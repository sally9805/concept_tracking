Pursuant to a request with which you have honored me , it has become my duty to speak of what must shortly silence me , and yours to hear of that , which , youthful as you are , rich in health and present enjoyment , and gladdened by the prospect of all that can reward and brighten the future , is destined , at no distant period , to take from you the power to listen . Is any one prompted to inquire , what is this fearful silencer of the tongue and deafener of the ear - this foe to happiness , that wrests from us our possessions and frustrates our hopes , to which I have alluded in language so portentous ?

True to life as remembrance assures me this brief outline is , 1 well know that , on an occasion like the present , your rightful expectations will not be fulfilled , nor the end at which I aim legitimately attained , by my employing exclusively , as the means of accomplishing them , abstract declarations and gratuitous assertions . In justification , therefore , of the general sentiments already expressed , and to show , in particular , that no unmerited prse has been awarded , it is requisite now that I treat analytically of the genius and character of the illustrious deceased . In attempting this , it would be superfluous , if not inadmissible , to dwell on his birthplace , parentage , or early education . These are circumstances entirely accidental , and belong to the biographer rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am considering , was one of those rare personages , * See Appendix , note A. /q/ who are called into existence at propitious and distant periods - rati nantes in gurgite vasto - at once to direct as master spirits , and act the part of mighty engines , in influencing the destinies of their contemporaries and posterity , on an extended , if not on a catholic scale . To encumber , therefore , with the details and particularities of time and place , a tribute to his memory , which is to consist in a recital of his own attributes , thoughts , and benefactions to his race , would be irrelevant and unsuitable . Nor would the expedient bestow on me the shadow of facility in the accomjplishment of my purpose . In descanting on the strength and majesty of the full-grown oak , it is needless to descend to the acorn or the scion from which it sprang , or to analyze the soil or describe the climate that bore and cherished it .

Nor can a representation of the deep and silent grandeur of the Mississippi be rendered more graphical , forcible , or sublime , by interweaving in it an account of the many thousand bubbling fountains and noisy rills that constitute its sources . No more , from the sprightliness , sports , and pastimes of the boy , the fair intellectual promise of the stripling , nor even from his empassioned pursuit and instinctive attainment of science and // tion of the United States , is it on his strength and lustre , in that capacity , that I purpose to draw , for evidence of the lofty and merited renown , which it was his destiny to attain . The elements of that intellectual greatness , high cultivation , and moral excellency , which rendered him an object so imposing and attractive , are to be found in his character as a scholar , a philosopher , an orator , a teacher , and a man . To a hasty portraiture of him , in these several capacities , permit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , justice and truth admonish me to observe , that in each of those components of his general character , Dr Holley was not alike accomplished and preeminent . As a general scholar , according to the technical interpretation of the expression , although his attainments were sufficiently ripe and varied , for all the purposes to which he was summoned by his duty to apply them , yet truth does not warrant me in denominating them either extensive or profound . In the literature of the Greeks and Romans , which , in a spirit of servile homage to antiquity , and in palpable violation of sound judgment and correct taste , has too long been recommended by the schools as the purest , if not the only pure exemplar of classical composition , his knowledge was respectable ; but it was not , perhaps , entitled to a stronger epithet. /q/ Although he read with facility the Greek and Latin authors , included in the catalogue of academical classics , in the highest seats of learning in the United States , he never studied them with critical accuracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened to all their beauties , sensitively alive to their native spirit , susceptible of the enthusiasm which some scholars experience in reading them , an able and severe judge of their excellences and defects , nor completely master of their peculiar philosophy , as idioms of speech . Conscious , perhaps , in youth , of the vigorous workings of genius within him , and misled by an excess of that sentiment of self-dependence , which , in early years , is apt to have too much influence in the direction of powerful and original intellects , he probably sacrificed to these feelings some of the advantages he might otherwise have derived from a more intimate acquaintance with the literature of the ancients . To scholarship in the ancient Oriental tongues he made no pretension , being simply able to read and translate the language of Moses , and nothing more . His knowledge of the French language was sufficient for all the purposes of science , although he could not , with either the pen or the tongue , express himself in it with facility or grace . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . But , by his profound and critical knowledge of his native tongue , he made amends , as ample as such knowledge can make , for all his deficiencies in relation to others . As relates to that , he was one of the most able and accomplished philologists of the age . The true spirit and philosophy of the English language , one of the richest and noblest that has ever been spoken by man , whose literature leaves that of Greece and Rome immeasurably behind it , and is destined to constitute the classical fountain of coming centuries , he had studied with an intensity and a degree of success , that have rarely been equalled by the most distinguished scholars that Europe has produced . So completely had he mastered them , and so familiar was his knowledge of them , that he handled them , even as topics of conversation , with the most entire perspicuity , facility , and grace . So perfectly simple and intelligible did they appear , as , under the magic of his powerful analysis , they escaped from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget that they constituted an intricate science , and received them as ordinary subjects , and suitable themes for ordinary minds - themes to the elucidation of which they were themselves abundantly competent . But , no sooner had they made the abortive effort . /z/ than they discovered how vain and presumptuous it was , to attempt to emulate the vigor of his intellect , and the acuteness of his dialectics . Thus the youthful shepherd , fired with ambition , and confident in his strength , on seeing Hercules hurling his club to an immense distance , after having playfully flourished it in air , attempted to repeat with it the same vibrations , and the same projection , but found it immovable . It will not , I flatter myself , be deemed unworthy of remark , that , as a means of imparting to our youth a more thorough acquaintance with their native tongue , the deceased was anxious for the introduction of the Saxon language , as an academical study , into our seats of instruction . Nor can this improvement in education be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a denizen and limited portion of our language , the Latin and Greek are made subjects of study , surely , as its genuine origin and ancestry , the Saxon ought not to be entirely neglected . It may not be unimportant or without interest , to observe , that , on this topic , the sentiments of the * Father of the University of Virginia ' were the same . Hence the resolution of that illustrious sage , who had been accumulating wisdom for four fifths of a century , and whose equal Greece , in the days of her glory , never produced , to incorporate in the discipline of that institution the study of our ancestral tongue . /z/ Constitutionally enamoured of high intellectual excitement , our departed President never declined , in his career of inquiry , to combat with obstacles ; but , in the true spirit of chivalry , rather sought them for their own sake , and selected them according to the difficulties they presented , and the resistance they were consequently calculated to offer . Thus , in the aspiring intrepidity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration of the knight , ' Or if a path be dangerous known ) That danger 's self is lure alone . ' /z/ But , although he felt no pride in a victory that was easily achieved , he always prepared himself thoroughly for the conflict . Influenced by these sentiments , in his capacity as a scholar , his chosen delight was in philosophical grammar . Of this selection the reason is obvious , and testifies to the resolute and elevated character of the deceased . The subject is , in itself , so subtle and refined , and presents to the student such a variety of pure abstractions , delightful analogies , and curious relations , recognised alone by the profound philosopher , that , for an intellect like his , it had a charm which none but such an intellect could feel , and no language less graphical and expressive than his own , could adequately describe . Correctly may it be added , that to none but such /q/ an intellect has the subject an affinity sufficiently powerful to bestow on it a charm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had perhaps no rival in his native country , and no superior , as is confidently believed , in any country on earth . If he did not stand alone in it , he certainly occupied , in the foremost rank , a station equal to the most conspicuous . In mere technical grammar , embracing the spelling and etymology of words , their collocation in sentences , their accent and quantity , and their general relations to each other , he had no marked superiority over many other scholars . These were matters too limited , light , and mechanical , to awaken his ambition and engross his attention . He was content , therefore , with that competency of knowledge in them , which prepared him suffi** sufficiently for the usual purposes of literature and instruction . In the undeviating correctness , however , of his pronunciation of his native tongue , which was so essential to the chastity and grace of his elocution , he was above competition . In this he was aided no less by his exquisite powers of enunciation , and his acute and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of the subject . But much more enthusiastic and engrossing were his feeUngs , in reference to language in /z/ its highest capacity - its various relations to the human intellect , as a mighty instrument of human power , and its affinity to the entire range of creation cognizable to man , as at once a source , a subject , and a medium of knowledge . In the science of language thus considered , he recognised an object worthy , in all respects , of the aspirations of his ambition , and the grasp of his faculties ; because it presented itself on a scale of grandeur commensurate with his own expanded intellect , and was accompanied by difficulties , and entangled by intricacies , with which he delighted to grapple , and which none but masterly and disciplined powers like his could resolve and subdue . For his profound and extensive attainments in this branch of science , as well as for those in criticism , belles lettres , and taste , he was indebted , in a high degree , to his commanding knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and the arts can never be successfully studied and understood . For they derive from their conformity to the faculties of the intellect , not merely their attributes , but their very existence . Abrogate their relations and affinities to those faculties , and they cease to exist . Or destroy or change the faculties themselves , and , as essentially dependent on them , criticism , belles lettres , and taste , will necessarily accompany them in their mutation or fall . Let those , then , who are ambitious of solid and /q/ enduring reputation in philosophical grammar , and polite literature generally , become masters of the principles of mental philosophy . From his insight into the character and genius of language , Dr HoUey saw in it one of the choicest productions of the human intellect , and one of the rarest subjects of a refined philosophy . He , therefore , with those enlightened and catholic views of it , which he cultivated in relation to all other subjects , rejected the hypothesis of its being an immediate gift from heaven to man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as much the result of human invention , as a printing press , a telescope , a steamboat , or any other instrument with which we operate , or means we employ to effectuate our purposes . In the character of his various intellectual powers , he saw in man an aptitude to invent it . And that doctrine is alone correct , which ascribes to man , as his own production , everything that nature has fitted him to produce . For Heaven to bestow on him that which he is able , by industry and exertion , to procure for himself , would be not only supererogatory , but would amount to an actual encouragement of indolence . As well may it be contended that Heaven confers song on the nightingale or the mockingbird , as speech on the human race . It simply qualifies the former to learn to sing , and the latter to speak , and that is all that can be required of its bounty , and all that it performs . /z/ For the actual attainment , both the man and the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Language , when legitimately and accurately employed , expresses fairly the condition of the intellect of him who employs it ; and its chief objects are , to produce , by representation and argument , a similar condition in the intellects of listeners , or to procure services , or exercise authority , by request or command . Even when used for purposes of deception , it still* bears the impress , or reflects the image , of the intellect that uses it , and is intended to affect the feelings and influence the conduct of those who bear it . It varies , of course , according to the intellectual condition of its employer , and the particular faculties of the listeners to which it is addressed . Is it addressed by the reasoning faculties of the speaker to the same faculties in the hearers ? It is simple , perspicuous , accurate , and mild ; and its object is the production of a change of opinion , or the confirmation of opinions already entertained . Is it addressed by a faculty of feeling or sentiment to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominant in the speaker , and does he wish to awaken in the listeners analogous feelings ? The language is harsh , vituperative , vehement , and severe , and the sentiments conveyed of the same character ; the tones are loud , and the manner violent , menacing , and wild . /z/ /q/ Is the address from We to love , or fromr the attachment of friendship to the same afiiection 2 or IS it the purpose of the speaker to awaken in his hearers either of those feelings ? The language is mild , soft , and melting ; the sentiments correspond ; and the manner is soothing , persuasive , and kind . Does the faculty of veneration address itself to veneration , hope to hope , firmness to firmness benevolence to benevolence , or fear to fear ? In either case , the language , sentiment , and manner correspond precisely with the faculty engaged and both speaker and listener soon become possessed of the same state of feeling . Considered , then , as the mirror of the intellect , the interpreter of creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which man immediately and irresistibly operates on his feUow , and the everlasting means by which all knowledge is re- corded and perpetuated ; considered I say , in these points of view , language , as a science , assumes a beauty and refinement , and swells to a magnificence and sublimity , which no other topic of study can surpass , and which imagination itself is unable to transcend . And it was in these several aspects and relations that the deceased contemplated it with such intense and glowing delight , and that his intellect proved competent to fathom its profundity , resolve its intricacies , and compass , in discussion , the immensity of its extent . /z/ To figure to yourselves , in the most forcible manner , the importance of language , imagine , for a moment , its entire extinction . By that single act will all antecedent and recorded knowledge be blotted from existence , and the fountain of future attainment dried up . In the magnitude of such a disaster , the conflagration of the Alexandrian library , which impoverished , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the world of letters will never cease to deplore , would be swallowed up and lost , as the immeasurable ocean swallows the dew drop . As already intimated , the entire field of polite literature , criticism , and taste had been eagerly and faithfully traversed by Dr HoUey , who culled , with curious and disciplined hand , both its rarest flowers and its choicest fruits , and thus at once embellished and enriched his intellect with such of its productions as were most beauteous and valuable , and most congenial to his own feelings . Of this course of training the issue was , that , as a critic in letters , he had few equals in any country , and , in the United States , no superior . In that department of scholarship his judgment was equally sound and severe , and his taste cultivated , matured , and refined . In the style of prose composition , he not only preferred simplicity and plainness to ornate richness , pomp , or figure , but carried that preference to an extent , that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of his own compositions , his favorite qualities were , of course , predominant . He pressed , in expression , as he did in action , directly to his object , without ornament or periphrasis in the one , or any circuition or complexity in the other . Both practically and as a matter of taste , he gave to substance the ascendant over show ; and to vigor of thought , over mere force and elegancy of expression . If this overwrought simplicity impoverished his writings , and detracted from their brilliancy , the cause was to be found in an effort , which he had carried too far , to curb the native prodigality of his intellect . For here , as in other cases , his fault was the result of exuberant endowment . So true is it , that genius may be overwhelmed in its own luxuriance , and dazzled by the abundance of its own splendor . In the style of poetry , sublimity , intensity , and force , were the attributes which to the deceased were most peculiarly attractive . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he delighted . Although perfectly alive to the graphical elegances , and all the exalted excellences of Shakspeare , Homer , Pindar , Milton , and Byron were perhaps his favorite authors ; and of the writings of these he was an accomplished master . Even when under the deepest fascination of their beauties , he was not blinded , by their dazzling effulgence , to the smallest of their faults . If he enjoyed them with the taste and refinement of an 20 DiscoumsE* amateuri he did not &il; to judge of them with the severity , and to experience , within himself , the powerful workings of the same spirit , which , freshly breathed forth by the Pythian god , and redolent of the quickening essence of divinity , had actuated their immortal authors in composing them . Thus did he , in his own person , illustrate and justify , with perfect accuracy , the poet 's re* presentation of a genuine critic ; - ' A proper judge will read each work of wit , With the same spirit that its author writ* As a philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although , as a whole , it was active , lofty , and expanded , perspicacious and Bingulariy vigorous , it was unequaUy so on different sulects . While , in relation to some topics in science it manifested no very decided choice , or extraordinary capacity , it inclined and clung to others with the powerful predilection and adhesion of instinct , ikandled them with preeminent dexterity and strength , and mastered them with surpassing rapidity and ease . The swiftness , in particular , with which , in a favorite pursuit , it swept over books , and the facility and accuracy with which it seized on their contents and made them its own , transferring , apparently , by a single act , the matter of entire pages to itself , as it had been previously transferred from the type to the paper , constitoted one of its most striking and felicitous characteristics . The unwonted celerity with which Dr HoUey executed this process , gave currency to a belief , that his acquaintance with books was much less extensive and thorough , than was actually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters , while others were halting through paragraphs and pages , it was imagined and reported that he scarcely read at all . Thus , in the acquisition of recorded knowledge , did the movement of his intellect seem almost independent of time , as the headlong rush of the eagle through the heavens sets space at defiance . And thus , by great achievement , in a short period , was he enabled to be alike familiar with books and society ; and to enjoy , in a degree that has been seldom equalled , and never , perhaps , surpassed , the rare privilege of being , in measures nearly similar , instructed and delighted by alternate converse with the living and the dead , the book of nature and the volumes of art . Nor did he acquire knowledge from the former source with less facility than he did from the lat ler . Whatever he saw or heard in the wilds of nature , in cultivated places , in assembled crowds , or in the social circle , he rendered tributary to his improvement in knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but powerful intellect and ripened discipline could impart , and an eagerness and promptitude that bespoke the divinity and the aptness of instinct . A mere hint on any topic , whether it was suggested by a book , or in conversation , was sufficient for his purpose . If the subject pleased him , he seized on it as if through a native affinity , and soon pushed his analysis of it far beyond that of the author or speaker , expounding it with a perspicuity , throwing around it a lustre , and enforcing his views of it with an aardor united to a gracefulness of eloquence , which often excited in his hearers no less of wonder and admiration , than it communicated to them of instruction and delight . If he was averse from encountering severe and long continued intellectual labor on a given topic , the reason was to be found in the extreme facility with which he acquired , at a single effort , all the knowledge that was requisite for his purposes . He did not weary his patience and ex* haust his powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been true of many other favored sons of genius , his love of achievement by great temporary exertions , rather than by arduous and persevering toil , arose from the superior amount which his capacity enabled him thus to achieve . Had the most patient and enduring labors been necessary to enrich his intellect and DiscomtSE. 23 secure to him renown , his determination to excel would have impelled him to encounter them . If he did not extend the boundaries of human knowledge , it was not for the want of abundant endowment . It is too often the disposition as well as the practice of master spirits , to pass their time in leisure and enjoyment , while others are performing for them toil and service . And his pleasure consisted much more in attaining , from books or conversation , in a few days or hours , possession of that intellectual wealth , after which his inferiors in talent had labored for vears , than in submitting to the toil of discovery himself . In effecting the conquest of knowledge , he greatly preferred the eclat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sap or siege . This predilection deserves to be recorded as an unfortunate instance of misguided ambition ; an ambition of general attainment derived from others , rather than a devotion to profound , selfdependent research , and original discovery ; an ambition to dazzle and impress from the pulpit or the rostrum , or in social converse , a limited number of contemporaries , rather than to instruct and delight the world and posterity , by an abundant stream of intellect from the press . Like many other individuals resplendent in genius , the deceased permitted himself to be too much engrossed in present scenes and fleeting enjoyments , regardless of their influence on his future destinieB. 24 mscouRsaB . Hence , though his contemporaries were regaled with the surpassing beauty and fragrance of its flowerSy posterity are deprived of the substantial repast they had a right to expect , from the fruits of his genius . With such resources and elegances as he possessed , it was the duty of the deceased to bare aspired to originality ; a duty to himself , his family , his friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those that are to come . Endowments less munificently bestowed , would have rendered him original , would have converted him into a writer . He would then have felt more deeply the need of exertion . Gifted as he was , had he eagerly and perseveringly toiled for the attainment of literary and scientific eminence , the age in which he lived , opulent as it is in the productions of intellect , and ornamented with the choicest monuments of taste , would have scarcely exhib* ited , in its galaxy of genius , a more resplendent luminary . But original discovery demands no less of labor than capacity . It springs forth spontaneously at the of no one . Without the requisite oflferings on the altar of research , it could not be achieved , even by the preeminent endowments of the deceased . But the charge preferred against him by his enemies , that he was a superficial thinker and defective in talents , that he wajs incapable of /q/ writiBg , because he did not write , and incompetent to discovery , because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only unfounded , but recoils on themselves , exposing in them , at the same time , an equal amount of ignorance and malice . In preferring it , they stand avowedly self-condemned , and are virtually accessory to their own degradation . For as often as the strongest and most resolute of them came into collision with him , in discussion or debate , they uniformly felt the supremacy of his intellect , and , on a few occasions of deep excitement , quailed beneath the chastisement which they compelled him to bestow on them , and which their injustice and outrage so amply deserved . Were it necessary or admissible , names and places could be easily recited in confirmation of this . If he was superficial , then , what were his opponents ? Was he but a shade ? They were but its shadow . Was he but littleness ? They were nihility . Such was the aspiring and etherial character of Dr HoUey 's intellect , that his chosen subjects in philosophy bordered on the transcendental . Most of them had an immediate respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as an individual , and others in his social and political bearings . They were matter and spirit , with their properties , powers , and mutual relations , as well in a separate , as an associate capacity , the doctrine of /z/ causation in the abstract , the science of language , as already mentioned , mental philosophy in its several subdivisions , especially its physiological and ethical branches , political economy , constitutional law , and the law of nature and nations . His delight in these departments of science , in some of which he attained such peculiar preeminence , would seem to have arisen from a twofold cause . They were in harmony with the master faculties of his intellect , and they presented to him problems of inviting difficulty , which severely , yet to him delightfully tasked his powers , and in the solution of which he held a proud ascendency over most other philosophers whom it was his fortune to encounter . For , in analyzing his character , it must not be concealed , that an ardent and highminded love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor will the intelligent and liberal , who look into the springs of human action , and attach to motives their proper value , consider this a fault . On the contrary , it was an excellency of abundant worth . For without the incentive of such an ingredient , no one would encounter the toils and difficulties , and brook the disappointments and concomitant anxieties , that thicken in the path , and embitter the existence of the candidate for renown . In justice to Dr HoUey , it is requisite to observe , that , to gratify his love of distinction , he never descended from his elevated sphere , nor availed /q/ himself of means that were not manly and honorable . The imputation of an attempt to acquire popularity by sycophancy or adulation , or any kind of meanness or trickery , would have roused his indignation , or stung his sensibility with the severity of a wound . If he loved distinction , it was that which is conferred by those who are themselves distinguished ; not by the fickle and undiscerning populace . Laudari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed to his escutcheon , as a suitable motto . To his favorite branches of science , which were , in their nature , so refined and subtle , and elevated so far above the reach of ordinary intellects , it has been alleged that Dr Holley was too ardently and exclusively attached , to the neglect of others of a humbler and less etherial , but much more practical and useful description . That this charge might have had some foundation in truth , will not be denied . Few things are more common than for a powerful intellect , fired by an ardent and enthusiastic temperament , to urge to excess a favorite pursuit . But the groundplot of the accusation was infinitely limited , compared to the superstructure attempted to be erected on it . With all his refinement and approximation to transcendentalism , Dr Holley was a practical philosopher . He presented in his character the rare phenomenon of an elevated metaphysical genius , united to that well adjusted balance of /z/ the inferior faculties , which constitutes the all important attribute of judgment . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of business . ' If , in the management of his own affairs , he did not always permit himself to be governed by what are denominated principles of prudence and common sense , it was not for want of an abundant knowledge of them . No man could descant on them more eloquently , expound them more clearly , or more conclusively demonstrate their practical utility . He well kniew that the great body of society can no more depend , in its vital economy , on a refined and abstract philosophy , than the body of the individual can be nourished by perfumes and essences ; but , that , as the latter must subsist on substantial food , the former must be sustained by substantial science . Although , therefore , he was not himself enaxnoured of the study of arithmetic , mathematics , mechanics and chemistry , in their multiplied applications to the great transactions and essential interests of civil society , he had so competent a knowledge of diem as to be alive to their importance , and to encourage and superintend their cultiration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a devotion to the higher , and what some have denominated the ornamental branches of philosophy , he patronized and promoted the humbler and more useful , from a sense of duty . /z/ In thus bestowing on what are called the exact sciences the phrase ' more useful ' I speak in conformity to public opinion , rather than my own . In my estimation , as well as in that of the deceased whose character I am commemorating , intellectual philosophy , the science of language , political economy , and the law of nature and nations , are at once the most eleyatd , and among the most important branches of human knowledge . He , therefore , who devotes himself to the cultivation of them , is not to be regarded as waiting his time , and exhausting his powers , in subtle abstractions , hypothetical calculations , and superhuman refinements . He is not to be deemed a visionary in science . He is acquiring that kind of knowledge which best prepares him to make of other kinds the most extensive application , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accomplishment of great and momentous purposes . He is like the chief of an army , who must be thoroughly versed in the science of war , that he may be able to wield , with the more terrible effect , the technical attainments of his soldiers and officers . For he alone who understands mental philosophy , in its principles and details , is pre pared to act with supreme efficiency on man as an intellectual object , and to use him with consummate effect , as an intellectual engine . The complete success of others , when thus operating on and with man , is necessarily accidental - as so DISCOURSE . entirely so as is the success of a gunner , in his first experiment in the employment of fire arms . But to a triumphant result of an operation or process , a minute knowledge of details in the chief director is not essential . Napoleon was not dextrous in the use of the musket ; yet millions of muskets replied to his command . He was not himself an adept with the bayonet ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor , that he may direct the application of them to their most important purposes , is it requisite that the distinguished mental philosopher should be minutely versed in all the inferior branches of science . To have a general knowledge of their principles , objects , and ends , and to understand man as an intellectual subject and instrument , so as duly to govern him , as well when he is acted on by them , as when he is himself the agent employed to act with them , is all that is requisite . With these requirements , and suitable opportunities to exercise and apply them , the mental philosopher , if enterprising , ambitious , and energetic , is all but omnipotent in human affairs . He is , at once , a true example and illustration of the maxim , that * knowledge is power . ' Notwithstanding the dehghtfulness and sublimity of mental philosophy , the vast scope of its practical usefulness in the most important of sublunary concerns , and the exalted estimation in which it /q/ is held by highly gifted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very generally underrated in the United States . It is here considered rather as a scheme of subtle abstraction and visionary speculation , baseless in itself , or built only on hypothesis , than as a branch of sound and legitimate science founded in nature . It is declared of it by many , that it not only contains no well defined and stable principles to recommend it to the philosopher and the votary of truth , but that so remote is it in its nature from everything practical , that were it even true , it could not be useful . Although it is not my intention , nor would it comport with the occasion , or the discourse I am delivering , to attempt a labored and circumstantial defence of mental philosophy - nor does the science stand in need of a ministry so superfluous - yet , as it constituted the favorite pursuit of the deceased , and as he even sustained obloquy on account of his devotion to it , a few words in vindication of it will not be misplaced . But first let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thus magisterially arraigned and condemned ? By whom has it been pronounced an entanglement of subtleties , a mere web of vision , unsanctioned by truth , unsupported by nature , and useless if true ? I answer . By those alone who never studied it , never understood it , and who are necessarily , therefore , utter strangers . /z/ as well to its usefulness , bb to its beauties and surpassing delights as a scieivce . Ignorance and prejudice are its only accusers . Neither knowledge nor liberality has ever assailed By no one acquainted with it has it ever been made a theme of discommendation* On the contrary , by all who have bad the industry , taste and talent to render themselves masters of it it has been uniformly pronounced a branch of science pre* eminent in the pleasures and benefits it confers . While presuming novices , therefore , audaciously denounce it , and feebly endeavour to attach to it a disgrace which does not fail to recoil on themselves , the intelligent are proud to bestow on it applause . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its value which nothing could resist , would be found in a perspicuous and fair exposition of its principles and objects , and its genuine relations to other branches of knowledge . Its subject is intellectual man , in his real nature , and in all the relations he sustains , whether in his mortal or immortal capacity , to the Great Uncreated ? and to created things . And when it is recollected how exquisitely curious and interesting that nature is , and how numerous and diversified , how elevated and surpassingly momentous are those relations , the sublimity and vastness , the beauty and utiUties of the science that compasses /q/ them , may be easily made to present themselves as delightful and swelling conceptions , but can with difficulty be expressed . Considered in this point of light , mental philosophy might be represented as a kind of epitome of all other sciences , in as much as it is an analysys and exposition of man , in his capacities and aptitudes to achieve the mastery of science in general . It primarily contemplates and expounds him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his nature ; and , therefore , as a candidate for all the high and ineffable enjoyments arising from a progression in purity , refinement , capacity , and knowledge , which an all bounteous Heaven , through an endless futurity , presents to his acceptance . Man , then , I say , in his most exalted and precious capacity , his relation to his God , both as a subject of religious feeling and hope , and as possessing faculties adapted to the attainment of the science of heavenly things , and the connexion they sustain with things that are terrestrial , is a recognised object of mental philosophy . So is he in his lofty capacity as an astronomer , approaching , by his glasses , the very boundaries of space , and , by his mathematical powers , calculating the masses , distances , relative bearings , influences , and laws of the great components of material creation , as an organized universe . /z/ So is he , as a poet , annihilating , at once , both time and distance , by traversing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culling from creation her choicest objects , properties , and affections , and superadding to them , in imagination , augmented excellences , to body forth a more exquisite creation of his own . So is he , as an orator , pouring out , in a flood of triumphant eloquence , the strength and opulency of his mighty intellect ; and , with a power bordering on earthly omnipotence , moulding to his purposes the intellects of others . So is he , as a philosopher , exploring the dark and intricate profounds of nature , and penetrating the hidden recesses of her temple , to attain a knowledge of her inmost workings , and unveil her secrets for the benefit of his race . So is he , as a scholar , with an intellect formed for recondite research , disciplined , refined , and polished by cultivation , competent to the functions of criticism and taste , and opulent in its treasures of the recorded knowledge of all times and all countries , where literature has had a being . So is he , as a mechanician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads , canals , aqueducts , fortifications , splendid edifices columns and superb monuments of art , and other works of usefulness or ornament , public or private , as objects of necessity , convenience , or taste , in commerce or manufactures , individual accommodation , national intercourse , or public defence . /q/ So is he , as a patriot and a statesman , a diplomatist and a leader of armies , earnestly devoting his talents and wisdom to the enactment and execution of laws , or fearlessly contending , in the cabinet or the field , for the rights , the honor , or the safety of his country . So is he , as a painter , a sculptor , or a musician , or , in fact , as devoted to the cultivation and application of any other intellectual faculty or combination of faculties , with which nature may have endowed him . Such , I say - and the particulars of the illustration might be greatly multiplied - are the extent , the richness , and the magnificency of the field , which itUs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other can be designated transcending or equalling it in variety and beauty , grandeur and usefulness , I know not in what department of nature it lies . Man , as I have here attempted to depict him , situated in the centre of creation , with powers not only . extending to its very confines , and filling and exploring every intermediate part of it , but reaching to the footstool of Deity himself , with ardent and never dying hopes and affections embracing , and vivid emotions corresponding to , the whole , - man , I say , thus situated and thus endowed , is , in himself , an epitome of immensity , and , in his intellectual ubiquity , stands forth an object of subhmity and grandeur , which nothing /z/ in created existence can transcend , and which , as a subject of study , is worthy of the devotion of the loftiest faculties of the human intellect . But , I repeat , that the results of the true knowledge and exposition of that subject constitute the doctrines of mental philosophy - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance or prejudice undervalues and condemns ; which has been zealously cultivated by individuals , whose talents and attainments threw a lustre over their country , and conferred glory on their race ; which was the favorite pursuit of him whom we commemorate ; and , for his thorough acquaintance with which , he stood distinguished among the most distin guished philosophers of the age . Another invaluable excellency of mental philosophy , is , that the study of it confers , beyond any other exercise , strength and acuteness on the intellect of the student . It gives to it a power of analysis and combination , which , applied to the investigation of other subjects , finds in them but little more than pastime and amusement . Thus in their preparatory exercises , the Roman soldiers practised with heavy armour , that , by the strength thus acquired , they might use their swords with the more fatal efiect , when in conflict with an enemy . That Dr HoUey and myself did not precisely agree in our views of mental philosophy , is perfectly true . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that subject was much less material /q/ than it was generally believed to be . And the points on which we concurred in belief were not only by far more numerous , but infinitely more important , than those on which we differed . Nor did our discrepancy of opinion ever produce between us , as was by many both imagined and asserted , either alienation of feeling , or diminution of regard . Ours was a difference purely intellectual , which had no shadow of influence in awakening resentment , or engendering dislike . Even in the most heated moments of mental conflict , we never meditated the savage-like exchange of the calumet for the war club . We should have felt ourselves degraded in. permitting a mere discrepancy of abstract opinion to subvert or disturb the harmony of our intercourse . As soon would we have suffered such disturbance to arise from the dissimilarities of our countenances , figures , or professional pursuits . Indeed , by unfolding the variety that necessarily exists in the intellectual constitutions of different individuals , mental philosophy conclusively shows , that to differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clearly so , as it is for them to differ in complexion , or the native color of their hair and eyes . It is one of its excellences , therefore , that , by thus liberalizing the intellect , in communicating to it a knowledge of itself , it cultivates the virtues of charity and forbearance , and takes from man the fell propensity to hate his brother , simply /z/ on account of a disagreement in creed . Conformably to a sentiment just expressed , it announces to him mildly , but firmly and definitively , that as well might he hate him , because of a dissimilarity in complexion or stature . If the deceased did not , from his own resources , improve the scheme of mental philosophy taught in the schools of the United States and of Europe , he became , with equal promptitude and zeal , the ablest advocate , and the most eloquent and instructive expounder of that which had received the highest improvement from the labors of others . And if early prejudices , or other causes , deterred him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the truth of which it is known that I am a believer , he adopted that which can not be denied to be next to it in excellency . Instructed originally in the metaphysics of Stewart , Reid , and Locke , he afterwards attached himself , with the predilection and suddenness of instinct , to the greatly improved philosophy of Brown , and became as zealous and faithful a votary , and as accomplished a master of it , as if he had been its author . Indeed , a gentleman of distinguished intelligence , who had first attended the lectures of the Scottish , and afterwards of the great American teacher , gave , without hesitation , the preference to the latter , as by far the most perspicuous expounder and impressive inculcator of the principles of the science . /q/ To render this evidence the more valuable , the gentleman referred to , was a native of Scotland , deeply enamoured of the glory of his country , and proud of the genius , attainments , and powers of her distinguished sons . But truth prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palm to the American . In this case , as in that of Socrates and Plato , the illustrious pupil , in the perspicuity and force , no less than in the richness and elegances of his teaching , surpassed his preceptor . Under the present head of my subject I shall only add , that in the science of theology , both natural and revealed , the attainments of the deceased were extensive and liberal . Were I to call them profound , the term would be strictly conformable to fact . And whatever others may have thought of the orthodoxy of his creed , he , at least , after the most deliberate examination of it , believed it to be true . For , in his religious , as in every other form of sentiment and manifestation , he was not only a stranger to all affectation , hypocrisy , and pretence , but an indignant despiser of the impostors who practise them . Admitting , therefore , that his tenets were unfounded , a position which it is not my purpose to discuss , so sin-* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conviction of their soundness , that emphatically may it be said of him , in reference to that topic , /z/ that even his failings leaned to virtue 's side . ' Nor was his competency to judge of truth inferior to the earnestness with which he embraced it , or the zeal with which he diffused its benefactions around him . But too liberal to be influenced by sectarian intolerance , and holding in scorn the presumption and obtrusive importunity of the propagandist , he never attempted to force on the community , nor even on individuals , his theological opinions . Free himself to select his path to the footstool of Mercy , he was not the tyrant to throw others into chains , and attempt to drag them thither , by usurped authority , dooming them to the penalty of endless torment , in case of non-conformity to some nostrum of belief . True piety he held to be an affection of the heart , that can neither be called forth , nor extinguished , by mere doctrinal influence . Perfectly independent in his religious sentiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a temple of adoration , every work of beneficence , and every instance of duty faithfully performed , an act of worship acceptable to Heaven , and the only authority to which he bowed in homage , was the recognised will of the Living God . And a knowledge of that will he derived alike from written revelation , and that still elder revelation , ' the works of nature . Let those whom it pleases to denominate heretical , and denounce , in maledictions , a reUgion /z/ like this , and who deem such denunciation an offering of piety and a token of grace , take to themselves , and press to their bosoms , as the delight of their souls , the present gratification and the future reward of the darling act ! For me they shall rest undisturbed in their enjoyment . Never shall their feelings , their works , or their reward , awaken my envy , or excite in me a wish to participate in their felicity . Give to me a religion of charity and benevolence , liberality and toleration , which forbids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , which inculcates , as a duty , the study of natural , no less than of written revelation , and breathes forth among its votaries a balmy spirit of peace , harmony , mutual beneficence , and fraternal affection . Give me , I say , a religion like this , and , call it by what denomination you please , I will joyously receive it as a boon from Heaven , give to it my confidence , and repose in it my hopes . But be it the reverse of this , neither its name , its doctrines , the authority promulgating it , nor all the other attributes appertaining to it , shall hallow it in my estimation , or recommend it to my choice . Permit me to repeat , that whether orthodox or heretical , * in its abstract tenets , thus liberal in spirit , pacific in principle , and beneficent in fact , was the religion of the deceased . And in unison with it was the tenor of his life . Sympathizing /z/ and rejoicing in the happiness around him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was his delight and his practice to go ' about doing good . ' As an orator it may be asserted of Dr HoUey , as truly as it was of the great Chatham , in reference to his Roman virtues and peerless endowments , that , in some respects , at least , he stood alone . ' In that capacity , neither truth nor justice forbids me to add , that @#@ modern degeneracy had not reached him . ' Of the orators of antiquity , whose fame is the theme of classical story , and who still furnish models for the world 's imitation , the mantle of inspiration would seem to have descended to him , and gifted him like themselves . In the eloquence of the pulpit he was the paragon of his country , if not of the age , and might calmly look down on all the efforts of cotemporary rivalry . Nor , in that line of oratory , has his superior , perhaps , ever shed a lustre on any age . Bossuet , of France , was not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more enchantingly attractive . To award to him a triumphant ascendency over Chalmers and Irving , the living Masillon and Bossuet of Britain , is but to do what has been repeatedly done , by sundry judges , whose decision is entitled to undisputed confidence . To say the least of them , the matter , arrangement , and language of his discourses were equal to those of the discourses /q/ of the British orators ; and his delivery of them incontestibly and greatly superior . In gene-* ral opulency of diction , and splendor of elocution , more especially in the majesty of lofty and solemn declamation , he left the two foreign divines im  - -  measurably behind him . Nor , of his powers of analysis , when topics of depth and intricacy presented themselves , am I inclined to speak in less elevated terms . Here , as on all other points , he descanted as he thought , with accuracy , vigor , and resplendent perspicuity . Even matters of mystery almost ceased to be terious , as they fell from his lips irradiated by his genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when exposed to the searching influetice of the sun , drink in his beams , and become a radiator of borrowed light . As Dr Holley rarely appeared professedly in the capacity of an orator , except in the pulpit , and on public academical occasions requiring eloquence of nearly the same description , to speak of him , as such , in any other situation , where a difference in preparation , mode of address , and mental endowment would be essential , might seem gratuitous , and perhaps inopportune . Yet , if it be permitted us to judge from the tone and general character of his intellect , its distinguished promptitude in apprehending a subject presented to it , its quickness in perceiving its various relations , its readi- /z/ ness in detecting its weak and vulnerable points , its dexterity in assailing them with the fulness of its means and its collected powers , and in unravelling and exposing whatever was sophistical or otherwise unsound in them , its self-possession and perfect intrepidity - judging , I say , from these attributes , united to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ready and abundant command of the most select and varied expression , his lofty ambition prompting him to the attainment of preeminency in all things , and a few very splendid manifestations which he is known to have made in popular addresses to public bodies , and in the conflict of debate , there is not wanting ground of confident belief , that , in a deliberative assembly , if he had not taken a decided ascendency , he would have ranked with the most distinguished orators of the day - with the Mackintoshes , Broughams , and Cannings of England , the Mirabeaus , Foys , and Manuels of France , and the Pinckneys , Websters , and Clays , of the United States . The testimony to this effect is the more conclusive , as a characteristic excellency of the deceased , was , his wonderful power of popular extemporaneous address after brief preparation . As if she had cast him intentionally in her happiest mould , and endowed him in a moment of her most abundant prodigality . Nature had showered on this her favorite , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes , which /q/ are so powerful in their influence , as the exteriors of oratory . In person and general aspect , as heretofore mentioned , he was not only elegant and imposing , but splendidly beautiful . But , without any of that deUcacy , which , though peculiarly characteristic of youth , adheres to some throughout their lives , or the slightest admixture of feebleness or effeminacy , his beauty was as masculine as it was rare and attractive . With a stature of the most approved dimensions , a figure so symmetrical as to be almost faultless , features bold , expressive , and comely , giving strength to a countenance beaming with the brightest intelligence , and animated with the workings of the loftiest sentiments and the most ardent feelings , he truly and emphatically gave to the world , assurance of a man - take him for all in all , we shall not look upon his like again . ' Thus configured , gifted , and accomplished , when he ascended , in his flowing toga , the pulpit or the rostrum , assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes around him on an admiring audience , the presentation itself was a burst of eloquence - an exquisite exordium to a splendid discourse . Under the illusion of the moment , the Genius of Oratory , indebted for his existence to poetic fiction , might have been almost fancied to have started into actual being , and stood forth to view , clothed in the form and aspect most suitable to his character . An ordinary ad- /z/ dress from a source of such promise would have been deep disappointment . One of consummate elegance , opulency , and force , could alone redeem the pledge that was proffered . When to these attributes were added , a mellow , rich , and silver-toned voice , thrilling at times with the very essence of melody , and of unusual com* pass , flexibihty , and power ; an enunciation uncom- " monly clear , distinct , and varied ; a manner in the highest degree tasteful and animated , and action the most graceful , expressive , and appropriate , the combination to give to elocution all its fasci* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in* delible effects , was as complete as nature in her bounty could bestow . To render it irresistible , nothing was wanting but the outpourings of a mighty and cultivated intellect - and the whole were united in the person of the deceased . Were I called on for substantial testimony of the peerless eloquence of this great orator , I would fearlessly refer to the vivid recollections of many whom I have now the honor to address , to the recollection of numbers who were formerly members of the legislature of our Commonwealth , to the oft-repeated declaration of members of Congress , and some of the heads of departments in Washington , and to the recorded effects of several dis- * From a very excellent Discourse occasioned by the Death of Horace HoUey , LL. late President of Transylvania Unfvendty , by the Rev. ' John Pierpont , of Boston , we extract the following parv graph , in testimony of the correctness of what is here stated . After a /q/ courses deliTered by the deceased , in Boston , at Plymouth , and in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholastic dogmas , or any system c arbitrary canons , but hj its power over the Hsteners , that the genuine excellency of eloquence can be determined . And , adopting , as our rule of judgment , this most natural and unerring test , we can have but little hesitation in believing , that some of the addresses of our departed Presi- few general remarks on the surpassing power of Dr Holley 's eloquence , the speaker observes ; - ' To such as may consider ' this as too high praise I would remark , that that is the most efficient oratory , which , in the greatest degree , produces the effects of oratory . I would refer to Mr Holley 's oration at Plymouth , on the anniversary of the landing of the Fathers of New England there ; to his oration before the Washington Benevolent Society ; to his sermon before the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company ; and to his discourse on the anniversary of the Boston Female Asylum . * * * * You heard him before the Artillery Company . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say that I approve of the noisy demonstration of excited and gratified feeling , the outright applause , which , then , for the first and last time in New England , broke out in the house of God , and echoed from its walls . * * * ' I know not what it may prove to others to be told , or to see , that in our cold regions , where a fervid eloquence is frowned upon , under the very shadow of an iceberg that chills the young orator 's veins as he looks up to it as the hill from whence cometh his help , " and that gives forth its light as coldly though as clearly as the moon gives down hers ; I know not what it may prove to others to be told that , under such circumstances , a man had so seized upon and spell-bound a thronged church as to make the whole multitude so far forget the occasion , the place , the coldness of the rhetorical atmosphere , so far to forget the decorums of the age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion , as to break in upon his discourse by outright applause ; but /z/ dent have been unsurpassed , perhaps , unequalled in modern times . As a teacher and governor of youth , * one of the most responsible and important stations that society can confer , or man occupy , Dr HoUey was no less preeminent , than in the other capacities in which he has been represented . For in this , as in every pursuit and exercise to which he devoted himself , his high-reaching ambition impelled him to excel . ' Aut CtEsarj aut nihil was imprinted on his spirit by the finger of the Most High . to me , it proves that that man had risen above all others of his country and his age , as an accomplished and efficient orator . ' From the records of the Boston Female Asylum , it appears , that the discourse by Dr Holley referred to in this note , procured for the institution the most munificent contribution it has ever received on any anniversary celebration since its first establishment . The following vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings with which the discourse was received , and the exalted estimation in which it was held , by those at whose request it was prepared and delivered ; - * September 27 , 1816 . ' Voted , That the grateful thanks of this institution be offered to the Rev. Mr Holley , for the very eloquent discourse this afternoon delivered in behalf of the institution , and a request that he will still increase the obligation by granting them a copy for the press . This request I am directed to urge with more than common solicitude . I can do it only by an appeal to the same motives which produced your animated and successful exertions to strengthen the weak hands . Will you not then , sir , give to those , who did not hear your sentiments , an opportunity of reflecting on them , before they bestow on remote and doubtful objects the support which is needed by our home charities ? Will you not give to the institution you have favored , the advantage which might result from this influence on public opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your approbation ? ' * See Appendix , note E. /q/ Nor , as already contended , is there , in this declaration , aught that is derogatory to excellency of character . On the contrary , its truth is evidence in confirmation of that excellency . . For there is no sentiment or virtue more perfectly worthy of a divine origin , than an ardent and well directed love of distinction - an ambition to be foremost in the splendid career of laudable achievement and honorable fame . * Living or dead , let me but be renowned , ' is an exclamation worthy of the high-gifted poet who penned it , and of the aspiring young Douglas , to whose soul it was congenial . In a powerful effort for the attainment of distinction , the love of approbation throws into energetic and praiseworthy action all the more exalted faculties of the- intellect . Hence , when properly directed aifd judiciously regulated , it gives elevation and excellency to the human character , and is a source , of the most important benefits to man . As relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone in the capacity of an executive ofiicer , that the marked preeminence of the deceased consisted . On that subject , his competency to legislate , was in no respect inferior to his aptitude for execution . In the totality of his qualifications , as a preceptor and governor , he was as truly and completely as individual man can be , ' ipse agmeUj a host within himself , qualified alike to originate , mature , and carry into effect . And /z/ for this preeminency he stood indebted , in no ordinary degree , to his thorough acquaintance with the philosophy of the intellect . In his general views of the science of education - for he was scientific in all things - Dr HoUey was a liberal and practical philosopher . Catholic , independent , and rational , in all his digested and settled opinions , he was as far from being a visionary projector of reform and improvement , as he was from being trammelled by arbitrary canons , antiquated customs , or worm-eaten authorities . While he held , that , by the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practical knowledge , morals , and manners , he contended that that scheme of education could be alone judicious and excellent , which was so far accommodated to the prevaiUng genius and character of the age , as best to qualify the subjects of it to acquit themselves with efficiency in the departments allotted to them ; and that it should , hence , be modelled and conducted much more with a regard to the present , and a prospect of the future , than from a retrospect and remembrance of antecedent times . Education , therefore , he believed , ought to vary with the advancement and changing con* dition of society . Hence , it should be very different now , from what it was in former ages ; and somewhat different in the western , from what it is in the eastern hemisphere ; but uniform throughout the United States . /z/ For the better and more certain accomplishment of this latter purpose , he was an advocate for the erection of a national university , and the arrangement of schools on a federal plan , analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate , indeed , for the federalizing of everything susceptible of such modification , with a view to the production and confirmation of federal feelings , practices , and habits , to strengthen throughout the country the federal and national bond , and aid in perpetuating the union of the States . For he believed , that , as concerns the permanency of that union , the stability and endurance of a moral tie , the result of education , social intercourse , early friendships formed at school by leading characters , and a constant interchange of kind ofiices , the whole cemented and strengthened by a liberalizing and harmonizing spirit of letters derived from a central and common source , are much more to be relied on than those of a connexion exclusively political . As a further reason for advocating the establishment of a national university , he believed , that , in the nature of things , great literary institutions are best calculated for the production of great men - at least of accomplished scholars , and pupils distinguished for attainment in science . For , morally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of creation , that everything begets in its own likeness - a puny parentage , puny offspring , /z/ and the reverse . A national university , therefore , being necessarily a grand and magnificent estab lishment , on the same scale must be the educated men it would regularly send forth , to participate in the management of national affairs , and shed a lustre on their native country . But his views of the salutary bearing and important influence of a great national institution did not terminate here Considering it as operating on a much more extended scale , and covering a field of wider compass , he felt and duly appreciated the effects it would produce on our literary and scientific reputation , as a people , in foreign countries . He believed that it would tend much more certainly and effectually than any other measure , to secure to us , in that species of reputation , the same ascendency which we are hastening to acquire in arts and arms , and which we have already acquired in practical legislation and diplomatic policy . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be erected at the seat of the national government , so did he believe that the interests of science and letters would be greatly promoted , by the erection , at a suitable time , of a college or university in each of the States . But , that more than one in each State would be injurious to education , was his settled conviction , the result of observation and deliberate reflection . /q/ Nor can the ground of this conviction be concealed from any one , who will examine the subject with the requisite attention . To be , in character and efficiencies , worthy of a State , a university should be erected , and supported , by all the opulency and means of the State , available for such a purpose . Divide those means , and they become , of necessity , insufficient for the accomplishment of anything great . Limited and feeble in themselves , they can produce nothing that is not correspondingly feeble . This , I repeat , is a neverchanging law of nature ; and any deviation from it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to descend from a pigmy , or the magnanimous mastiff from the puling whiffet , as anything truly distinguished from a dwarfish school . Concentrate your powers , if you wish them to be effective in an eminent degree . Division into fragments will take from thiem their very name , and transform them to feebleness . When Napoleon meditated and most signally accomplished the overthrow of an army , or Nelson of a fleet , he penetrated its centre , dissevered its connexions , reduced it to parcels , and destroyed it in detail . A college or university must be regarded , in its kind , as a genuine sovereignty . But , as well may you erect and maintain two or three political , as an equal number of literary and scientific sovereignties , in the same limited community . In either case , the production is a many-headed mon- /z/ ster , and can not possibly thrive . One head will drain off the life-blood from the others , or all will dwindle for want of nourishment . Nor is this all . Sectional feelings and passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; envies , jealousies , and hostilities will be engendered ; one portion of the state will be arrayed against another ; falsehood and defamation will be employed as weapons by the conflicting parties ; morally and intellectually an embittered inte &tine; discord will prevail , or a ruinous compromise of interests will be effected , and the entire concern will run into confusion , and experience , in the end , an absolute failure . That this representation is neither a fiction , nor an exaggerated portraiture , the nature of man compels us to believe , and existing realities abundantly testify . Show me a state or small community studded with a number of petty colleges , each one vying with the others for popularity and profit , and affecting to dole out the honors of literature , and you show me a community where literature is without honor ; where scholars are as puny as the institutions that bred them , and where , to be liberally and competently educated , individuals must either go abroad for instruction , or educate themselves . That the academical organization may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respects well adjusted and healthy , the system of /q/ general education efficiently administered , and science and letters brought to some degree of perfection , establish in each State , as it becomes populous , one institution of the highest class - call it university or college , at option - and a sufficient number of subordinate ones , subjecting the whole to competent direction , and you will be successful in your effi ) rt . Your scheme will contribute to the illumination of the age , the advancement of the interest and happiness of the community , and the permanent strength and glory of your country . Pursue a course the reverse of this , and the reverse of the issue will be presented as your reward . Neither honor nor advantage will hallow your enterprise . The community will swarm with a brood of scholastic pretenders , sent forth precociously from their ill provided hives , unripe , noisy , and conceited ; but neither the strength of manhood , nor the raciness of maturity will characterize your scholarship ; nor can you ever attain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then will you realize , in all its force , the truth of the well known lines of the poet ; * A little leamiog is a dangerous thing ; Drink deep , or taste not the Pierian spring . There shdlow draughts intoxicate the brain ; But drinking deeply sobers it again . ' Should genius bestow on you any of its mighty and perdurable benefactions , or scatter among /z/ you its graceful and dazzling productions , it will be a boon from nature , or it will come to you from abroad . Your scheme of education , so defectively organized , and wanting in energy and every other genuine attribute of excellency , will have no participation in the glory of the event . Such were the oft repeated sentiments of Dr HoUey ; and , in confirmation of their truth , testimony ample and conclusive is presented to us , id the condition of the present , and the history of the past . Nor is there , in the United States , a single community , to which they are more emphatically applicable , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of literature and science among us , truly , and in a voice of solemn warning may it be said to the people of this Commonwealth , * United you stand , divided you fall ! ' ' Divide et impera , was the banner motto , and the rule of practice , of him who , by means of it , subverted the liberties of ancient Greece - the most subtle politician , one of the ablest warriors , and the most consummate diplomatist , that antiquity presents to us . In relation to our literary institutions , let a spirit of jealousy and discord continue to divide the people of this Commonwealth , and , without any aid from the sword of Philip , we shall unnaturally and ruinously triumph over ourselves and the destinies of our posterity . /q/ But let us , on the contrary , array , in promotion of the cause of letters , the united means and energies of the State , and the issue will be incalculably beneficent and glorious . Under due cultivation and fostering patronage , native genius , awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive powers , will soon shed around us its witcheries to enchant , and its splendors to adorn , and pour forth its opulence to benefit society ; an enlightened , and more salutary economy will pervade the whole community ; and the Commonwealth , talented , rich , and powerful in herself , will , not merely in the valley of the Mississippi , where it should be her determination and pride to predominate in all that is useful , great , and glorious , but throughout the Union , possess a weight and consideration , and exercise an influence , to which she has been heretofore a stranger , but to which an elevated ambition should prompt her to aspire . It is intellectual capital alone that can confer on her genuine and enduring greatness and power - in a particular manner , that can secure to her , in the West , the undisputed ascendency , which , as the eldest sister of that great and growing family of States descended from the confederacy that achieved our independence , she ought to claim , cling to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to every possible facility to establish and administer a magnificent and successful /z/ scheme of education , the world can scarcely exhibit a spot preferable to one which Kentucky presents . Very few does she possess that can be placed in competition with it . And that spot I fearlessly proclaim to be the town of Lexington . Let those whose ' envious spirits and alienated feelings prompt them to hostilities and calumnies against us , pronounce this declaration vainglorious , if they please . Facts exist in ample abundance , had I leisure to recount them , which prove it to be true . Permit me to add , which I do most confidently , that if the institution , within whose walls we are now assembled , should not yet attain to a degree of very extensive usefulness and exalted renown , its failure will be attributable , not to any fault in the place where it is situated , nor to a deficiency of many other concomitant advantages , but to a want of wisdom and ability in its administration In the words of the great dramatist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romans , The fault will not be in our stars , but in ourselves , Should we be underlings . ' A people more munificently gifted in native intellect , and more abundantly susceptible of all that education is calculated to impart , than the inhabitants of Kentucky , no age or country has ever exhibited . Give to them , on the principles of a well concerted scheme , the proper amount of /z/ /q/ instruction and discipline , their literature will be classical , rich , and profound , and their intellectual manifestations of every description brilliant and powerful . The descendants of an ancestry distinguished alike for their chivalrous spirit and the splendor of their talents , their hereditary resemblance testifies conclusively to the legitimacy of their birth . Thus peculiarly blest in the genius of her inhabitants , unusually felicitous in the character of her climate , whether reference be had to its dehghtfulness or salubrity , and exuberant in many of the most valuable and delicious productions of the soil , Kentucky occupies a central position in the valley of the Mississippi , destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most distinguished sections of the globe . Thus favorably situated to invite pupils from every quarter , she presents preeminent and manifold attractions to the youth of the South , to repair to her health-bestowing fountains , her balmy and invigorating atmosphere , her deep embowering forests which dispose to contemplation , and her academic shades so abundantly qualified to become the haunts of the Muses , to receive instruction . Establish in her bosom , then , a seat of learning corresponding to the physical advantages she enjoys , and in all respects worthy of patronage so extensive , and it will be filled to overflowing by /z/ the sons of the valley whose centre she constitutes . Nature would seem to have designated her as the chosen seat for such an establishment , and the wisdom and policy of her people should promptly and gratefully avail themselves of the boon she has bestowed . For the people not thus to embrace the proffered blessing , would be to neglect the munificency of Heaven in their behalf , to be deaf to its call inviting them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road to their most exalted destinies . Stronger still ; it would be to surrender up tamely and without a struggle the sceptre of influence which they once wielded , and the preponderating name in Western America which they once held ; to both of which , not only from motives of public and private interest , but from pride of ancestry , of political birthright , of person , and of State , they ought to cling , forever cling , with the generous sentiment and noble resolution of the naval hero , when he nails to the mast the colors , whose loss he feels would dishonor him , and sinks , if he must sink , in a blaze of glory , which the waves that receive him serve but as oil to augment and brighten . Is it the anxious wish and settled resolution of the inhabitants of Kentucky to acquire , with the proud reputation that must necessarily accompany them , a power within themselves , and a consideration without , of which nothing can deprive them , but which , instead of impairing , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit with unfading freshness and lustre , to the most distant posterity ? Let them strenuously devote themselves to the skilful cultivation and extensive diffusion of science and letters - their diffusions , not merely among themselves , but through the States that surround them - ; from the inland seas that constitute the boundary of our country on the north , to the ocean that washes its southern borders - throughout the illimitable valley of the Mississippi . An ambition like this , to supply with the invaluable capital of cultivated intellect a region so boundless , has a bearing that is godlike , and is justified and hallowed by its immensity and grandeur . It is views and meditated objects like these , that truly ' make ambition virtue . ' And if she be true to herself , in the management of the means with which nature has supplied her , this ambition the Commonwealth of Kentucky can certainly gratify . She can become herself the recognised Attica , and Lexington continue the * Athens of the West . ' For Lexington is to her , precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central and most eligible spot for the erection of a magnificent seat of instruction . Its appropriate size , the intellectual and cultivated character of its population , its interior , beautiful , and healthful situation , and its seclusion from the bustle of trade and navigation , all conspire to bestow on it , over /z/ every other situation in the State , a triumphant ascendency . The truth of this , although the ignorant may mock , and the conceited witling affect to jeer at it , its intelligent and magnanimous enemies will not venture to controvert A place where the spirit of commerce predominates , is withering to the spirit of science and letters - as certainly and naturally so , as are the skies of the north to the plantain and the banana . As well may you attempt to rear the rose , and give to it all its beauty and fragrance , among the thick entangled robber-roots and beneath the blighting shadow of the beech , as to make literature flourish under the influence of trade . Like bodies positively electrified , the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil and water , without an inter-medium , will as readily unite , and become homogeneous . If this be not true , then is there nothing certain in the philosophy of man - then is history unfaithful , and observation and experience delusive informants . In an overgrown metropolis , like London or Paris , which are worlds in themselves , it is possible for two spirits to prevail ; one amidst the throng of commerce , and the other in a more secluded part , to which the wealthy have retired for the enjoyment of tranquillity , elegance , and ease . In the latter situation , where but little business is transacted and little bustle exists and where letters and taste are cultivated as accomplish- /q/ /z/ ments and sources of amusement and pleasure , a seat of education may be erected and successfully administered . But in a town or city of ordinary size , there can be but one spirit . If commerce , therefore , predominate and flourish , letters must wither . Science is the growth of quietude and leisure . As well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ din of arms , as the clatter and confusion of extensive trade . Such , on the several topics we have passed in review , were the sentiments of our departed President and friend , as those of you who have hung with instruction and delight , on his public and academical addresses , and on his colloquial communications , must be ready to testify . Had we been so fortunate as to have caught and recorded his masterly thoughts , conveyed in his own felicitous expressions , as they fell all fresh and glowing from his lips , this effort of mine to recall and recite them , would have been unnecessary . But , to our lasting regret and irretrievable loss , he neither printed nor wrote them , and therefore have I ventured to offer to your acceptance this humble rehearsal . But , for the substantial correctness of it , as far as it extends , I hold myself responsible ; for , on these topics , as as those of education generally , the deceased and myself were identified in opinion . But Dr HoUey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred merely from the liberality. /z/ depth , and correctness of his views on the principles and schemes of education . As an executive officer , in giving to those schemes direction and efficacy , and in the general discipline of the human intellect , his merit was preeminent . In his qualifications for the government of youth , his powers of practical instruction , and his aptitudes for the general superintendence of the afiairs of an institution , he was preeminently accomplished . His government , although dignified , firm , and uncompromising , was affectionate and parental ; and at the same time peculiarly gentlemanly and refined . Possessed of a still higher quality , it was undeviatingly just . No personal resentments , no obliquities of temper , no unbecoming grossness of rebuke , nor any indulgences of partiality or favoritism , mingled in its decisions , or marred its administration . While it was the rule of the father in the midst of his children , it was of the Roman father , and was resolutely transformed into the tribunal of the judge over such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of those who were the subjects of it , it commanded their approbation and conciliated their affections . His admonitions , when necessary , were so perfectly judicious , and so free from , all severity of expression , that they produced contrition , bat never provoked the resentment of the delinquent . Hence , by the numerous youth whom he instructed , /q/ no teacher was ever more sincerely respected and beloved . So true was this , that , like stranger and guest to the hospitable Roman , to him pupil and friend were synonymous terms . Few men have ever been able to mingle so naturally , with such courteous ease , and a deportment so affable , the dignity of the presiding officer , with the cordial and endearing familiarity of the companion* Nor did he ever experience , in consequence of such intimacies , the slightest diminution of his official authority . Having in his character no traits of mediocrity , much less of littleness , he had nothing to dread from the closest inspection . On the contrary , like the Andes or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude and strength became the more imposing . In communicating instruction , his style and manner , while peculiarly didactic , and as perfectly lucid as a tissue of sunbeams , participated of the qualities of his general address . They were elegant , eloquent , rich , and impressive . Without any adscititious aid from magisterial authority , they commanded , by their attractiveness , the devoted and profound attention of his class . It was thus , that , by their beauties and excellencies , they rendered his pupils enamoured of knowledge , and led them to study , by a twofold motive , the abstract love of attainment , and the delight they experienced in the process of making it ; while , urging them to the same end , a third incentive arose out /z/ of their affectionate attachment to their parental governor and illustrious preceptor . It will be permitted me , on this occasion , to remark , that that teacher who does not awaken in his pupils a passion for knowledge , is unfit for his high and responsible vocation . If any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his soporific prelections , attain to eminence , they will owe to him , for their good fortune , neither gratitude nor regard . His heartless instructions can have had no participation in the propitious event . . But , in the capacity of an instructor and disciplinarian of youth , Dr HoUey 's most exalted merit remains to be mentioned . It consisted in a dexterity , which has rarely been equalled , and never , perhaps surpassed , in teaching his pupils to think for themselves - not merely to acquire knowledge , but to digest , assimilate , and apply it to its uses - not to derive information from books and oral communications alone , but to gather it from observation - to read and underistand the book of nature , whose truth is immaculate , and whose author is God , and not to rely too much on the fallible productions of fallible men . This is the ultimate perfection of intellectual discipline - the highest and severest test by which the value of instruction can be tried . The intellect of an individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable /q/ of indefinite progress in improvement . Earth is its study , creation its library , and nature , as the priestess of heaven , the only oracle whose responses and dictates , it implicitly receives . Barely to communicate knowledge , unaccompanied by training in the management and use of it , is to do but little , and exposes even that little to the hazard of being lost . It resembles the unavailing kindness of a parent confiding funds to the disposal of a son who is incompetent to business . The funds lie idle , or are injudiciously employed , the father is disappointed in his expectations and wishes , wounded in his affections , and mortified in his pride , and the son becomes a bankrupt . Can a preceptor teach a child to walk , a boy to dance , or a youth to fence , by merely walking , dancing , and fencing in their presence ? We know that he can not . He must induce them , under his superintendence , to walk , dance , and fence themselves ; otherwise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by their awkwardness and ignorance . And no less unavailing are the labors of the preceptor in knowledge , who limits his instructions to the mere discharging into the intellects of his pupils the contents of his own , or of such text-books as he may place in their hands , and expound to them in his lectures . He that would train successfully and to the highest efiect the intellects of youth , must proceed /z/ precisely as if he were training their muscles . He must teach them self-dependent action ; to observe , judge , and reason for themselves ; to move intellectually without his aid , not only in collecting judiciously the materials of knowledge , but in exercising their higher faculties on such materials as they already possess , his chief province being , vigilantly and faithfully to aid them in the process . It was , perhaps , as already intimated , in this department of instruction , that Dr Holley was most strikingly judicious and able , and in the highest degree successful . Leaving to others the humbler and less useful task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobler ambition to make philosophers and men of business - characters competent to the advancement of knowledge , and the management of high affairs - prepared to shine alike in any sphere of activity and distinction , whether in medical , forensic , or clerical life ; or to become , at option , ministers of nature , or ministers of state . Nor was the deceased less successful in forming the morals and manners of his pupils . While he enriched them in knowledge , he zealously cultivated in them pure and high-toned principles of rectitude and honor ; and , as far as precept and example might avail , and the peculiarities of a college life would admit , imparted to them the air and polish of gentlemen . For the better and more certain accomplishment of these purposes . /z/ he delivered itx this Chapel , one or two courses pf popular lectures on morals and manners , which , being open to public attendance , were , in a high degree , delightful and instructive , not merely to the pupils of the institution , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of riper years . Notwithstanding the imputation of laxity and a disregard of strict morality , thrown on his government , by those who were hostile to him , a body of young men more highly decorous and exemplary in their deportment , than the pupils of Transylvania , was not to be found in any similar institution in the United States . And since their departure from under the auspices of their Alma Mater , bearing along with them her honors and her blessing , they have so deported themselves , both morally and intellectually , as to redeem , very abundantly , the pledge that was offered by their college lives . The entire charge , therefore , was a violation of truth , deliberately perpetrated for nefarious purposes , and worthy , in all respects , of the profligate spirits that conceived it in malice , and the venom-dripping tongues that uttered it in slander . Under Dr HoUey 's training of her pupils , administration of her government , and general superintendence of her interests , Transylvania rose , as if by enchantment , from a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ honorable . Search , throughout the world , the records of institutions for the instruction of youth , and you will not , except perhaps under the munificence and power of a royal treasury , and the patronage of a kingdom , find a single instance of a growth so rapid , and success so triumphant . Nor even under circumstances genial and powerfully fostering as those , is any seat of learning at present recollected , whose early career was so brilliantly prosperous . Notwithstanding the munificency of its pecuniary benefactions from the State , the strength and reputation conferred on it by five accomplished European professors , and the weight and imposing eclat it has derived from the names of Jefferson and Madison , as its rectors , and of Monroe and other distinguished personages as visiters and counsellors , the course of the University of Virginia has been much less resplendent . In the year 1818 , Transylvania was but a grammar school , composed of a few boys acquiring the elements of classical learning , without any of the incentives of lofty ambition , to enamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the magician came , and in 1823 , 1824 , and 1825 , it was a proud university , consisting of three departments , and containing four hundred pupils , amply instructed in what most essentially pertains to scholarship , profession , and general science , and burning with the ambition of honorable attain- j /q/ ment and intellectual renown . Nor will the most envious and embittered of his enemies deny , that , in this career of advancement , so unprecedented and lustrous , the genius of HoUey was the primitive agent . What though he did not immediately superintend and personally administer the professional departments of medicine and law ? He was the master spirit that called them into existence , and an able and faithful counsellor and auxiliary in their administration by others . Nor was this all* His ardor and enthusiasm were felt by their professors , to whose energies he was instrumental in giving augmented tone and vigor , whose hopes and prospects he sustained and brightened , by his irrepressible enterprise and confident anticipations , and whose reputations derived additional lustre from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now shorn of her radiance , and that her decline is to be attributed to the faults of the deceased ? That the glories of her morning are dimmed , not a little , by a passing cloud , is a melancholy truth which must not be denied , and can not be concealed . Nor , as relates to her present enfeebled condition , will candor permit me to exonerate from blame her late illustrious and lamented President . Like other mortals , he was the heir of imperfections , and , therefore , subject to faults . But , as regards the case in question , even his very /z/ failings arose from the prodigality with which nature had endowed him - from an excess of those attributes , which , existing in moderation , are ele* vated excellencies - virtues of the manliest character , which , urging to high and daring emprises out immortal ancestors , contributed essentially to our existence as a nation - so essentially , that , with out them , that existence would never have been established . Had President HoUey been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , and less frank and intrepid in disclosing his sentiments , he would have been more fortunate , and Transylvania more prosperous . But for those failings , which , at worst , are nothing but errors of judgment , and which justice therefore forbids us to designate by a harsher term , it is altogether probable that the late dispensation of Heaven would have been averted , this university still in its glory , and our departed friend flourishing in the midst of us , as he once was , in the pomp of his talents and the splendor of his fame , the delight of his associates , the idol of his pupils , and the legitimate pride and boast of the community . Although no one deplores more sincerely than myself , his melancholy failure , in this place , to attain the object of his laudable ambition , by becoming the father of literature and science in the West , and rearing to his renown , in this institution , a monument more durable than marble or . Discourse . 73 bronze , yet truth compels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solemn warning of the fate that awaits the most munificent endowments , and the highest competencies , where a becoming deference to public sentiment is unyieldingly withheld . For to that unyieldingness , carried to excess , is to be attributed , in the present instance , not a little of the catastrophe , which both we ourselves , and the community at large so fervently lament . But if , under the administration of Dr Holley , Transylvania did decline from the lofty pinnacle of usefulness and renown , to which his genius and exertions had raised her , the fault was far from being exclusively his own . On the contrary , the portion of it rightfully chargeable to him , was comparatively small . If , as connected with the lamentable reverse she has experienced , some of his measures must be denominated unwise , the conduct of others must be pronounced unholy . If he had his excesses , which moderation would have changed to excellencies , and which liberality invokes us to remember with indulgence , those who , from motives of envy and unprovoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both him and the institution over which he presided , were blackened by faults and soiled by impurities , not to apply to them more condemnatory terms , which nothing earthly can justify ; and which , though miercy , in its fulness , may forgive , /z/ even charity denounces , and nothing but a compromise with dishonor can eacuse . For , that a deadly conBpir#cy was formed , not only against him , but against Transylvania , as the pride of his genius and the child of his affections , is known to be true . That falsehood , defamation , and treachery were employed , by that conspiracy , as worthy instruments for the perpetration of its purposes , is equally true . Nor is it less so , that the institution owes its present humbled fortunes to the machina* tions of the conspirators , and the profligacy of their minions , infinitely more than to any immediate influence of the indiscretions of the President . But I must drop the subject , lest the abhorrence with which I view it should so far prevail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were I to paint it in the full depth of the darkness that belongs to it , and give to it all the revolting deformity which is so peculiarly its own , the labor would not avail me . It could neither extinguish the spirit of envy , jealousy , and hatred , which conspired to destroy ; nor remedy the desolation it contributed to produce . Nor do I need its blackness to serve as a foil to brighten the merits and fame of the deceased . Like an electron per 56 , he shone with an inherent lustre , independently of the contrast of surrounding objects . To utter these remarks has been as painful to me - I trust much more so , than it has been to any of you to listen to them . It is not my purpose DiiSCOUASfi. 75 to wound or to offend any individaal who honors me with his attention . Nor do I speak with an immediate reference to any person , sect , or denomination , whether present or absent . I allude to those , and to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , that they were enemies to Transylvania , and to him , who , for a time , so brilliantly and successfully guided its fortunes . Should such individuals , whoever they may be , recognise , in their own image , the correctness of this representation and agonize beneath the pressure of truth , their sufferings will be the result , not of my expressions , but of a sober retrospect of their own misdeeds . On such an occasion , neither malice , hatred , nor any other unhallowed affection , can rankle in my bosom or empoison my words . Feelings so unsuitable , because so unworthy of the spirit of him I commemorate , would degrade and dishonor me in my own estimation , as deeply and irretrievably as they could in yours . But asolemn sense of duty to the tomb demands of me the truth . As far as my humble abilities may avail , the fame of the deceased must not suffer in my report of him . At every hazard it shall be honestly maintained . What I have spoken , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I fearlessly encounter it . In his capacity as a man , I have already so far spoken of Dr Holley , as to set forth , as amply as i /z/ the limits of this address will adroit , the readiness , strength , and splendor of his talents , which , in any sphere of any intellectual life , would have ensured to him renown . Were I to attempt , in miniature , a sketch of his intellect , I would say , that its predominant features consisted in a boldness to encounter the most difficult enterprises , a capacity to acquire knowledge with unwonted rapidity and retain it with a corresponding degree of tenacity , a power to wield and apply it to its uses with wonderful promptitude , force , and splendor , and a strong propensity to great temporary efforts , with an equal antipathy to persevering toil . With feelings as ardent as a Bolingbroke or a Mirabeau , when fairly engaged in a task that was pleasing to him , he clung to it , until finished , with unremitting assiduity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faculties . Hence arose the greater certainty of his success , and the unrivalled celerity of his progress in accomplishing it . On knowledge thus attained he dwelt with steadiness , carefully analyzing it , viewing it in all its connexions and relations , and making it repeatedly a topic of conversation , and even of soliloquy , until it was completely assimilated to his intellect , and had become , in its adhesion to it , so settled and confirmed , that he had a perfect command of it , and the union was indissoluble. t.mraS'Z ' /q/ If he failed , at times , in sober judgment , it was owing to the absorbing or distracting influence of awakened feeling , and not to any want of perspi cacity in his perceptive , or strength and clearness in his reasoning faculties - not to any defect in the power to judge , but to some failure or obliquity in the exercise of it . In his calculations , as to future achievements and anticipated events , especially if high enjoyment was associated with them , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which constituted a predominant sentiment of his intellect . But although , like a phantom-fire in his path , that cheering faculty did occasionally beguile and mislead him , it did not fail to bestow on him , in return , an ample measure of compensating benefit . It maintained in him , in a high degree , that elasticity of spirit and sunshine of the soul , which constitute the choicest condition of existence , under the influence of which , success , in every enterprise , seems certain , fame is seen in waiting , friendships are deemed steady , love unchanging , and , all creation is bright and beamy to the eye , and in delightful harmony with the other senses ; but without which life is nothing but gloom and bitterness - the vision of a hypochondriac or the dream of an epicure , with an incubus on his bosom . /z/ To the foregoing intellectual characteristics of the deceased , may be justly added , his wonderful powers to arouse , delight , and instruct , in conversation* In this mode of intercourse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view - the knowledge he communicated , and the trains of thought he was instrumental in awakening . When thus engaged , the workings of his intellect were irresistibly contagious , and excited to imitative and productive action , the intellects of all who were within the compass of his voice . No one could be dull or inattentive in his presence . Nor was it possible to be long in his company , without receiving something to remember and prize . Most truly may I say of him , as Johnson did of Burke , that you could not stop with him even a few minutes under a shed , as a protection from a shower of rain , without feeling that you were in contact with a great man . So powerful is the magic of a master spirit , and so certainly does it excite in others an earnest , though involuntary effort at imitation . Nor were the texture and tone of his moral inferior to those of his intellectual faculties . In all matters of private concern , and of business generally , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable ; * /q/ m those of charity and public spirit , benevolent , liberal , and enterprising . In the performance of his official duties , whether professional or academical , he was conscientiously and inflexibly faithful and exact . He suffered nothing to interrupt him in the due execution of trusts committed to him , by individuals , public bodies , or the community at large . No man ever stood more contemptuously aloof from the UtUenesses and meanness of false profession , hypocrisy , and deceit . He scorned all trickery , cant , and knavishness , as well in religious as in secular affairs . To no subtle artifices , dis honorable compromises , or petty expedients of any description , did he ever descend in quest of popularity . Nor did he stand in need of their protection or their aid . Possessing within himself an abundance of powers for the effectuation of his purposes , he held it not only dishonesty but humiliating and self-degrading to manifest a spurious pretension to more . The governing maxim and rule of his life was , * O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Let me succeed in honorable enterprises by honorable means , or let me fail ! Success by intrigues debt he contracted in the West . So conscientious was he on this topic , that having forgotten a small demand which a citizen of Lexington had on him , he remitted from Louisville , unasked , the money to setde it , when on his way to New Odeaos. /z/ or any kind of unfairness , is worse than failure . It is moral delinquency . ' To pretend to what we have not , and to practise deception for the attainment of our ends , is an avowal of our deficiency . For all affectation , deception , and hypocrisy , are but feigned and miserable substitutes for real and valuable qualities . He , therefore , who is conscious of possessing the latter , feels himself above the necessity of the former . The truly opulent never borrow ; much less do they stoop to chaffer or purloin . Conscious of his standing , and above all deception for the purpose of maintaining it , our departed President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all undue suspicion of it in others . To envy and jealousy he was no less a stranger . As a friend , therefore , he was manly , confiding , and steady ; and frank , high-minded , and liberal , as a companion . Nor were his enmities , if awakened , less uniformly characterised by openness and candor . When roused by injury , or meditated insult , although his resentments were fiery , they were neither lasting nor vindictive . The lightning might flash , and the bolt be given to fly , at times with bitter and galling effect ; but , in a moment afterwards , all was peaceful and serene as before . The angry cloud which had gathered and burst at the same instant , never lingered sullenly on his brow . Nor did hatred or malice find access to his soul . /q/ The region of feeling in which he delighted to dwell , was far above such ignominious passions . The sphere of magnanimity , clemency , and manly forbearance , was his chosen abode . Or , if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion against immorality and crime . He never pursued a foe from selfish motives ; nor for the personal gratification of doing him an injury . If he pursued him at all , it was from considerations connected with other individuals , or the community at large . He practised the virtue of forgetting offences and forgiving injuries , in a degree infinitely above any manifestation of it made by those who accused him of disaffection toward the christian religion . Yet a spirit of forgiveness , and a disposition to bury ofifences , are ranked with the choicest of christian graces . While his foes assailed him with clamorous defamation and unrelenting vengeance , he maintained , in relation to them , a dignified silence , or spoke of them * more in pity than in aftger . ' He cherished and practised toward them , benevolence and charity ; they toward him , inexorable malevolence in all its modifications . He tolerated them , even in their calumny and persecution ; they were intolerant toward him , while peacefully engaged in his high vocation , dispensing beneficence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine spirit of Christianity , not only extend to /z/ them the peaceful olive branch , but returned them good for evil ; while they , deliberately and inflexi* bly resolved on his ruin , persisted in outrage , and , in a spirit which Christianity and virtue condemn , iniquitously repaid him with evil for good . Yet , in their own estimation and vainglorious pretensions , they were saints on earth - a portion of the legitimate christian community , ' elected as the favorite children of mercy ; while he was a reprobate and an outcast from grace . Theirs was the consecrated privilege to empty on him the . vials of their wrath , while he was pouring out the riches of his intellect , for the instruction and accomplishment of the youth of the West . His religion was practical , and . operative on character . It consisted chiefly in sentiment , which prompted to works of justice and beneficence ; while theirs was little else than a compound of doctrines and opinions , an adherence to which was their test of holiness and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had no kindly influence , nor was it , in practice , a fountain of good works . To the truth of this , their persecution of him abundantly testified . In its benevolent spirit and catholic scope , his religion embraced the entire family of man , while theirs was limited to the adopters and advocates of particular creeds . But this hasty contrast must be brought to a close . /q/ Withoat meaning to pass judgment , or even offer an opinion , on the comparative merits of the reUgion of Dr HoUey , and that of his persecutors , I have simply sketched this succinct view of them , that others may examine and judge for themselves . On which side lie , as relates to the parties , the highest magnanimity , amiability of disposition , and attractiveness of deportment , and on which the temper best adapted to cherish * peace and harmony and good will among men , ' no one will find it difficult to decide . On this subject I shall only add , that while the foes of the deceased were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell , to the utmost , the number of their adherents , he was never , while President of this university , an active propagandist of any peculiar theological creed . In his academical teachings , he descanted occasionally , as his topic required , on the religion of nature , and the general principles recognised as true by the whole christian world , and nothing more . That he ver made or meditated an effort to sully , by heresy , the orthodox purity of his college classes , is not true . The charge , like most others that were preferred against him , was a calumny as dark as malice could render it . It was fabricated by his enemies , as a means of destruction , while the easy credulity and tattle of some , and the ever-vigilant and active malignity of others . /z/ gave it a currency and force , that rendered it an instrument of no ordinary power , in the accomplishment of its object Nor did he ever , although slanderously charged with it , introduce into his academical instructions , a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke on politics , it was only as a branch of the philosophy of man , considered in a moral and intellectual capacity , and living under a regulated form of government ; and then , as his duty and responsibilities demanded , he confined himself exclusively to general principles . In his disquisitions on constitutional law , in the law department of the university , his course was equally philosophical and fair ; and his sentiments characterized by the same liberality . Another of the numerous reports circulated against the correctness of the creed of Dr HoUey , was , that he was a materialist , and therefore a disbeliever in the immortality of the soul . This again was deliberate slander . Dr HoUey was no materialist . And if he had been , that alone would not have rendered him necessarily a disbeliever in the soul 's immortality . Matter , in the abstract , is as immortal as spirit . Nothing but the power that created both can destroy either ; and that can destroy both with equal facility . Nor can any one assign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed of matter , /q/ as readily and worthily as of anything else , the thinking and immortal principle of man . It has even been contended by some of the most pious and enlightened of men , that to have done so , would seem most consistent with the uniform simplicity of all his operations - with his achievement of everything by the least possible complexity of means . But be this as it may , to contend that he could not thus have formed the human soul , would be to limit his power ; to allege that he ought not , would be presumptuously to interfere with his counsels and his pleasure ; and to assert that he has not , would be an assumption of knowledge which pertains tiot to man . Of one truth we may feel assured , that he has formed the soul of the substance most suitable to its faculties and destinies ; and it belongs not to us dogmatically to decide , whether that substance be matter or spirit . Some contend that there is a revolting grossness connected with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . The grossness is not in the idea ; but in the crude and erroneous conception of those by whom it is formed . It is to compositions of matter alone that impurity and coarseness can attach . And , whether it be material or immaterial , no one imagines the soul to be compound . Simple matter is as pure , and , for aught man knows to the contrary , as refined in its nature , as spirit - a sunbeam as much so as aa angel of light . /z/ In the most extensive signification of the term , Dr Holley was a professed immortalist . He believed in the immortality of the created universe . He did not believe that even an atom had been called into existence to be again annihilated . He saw no reason why , at any future period , matter would be less necessary in the economy of creation than it is at present . Nor can any such reason be rendered by man . Nor is the actual destruction of matter predicted in scripture , whatever may be said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground of our opinion , the disclosures of written revelation , or the lights of nature , we are compelled to believe , that , in the administration of the government of the universe , created spirit and created matter are alike essential . It is as rational , therefore , to believe in the meditated annihilation of the one , as of the other . To believe in the annihilation of either , is the dream of a visionary , unsupported by a single fact , or even the shghtest probability . Changes in compound bodies are hourly occurring , and will continue to occur . Birth and death , with all the alterations that the individual experiences from the one to the other ; the succession of one generation to another , and of one condition of society to another ; the material phenomena characteristic of spring and summer and autumn and winter ; the multiplied appearances denomi-. nated meteorological , and the magnificent move- rflSCOURSE. 87 ments of the heavenly bodies , which are nothing but mere mutations of being - all these will go on , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will never be realized . The , poet may interweave it in a web of fiction , and the frenzied zealot embrace it as a truth ; but the philosophical Christian will exclude it from his creed . To assert of the Deity , that for his own pleasure alone he creiates , and for his own pleasure and glory destroys , without any regard to the beings created , is to represent him as arbitrary and selfish , capricious and unstable , in a degree that would be derogatory to the character of man - as acting from motives of pastime and wantonness , without system or object or premeditated plan . Such are not the schemes of creative wisdom . They are not mutable , because by change they could not be amended . In them , as in their Author , there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning . ' They were matured by omniscience in the counsels of eternity ; they were necessary , or they would not have been carried into effect ; no experience will find them defective , or susceptible of amelioration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can be conceived of by man , that will either mar them or render them useless . There is strong ground to believe , therefore , that they will be neither altered nor destroyed ; but , in stability and duration , will rival eternity . /z/ Constitationally Dr Holley was most aetiteiy alive to the beauties of nature , and all the splendid productions of art . On few individuals has there ever been bestowed so keen a relish for this elegant and inexhaustible source of enjoyment . Nor had he failed to cultivate , with zeal and distinguished success , his native susceptibility , which served him as a fountain of such exquisite delight . On beauty of every description he gazed with feelings of high-toned rapture ; and turned from what was unsightly , with an offended sensibility bordering on pain . Hence arose the refinement and peculiar excellencies of his taste as an amateur , and the well known correctness of his judgment as a critic . Although not himself a frequent or successful suitor in the bowers of the Muses - for he rarely attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep effect , @#@ the minstrel 's bold and high-strung lyre ' - he , notwithstanding , looked on creation with the frenzied eye , and felt her charms with all the thrilling ecstasy of the poet . As relates in particular to the sublime and beautiful , and whatever is characterized by intensity and strength , so indissolubly were the feelings of poetry interwoven in his nature , that they constituted a part of it . Where others were only gratified , he was delighted ; and what gave delight to them , was rapture to him . Though not an enfeebled aspen sensitive , that trembles and shrinks at /q/ the approach of the breeze , or dies of a rose in aromatic pain , ' he possessed , perhaps , as ample an endowment of manly sensibility , as was ever bestowed on an individual of our race . In him the azure of the heavens by day , boundless in extent , and vying in purity with * the Spirit that made it , ' and the glories of their star-fretted canopy by night ; the freshened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lap of ocean , and the tempered radiance of his evening orb , as it drops for repose into the crimson wave , after the toils of a day of brightness ; the cloud-piercing mountain with its fantastical drapery , its frowning precipices , and its piles of granite ; the illimitable ocean , whether swept by a tempest or slumbering in a calm , in either case a mighty and impressive representation of the attributes of omnipotency and boundless extent ; the widespreading prairie , to the wondering eye alike interminable , with its gorgeous and undulating sea of vegetation , reposing in solitude , or peace-* fully or tumultuously thronged with animals , whose myriads seem to compass infinity ; the convulsions of the earthquake , spreading terror in its path , and reducing to a waste of indiscriminate ruin the productions of nature and the monuments of art ; the deep entangled forest , lyrapt in gloom and primeval silence , except when resounding to the hunter 's rifle , the Indian 's war-whoop , or the monster 's howl ; the bursting thunder-cloud , riving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted oak and . the rock of adamant ; the mighty river , the roaring cataract , and the wild and desolating sweep of the tornado - objects stupendous and magnificent like these , produced in him those intense and highwrought emotions of the sublime , a faithful description of which would be received by the insensitive as a fiction of romance . With sensibility equally awakened , and corresponding emotions equally vivid , did he enjoy bis *90uPs home , ' when placed in the midst , of softer and more soothing scenes , rich in the humbler beauties of nature ; the sequestered bower , erected and decorated by the hand of taste , whether silvered by moonlight , or fanned by breezes bearing on their bosom the virgin freshness and fragrance of morning ; the emerald lawn , spangled with flowers wantonly scattered from the lap of spring ; the chrystal rivulet , glittering in the sunbeams as it smoothly winds within its grassy banks , or breaks in faint and tranquillizing murmurs over its variegated pebbles , which the lapse of its waters through indefinite ages has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own secluded loneliness , or enlivened by the sportings of the feathered tribes , and vocal to the thrilling music of their loves ; the luxuriant meadow , gemmed with the early dew-drop , where flocks and herds enjoy their frolic and partake their food ; and the checkered prospect of the sunny hill-top and the /q/ shaded vale - such were the sources of his minor delights , in the midst of which he loved to linger with a kindred fondness , which , if faithfully pictured , would seem to the intellect of * grosser mould , ' a @#@ tale of fancy , or a poet 's dream . ' But to him it was a living and ever active reality , to which his nature ministered , and which clung to him through life as an attribute of his soul . Nor was he less enamoured of all that is poetic in human nature , than of that which the earth , the ocean , and the heavens unfold to us . And , notwithstanding the revolting pictures of it , which , in their cankered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw , and the dismal denunciations which they thunder forth against it , there is much in human nature that is not only delightfully , but intensely poetic . The sportive innocency and irrepressible delights of infancy ; the sprightliness and blooming gaiety , the buoyant hopes and fresh desires of youth , ere yet neglect or disappointment , misfortune or care has assailed and withered them ; the first emotions of virtuous love , which soothe with visions of ineffable felicity the soul of the possessor , and , * in witching fancy , ' deck , with all that is most excellent , rare , and attractive , whether in earth or heaven , its chosen object ; the warm and widespreading affections and desires of ripened life , that encompass in their scope the existing family of man , and throwing their longings into future 92 mscouRSE. yearsi and other anticipated conditions of being , give to us even here , upon this bank and shoal of time , ' an existence that reaches beyond the grave ; the all-subduing beauty and loveliness of woman , composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her form and the delicacy and chastened richness ' of her complexion , the grace and airy lightness of her movements , the sprightliness and vivacity of her etherial spirit , the lustre of her eye , whether brightened by pleasure or impearled by a tear , the fascination of her smile , the retiring blush of her virgin purity , the devotedness and constancy of her friendship , the generous and absorbing confidence of her love , her conjugal tenderness and fidelity , the endearing and indescribable affections and attentions , which none but a mother can experience and bestow , which beam from her countenance with such mellowed radiance , and proclaim her the world 's most perfect model of disinterested attachment , and duty instinctively and faithfully performed ; the fond and untiring vigilance with which she hangs over the pillow of affliction , ministers in kindness to the troubled spirit , cools and calms the burning temples , soothes to slumber the aching brow , and then retires to weep unseen , and pour forth the balmy incense of her prayers for the relief of the sufferer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers environ the objects of her love - these are the genuine materials /q/ of poetry , these are the atributes of human nature , and of these was the deceased enthusiastically enamoured . t Nor of the higher and bolder manifestations of man was he a less ardent and devoted admirer . The fearful workings of the tragic passions , convulsing the soul with the throes of an earthquake , or breaking forth with the ruinous burst of the volcano ; the lofty darings of the youthful hero , who rushes from the arms of affection and beauty to battle and carnage , and , regardless of danger , suffering , and death , surrenders up his life in exchange for glory ; the mighty in genius , at one time ruling and calming the turbulence of free minds by the powers of persuasion , stirring them to frenzy by his maddening eloquence , or , by the omnipotency of argument , forcing conviction on a listening senate - at another , exploring the heavens in quest of new and remoter worlds , or profoundly scanning and settling the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - or again , in the inspired character of the poet , searching the deep fountains of the human heart , and the dark recesses of the human soul , for means to subdue by sympathy , to thrill with ecstasy , or appal with terror ; sweeping in thought through earth and heaven , even to the footstool of Deity himself , to exalt imagination by celestial scenery , and hallow it by celestial influence ; plunging into the fiery abode of the infernaJs , /z/ to consummate the conception of misery and wo , by a survey of the fearfulness of the place , and returning fraught with the choicest materials , to weave a fabric of imperishable song ; - nor must I forget the still more magnificent spectacle of a patriot hero , striking , with his own single arm , as the commissioned and avenging minister of Heaven , a daring usurper , or a blood-stained tyrant from his seat of power , or , placed in command of a patriot army , pouring into its masses his own mighty and invincible spirit , wielding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in defence of his country and human rights , gloriously leading it to victory or death ; - these are the objects of true intellectual and moral sublimity , the most lofty and resplendent materials of the poetry of man ; and with these was the deceased very perfectly familiar , and as deeply , perhaps , susceptible of the emotions corresponding to them , as comports with the constitution of human nature . Did the occasion permit me to descend to a detail of those minor elegancies , which at once adorn and dignify our nature , and constitute the charm of polished society , truth would not fail to sanction the declaration , that , as already intimated , in these the deceased was abundantly accomplished . Such , in fact , was the strength of his passion for honorable distinction , and so consummate the confederacy of his powers for the attainment of /q/ it , that in whatever walk of the drama of life he might have acted his part , he would have been secure of elevation , if not of preeminence . Fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exuberantly endowed by nature , had Heaven , in its pleasure , consigned him to the walks of common rural life , or ushered him , as a hunter , into the wilds of the West , even there , he would have been , in the former case , a chosen leader in labor and sport , and , in the latter , a recognised Nimrod of the forest . So true to nature , and so characteristic of genius united to ambition , are the lines of the poet ; - * Great Julius , on the mountains bred , A flock , perhaps , or herd had led ; He that subdued the world had been But the best wrestler on the green . ' As if destined by nature to be , in some degree , marked and distinguished in all things , and assimilated in nothing to ' living clods of coarser mould , ' even the circumstances of the sickness , death , and burial of Dr HoUey , being singular , and striking , have attracted deservedly much more than ordinary attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness and roar of a tempest as fierce as the dehrium by which his great intellect was destined to be shattered , and which shook , for a time , surrounding nature with /z/ a tumult as appallingi as the fearful convulsions amidst which he expired . And he died , after a short illness , at sea , in the meridian of life , remote from medical aid , and from all connexions and intimate friends that might have soothed sufferings and ministered to his wants ; was at  - -  tended in his sickness only by strangers , who were destitute alike of skill and means to afford him relief , or even contribute to his comfort , and bis rentains were committed to the waves , in the Gulf of Mexico , one of the most remarkable and cele brated bodies of water on earth . To deepen still more the sombre shades of the melancholy picture , all this happened at a conjuncture when offers were held out to him and prospects unfolded , not only in the highest degree flattering , in an intellectual point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fame , but by which he might have become easy and affluent in fortune . And the value to him of such prospects is perfectly understood , and can be duly appreciated by his acquaintance and friends . For it is well known to them , that , owing to the liberality of his charitable benefactions , his munificent hospitalities , and his general disregard of wealth , his intellectual riches and ample reputation were his only possessions ; and that , like too many others of the bright but improvident sons of genius , he had made no competent pecuniary provision for any of the adverse contingencies of life . /q/ But mournful , in the aggregate , as this visitation is , were I curiously to analyze it , giving to each of its constituent parts the consideration that belongs to it , I would say , that , to whatever extent evil may predominate in the entire mixture , it is not a compound of unqualified evils . True , the world has lost in it one of its rare and highly gifted inhabitants , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful promoter , education a devoted patron and an efficient minister , society one of its choicest favorites and most distinguished ornaments , and his immediate friends and family all that those terms of endearing relation imply , enhanced and hallowed by the abundance of amiable and attractive qualities , that were united to the more exalted excellencies of the deceased . Still further to augment the collective loss , almost the entire intellectual opulence of Dr HoUey is , with his corporeal relics , in the deep bosom of the ocean buried . ' For , of all his vigorous and glowing thoughts , his rich conceptions , and bis brilliant fancies , all his refined and lofty philosophical disquisitions , and the famed discourses , whether theological , academical , or popular , that were breathed in soul-subduing melody , or rolled forth in awakening thunders from his lips , he has left but little behind him either in manuscript or print . Like a gifted , but hapless son of Helicon , whose misfortunes find a place in classical story , instead /z/ of imprinting them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keeping of Echo , who , now that he gratifies and enriches her no longer , has proved faithless to her trust , and refuses to render back the treasures she received . Of him may it be said , with more literal truth than of almost any other personage so abundant in talent , attainment , and scholarship , that he has ceased from his labors , and his works have followed him . ' Much as he aided , by his oral exertions , to grace and decorate the field of intellect , it is matter of deep and lasting regret , that , by the productions of his pen , he contributed but little to extend or enrich it . Yet had he labored , as an author , in proportion to the munificency of his native endowments , he would have been one of the most distinguished writers of the age - alike in richness and profundity , brilliancy and strength . Then might the abundant eloquence of his pen have instructed and charmed an admiring posterity , as that of his lips did his contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted of his productions , in the terms of the Great Unknown , commemorative of the magic of the highest specimens of British eloquence , Spells of such force no wizard grave E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave , Though this could drain the ocean dry , And force the planets from the sky . ' /q/ But , in the graphical language of the same writer , ' These spells are spent , and , spent with these . The wine of life is on the lees . Genius , and taste , and talent sleep , For ever tombed beneath the deep . ' But if the death of our departed friend was sudden , produced by a disease of fiery character and overwhelming force , which deadened sensibility , maddened the brain , and dried up , in a short time , the fountain of existence , he escaped by it the spirit-withering feebleness , the slow-consuming anguish of * hope deferred , ' and the many other aggravated sufferings of protracted illness . He was gratified , moreover , in a favorite wish , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might not die of a lingering disease . If , from the exalted meridian of his career , unobscured by clouds , and unshorn , by decline , of a beam of his radiance , he dropt , Kke the tropical sun , into the waves , he was exempted , by that , from the corporeal infirmities , and intellectual debilities and dimnesses , which constitute the concomitants and the miseries of age . * And now his race of glory run , His was the eve of tropic sun ; No pale gradations quench his ray . No twilight dews his warmth allay ; With disk like battle-target red , He rushes to his ocean-bed , Dies the wide waves with ruddy light , Then sinks at once - and all is night . ' /z/ If his body was committed to the deep , by the hands of hardy and honest-hearted mariners , who honored it , as it descended , by the libation of their tears , and the rites of their manly and cordial Farewell ! ' his funeral was not profaned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemies and calumniators in life . Nor can his grave be violated by the exulting gaze , or muttered triumphs of wretches , who , since his death , have ignobly and vindictively insulted his memory . What though his friends were denied the gratification of watching his pillow , and mitigating the severity of his sufferings while living , the sad yet soothing privilege of mingling their sorrows and sympathies around his herse , and the melancholy solace of ministering to him the rites and solem nities of the tomb ? - What , I say , though to his friends and connexions was denied the boon of rendering to the illustrious dead these tributes and tokens of their affection and esteem ? Notwithstanding the unfavorableness of the occasion for paying them , as far as they could be paidi those mournful manifestations of sympathy and regard were neither churlishly withheld , nor heartlessly administered , by the voyagers whom chance had made his companions at sea ; for , of him it was true , without any poetical license of expression , that he was By strangers honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though man had been silent , the rolling surf , as it broke over the reef near which he was deposited , would have resounded to him , as it did , a deep and solemn requiem , which will never cease to salute the ear of the passing mariner , while the winds shall continue to waft him , and the ocean be his home . And , amidst the roar of the mighty waters , his repose will be as peaceful , as if he slept under fretted marble , or the grassy sod , silently wept on by the dews of evening , and soothed by the vespers of the softened breeze . Were I inclined to indulge in poetical vision , and decorate my subject with the drapery of fiction , readily might I fancy to myself , and picture forth to you , a choir of the fairest and most exquisite vocalists of the ocean , chanting to their favorite the following elegy . ' Farewell ! be it ours to embellish thy pillow With everything beauteous that grows in the deep ; Each flower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeten thy bed , and illumine thy sleep . Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept ; With many a shell , in whose hollow-wreathed chamber , We , daughters of ocean , by moonlight have slept We ' 11 dive where the gardens of coral lie darkling . And plant all the rosiest stems at thy head ; We 11 seek where the sands are most precious and sparkling And gather their dust to strew over thy head . Farewell farewell ! until pity 's emotion Is extinct in the hearts of the fair and the brave , They 11 weep for their favorite who died on this ocean . The stranger who peacefully sleeps in this wave . ' /z/ But brilliant and attractive as is my theme , and far as it is from being exhausted of its opulency , I must no longer resist the pressing admonitions of time and circumstance to close this Discourse . But indulge me first in adding , that as long as the Tortugas , in the midst of which the blue waters opened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding billows , they will serve as a monument to draw forth from voyagers of refined sensibility , and from the generous and high-minded sons of the ocean , a sigh of remembrance and a tear of sorrow , in homage to our friend who reposes at their base . /z/ Note A. - belong to the biographer rather than the eulogist , p. 4 . In contemplating an exquisite work of art , it may not be necessary to refer the imagination or the judgment to the process by which such perfection was attained . It is sufficient that it excites our whole admiration . But who does not inquire , whence sprung this model by which the world has been delighted ; by what agency has it acquired such mastery over our hearts ? Who , when the genius which inspired it is no more , will not love to dwell , not only upon its maturity , but on each step of its progress - its earliest indications ? Who will not demand , whence its origin ? Thus , in describing the matured character , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its powers . To trace its virtues to their beginnings does not increase or diminish their value or beauty ; yet such a process is not without its uses , certainly not without interest . The philosopher and the moralist are as fond of first principles as of results . They like to go back , step by step , to the origin of things ; nor is such a course uninteresting to the common observer . Who , on beholding ' the deep and silent grandeur of the Mississippi , ' and its twin torrent , the Missouri , or the beautiful Ohio , is not , at least in fancy , carried through their /z/ meanderings , to the thousand rills which are tributary to their greatness ? Who , on viewing the wide spreading St Lawrence , bathing the shores of two nations , does not search out its parent Lake of the Woods , and follow the gathering tide through its placid course , and over rapids and cataracts , to that emblem of eternity , the ocean ?

It boasts , also , of having given birth to many persons , who have been highly distinguished in our country , and who still adorn its civil , military , and literary walks . Its iron soil , at once rugged and fertile , seems to have a peculiar adaptation to the production of vigorous intellect . Glowing patriotism , patient industry , ardent enterprise , and exuberant fancy , have been its common productions . These active epergies , as exhibited in the character of its sons , are diffused throughout the nation . Its towering mountains , its beautiful lakes , its luxuriant vallies , though deserted by the genius they inspired and nurtured , still claim their share in those ardent aspirations which sent it forth to an admiring world , and in that affection , which , amidst toil and vicissitude , ever directs its warmest impulses to the cherished remembrances , and dear scenes of its birth and infancy .

' It is an interesting question , and one that has given rise to much curious speculation . How does an individual inherit his genius ? That it is an ijaheritance , though greatly modified by the circumstances which repress or foster its growth , all must allow . Some very intelligent persons earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . However that may be - the author would choose to exemplify rather than contradict it - it is certain that the example , which to us is illustrious in all things , is an eminent instance in point . All know the mother of Washington . Fisher Ames , also , had a distinguished mother , and Mrs Adams , the mother of our present chief magistrate , was remarkable /z/ for strong powers of raiod . Would that all intelligent mothers and intelligent fathers had such sons ! * The parents of Mr Holley were both strongly marked , but had very different and peculiar traits . The father , who had blue eyes and fair hair and a remarkably spare person , was uncommonly quick in his perceptions , and equally rapid in action . He had an intuitive perception of what was just and right , and pursued the dictates of his principles with an undeviating step . He was ardent , intrepid , and kind ; commanding , at once and uniformly , affection and respect . In no case , though he had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lukewarmness .

It is a curious fact , and perhaps not unworthy of a passing remark , that their different features and characteris- * * From number of facts , a few of which we shall select for the purpose of illustration , it will appear remarkably striking , that such an inheritance is more generally derived from the maternal than the paternal side . In the examples to be adduced , a selection has been made with a view to the diflerent varieties of mental superiority , and the following comprehends philosophers , poets , historians , and orators : - * Lord Bacok. - His mother was daughter to Sir Anthony Cooke . She was skilled in many languages , and translated and wrote several works , which displayed learning , acuteness , and taste . * Hume , the historian , mentions his mother , daughter of Sir D. Falconer , President of the College of Justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , although in the prime of life , devoted herself entirely to his education . R. B. Sheridan . - Mrs Frances Sheridan was a woman of considerable abilities . It waa writing a pamphlet in bis defence , that first introduced her to Mr Sheridan , afterwards her husband . She also wrote a novel highly praised by Johnson . Schiller , the German poet - His mother was an amiable woman . She bad a strong relish for the beauties of nature , and was passionately fond of music and poetry . Schiller was her favorite child . * William Pitt . - Son of the great Lord Chatham . Goethe thus speaks of his parents ; - " I inherited from my father a certain sort of eloquence , calculated to enforce my doctrines on my auditors ; from /q/ tics were singularly and forcibly blended in all their children , they having alternately blue eyes and fair hair , black eyes and black hair . Those who had the features of the mother , bad the mind and character of the father , while , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , had the tender and less persevering character of the mother . He , whom this narrative proposes to describe , had clear and bright , yet soft and expressive black eyes . His hair , in his youth , was black , finej and silky . As he advanced in life it gradually retreated from his fair , polished forehead , until but a remnant was left upon one of the most classic heads ever displayed to view . That he inherited chiefly the mind and character of his father it is our business to prove . But first it may not be uninterestbg to show bow rich that inheritance was . tt will throw light upon the main figure of the piece to bring out that character with the distinctness and vividness it deserves . It will be delightful to the family who sprang from that good man , to have a faithful portrait of him they so sincerely loved and venerated , on the same pannel with one of themselves , who shared equally in his affection and theirs ; while my mother I derived the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and vivacity " * Lord Erskixe 's mother was a woman of superior talent and discernment ; by her advice , her son betook himself to the bar . * Thomson , the poet . - Mrs Thomson was a woman of uncommon natural endowments , possessed of every social and domestic virtue , with a warmth and vivacity of imagination scarcely inferior to her son's. * BoERHAVv 's mother acquired a knowledge of medicine not often to be found in females . * Sir Walter Scott . - His mother , Elizabeth , daughter of D. Rutherford , was a woman of great accomplishments and virtue . She had a fond taste for , and wrote poetry , which appeared in print in 1789 . ' We might further mention the mother of Marmontel , of Bonaparte , of Sir William Jones , and a host of others . But a sufficient number has been given , we think , to show , that in a great majority of cases , eminent men have derived their talents from either parent , and that it is a remarkable circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' /z/ the general reader will not be displeased with this family picture , since all can derive from it , both pleasure and instruction . Luther Holley was descended in a direct line from Edmund Halley , a celebrated English philosopher , born the 29th of October , 1556 , in St Leonard 's Parish , Shoreditch , London . His great-grandfather came from England and settled in Stratford , Connecticut , and afterwards removed to Stamford in the same State . His grandfather married a lady by the name of Waitstill Webb , and continued at Stamford until his children were grown up , when he removed to Sharon , being one of its first settlers . His second son , Johq , whose wife 's name was Sarah Lord , was the father of Luther . He lived prosperously in Sharon , until he had the misfortune to lose his house , with its contents , by fire , which , as he was a mechanic , reduced him to poverty and was a fatal blow to his ambition and energy . The following sketch of Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Horace , at his request , about a year before his death . They died within two years of each other . Having made a few remarks on the pranks and accidents of his childhood , he thus proceeds ; - ' After I had advanced towards manhood , say sixteen or seventeen , my father was ill for a number of years . My two elder brothers were of age and gone from home . It fell therefore , to my lot to carry on the farm . I worked hard during the day and at night had to go after doctors and medicine* As doctors were then scarce , I had often to go eight or nine miles , when I was so weary that I have fallen asleep on my horse and rode for miles without knowing where I was , contriving to balance , however , so as to keep my seat . This I mention to show the practice and habits at that early day . * My father continued ill for years after I was of age , but , by my own exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sisters , we lived in good style for that day , and punctually paid every demand . I worked at different places for two years , got forward , clothed myself well , and had something beforehand . But when at work upon a plough one day I cut my knee , and lay ten or twelve weeks under the care of the doctors , expecting to have my leg taken off . But on opening the swelling my knee got well , but was stiff . After the pain had ceased , and I was yet too weak to work , I concluded some other course must be fallen upon for a support . I studied hard to qualify myself to keep school . I succeeded so well that I obtained a small school the following winter , and gave so much satisfaction that I was engaged also for the next . In the course of the summer my knee became strong and I was able to labor , keeping school in the winter , as agreed upon , at a higher price . The next summer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season was bad , my crops were light , and I lost a horse which I owed for in part . I was therefore again reduced to a level with the world . * This you will say was discouraging and no time to marry . I was , notwithstanding , actually negotiating with your mother , and in the following October we were married . Soon after , I began my school and taught through thos winter , the wages enabling me to pay the residue for my dead horse , and get myself well clothed . The following spring I was applied to , by a committee from Salisbury , to keep school in that place , they having received a flattering account of my success where I had taught . I agreed for six months for seven dollars and fifty cents a month , which was then a great price . This term I fulfilled my duties so much to the satisfaction of the district , that they hired me for another year at a still higher price . I then purchased a small house in the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There Milton , yourself , and Edward were born . I continued to keep the school for three years , the salary being raised to five pounds a month , /z/ wheat being four shillings a bushel , or what was called the old way , continental money having begun to depreciate . I grew tired of keeping school , and an offer being made , I went into trade on commission , in which business I continued two years , having acquired three hundred doUars . This brought me down to nearly the close of the war . I then formed a partnership with William Davis of Sharon . We made a large purchase of goods of Richard Smith of New London , who , being in Holland , had assisted our government , m its struggle , to procure a quantity of gunpowder . For this service , the Legislature of Connecticut granted him the privilege of bringing into the country twenty or thirty thou sand dollars worth of dry goods . This purchase of Richard Smith was made late in the fall , and in the following spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . Mr Davis , discouraged , sold out for litde or nothing , and quit business . I worried through , paid Smith , and cleared something . * In June , 1783 , 1 formed a partnership with Read and Bogardus , who were large importers and lived in the city of New York . This business was carried on in the most satisfactory manner , and I continued in business alone till we moved to Redhook , on the Hudson , in 1794 . ' After continuing there one year , and giving up the plan of going into the West India trade with the same Mr Read , as had been contemplated , we moved , as you well know , to Dover , New York , from which time you will recollect the events without further detail . * Of the Dakin family I know but little . Your mother says they came from England some two or three generations back , and settled somewhere near Boston ; that her great-grandmother 's name was Swift , her grandmother 's name Deborah Johnston , her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her father became a Baptist after he was /q/ married , and that he lived at Quaker Hill . Thence be removed to what was called Phillips ' Patent , where the family were brought up . They then came to Oblong , New York , where , as you know , he lived and died at an advanced age . ' These few events of my life , though unimportant , and hastily thrown together , may be interesting to you , my som as coming from your father . ' Having followed the good man through the simple story of his early life , let us survey him at his close , in the language of that son who still lives to inherit the virtues , as well as the station in life , of such a father , and in a letter written on the occasion by the President of Transylvania University . /z/ Our father 's death is very much deplored by all classes of men . No man , occupying so exclusively a private station , and perhaps no man in any station , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His example was uncommonly salutary . His industry was almost unparalleled . His honesty and justice in all his dealings were proverbial . His sincerity and love of truth were never , perhaps , exceeded . He was temperate in everything , and strictly punctual in all his engagements . It is not his family and immediate friends alone that regret his loss , but the whole community . The poorer class of people , who were dependant upon him for small parcels of land to cultivate on shares , and whom he usually furnished with hay , pasture , wood , grain , and other necessaries , are among those who most lament his death . There is not a poor man in the neighbourhood to whom he had not been more or less a benefactor , and who does not sincerely mourn his loss . We all feel it most deeply , and every day brings to view , additional reasons why we should regret his departure so far as we are concerned here . That beautiful farm , which he so much delighted to cultivate , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already shows that he is not there ; and every succeeding year will manifest more paljpably bis absence . But to those who knew him no eulogy can add to the worth of his character . We all loved and respected him as a man of rare endowments . Few , commencing life as he did , have been so successful and so useful . ' That he lived a long life of active virtue is certain . And that he has left a bright example of the manner in which we are to perform our duties here is equally certain . That he was well prepared to enter upon the duties of a higher and infinitely more glorious state of existence , I can not doubt . If so much diligence and perseverance in the practice of all the social duties ; so much fairness and integrity ; so much honesty , justice , and liberality as he displayed in all his intercourse with his fellow men , be not acceptable to ( rod , I know not how to estimate his character . What other men made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession or ostentation . It was the every day business of his life to " do justice , love mercy , and walk humbly with his Grod . ' ' And when we consider the circumstances under winch he commenced life ; the fortitude , the industry , the perseverance , by which he overcame every obstacle to his advancement to pecuniary independence and respectability ; the complete success which he enjoyed for many years , without arrogance , and without being envied , we can not but consider him a wonderful man . He not only had no enemies , but every body was his friend . ' To this letter President Holley made the following reply . Tramylvania University AprU 16A , 1826. ' deab beother - 1 have received your melancholy letter , convejnng the afflicting intelligence of our beloved falher 's death . Although /q/ I have often reflected upon this event , and knew that the information of it would probably come upon me by surprise , in consequence of my great distance from my parents and relatives , yet I was not prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened by the tenderest recollectfons , which point primarily to him and our dear mother , and are then immediately associated with my afflicted sister and brothers . The features of our revered father 's face , and their remarkable expression of thought and integrity , are continually rising to my imagination , and render it difficult for me to conceive of him as a lifeless corpse . God 's will be done ! I am resigned ; I complain not in word or thought . The age , the virtues , the services , the entire preparation of our admirable parent , now no more , leave not a smgle deficiency in our contemplation of this sad event and its various relations . He has done all that was required by his fellow creatures or his Creator ; he has Idl his family with nothing to lament but his absence ; and has entered upon a new state of existence fully qualified for all the duties that may be assigned to him . While I reflect upon his active and useful life , his imiform integrity and benevolence , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his efficient philanthropy , his domestic and social virtues , and the numerous practical results of his labors , I enjoy a triumph of feeling that makes me , for the moment , forget his death , and that leads me along his upward ffight to bear him company in a glorious immortality . I see him , with bis venerable form and illuminated countenance , full of parental aflfection for us , and firm in conscious sincerity and worth , awaiting calmly , but with the deepest mterest , the disclosures which eternity may make to him . I want no inspiration to furnish me with additional certainty concerning his destiny . My filial affection for him , and my deep reverence for the Deity , are equalled by the faith , which elevates and delights my soul on the subject of his thorough preparation for the world to come . /z/ In regard to our dear mother , I can offer to her no better consolation than the spirit of this letter . Here she will see my love and veneration for both mj parents ; my resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goodness in the continuance of the surviver ; my recoUection of the devoted children who surround her , though I am absent ; my triumphant joy in the contemplation of the virtues of the departed ; and my satisfied reflections upon the age , the time , the manner , and the circumstances . It would be weakness and ingratitude to complain . Let natural feeling flow , while reason and religion illumine the tears that fall . *To my sister and my brothers , I would say . We are happy notwithstanding our loss ; happy in a thousand ways , in the affection of each other , in our education and principles , in the character and virtues of our parents , in our reputation and standing in Society , in the means and comforts that surround us , and in the ability which we have to take care of ourselves and do good to otiiers . God be praised for the blessings , which he has bestowed upon us ! * Your affectionate brother , Horace Holley . ' Though without the least education except what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school but five days in his life , Luther Holley was well informed , and conversed , not only sensibly , but elegantiy on aJl general subjects . He loved reading , had a sound judgment , and reasoned , as he acted , well . Good sense prevailed in all he said or did . His memory* was so retentive , that he could , at one time , repeat the whole of Paradise Lost , for whose sublime author he entertained- such a profound respect that he named his eldest son John Milton . Another favorite work of his , and which formed the principal part of his library , was a Universal History , which was abo , in all its prominent features , transferred to . his own mind . The way he accomplished so much , was , by never being a moment /q/ idle . Even when seated to rest himself after the fatigue of business or labor , he was always seen with his book , and his mind exhibited as much elasticity as if his body had experienced no weariness . Decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever lost by vacillation of purpose . Such was the native force and independence of his mind , that he could not jrield himself to sectarian views . He reverenced the great truths of religion ; was foil of practical piety ; loved to contemplate the Deity in. his works , in the history of man , and in the scriptures ; but he could never bend his reason to the narrow views of God 's providence which prevail in weaker minds . Such was Luther Holley . The good mother , whose maiden name was Sarah Dakin , was distinguished for warm and generous affections in action , and patient endurance in trial . These mark the woman . In her they went beyond her sex . For her children she was never weary in weD-doing . Her intellect , though slower than her husband 's , was firm and decided . Her education was strictly sectarian , her father being an Orthodox Baptist preacher ; a character at that day , as now , abounding in zeal , but not holding in respect , so much as in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . Her religion , which *grew with her growth and strengthened with her strength , ' maintained its influence over her through life , but not to the extmction of her benevolent and philanthropic feelings . She never could be persuaded to believe that her own child would suffer endless torments on account of a point of faith . She did not regard forms exclusively ; nor did she in doctrine pretend to infallibility , or vindicate those who did . She left ; the control of each man 's faith , where it should ever rest , with himself and his God . As she still lives to bless her children , and to weep over this humble tribute to exceUence , she will excuse being , without her knowledge , brought out from her retirement , and the introduction in this place of a letter to her son on his first leaving /z/ her maternal care . It is a true exhibition of her natural and amiable character , and shows also the filial reverence , which , amidst the wreck of many valuable papers , preserved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to you , but as olten has my mind been confused and perplexed ; and being entirely out of the habit of communicating my thoughts in this way , I have been discouraged and given it up . Yet again feeling so much mterested , I can not omit this opportunity , especially as our dear M3rron is coming away to leave you alone . I am convinced you are a good boy and have behaved with great propriety , both before you had Myron 's company , and during his stay . Yet when I consider that he is to be separated from you , it calls up a more tender solicitude . I can not but say , dear Horace , Keep up a strict watch over aU your actions , that you may end your studies with as much credit as you have begun them , and as your friends anticipate for you . We shall rejoice to have Myron at home to live again , and shall be equally happy when it is your time to return . Receive the fond wishes and affection of *YouR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the third son , was bom at Salisbury , in the county of Litchfield , and State of Connecticut , on the thirteenth of February , 1781 . He early manifested a more than usual degree of mental vivacity , and , even in childhood , gave indications of high and generous qualities . Blessed at his birth with a sound and healthfiil frame , no physical infirmities checked the expansion of his faculties . His senses were perfect ; his perceptions were quick and clear , and his memory retentive and ready . Thus qualified to learn , he was naturally fond of trjring his openmg powers ; and the acquisition of new ideas , from whatever source , was to him an enjoyment . /q/ He was placed at a common district school in the immediate neighbourhood of his father 's house , when he was little more than three years old ; and the peculiarly rapid progress which he made in the simple studies suited to his age , proved his aptitude to receive instruction , and plainly showed that his lessons were no burden to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stated task ; and to insure their attidance , the frequent exercise of parental authority is found indispensible . But the parents of Horace never had occasion to urge him to school . On the contrary , if at any time domestic convenience required his stay at home , it was a disappointment to him , and positive commands were necessary to produce compliance . The first ten years of his life passed in this way , chiefly at school or in such light labor as was suited to his years , and which , intermingled with the customary sports of childhood , served both to develope his corporeal powers , and to give a heahhiiit lone to his mind . With such faculties , and such a disposition to use them , he soon became familiar with the common rudiments of knowledge ; and as nothing further was to be acquired at a district school , he was permitted to avail himself of other modes of gratifying his active spirit . His father , in addition to the cultivation of a farm , was pretty extensively engaged in country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities of produce and merchandise , and to many errands of business from home . New York was then , as now , the ultimate market for that quarter of e country , and intercourse with it then vras , as it sdil is , carried on through the freightmg villages on the Hudson river . A drive to Redhook , or Rhinebeck , or Poughkeepsie , on a smooth road , through a cultivated and pleasant district , with a pair of good horses , under independent circumstances , and charged with business , was no repulsive empl ( yent to a boy of manly temper and enterprising spirit . It was well adapted to promote many valuable ends . It was calculated to help forward a knowledge /z/ of men and things - of the modes of business and the relative values of commodities-to throw a youth in a beneficial way upon his own resources , and to aid in giving firmness and tone to character ; and in this kind of occupation , this new school of practical education , was Horace frequently and cheerfiilly engaged , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the promptitude , accuracy , and fidelity with which he discharged his trust , always bringbg tokens of parental approbation . At about this period , his father , m pursuance of his origmal purpose of educating Horace as a merchant , sought a place for him in the city of New York . Finding , however , that a situation in a mercantile house of respectable standmg and extensnve connexions , could not be procured for him without pajring a considerable premium for the privilege , the design was relinquished , and Horace went into his father 's store , as the best means , then at hand , of furnishing him with wholesome occupation , cultivating habits of indusfty , and advancing his knowledge of business . Still , he was not exclusively devoted to this employment ; but , with those of his brothers then at home , he was occasionally on the farm and at school , and , wherever engaged , was active , faithfiil , intelligent , and efficient . As his faculties unfolded , however , and as the impulse from within gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , it became more and more obvious that intellectual pursuits attracted him the most powerfully ; and the rising desire to obtain a liberal education strengthened , until his thoughts became so engrossed with that object , his hopes and wishes so clung to it , that his father finally consented , and came to the determination to set apart for the purpose , that portion of his estate with which he had intended to set him up in business . The plan being adopted , it was speedily acted upon ; for procrastination was no part of the character of father , or son . Accordingly , in 1797 , Horace being then sixteen years old , was taken to Williamstown , in Berkshire County , Massachusetts , and placed at the academy , or preparatory school , connected /q/ with Waiiams CoDege , with the view , when the proper time should arrive , of entering him in that institution . At that early period , however , Williams College was more limited in literary means than at present . Perceiving the deficiencies of that establishment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his preparatory studies at Williamstown , he went to New Haven and was entered at Yale , as a member of the Freshman class , at the commencement of the collegiate year in 1799 . Yale was then flourishing under the auspices of its celebrated President , Dwight , whose brilliant reputation shed lustre on the institution conmiitted to his care , and whose individual fame had long before become fixed as a part of the public glory of his country . Horace now found his long cherished desire of knowledge in a way to be satisfied . He looked upon the path opened before him , and on the elevating competition which it provided , with a generous exultation ; and he pressed forward on his new career with fi-esh alacrity , and pursued it to the end with unabating intensity of purpose . His course was upward , from the beginning . On his visits home , during the vacations , as well as in his letters to his friends , he showed , by the cheerfiil tone of his mind , by the buoyancy of his hopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prized the opportunities he enjoyed , and was making good use of them ; that his honest ambition was reaping a perpetual gratification ; that he was tasting a happiness as little mixed with alloy as often falls to the lot of humanity , and that he might lawfully look forward to honorable distinction . The scenes which are exhibited within classic walls , being a kind of Freemasonry proscribed to the weaker sex , the reader can imagine them as well as the writer - if of the more favored order of creation , and initiated into those mysteries , rites , and privileges - far better . He has experienced in miniature the struggles , hopes , and despondencies , the rivalries and excitements wliich he has had afterwards to encounter in real life . /z/ I2i APPENDIX .

He has since been heard to say , that during the four years of his college life , he was never the subject of a fine , or admcmition from his tutors . Indeed , he was a favorite with them all , and with the President , the best test of talaat and application . He was also distinguished in the polite cn ? dbs of the town , whidi was then the resort of many Southern fanulies , ixioee sods or bioths were at the college and among his krijmate friends , for his elegant perscui , polished manners , and intellectiial lOonversatiMi .

' BEAR Hoauca-* ' I received your two letters with greai pleasure , and am glad to hear you are well and contited . Your first I regard as a letter of fine sentiment and good style . I think myself /q/ happy beyond the common iot of parents in regiffd to my children , each more than answering my highest expectations .

They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self separate bom the intwest of my &mily.; They only arose from 8 wish that you would spend the sum allotted to you with suitable discretion ; and that you should be habituated to calcu* lations o economy . * The other remarks grew out of a fear that you might view your fellow creatures in the common pursuits of Eie , as being less useful than they really are . But my fears of that kind are all done away . I discover too much judgment and good sense in your sentiments to admit any finther fears of that kind . * Cfo OD , iny son , and prosper . You can hardly do otherwise with your perseverance . Fear not ; my mind and warmest wishes will accompany you up the " difficult path of science , ** as you express it .

They give me pleasure as I hope your mind is duly impressed by them . What I most feel and wish , is , that you may so advance in the path of science as to be useful in your day and generation , meet the high expectations of your friends , and the approbation of your own mind . /z/ Often , Horace , have you observed that you should not be satisfied with that moderate share of knowledge that will just pass in a crowd of dull scholars ; but that it was your ambidon to do something on the theatre of life to distinguish yourself . Now is the time to prove yourself capable of securing the rewards of high and honorable efforts . ' But , well knowing that you have sufficient spirit and ambition , I shall cease to urge . I have litde time , and business calls from every quarter . Your happiness and prosperity I link with my own , looking forward with no small pleasure to the time when you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pride of your family . ' ' Salisbury March 2Ut , 1802. /z/ After several attempts whijch have been interrupted , I hope now to be able to finish and send you a letter . There would be no difficulty in writbg if I had nothing to say out of the common way . But without further preface I shall proceed to the subject which will occupy the principal part of this sheet . I have long since viewed you as possessing talents above the common level , and several pieces of your own composition , which you read when last at home , more fiilly confirmed my opinion ; yet with all your activity and good sense , I feel some degree of anxiety on your account . Are you not too much inclined to dommation , and , though honest and upright in disposition , prone to consider the common class of mankind with too little attention ? I have not time to be very particular , but would not a fair and candid investigation give you different ideas , and be of use to you in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully examine the causes by which the United States are thus rapidly increasmg in wealdi and improvement . Is it not because we are habituated to , and not ashamed of labor ? When you view the highly cultivated fields , the towns and villages , the usefid as well as the more elegant /q/ arts ; nay , when you are conveniently dressed , and comfortably fed , are you not led to say , These are the productions of labor ; and for these am I beholden to the hard hand of industry ? Why then should we not say . The laboring class , though less informed in science , and perhaps less entertaining in conversation , are yet the most meritorious citizens ? ' If we look for men most necessary in times of imminent danger , where are we better furnished than by appljring to those who are inured to hardships , like Cincmnatus and Gideon of old , the former called from the plough , the latter from the threshing floor ? General Lincoln , I am told , cultivated his farm with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a forger of iron . General Putnam , we aU know , was a laborious man , and , although rough in manner , was a good commander . Once more ; I am informed that the battle of Bennington , which first cbecked the victorious army of Burgoyne , was fought by an intrepid band of farmers . Many people think that the time is approaching when the great cities and commercial towns of the United States will be ingulfed in luxury ; and inevitable ruin must ensue , but for the yeomanry , who , scattered over the country , simple in their manners and living , bold and hardy from the habits of labor , will , it is hoped , form a wall of defence . ' ' My intention , however , in writing , is not to damp the ardor of your mind , or to discourage in you that laudable ambition , which you so handsomely and ingeniously distinguish and describe in your letter to Milton , but so to direct you that your conduct may not only be dignified , but tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance mto life , and to assist in placing a just value on every object . The most pleasmg thing in nature must be , to be able to converse with the wise , to mform the ignorant , to pity and despise the intriguing villain , and to compassionate and assist the poor and unfortunate . /z/ *Toiir mindy Horace , I think capable of ahnost any attainment . I have no fear but that it will be stored widi pleasing and useful knowledge , and with just and proper ideas of moral rectitude ; and that you will be abundantly able to make yourself agreeable to those with whom you are to associate . May you so cultivate your understanding and simplify your conduct , that , with the learned , you can be learned ; with the ignorant , useful ; with the cheerful , pleasant ; and with the poor , compasffionate . I shaU say the small degree of anxietjr I feel on your account , will be done away , and I shaD , as respects you , be witirely happy . ' Saliabury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter I am very much pleased with . I think them worthy of the highest notice . Yes , my son , bring those sentiments into operation and you will be prepared to fill any situation into which you may be called . I fiilfy agree with you , that the mind had better be overbin ' - dened than not to have employment enough , and that by exercise and exertion , not only the body , but every mental power is invigorated . I must repeat , that I not only think the sentiments of that letter exalted , but the language happfly calculated to impress them on the mind , and to make them appear beautiful , both to Christian and infidel . ' The period of a college life , to the actors in its busy scenes , is undoubtedly full of mcident . Many , perhaps , look back to that period as embracing more points of interest than any other . But , since that interest , as in most cases of intense power , is more the ofispring of the mind ardently engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of circumstances , it will occupy a brief space in this narrative . We might close it , as it is usually closed , though a contradiction in terms , with a brilliant Commencement , and by stating that Horace /z/ was adioitted to his dee of bachelor of arts in 1803 , and left college with a high reputation for talents and attainments , for expandon of mind and elevation of character . We deem it however , to advat to a few other particulars of an interesting character . The subject of our memoir , as we have seen , had answered fully the expectations of his excellent father , of his tutors msd and of the President , from whom he always received marked attention . He had gone through the various stages of his college course , acquitting himself perfectly to the satisr faction of all concerned ; was considered among the first of a large and distmguished class , in whose various associations for literary purposes , he took a leading part . He excelled in declamation and extempore speaking . Hence , in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes an envied one . His conciliating manners , his colloquial powers , together with his commanding mind , ensured to him , not only respect and attention , but universal admiration . Some of the exercises of this time still remain , which are hcmorable specimens of vigorous , refined , and elevated thinking . Among them , the product of the Junior year , is a poem of some length . They embrace , however , many popular sentiments of the day , which are now obsolete . The preservation of them shows the attachment of the heart to the things of our youth . The author of these early e &sions; preserved them with care , while the results of his matured reason and deep researches bemg , in his various migrations , considered cumbrous and tioublesome , were destroyed . He at different times committed to the flames , volumes of sermons , and essays cm various subjects , saying , as they consumed , that die whole was treasiured in his mind . But every memto of youth , with every letter of friendship or affectiixi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which q ) read over New Haven , extended also to die college . Many of the students were numbered among its subjects . It is not strange that one , of the enthu- /z/ siastic temperament we have described , should have caught its influence . His mind , equally ardent in everythmg , imbibed the spirit of the time and gave all its eloquence to divine things . The debadng clubs were changed mto meetings for religious exhortation , prayer , and other religious exercises . Hence the first impulse towards that profession which he afterwards embraced , though he was destined for the law - a profession for which the particular constitution of his mind , and his uncommon ambition , best qualified him ; and in which he would undoubtedly have distinguished himself more than in any other . With these softened feelings , during the Senior vacation , he retired to the bosom of his brother 's family , then in Poughkeepsie , on the Hudson , to prepare for the last honors of his college , being appointed to pronounce an oration . Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfitted him for the task . Pale and emaciated , he appeared before the public , and , as he ever did , carried with him the admiration , as well as the deep sympathy of the audience . It will give some idea of the excitement of the time to state , that , of this enthusiastic class , a great proportion , before parting for their distant homes , entered into a solemn engagement in writing to pray for each other at a certain hour every day - an engagement showing more of the spirit of devotion and the ardor of youth , than a knowledge of what is practicable in real life . Many of the more conscientious afterwards became absolved from the obligation with the same formality tliat it was entered upon , choosing that such an act of friendship should at least have the merit of being voluntary . Bound together by so many ties , the parting was solemn and affecting . They embraced in tears , and bade each other adieu - with many an eternal adieu ! After leaving their Alim Mater they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the course taken by that individual of the number , to whom we must now be exclusively confined , the following letter from the best of fathers will furnish some elucidation. /q/ ' Salisbury , Jtdy iSth , 1803. ' dear HORACE- * I have but a moment to write . I can , however , observe that your letters came safely , and that I have thought much of their contents . Still I am not fully prepared to give a final answer . * The advantages of going mto New York to study law , do not strike me as being very great , and the expense will be much more than in some village or small town . I should think , on the whole , it would not be best to calculate for that place . Probably some other plan may be fallen upon that will be equally advantageous and less expensive . It is not always those men who are sent to the most expensive schools , or educated in the largest cities , who are the most useful in society . Self-invention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are , in my estimation , a better foundation , than all the knowledge , without them , that can be acquired from opportunities like those you mention . After all that can be gained from such places , connexions , and studies , a man must stand or fall by a different calculation - I say , by energies origmating in his nature , called out by experience and necessity . These will render science useful , and science will give them a fine polish . But to depend on fine places , or a library of books alone , will , I believe , result in nothing but disappointment . ' But time presses , and I can give you my ideas better in conversation , or when I am less hurried . ' The son carried into execution his own plan in this case , as he had always done before . One of his strongest characteristic was the power of domg whatever he undertook to do . Having decided on a project , he went on to perform it without interrogation as to the result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him m the office of Messrs Riggs and Radcliff , New York , as a student at law . It was then his /z/ opinion , as it continued to be , that large cities furnish the greatest facilities for every liberal pursuit ; that where there is the greatest collection of men and things , the mind will be best enabled to bring into exercise its own powers . All his energies were for some months engaged in this study . But soon a reaction took place which gave a different direction to his mind , and determined his destiny for life . This change , which gave to the profession of divinity one of its brightest ornaments , and a most eloquent expositor , may be ascribed in a great measure to the influence of Dr Dwight , who , much interested in his favorite pupil , was desirous of engaging in this service so much active talent . He was proud of this son of his beloved institution ; one , who , as stated in another part of this work , was no bad example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his successful instruction . This distmguished gendeman was remarkable for the power he acquired over his pupils . It was a paternal influence . They hung upon his words with delight , and regarded his advice as law . In this trait of character , as afterwards exhibited , the pupil , perhaps , excelled his master . Wherever a son of Transylvania may be found , its lamented President will have a friend and eulogist . It was natural that so much enthusiasm , somewhat subdued by recent religious impressions , on being removed to uncongenial scenes of business and bustle , should , under a temporary disgust , readily jdeld to any plausible suggestion which promised to restore him to the scenes and friends he had left , to his favorite haunts , and to his respected preceptor . Accordmgly , m the summer of 1804 , we find Mm among the students of theology under Dr Dwight , and residing , with Mr , afterwards Professor Stewart of Andover , in the family of the venerable Dr Dana . Here he engaged in s new course widi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lively satisfaction with the late change in his destiny , could inspire . Here also he cultivated poetry , and indulged his tastes and his friendships . It was a season of /q/ peculiar interest and very important in its consequences . It was a period which formed an era in the religious opinions of the place . The doctrmes of the old divines were thought too lax , and the system of Hopkins was engrafted upon that of Calvin , and upon the ruin of some of the best men of the day . It must in justice be said of the distinguished head of Yale , that he did not go the full length of that austere system . It often happens , however , that the pupil exceeds the master in zeal , just in proportion as he lacks knowledge . This new system had for a time its influence , just as the dogmas of any school are received till better are found . The son , from the strong affection subsisting between them , very naturally endeavoured to impress upon the mind of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose force consisted in judgment rather than imagination , resisted the dogmas , while it received . and cherished the spirit . It is thus , that the novice , elated with the freshness and vividness of his impressions , would force his convictions upon the matured , the reflecting , and the dispassionate . It is thus , that the learner of rules would restore to first principles , the mind which has lost sight of them in practising results . How much has the artist to forget of the steps by which he arrived at perfection ? and how careful should the young convert be in making his own impulses the rule of another 's faith ? Some passages from the father 's letters are here given . The same goodness which breathed through all he said , will appear in the feelings they express . The same generous spirit shall still attend us , and , like the genius of Eastern fable , cheer and guide us on our way . ' The sentiments contained in your letter I have read with satisfaction . Whatever may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that faith for which you so earnestly contend , nor lose that hope which appears do be sure and steadfast . You have often mentioned in your letters in a very affecting mgnner , the interest you take m these subjects , in which /z/ I am more and more led to think lies the highway for man to walk and be happy . But I find in me , like the governor of Caesarea , a strong propensity to put off the examination of them till a more convenient season . ' Speaking of certain dogmatical and technical divines , he says ; - * Such mechanical preachers will never warm my heart , or call forth my affections . They may , however , do good to others , therefore I do not wish to find fault with them . One essential thing with me , in every part of divine worship , is , that the preacher should feel what he says , and that he be hurried on at times , with increased energy , by the warmth of his own affections . Then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive any benefit . I hope all are not like me . ' After a sermon that interested him , he says ; - ' All this was said in so forcible and affecting a manner , I was ready to say with King Agrippa , ' Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian , " and also can say , with respect to the congregation , as Milton did in another case , ' * That his words drew audience and attention Still as night and summer noontide air ! " Such reasoning has great influence on my mind , and leaves an impression like the seal on softened wax . Tonight you may read my feelings in the above sentiments . Tomorrow all may be gone forever , and other cares may occupy my whole attention . Such is the state of my mind . Wliat I gather to day may be blown away tomorrow . This I hope wiU not alarm you , as you kiyw , from long acquaintance , of what unaccountable materials my mind is compounded . ' /z/ This state of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be governed by reflection and not by impulse . After the excitement produced by exaggerated views has passed over , the judgment resumes its influence . In reference to the change of profession in 1804 , he says ; - ' Happiness , my son , is the great pursuit of all . If you found it was not to be obtained by the study and practice of the law , you were perfectly right to quit it for the study of theology . The ardent wish of my heart is , that you may be finally established in that course of life which will render you most happy , and where you will be most useful to mankind . ' The respect and affection for Dr Dwight , though there was afterwards some discrepancy of opbion , continued through life . The directness and communicativeness of Mr Holley 's mind led him to express his sentiments with more boldness than others . Hence they at first met with opposition , even from the very persons who afterwards espoused them . It is always dangerous to contradict the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done to the preceptor , whose death , so much lamented , was the occasion of two sermons in Hollis Street , in which his genius and character were exhibited in their best and strongest points of view . It has been remarked , that of the numerous pupils of that distinguished gentleman and scholar , Mr Holley was the only one that paid that tribute to his memory . The marriage of Mr Holley with the author of these pages , took place at New Haven , on the first of January , 1805 . The first six months afi ; er this event were passed under the paternal roof at Salisbury . The time of the young divine , the date of whose license preceded but a few days that of his marriage , was employed , during a severe winter in the country , in composing sermons and pursuing his theological studies . In the follong summer he repaired to New Haven , and various invitations /z/ were received by him . Much expectation was excited by a new pulpit orator , a young man whose course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect disappomted . The writer , not an unconcerned spectator of these events , recollects the deep interest which was felt on the occasion . Invitations pressed upon him , and he was not long in selecting a residence , and the selection , in a personal point of view , as often happens to the young and romantic , was made less in reference to the real wants of life , than to taste , literary ease , and rural retirement . It is sufficient to name Greenfield Hill , Fairfield , Connecticut , which once boasted as its pastor , the so often named President of Yale , who celebrated its beauties in verse , * and who retained an after influence on its destinies . The successor to his pastoral charge entered with zeal upon his new relations . He was ordained by the Western Consociation of Fairfield County , September the thirteenth , 1805 . The Society ' voted to give Mr Holley five hundred and sixty dollars per year for his services in the ministry , so long as said society and Mr Holley could agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve the union , when they should consider it no longer expedient to remain together . There never was the least disaffection between them , but after the experience of nearly three years , it was found that the salary was too small . And , though the situation was delightful , the people kind , the professional duties congenial , the tender charities of life agreeable , still a larger portion of substantial comforts was necessary to the well being of a family . These it was not in the power of so small a community to supply ; and for these , even with the best economy and discipline , the pleasures of taste could never be rendered an entire substitute . Although the eye was never wearied with contemplating the various objects m the view , a view comprehending in its wide range a great extent of that beautiftil sheet of water . Long Island Sound , with the Mahd in the distance ; while nearer Greenfield Hill , a poem by Dr Dwight . /q/ might be seen , reposing among rich fields and lawns , villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated grounds . These were at the base of the hill . Its verdant summit is crowned by the white church , with clusters of neat dwellings and gardens , and elegant mansions . It is a scene which presents new charms on each exhibition , though beheld every day , and which the writer , even at this distance of time , can not but pause to admire anew , and to indulge a feeling of tender regard for the friends whose kmdness consecrated that interesting period . Yet in the midst of this loveliness of nature , and the exercise of the holiest sentiments of man , the cares of life would intrude . Even two young persons , who had not yet lost a romantic disregard of wealth , were forced to admit that mental food alone was not sufficient . Though indulging in no wishes beyond their home , they had tastes and habits which demanded something above what was merely indispensable to subsistence . It was believed that other situations better adapted to these views , would at the same time open a wider sphere ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this parish was sought and amicably effected , as appears from the following paper , which is an extract from the records of the Consociation of the Western District of Fairfield County , dated September thirteenth , 1808 . ' Votes of the church and society concurring with Mr Holley in his application for dismission , were presented to the Consociation by committees regularly appomted . ' After an extensive and minute examination of the circumstances relative to the expediency of dismissing Mr Holley , Resolved , unanimously , that under all the circumstances die Consociation judge it expedient to dismiss Mr Holley from his pastoral and ' ministerial relations to the church and people of Greenfield , and he is dismissed accordingly . And while the Consociation regret that circumstances are such as to render it /z/ expedient to dissolve the connexion between Mr Holley and the church and people of Greenfield , and to separate from their own body a brother whom they so justly esteem , they do cheerfully declare their entire approbation of his ministerial character , and recommend him to the grace of Grod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbly praying the great head of the church to open to him a door of usefulness in building up his glorious cause and kingdom in this world . ' Again at New Haven , ever the starting place of his hopes , and freed from all engagements and every external influence , Mr Holley took a survey of the religious world , desirous of avoiding the inconvenience of again placmg himself in a situation not calculated to promote his happiness . Under the most favorable circumstances , having excellent recommendations , and what was better , a growing reputation , he determined on a journey through Massachusetts and Mame . He had , previously to leaving Greenfield , travelled through New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . He was now at maturity , and perhaps no man ever presented a finer combination of rare qualities . His mind was active , vigorous and glowing ; his person manly , graceful , and imposing ; and he had a power of eloquence which few possess , and none surpass . On recurring to his letters of this period , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings ; purposes and prospects ; we find him , October diirteenth , in Marblehead , where he remained several weeks , preaching with such success , that he was mvited by the citizens of that place to become their permanent pastor . This , however , he declined . He received also about this time invitations from Middletown , Connecticut , Albany , New York , and other places . He determined , however , against establishing himself in either . Having finished his engagement at Marblehead , he repaired to Boston , where some expectation had been excited in regard to him ; and we next find him preaching at the Old South Church , and at the /q/ Thursday Lecture , always to crowded houses . Subsequently he was engaged at the South End Church , Hollis Street , where , after several weeks of probation , he was mvited to undertake the pastoral charge . He did not hesitate to accept of a situation so eligible - a situation that not only promised , but more than realized , all that he had hoped . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy by the intelligence of the birth of a daughter , at New Haven , in his absence . The happiness he experienced on the occasion , though in the expressions of excited feeling , may be allowed to appear in his own words . ' I can not realize the joy the event has given me . I think of the mother and I think of the daughter ; and my soul is filled with gratitude . I shojidd hasten immediately home , now that I have received a call from the society here , were it not that I remember the warning you gave me some time since , not to cause you a relapse by breaking in upon you too soon and too suddenly . Yet I a extremely anxious to see you and your first gift . The era of brighter hopes seems to have commenced in our history . We were married before we obtained a setdement . That settlement proved to us a term of severe trial . We now have a daughter before a second setdement , and I trust the favorable omens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately to our friends and lead them to partake in our happiness . ' Havmg accepted the invitation fi-om the Church and Society in Hollis Street , the installation took place on the eighth of March , 1809 . This connexion continued for ten years , and perhaps no society and minister ever lived together more harmoniously - he giving to that excellent people the most entire and perfect satisiacdon , and receiving from them every demonstration of affection and esteem . It is difficult to conceive how a relation , allowed to be so mutually interesting and beneficial , /z/ could have been dissolved . But of this we must speak hereafter . It is certain that an event so deeply regretted at the time , never ceased to be lamented by both parties . Though the one is now insensible to suffering , the other still mourns , as appears from the following estract from their own records . Sunday , August I9th , 1827 . ' At a meeting of the proprietors of HoUis Street Meetinghouse , held after divine service in the afternoon , deacon Samuel May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The Hollis Street Society have heard with deep and unfeigned regret , that their late pastor , the Rev. Dr HoUey , departed this life on the thirtyfirst ultimo .

Mr Pierpont , their pastor is absent , therefore ' Vbtedj that a committee of seven be chosen to confer with him on his return , and make such arrangements as they may think will most appropriately express the feelings of this society , for the loss which not only they , but the community at large , have sustamed In the death of an individual of such high and distinguished talents . * Vbtedj that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Brown , and Henry Bass , with Joseph Lovering , Joshua Davis , Otis Everett , John D.

They learned that it is his purpose to prepare a suitable discourse on the occasion , which it is his intention to deliver on the afternoon of the next sabbath .

The followmg letter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can avail nothing , may , not unapdy , be introduced . It was never seen by Mr Holley . It arrived in New Orleans after he sailed . /z/ ' Boston , July 11 th , 1827. /z/ ' A new society having been fonned in the south part of this city , for the purpose of building a Unitarian church , by many of your friends and admirers , I take the liberty of suggesting to you the advantage you and your friends may gain by your visiting this city , during the summer . The com stone was laid this morning , and the house will probabfy be completed before the first of January . There is no one authorised to solicit you to be their pastor , nor can there be until the house is more forward ; but , from the conversation of many with whom I have consulted , you may depend on a full society of such friends as you always have had every reason to expect to find in Southenders . ' Personally I regret bebg obliged to address you anonymously . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be known that I had solicited your return . But , as there is a society fonned , with every prospect of its being a full and respectable one , there can be no impropriety in your visiting your old fiiends , and if they can make it for your interest to return to them , you must permit me to say I hope it will conduce to your happiness , as it certiunly will , and greatly , to the benefit of your very many smcerely affectionate and devoted Boston friends . ' It is not the intention of this narrative to enter the angry field of controversy . But some few remarks are necessary in relation to a supposed change of religious opinions about this time , as if Mr HoUey had accommodated his principles to his ambition . There was , in fact , no sudden change ; it was the gradual progress of an inquiring mind , under favoring circumstances . In attempting a defence , if a defence for honest researches , and legitimate convictions be necessary , we set out with stating our belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no crime , and that every mind should be itee to receive superior light ; that dogmas are not the criterion of /q/ excellence , and that those q ) inions are best , which produce the best results . Mr HoUey , as we have seen , was educated at Yale College , and received his religious impressions there , imbibbg the principles of the Connecticut school , with all its peculiarities , at a time of unusual excitement , and when his own mind was particularly enthusiastic . He received the Calvinistic system when to controvert it was a crime . That faith was considered the only true faith , and any modification of it , which did not , like that of Hopkins , render it still more austere , was thought sufficient to consign its author to everlasting punishment . It did , in fact , destroy him here , but it is grateful to reflect , that God , not man , rules hereafter . For die young student eager for divine ihmgs no choice was left . He had no opportunity for fair examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely , ' Do you believe the scriptures , ' but , * Do you believe the prevalent system , which is the only road to heaven ? ' It is no wonder that one of a liberal mind , which revolts at injustice and absurdity , should struggle hard in the conflict . He can not , in all cases , nor for a very long time , subdue entirely every natural feeling and generous sentiment . He will at length become disgusted with systems , break out from the rules of the schools , trust to his own powers , look with his own eyes , and think his avm thoughts . Dissatisfied with such ex parte testimony , he will examme the whole ground of debate . He will see God as a kind , indulgent father , not as a merciless tyrant . He will feel m devoticxi a pure , holy , and benevolent sentiment , which is to regulate the acticMis , as well as to direct the heart to God . He will see in the impulses of fanaticism , passion forced out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tending , like all excess , to no permanent good . From views deemed by many derogatory to Grod and his gpvemment , Mr HoUey was soon emancipated . His mind , lye the natural organ of vision , readily adapted itsetf to a more /z/ extended range of observation . He did not shut bis eyes to the more expanded view . Arrived m Boston , where all subjects were freely discussed , where truth , not the interests of a sect , was sought for , mixing with the clergy of every denomination and mode of faith , learned and eloquent , and disposed to draw him into debate - a kind of warfare for which he had a taste as well as talent - his mind unfolded to a more extended view of Christiani . He saw that though one set of opinions might be right , another , in many respects difierent , need not of necessity be wholly wrong - they might agree in Amdamentals - and that religion does not consist so much in thinking as in feeling and actmg . He believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises a moral government over them ; that they are bound to worship him ; and that they wiU be happy or miserable in every stage of their existence , according to the state of their affections and conduct . He believed the scriptures to be the rule of faith , but allowed of a variety of interpretation . As they were written for all nations , all climates , and all circumstances , and adapted to each , they could not justly be circumscribed by the peculiar interpretation of any man , or set of men ; of a single church , village , or state . He was , probably , led to examine the subject sooner , by the exaggerated accounts which he had received of the opinions , manners , and morals , of those of the Boston clergy , who were called liberal , that epithet being used as synonymous with licentious . They were represented as intriguing and worldly , and as being neither religious nor moral . On becoming acquainted with their true character , he found them differing from the Orthodox , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much learning , more simplicity of character , more mdependence , and more kindness . If they had less of the form and show of religion , it was with quite as much of the spirit . This was , he thought , as it should be . He was not afraid of responsibility , and did not hesitate to follow out his opinions . t /q/ and defend them before the world , religion being designed , not only to fit us for another world , but to qualify us to live in this . As he never concealed anything , especially from selfish considerations , his new views of some points were sufficiently obvious , as was also a sense of the injustice manifested to his adopted brethren . In consequence , many of his former friends became either disaffected , or professed enemies . They did not , however , disturb him , or excite in him any resentment or unkmd feelings . He pursued the even tenor of his way , admired and beloved . Perhaps no preacher was more sought after , or obtained more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored to enlarge their understandings , and improve their moral condition . No man could more clearly unfold and illustrate the loveliness and value of Christianity . All who heard him acknowledged that their hearts were made better ; and it was not an expression of feeling merely - it was a conviction of the judgment . The following note to this effect , from one of his hearers , will be no unapt illustration of the sentiments of the rest . , * Permit me , dear sir , to offer you the language of my gratitude and admiration for the bright and eloquent appeal which you made to our understandings and our hearts on Sunday evening , and to assure you , that I left the church a happier and better person . A spark of that celestial fire with which you were filled , communicated to my bosom a glow , which still animates and exalts me . That Divine Being , whose perfections you so beautifiilly portrayed , seemed to diffuse through my mind a portion of its own pure spirit . ' His sermons were generaQy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but left to be filled out by the suggestions of the moment . His method of composing , or of preparing them , was as follows . His mind , being ever active , was richly stored with information on all subjects . He never forgot anything he /z/ had once learned , and he learned all things accurately and definitely . Whatever he read or saw in his walks during the week , was made tributary to his Sabbath exercises . Frequently a visit , or an accidental conversation with one of themselves , would furnish the train of thought upcm which his hearers hung with mtense interest , while its unconscious author , surprised and delighted , could easily follow in another a course of reasoning , which he could not by himself pursue . Hence these sermons were always practical , always addressed to the heart and understandmg ; and hence , in part , their power . It was his custom to enter his study on Saturday evening , and remain there until a late hour , more for the purpose of reflectkm than composition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make notes . After a few hours sleep he was again in his study , when he would suffer no interruption , either for breakfast , or from any other circumstance . This was particularly the case when there was anjrthing remarkable in the subject or the occasion . He then entered the church with his whole mind fired with his theme , and rivetted all attention for an hour or more , with scarcely a recurrence to his notes . If the evening service required a similar elSbrt , he ate no dinner . If he dined he would take a familiar subject and treat it less elaborately , as he could not so soon again excite his mind to the necessary point of ardor when it had once been suffered to cool . He preferred , however , not to be interrupted until the services of the day were finished , when his mind still dwelt with pleasure on the thoughts which had so filled and engrossed it. * It may be supposed that by so long an abstinence , and such a great and continued effort , considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social circle with his family , and two or three friends , who loved to discourse upon the strains of eloquence which had not yet died upon the ear , and whose salutary influence still warmed the heart , and excited the understanding . mmmmmmmmsmBs ; simmm /q/ Mondaj was riways devoted to parochial visits , which were used as occasions for discovering what improvement of the discourse had been made by the devoted listeners of die preceding day . This kind of intercourse suggested topics for other discourses . Persons in affliction or want were first attended to . The meanest were not neglected , all were benefited , all had lessons of instruction and pleasure . The other members of his parish had dififerent portions of the week devoted to them , and thus a new stock of materials was gathered for the coming sabbath . But let us listen to his own words on this subject , in a letter to a friend ; - ' Monday , you know , with a clergjrman , is a day more than any other in the week given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings . Sunday , being no sabbath to him , and Monday being most distant firom his returning labor , he bdulges his heart in ease , in viiating , m poetry , in thinking of fiiends , or in anything else that may giVia play to the benevolent afiecdons , and refiresfa the mind after a season of severe exertion . The force of this I feel very sisibly at this moment ; and indeed should be rather melancholy , were it not that I wish to set you an example of resolution , and have a stimulus to my spirits in the brightening prospect before us . Yesterday was a very rainy , bad day , and yet the audience was quite large , and I believe they did not go away dissatisfied . They were very attentive indeed . The text in the morning was , ' I am made all things to all men ; " and , in in the afternoon , " Which were bom , not of blood , nor of the will of man , but of God . " The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firom double-dealing , especially in a minister ; the latter , to a discussion of ( rod 's agency in changing the heart . ' His mornings were spent in intense study , for everything with him was intense , and his evenings devoted to the current litera- /z/ ture , which he read aloud to his family , and to the enjoyments of society and conversation , which were made subservient to the objects on which his mind was acting in his retirement . Thus the fruits of his studious hours were brought into society , and thus , also , society , in its turn , added its contributions to the stores of his intellect and taste . His occasional sermons were generally composed with care , and written out . Of these several remain , and may hereafter be offered to the public . The following facts will show the effect of these sermons , and the popularity of their author . They will also show his thorough knowledge of the human character , especially of the various and discrepant shades of opinion which necessarily attach to different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to turn against others the weapons they had prepared for his own annoyance ; - * The edifice , of wood , in which Mr Holley commenced his pastoral labors in Boston , was soon removed to Braintree , to make way for a more spacious and commodious brick church , adapted to the rapidly increasing congregation . The former building was put into excellent repair , and a day appointed for its re-dedication , together with the ordination of a new pastor , whose sentiments were decidedly Calvinistic . The society in Braintree invited Mr Holley to preach the dedicatory sermon , while several clergymen , whose opinions were m sympathy with those of the pastor elect , were engaged to take part in the ordination services . These gentlemen , alarmed at the celebrity of Mr Holley , and dreading the counter-influence which his preaching would exert against their own , called on him in a body , a very short time previous to the day appointed , and requested him to decline performing the service for which he was engaged . Mr Holley expressed great surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground it was made . They replied , the ground was distincdy this ; that he was not a believer in the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ , and that therefore they could not conscientiously /q/ unite in a joint service with him on that occasion . After some remarks on the difficuky , if not impossibility , of ever procuring perfect uniformity of opinion among those who engaged in the services on such occasions , Mr Holley said , " Pray , gentlemen , let me inquire if your own belief on this subject is so mutually correspondent as you imagine , and as would fairly justify you in making of me this unusual request . Does each of you firmly and unequivocaDy believe , that the being called Jesus Christ , who lived , and walked about , and ate , and drank , and died , on this earth , was verily the eternal God , the great First Cause of all things ? " On their at first hesitating to reply , he addressed himself separately to each of them , and received different answers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly prepared to answer the question ; another said he did not entirely believe m the divmity of Christ according to the terms stated by Mr Holley ; another declared , that he believed it in a certam sense ; while the fourth unhesitatingly said , " Yes , I believe that he was very God of very God . " **Very well , gentlemen , " replied Mr Holley ; " you see that your own minds are as yet far fiom agreeing on this subject , and if you will take your own time to discuss it , and let me know when you all perfectly coincide , I will then be ready to make my answer to your proposal . " They retired in silence , but they never again called upon him for a similar purpose . ' Mr Holley was not only active and distinguished m parochial duties , but in his profession generally he was eminent . Having a degree of moral courage beyond what was common , he gave his influence unhesitatingly to what he considered the cause of truth , not by forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rendering all subjects plain and intelligible , supporting his clear convictions by the clearest argument . No fears for himself , in any part of his life , ever influenced him to envelope plain and simple subjects in obscurity . The beauty /z/ and simplicity of truth he always insisted on , and maiiitaiiied that , like all loveliness , it needed not foreign To discover in what it consisted was his endeavour , and no mind was ever more sincere and direct . What he believed , he examined , felt , expressed , and acted upon . Besides his various pastoral and ministerial duties , Mr HoUey took a lively interest in the affiurs of the town . He was an active member of the School Conmiittee , and of many other useful associations ; was always at his post as a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University , and of various Uteraiy , scientific , and benevolent institutions , in aid of which he contributed not only money , but his time and his eloquioice ; and was ever associated with the foremost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in with all his might . The remaining members of these associations publicly acknowledged his services and lamented hb loss ; and there are not wanting those who still remember , with mingled sentiments of pleasure and regret , the interest he took in Ktrary and scientific enterprises of every description , and the encouragement and kindness he was ever ready to bestow on deserving young men . His colloquial powers were unrivalled . In the language of cmewhb knew and admired his rare gifts , ' He had a habit of minute observation , an extreme facility and clearness of expression , which rendered his conversation at once delightfiil and instructive . He would force the faculties of all into active service , and compel them to exertion . The only thbg that diminished the charm of his society was an uncomfortable size of inferiority , which his conversation sometimes imposed on the mind . He illustrated his subject with facility and grace , and seemed to have thought and reasoned so long and so well on everything , as to have left nothing unthought and unsaid . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , cofered all objects with its own pure and mellow lustre . ' /q/ In society bis inHuence was universal . Greeted everywhere as a man of taste , he was the . Hfe of literary conversation . He united the dignity of the divine with the urbanity of the gentleman . He WHS remarkable for promoting at once cheerfulness and thought . To the young and the aged , he was equally accessible - they were equally his admirers and friends . No person could be long in his company without feeling all the faculties of his mind set in motion . Whatever was the topic , new illustrations were drawn out . He engaged the attention of others , because their own powers were brought into action , and they were interested in their own emotions . Hence he was welcomed by all , and on all occasions . There was no dulness in his presence . His natural activity , both mental and bodily , together with his love of observation , led him to make frequent excursus , and long journeys . One of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very graphical manner , giving a lively picture of the Cascade , before it had become a place of resort . . But the most interestmg of his tours was that to Niagara Falls , in company with a few friends , which threatened for a time to have been fatal in its consequences , and to have made our story more brief , though not so melancholy , as it will shordy become . That journey being now the common course for all who travel and the facilities for travelling having so increased that a journey at this time is not so wonderful an event as it was then , and Niagara , with all the intermediate stages , having become the hackneyed theme of so many tourists , a description in this place may be dispensed with . Such incidents , however , as illustrate character , can not fail to be interesting . Besides Mr Holley , this travelling party consisted of three ladies , all actuated by eager and liberal curiosity , with minds alive to every object of interest , and regardless of fatigue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It being the year after our late war with Great Britain , and the route lying m part along the frontier among its still recent ravages , whose details were /z/ yet as fresh upon the tongue as visible in the dwellings and resources of the inhabitants , this rare qualification in ladies was very often called into exercise . Bufialo , Black Rock , Erie , Chippewa , Bridgewater , and Manchester , did not then furnish such comfortable lodgings and well spread tables ; nor the routes between them , such smooth roads and commodious conveyances , as now bid defiance to complaint or weariness , even in the most delicate , luxurious , and fastidious , whether of domestic or foreign origin . It was , moreover , very hot weather , in die month of July . The consequence was that some of the company , and among them Mr HoUey , were seized with the disease of the lakes . The state of his mind , during this critical situation , is thus described by one who was a constant witness , and through whose kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was preserved . * Mr Holley possessed uncommon energy and promptness of decision . He was also calm and self-possessed in cases of emergency and danger . Aany mstances of this occur to my recollection ; one in particular , with which , at the time , you were unacquainted , when you were both so ill at Niagara. * While sufifering with a very painful and disheartening disease , in circumstances peculiarly aggravating , and aware that his situation was critical , Mr Holley 's patience and even cheeriubess did not forsake him . With composure and resignation , he made such arrangements as would be desirable in the event of his death . He exhibited the same bright and unhesitating hope of a future life which he had before been often heard to express . His confidence in this and in the goodness and mercy of God , enabled him to look on death without dismay . He used often to say that the doctrine of immortality should be a clear and abiding principle in the mind , familiar in the season of health and prosperity , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he was himself an example of its cheering influence , at the approach of danger , upon one with whom it has /z/ /q/ long been the intimate thought , the habitual anticipation of the soul . ' That Mr Holley could consent to leave so brilliant a sphere , and one to which he was so peculiarly adapted , as that which he filled in the metropolis of New England , unless his fancy and his hopes painted still brighter scenes in the West , is hard to be understood . Such a step abnost persuades us to yield to the superstition , that there is connected with man a principle of fatalism by which each individual is led on to the accomplishment of his destiny . Whether such anticipations were realized , remains to be told by one more equal to the task . The writer can never forget the tears , and lamentations , and everlasting regrets - sad indeed in the retrospect , and still fresh in the heart . The pangs inflicted by the occurrences of that period , and the scenes which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no time or change can entirely remove . The extracts which follow , from letters written by Mr Holley in Kentucky during a tour of observation , will explain the above mystery and illustrate some remarks in another part of this volume . Lexington May 27th , 1818 . ' I wrote a hasty letter to you on the night of my arrival . I shall now be able to speak a little more in detail . ' The town and the vicinity are very handsome . The streets are broad , straight , paved , clean , and have rows of trees on each side . The houses are of brick almost universally , many of them in the midst of fields , and have a very rural and charming appearance . The taste is for low houses , generally two , sometimes even but one story high , like English cottages . This taste gives an efiect that eyes accustomed to the high buildings of an Atlantic city , where there is but litde room , are not at first pleased with . But it is a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unpleasant . The town is handsomer than I expected , and has a more comfortable and genteel aspect . It has not the pretension without the reality , that so many of the small towns have through which I have passed . ' I have taken lodgmgs at the principal hotel of the place , where I have a drawingroom to receive calls , which were yea* terday until dinner almost innumerable . It was immediately known that I had arrived , and the citizens turned out in suffix cient numbers to make their greeting as cordial as I could and to convince me that the opposition to my appomtmenthere is nothing . Eveiything is done that can be done to gratify me with the prospect before me . The committee of arrangements fix a dinner in honor of Mr Clay , conclude an invitation to me to attend it m this manner ; - They are pleased with an opportunity aflbrded of greeting you on your safe arrival in Lexr ingtcHi , and of tendering to you their sentiments of esteem and regard . " They brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is anything extraordinary , but because it will aid you to enter at once into my situaticn and circumstances , and will produce a distinct impression . In die afternoon I walked about town witii Mr Clay , and called at a few charming houses . I visited also the Athenaeum , an institution not yet furnished with many books , but well supplied with newspapers , and die best periodicals . I find everything of this sort , which is valuable , from Boston and the other Adantie cities . * This morning I breakfasted at Mr Clay 's , who lives a mile and a half from town . He arrived here only three days before me . Ashland is a very pleasant place , handsomer than I anticipated . The grounds are beautifiil , the lawns and walks exteninve , the shrubbery luxuriant , and the garden well suppGed . The native forest of ash in the rear adds a charming to the whole . After breakfast Mr Clay rode in with me , and we went with the trustees , by appointment , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all coUeeted in the largest hall to receive us . I made a short address , which was received /q/ ki a kind matmer . I was then conducted to the library , the apparatus , and the recitation rooms The library is small , and die apparatus smaller . There is no regular division of students into classes as in other colleges , and but few laws . Everything is to be done , and so much the better , as nothmg is to be reformed . Ahnost the whole is proposed to be left to me to arrange . I am now making all necessary inquiries , and a meeting of the trustees is to be called next week . * After this visit , I went with a party of ladies and gentlemen , nine miles into the country to the seat of Colonel Mead , where we dined and passed the day . This gentleman , who is near seventy , is a Virginian of the old school . He has been a good deal in England , in his youth , and brought home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great republican in politics . He and his wife dress in the costume of the olden time . He has the square coat and great cuf &,; the vest of the court , short breeches , and white stockings , at all times . Mrs Mead has the long waist , the white apron , the stays , the ruffled about the elbows , and the cap of half a century ago . She is very mild and ladylike , and though between sixty and seventy , plays upon the piano-forte with the facility and cheerfulness of a young lady . Her husband resembles Colonel Pickering in the face , and the shape of the head . He is entirely a man of leisure , never having followed any business , and never using his fortune but in adorning his place and entertaining his friends and strangers . No word is ever sent to him that company is coming . To do so offends him . But a dinner - he dines at the hour of four - is always ready for visiters ; and servants are always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without warning , and were entertained luxuriously on the viands of the country . Our drink consisted of beer , toddy , and water . Wine , being imported and expensive , he never gives ; nor does he allow cigars to be smoked in his presence . His house consists of a cluster of rustic cottages , in front of which spreads a beautifal , sbping lawn , as smooth as velvet . From this diverge , /z/ in various directions , and forming vistas termmated by picturesque objects , groves and walks extending over some acres . Seats , Chinese temples , verdant banks , and alcoves are interspersed at convenient distances . The lake , over which presides a Grecian temple , that you may imagine to be the residence of the water nymphs , has in it a small island , which communicates with the shore by a white bridge of one arch . The whole is surrounded by a low rustic fence of stone , surmounted and almost hidden by honeysuckle and roses , now m fall flower , and which we gathered in abundance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasure . His farm he rents , and does nothing for profit . The whole is in rustic taste . You enter from the road , through a gate between rude and massive colunms , a field without pretension , wind a considerable distance through a noble park to an inner gate , the capitals to whose pillars are unique , being formed of the roots of trees , carved by nature . Then the rich scene of cultivation , of verdure and flower-capped hedges , bursts upon you . There is no establishment like this in our country . Instead of a description , I might have given you its name , " Chaumiire du Prairies J /z/ ' This mommg many more of the citizens of Lexington have called on me . Among them were a Presbyterian , a Baptist , and a Methodist clergyman . The Rev. Mr Ward , of the Episcopal church , has asked me to preach in his pulpit , and the Methodist minister has also invited me to preach in his . The Presbyterian clergjrman has been one of my chief opposers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will take in regard to me and the University . No opposition as yet manifests itself . At present all is harmony . *I am now in one of the most important and responsible periods of my life . All my judgment and all my disinterestedness are put in requisition . I am to hear all opinions , to contemplate all prospects and alternatives , to reconcile all sects , to unite duty and expediency , to adapt myself to little minds with /q/ their prejudices , and to hold my march with great mmds and their comprehensive objects ; to look at Boston , and to examine and understand Kentucky . I am cool and calm , but I have enough to craze a nervous man . My nerves , however , are yet firm , and my career produces no vertigo . I wish much to be with you , but that is impossible . I can not now balk an enterprise into which I am so far entered , which has cost me so much time and money , which is connected with so many sacrifices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be glorious in success , or painful in defeat . I must on to the end of it . * ib * * it * Monday afternoon I went with some gentlemen of this town to Versailles , twelve miles from Lexington . The Circuit Court was sitting , and I became acquainted with the Judge , the Attorney Genera , and many other gentlemen , lawyers , merchants , J f.n i. fte W , y of . c* , . i . State . My object , yf ) u know , is to learn the opinions and feelings of the considerable people of Kentucky , concerning the University . All these persons are friendly to the institution , and give me good reason to believe they will cooperate with me in building it up . Versailles is a pleasant village , the shire town of Woodford County , well built , with fine land about it . ' From this place we went , next morning , fourteen miles , to Frankfort to breakfast . Frankfort is the capital of the State , though a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is in a deep basin . It was sportively compared by Mr Poletica , the Russian Minister , to a city in a hat crown . It is well built , and the prmcipal street is paved . The Kentucky runs through it , and the banks are very high . Beautiful marble is dug on the shores , and wrought in the Penitentiary . The Court of Appeals is sittmg , and Judge Todd , of the United States Court , is also holding a session there . After breakfast I took a room at the public house , and was not able to leave it till after dinner , it being known that I was there . The judges , iaK. /z/ with many other gentlemen , caUed on me . I conversed with them all on the subject of the college , and found the same harmony of sentiment , and the same promise of cooperation wUch I found at Lexington . In the afternoon I called on Governor Slaughter , and found him gomg to church with three of the Baptist clergymai of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kentucky , and it was his lecture . He immediately ads:ed me to preach it for him , which I of course declined , as the meeting was called for him . Tlie Governor is a Baptist . I went with them , and , by Mr Vardeman 's request , sat in the pulpit . When he had finished his discourse , he turned to me and asked me to close the services , which I did , and made a number of remarks upon the principal points of his sermon , bearing my testimony to their impcnrtance , and urging a regard to the principles of morality and piety . I offered a prayer after my remarks . We aU then returned to the Governor 's house . Mr Vardeman was pleased , and promised me his support of the college , and said 4ie believed his sect would generally support it . The Governor has prcmused me to recommend it very strongly to the next Legislature for patronage , if I accept of the presidency , and has asked me to make any suggestions to him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded that the Baptists will come in . I met afterward the Presbyterian clergyman of the place , and had some conversation with him on the subject that now engses me entirely . * * * ik ' The trustees meet tomorrow , and some will be taken preparatory to my decision . As soon as that is made , I shall let you know it . It will probably be necessary to decide before I leave the State ; at least , necessary on account of good policy in regard to the interests of the University . The importance of the position has advanced in ny mind in proportion to my inquiries and knowledge of the state of the country If I decide before I leave Kentucky , I shall write to the parisii im- /z/ /q/ metfiafeely . I slmll keep them in suspense not a moment after my own suspense is past . *On Saturday the Trustees of Transykania met , and I appeared before them and addressed them . All parties harmonized , and every vote passed unimimoudy . The Board adjourned kac three weeks to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three towns of consequence m the mean time , and shall then make up my mind . The salary was fixed permanency at three thousand dollars . This salary is liberal , and is offered with earnestness and unanimity . It is to commence the moment I accept of the appointment , although I shall not return from Boston until November or December , if I choose to accept the office . The fees for diplomas are in addition to the salary . I am left at perfect liberty to take such part of the instruction as I like , and to model the institution at my discretion . /z/ * Yesterday morning I attended church with Dr Fishback , a Baptist minister . He asked me into the pulpit with him , and when his sermon was ended , he requested me to close the service . I did so , and made a number of remarks as I had done at Frankfort . The effect was favorable , and the Baptists are manifesting their kindness toward the college as it is expected to be under my care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , is the daughter of a Baptist clergyman . At five in the afternoon I preached in the Episcopal church to an immense audience , that filled not only the seats , but the aisles . I took up the trinity and gave them all the theories , proving that the doctrine of one God , is , and has been , the doctrine of Christians by a great majority in all ages . I have not heard that any were alarmed , but all the Orthodox appear to be satisfied with my views , and that they may cooperate with Persons came fixrni the neighbouring towns , eager to learn whether I am a heredc or not . As I am no heretic , they went /z/ away satisfied , I hope , of the truth . You know I said , in Boston , that my views of the trinity would be the most popular of any in our country , when they were explamed to the public iuUy . This I have found to be true thus far , and am more perfectly convinced of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to preach for the minister of the Associate Reformed church , the same with that to which Dr Mason , of New York , belongs . He called upon me this morning and told me what he had done . In consequence of my bemg at the head of the university , and thus , in some measure , at the fountainhead of all the churches in the State , he told his people that an exception to their general rule ought to be made in my favor , and that I might be invited to preach in their church , although no one out of their order had ever been permitted to clo so . The session voted to ask me unanimously , after a week 's deliberation . Thus I am to preach in a pulpit where not even an English Presbyterian woidd be allowed to enter . Belonging to no sect is of some advantage , notwithstanding it was intended by so many that I should stand alone . All things go on well in regard to the college , public sentiment is becoming very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightening for my enterprise . /z/ * The climate here is delightful , the days fair , and the nights cool . I am very little exhausted by my labors . My health has not been of a firmer character for years . Yesterday , however , we had a warm rain , the church was crowded , and my long sermon , delivered extemporaneously , fatigued me considerably . I preached in one of the Presbyterian churches , Mr McChord 's , by the mvitation of the elders pf the session , the minister himself doubting whether he ought to invite me , but consenting to the invitation unanimously given by the elders . The popular impulse upon this subject , forces the ministers along , and the houses of worship are all opening their doors to me . Your presentiments are gloomy ; mine are full of life . /q/ action , and hope . The same good Providence which has hitherto buoyed me , buoys me up still , and I push for my mark almost sure of making the very centre of my object . My purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I shall be impartial and disinterested in the decision that I make . My feelings say at once , and widiout any drawback , " Stay in Boston ; " but duty and extent of usefulness say , " Consider Kentucky well before you abandon it , and look forward to the minds that you may form , and the good that you may do . " I have not yet determined , nor will I , until I get at the very core of public sentiment , and see clearly the prospect before me. * 4fr - Jf * * ' The proofs of cordial cooperation are multipl ) dng . I have been over the new college building , which is large and commodious . The field is very large before me , and letters have been received in town giving information that two hundred students are ready to come here if I accept of the appointment . Rev. Mr McChord , who has been an opposer , and who made a speech against me in the Board of Overseers formerly , who was a trustee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this morning . He took me by the hand and assured me that he is no longer au opposer , and that I may be assured that he will no longer take a part against me . He seems to be my fiiend , and I believe him sincere . The importance of this appointment rises in my estimation every day . There is reason to hope that I can unite the sects and the parties in favor of the college , and push it up very high . My present impressions are more strong toward an acceptance than they have ever been . I am greatly impressed with the idea that it is my duty to come here , and that more students can be got here than at any college in the United States . My mind is now loaded with this subject , and I do not go to sleep easily . * Dinners are made nearly every day for me , and there is a party ahnost every evening . But attentions of this sort , however agreeable , and however flattering to my self-love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the question with a tstelfy- different set of associations , and am governed by consideratioiis which are capable of a clear definition and a distinct weiglu . The road which I am now pursuing , is the most direct aae to usefcd power , to honorable fame , to the attainment of public confidence , and to the full application of aU my faculties . You will not only be contented in Lexington , but you will be pleased and delighted* I love society as much as you do - an affirmatioa you will well understand - and I am as litde likely to be fond of solitude and obscurity . If I were not well convinced that we should be happy in Kentucky , I would not come . But we shall be . We shall be more independent than we have ever been , and modes of influence will be opened to us , , which we could not enjoy at the head of a parish merely , in any coun*-try . It is much better to be a rall3dng pomt for all the sects , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . But no sect in this country can swallow up the others . They must continue to check and balance each other , and leave to wise men an opportunity for full and safe inquiry . * You may make your power and effirts very valuable , and most extensively useful in various ways . Our house will be a place of resort for persons of die best mind m the region , for the students of most promising talents , for the professors , for resident graduates whom we may wish to encourage , for strangers of distinction , and for all who shall have any claims to literature , re &iement,; manners , music , and accomplishment . The materials here , as Mr King observed , are in a very plastic state , and can be moulded into the most beautiful forms . The basis of character by nature is excellent . The metal is good , and will take any shape that a skilful artist will give it . All the ambition and ardor are here that are necessary to carry mind to any degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sentiment and operation that nothing could secure but that real and permanent Catholicism in religion and politics , which I cherish , and which you know I have been a good while ob /z/ taining and canfirming . I belong to no set of prejudices , or obstinate and silly peculiarities ; and for this very good reason , that I have trjed them all , and found them nonsense , by experience . I shall take , or rather shall continue , for I have already taken , Ae high ground which is most agreeable to my philosophy , an elevation entirely above local and sectarian feelings and views , and one that carries me on in a more pure and elastic atmosphere , and allows me to look down upon the competition of parties , not with contempt or hatred , but with good nature , with a very useful common sense , and with calmness and bold* ness enough to use the whole for the common good . My philosophy and Catholicism are too deep , and have grown out of too much reflection , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I formed in early life , does me essential service now , and enables me to avoid all trouble with the technical theologians with whom I meet . You know that metaphysics with me have long been modified by commoii sense and sentiment , and I now keep up the art of disputation for the real uses which it lends me in favor of genuine catholicism . * I write thus to you , because you will want to know the manner in which my mind views this subject , and how I expect to make myself useful and successful in the midst of such heterogeneous minds and mterests . The single fact that I am of no party , is of the greatest service to me. /z/ * Yesterday I preached to an overflowbg house at the Scotch Presbyterian church . My sermon was on heaven , such as you have heard from me in Boston . This is a prodigious stretch of liberality on the part of the minister and his people , who have been proverbial fot the rigor of their notions con* coming christian connexions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era in the town , and the good old gentleman , the clerg3rman , showed me some anonymous letters which he had received concerning it . But he is firm in his conrsei and /z/ declares himself my friend , and the friend of the college at all hazards . * The two great divisions of the Baptists have both invited me to preach for them , and will both support the college . They will send their children , and consent to appropriations of money by the Legislature . All things continue to go on well , and there can be no doubt that it is my duty as a philanthropist to accept of the station which is offered to me here . I believe it is in my power to do more good in this region than in any other at this moment . My life has not been half so useful in Boston , though it has been of some value there , as I am persuaded it will be in Lexington . I love the parish of Hollis Street without limits , and the more earnestly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated me well , and have always done nobly , and are as good a parish as can be found in the world . I shall have a long and interesting story to tell them when I get home ; a story in which I know they will see objects as I do , and acknowledge the propriety of my decision . For the sole purpose of doing good , I had rather be at the head of this institution than at the head of any Eastern college . The field is wider , the harvest more abundant , and the grain of a most excellent quality . I may become what you call a martyr , but it is not my intention to be one . I shall make a sacrifice in many things , but I shall do my duty , and if I meet with success it will be glorious . I ain not about to bury myself , nor take my talents , humble as they are , from an active and conspicuous sphere . This whole Western country is to feed my seminary , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets , orators , and savans , who will make the nation feel them . It is a great opening , and I should be pusillanimous to shrink from it , on account of the sacrifices I shall make in the refinements of society , and the breaking up of connexions , however dear to my heart . The course I am pursuing is a high and honorable one , entirely above the region of the clouds and storms of sects , and in a clear and pure day . I breathe an /z/ atmosphere more agreeable to me in the large view that I take , than I have breathed before . I am now in an enterprise adapted to my character and my ambition . There is enough of hazard , of eflFort , of difficulty , and of height , to excite and occupy all the powers of my mind . I shall act upon more minds than any man on this side of the mountains , and shall reach more sympathies . My personal objects will be the objects of the community . ' A great inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my determination ? " I answer always that you will leave Boston with reluctance and pain , but that you will follow my fortunes cheerfully and perseveringly . Tam not deceived by the gala dress of Lexington , as you suggest , but understand the people pretty well for the time that I have been among them . Letters that you will receive before this , will show you some of the principles on which I accept the appointment . Neither society , nor country , nor position , nor any expectation of increased happiness , is my reason . But the field is broader ; the object higher ; the employment more full ; and the chance of honorable fame , and of extensive usefulness , better . We shall be happy enough no doubt , and we shall be more independent . The salary is large and a church is offered me with another salary if I choose to accept of it . My mind is of some importance , I hope , anywhere , but not less here than elsewhere . We shall be better provided for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have more objects here , and more excitement , * In regard to Boston you want to refresh my mind , but you need not . I know already that no place in our country is better , or handsomer , or wiser , or happier . No scenery is so beautiful . That about Lexington is inferior , though the soil is far richer . There is endless variety in the vicinity of Boston , and nothing equals it in the Union . The climate here is better , but not much . These are not the considerations which move me . My imagination is not absorbent of my judgment I am cool , but clear and decided about my course , I shall accept of the appointment . ' /z/ Mr Holley had received two invitations to become the President of Transylvania , with a considerable interval between them . The first did not much gain upon his attention . The second came with so much authority and pretension and promise and plausibility , that he was induced to listen to the proposal , and to undertake a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfactory in its results . He set off in March , stopping in Philadelphia , and m the city of Washington , where , during a visit of two weeks , he became acquainted with many distinguished characters , and where he was pronounced a model for pulpit eloquence . He took the route through Virginia , a State he knew but by reputation , and visited Richmond and Monticello . The journey was exhilarating , invigorating his health , and exciting his mind to activity and enterprise . He was all enthusiasm himself , and was received with enthusiasm by the people of Kentucky . Well prepared to enter upon a scene of duty and hazard , but anticipating no evil , he accepted of the and immediately prepared to commence his labors . It only remamed to break up his connexion in Boston , a task of no ordinary trial . He immediately informed the church and society in Hollis Street of his determination , leaving them fi-ee to settle another minister , and travelled rapidly home to make the necessary preparations for his departure with his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absence , as it had been by that of his daughter , under similar circumstances , ten years before . The baptism of this son by his own name , was one of the last ceremonies performed by him in his own church . The high-minded society , who worship there , contemplated the separation from their pastor with regret and sorrow , but they mourned in silence . Such an appeal had been made to their magnanimity , their sense of propriety and duty , that they considered tiie event as a bereavement that was to be submitted to like any other inevitable occurrence . Mr Holley drew up for them an elaborate view of his motives , plans , and hopes , which left them no objectim to make to the separation , though it was /q/ painful in the extreme to their feelings . It was like an affectionate family parting with a favorite son . Th ceremony of dismissal was passed through , and we have only to speak of the farewell discourse . To this we can not do justice . It was not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large church , which had been erected and consecrated for him , filled in every seat and every aisle , but the entrance , the steps , and even a part of the street , was crowded with people . All were in tears . That beautifiil hymn , by Miss Helen Maria Williams , Whilst thee I seek , protecting Power , ' was simg to close the service , with a force and feeling , which , to many hearts , will render it sacred forever . Private leave-takings were not less sad , but they were endured , and the President elect , and his family , with two young gentlemen , distinguished alumni of Harvard University , proceeded to Kentucky , in September . We will close this part of our brief and imperfect sketch , in the language of one whose intellectual superiority enables him to appreciate , as well as to cherish a brother 's fame , and to whose pen these pages are already much mdebted ; - My attachment to the person and memory of my brother will not be satisfied without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native attributes of his heart and mind ; those qualities , which were bom with him , as distinct from those which he acquired , and for the sake of which his relatives and friends gave him , thoroughout all his life , their love and admiration . In the words of our eldest brother in a letter to me , I may say , " Of his honesty , firankness , ingenuous ness , and magnanimity ; of his true , and proper , and high sense of honor , with every other good quality that can adorn and elevate the character of man , I need say nothing to you , who knew them as well , and felt them as strongly as I did . I consider his death as a loss , not only to his family and friends , but /z/ to the nation and to the world . I think there are very few men whose minds are so highly cultivated , so well disciplined , and so well balanced , as his was , and still fewer whose affections were so pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a cheerful , social temper , full of lively emotions and ready sympathies , docile and tractable ; and he grew up a frank , ingenuous boy , of a free and zealous spirit , and generous nature , deriving the force of his character from the warmth of his affections , not from the violence of his passions , and remarkable for the directness and sincerity of his purposes . The man was like the boy . I never knew an individual , whose character , not only in its essential elements , but even in its external form and complexion , underwent less change than his , in passing from childhood to maturity ; or whose feelings , in spite of intercourse with the world , and the misconstruction of adversaries , retained in manhood , so much of the freshness , and elasticity , and kindly tone of youth . In my soul I do not believe the man ever lived , who loved truth , in all its forms , intellectual and moral , speculative and practical , more sincerely than he did ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it spread . * The last time I saw my brother , the promising youth of whom I have spoken , was become a distmguished man . The promise had been richly iulfilled . He was strong in health , and high in honor . His name had gone throughout the land , as of one who possessed high gifts , who was endowed with power to sway the thoughts of men , and who had won the admiration of many communities ; and when I look back on his life and character , when I recall the many proofs of affection which I have received from him , the many exhibitions of his fine talents that I have witnessed ; the admiring regards that I have seen fixed on him in the full congregation - his bright image rises warm and breathing before me , and I can not realize that he is gone from the earth . ' /z/ Note B. But much more enthusiastic and engrossing , fyc. p. 13 . That the reader may have some idea of Dr Holley 's strength and acuteness , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a paper written by him , in 1820 , and published in the Western Review , entided , * The Imperfection of Language. * It is but justice , however , to remark , that the article , although an able one , is not written in the best style of the deceased . ' Although language is one of the best gifts of Heaven to man , it is inadequate to express all our conceptions and emotions . Such thoughts and feelings as arise in the ordinary intercourse of society , it enables us to communicate to each other with tolerable success , though not with absolute precision . Mutual mistakes are constantly springing from the ambiguity and insufficiency of the words , which we are compelled to use in our social transactions . It is not in the nature of language to exclude ambiguity , or to supersede the necessity of employing our faculties attentively and candidly in order to ascertain the real meanmg of discourse , in speech or in writing . It was never designed tiiat this great instrument of our improvement should be an encourager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without ambiguity , or diversity of meaning . The ideas , conveyed by words , are many or few , in proportion to the degree of literary intelligence which may be possessed by the individuals concerned . The same sentences suggest a prodigious diversity of thoughts to different readers or hearers . Sometimes a book is full of meaning to one man , and is yet a blank to another . /z/ ' Language is indeed a means of thinking , as well as of communicating thoughts ; still , we have both thoughts and feelings before we have words . It is doubtful whether language would be developed in a human creature raised in such a degree of solitude as to have no fellow being with whom to converse and sjrmpathize ; but there is no doubt that a multitude of thoughts and feelings would be developed in his mind . Things themselves would furnish conceptions and call out emotions , with which his faculties could act , and from which he could derive a great variety of results . Systematic reasoning , the abstractions necessary to classificatioD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be recorded and communicated to others , and even that the mind itself may go &r; in this kind of labor . Of sensible objects , however , we can have ideas without words , and can compare them , and perform many operations concerning them , with nothing but our unnamed conceptions . Innumerable miscellaneous thoughts and feelings pass through the mind , which are never defined by words , never reduced to a visible or audible character in language . Tlie habit of puding our thoughts and feelings into words is acquired , and does not , in its most perfect state , extend to all our conceptions and emotions . The most we can expect from words is , that they shall serve as hints , or occasions , to call out in other minds similar operations to those which are going ou in our own . The delicate and exact parts of our meaning or feeling , must be left to be gathered from expressions of a general nature , which may or may not lead our feUow creatures to the precise results that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little connexion with words , that their pleasures are enjoyed through life by such as never undertake in any way to define them . The tcxigue and the pen are limited to the dic tionary ; but sounds , colors , odors , sensations , and associations , can speak to the soul , even with rapture , where the terms of the vocabulary can say nothing . /q/ * Wc*ds e ' arbitrary signs of ideas , and of course can be of no service to him who has not learned the connexion , which is established by custom , or who has not had within himself the experience necessary to feel their power . Such words as gratitude , love , revenge , jealousy , remorse , homesickness , the loss of a parent , wife , or first-born , convey impressions , and excite emotions , which are immensely different in different minds , according to the actual experience of one , or the mere speculative knowledge of another . Under the influence of strong feeling , words are always tame , and frequently offensive . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ them with complacency . We may trace many of the disputes of the wotld to the incompetency of language to express accurately and folly the meanings of the mind . All the subjects of taste , of moral sentiment , and of religious feeling , are eminently exposed to difficulty on this account . Refined people can never agree with those who are coarse ; the pure and delicate can never be understood by the sensual and obscene ; and tender consciences can never make the hardened and seared enter into their scruples and distresses. * In their best state , words may be compared to the keys of a musical instrument with strings . If the , strings are perfect , and in harmony , a tune will be produced when the keys are properly struck ; but if the strings are imperfect either in quality or number , or are not in harmony , the keys may be struck in vain by the most skilfol hand ; no music can be produced upon them . Words bear a similar relation to the mind . If the capacities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) rds will excite them ; but if the feelings are not there , if the capacities of one mind fall far shortof those of another , if the same sort of emotions or experiences be not found in the breasts of those who wish to interchange ideas , the words must be sounds without meaning , and meet the ear in vain . The mere mathematician can not talk with the mere poet . The mere man of avarice has no medium , by which he may understand the pleasures /z/ of the man of generosity . The sectarian , who sees truth only under a given aspect in the definitions of his party , can not conceive of the propriety and excellence of the mental operations of a philosopher , who penetrates into the essence of all sects , and draws out of our common nature the principles and motives which make all the forms of religion point to the same end , and require nearly the same virtues . Many a plain and honest , but unenlightened Christian might be found , at this hour , weeping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distinguished for a successful pursuit of truth , but whose views require great enlargement of the mental vision in others , to be clearly seen in their proper character , and in all their interesting relations . The difficulty , which minds of this sort find in convering their thoughts to the weak and ignorant , is illustrated by its analogy to the parental forbearance of the Author of Nature . Even this great and good Bemg shows us that it is necessary for him , with all his wisdom and skill , to wait long , as we do with our children , for time and experience to unfold the capacities of his creatures , to enable them to understand and apply principles and discoveries , which the system is calculated to furnish . These difficulties extend , not only to the works of the Creator , but also to his word . Parents will easily assent to this , when they remember , that in their daily intercourse with their children , important and luminous explanations of the most interesting points must be deferred till the elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and be capable of being combined by words in a manner adapted to their understandings . The whole firame of nature is a book , in which sentences and discourses of exquisite beauty and perfection are written , but which time , philosophy , and virtue , can alone enable us to read and rightly mterpret . How different are the instructions , which different minds draw fi-om the same page ! The man of misanthropy or superstition sees only defects , suffermgs , or terrors , where the man of benevolence and piety finds wisdom to adore , power and goodness /q/ to trust , gratitude to warm and elevate his soul , and happiness to enjoy . The ignorant and unreflecting stop and rest upon the outward forms of material nature , while the cultivated , the scientific , and the wise , penetrate into the all-pervading spirit that animates the visible forms , and makes them speak to the intellectual beholder in the accents of heaven and the Divinity . * Although we must have within us perceptions , feelings , and experience , before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them , yet the signs and the thmgs , the words and the ideas , may have a reciprocal influence , and promote their mutual progress . The elements of an illustration by words may often exist in the mind in a miscellaneous and unconnected state , and their afiinity be too feeble , or the intellect too inactive , to bring them together , and to make them a useful and consistent whole , without foreign aid and excitement . Such a mind may be able to follow the luminous discourse of another , which is already disciplined and informed , and may thus be led to call together the scattered elements of the illustration , and to rejoice in the result with equal surprise and delight . K the strings and all the essential parts of the musical instrument are found within it , notwithstanding they may be unwound , or loosened , or transposed , or out of harmony , or in any way disordered , the skilful artist may soon arrange them , and make the keys discourse excellent music . In one respect , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connexion between words and the operations of the mind . The keys touch all the strings and produce all the sounds , which the instrument is calculated to receive and furnish ; but words reach a part only of our conceptions and emotions , while there are others still more numerous which consciousness alone can touch and enjoy . If the instrument were endowed with life and a soul , and after the keys had played their limited number of changes , could , by its own internal power , move the strings as the mind moves the nerves , and produce an infinite variety of exquisite melodies in moral sentiment , it would then afford a full and perfect illustration . /z/ ' In all the arts and sciencesi the difficulty , which arises from the imperfection of language , from its inadequateness , even in its most perfect state , to meet all the wants of the mind , is feh and acknowledged . We borrow from each other ; we go from mind to ipatter , and from matter to mind ; we range dirough all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt all modes , literal and figurative , to msdce our thoughts intelligible to others ; and , after all , we are completely understood but by a few , and by none who suppose that words are to do the whole , that language is omnipotent , and that activity and candor are not necessary m the minds of those , who read or hear , who write or explain . The moral teacher , the expounder of the principles of taste , the ablest mvestigator of the human hesd and heart , the best mterpreter of religious sentiment and hope , is compelled to resort to every variety of experience , observation , and pursuit , in order to illustrate and enforce the principles of truth , the beauties of virtuCy'the pleasures of benevolence , and the affections of the Christian . From the physician we learn , as moralists and theologians , ao speak of the hedUh and disecues of the mindj stimvianU for the phlegmatic and slothful , knitives for the irritable , and the baim of consolation for the afflicted . From the lawyer we borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or saitence of condemnation from our supreme judge . From the musician we take the tone and harmony of feeling and sentiment , or the discords of jealousy and hatred . From the natural philosopher , motive for the will , gravity for demeanour , 2Lprop for the aged and feeble , and a balance for the passicMis of all . To the painter we are indebted for the light and shade of chr acter , for richness of color and delicacy of touchy while fixm the sculptor we learn to chip and chisel the rough marble of our nature till we produce , by time and art , the finished Apollo of the moral worid . From gardening and agriculture we have drawn out an inunense vocabulary for the use of moral science . We cultivate the mind , we sow the seeds of virtue , we ingraft /q/ gcx ) d and pious sentiments , and we reap a harvest of happmess in iixejidds of benevolence . ' But with all our expedients we do not advance a step beyond those capacities of the mind which experience has unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , are an indispensable preliminary to the knowledge that language can aid in exciting . Words may be taught first , and the mind be left to apply them afterward to ideas and feelings as they are gradually evolved . But as words are arbitrary signs of ideas , and have many different applications , their definitions become exceedingly multiplied . Each word must depend upon its connexion in a sentence or discourse for its meaning in the given instance . Few words can be named , each of which has but a single meaning , or , more properly , an imchanging application , the same force at all times . In our own language , the number of modifications varies from two or three to two or three score , according to the enumeration in a standard authority. * The meanings are still more multiplied , when we consider the different countries and smaller districts where the same language is spoken . To this variety we have to add the peculiarities which grow out of sects and parties . Their watchwords , though heard without any other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with violent passicms and the whole train of party mterests among the initiated . * The study of words is the study of the operations of the mind to a certain extent , the study of the analogies by which it proceeds , the study of such of its results as it has been able to arrive at for common use . But the homonymy of language is inconceivably various , and continually mcreasing as long as it lives , and as rapidly as it becomes copious . Many words , to use a term mtroduced by Coleridge , are now completely desynonymizedy which were originally identical , or the same in /z/ the root . Literary power is gained in this manner and the ingenuity of the mind thus extends its conquests to new territories of philosophy , and gams new resources for the supply of its vocabulary . Both synonymes and homonymes enrich a a language for the purposes of the philosopher , the poet , and the orator , although they never can bring all the operations of the soul under the dominion of the dictionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the candor and mtegrity of readers and hearers . The transitive or derivative meanings of words indefinitely outnumber the primitive . Our most literal sentences constantly introduce figures , as we find whenever we enter upon the curious and ample field of etymology . Every important word is a tune with variations , and the variations , although preserving the original air , are so numerous , and lead us so far from the origbal order of notes , that great talent and a fine tact are necessary to follow out the changes and subtile analogies . ' We are not to expect fiom language a degree of precision and certainty , either when used by others or by ourselves , which , tram its nature , it evidently can not ai &rd.; Our expressions partake of the peculiarities of our modes of thinking , and are rarely viewed under precisely the same aspect in which they present themselves to our own attention . Common sense and common equity direct us to supply all the qualifications and ellipses , with which every discourse must be accompanied . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , we are always to remember that they do not precede , but follow the operations of the mind . It is enough to satisiy us of this truth , if we reflect a moment upon the manner in which children acquire ideas , and arwards get the command of language . It is manifestly contrary to the fact to suppose that the words are first , or that words excite the first connected ideas which are found in their mmds . Sensible objects first act upon the intellectual powers , and produce the first class of perceptions . Both thoughts and feelings are , for /q/ a long time , in the mind , before words are distinguished from inarticulate sounds and unmeaning cries . The testimony of deaf and dumb persons , who , in adult years , learn to write language , is , as we have had frequent occasions to know , that they had many ideas about reason , sentiment , duty , responsibility , mind , and matter , before they pbtained any knowledge of words- We see them communicate their thoughts and sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention of words . ' It is rather astonishing that any body should ascribe to words the power of creating ideas in a mind where the elements of the ideas do not exist , and where of course the means of understanding the definitions of the terms are not to be found . Definitions are offered m vain to such as have not beforehand a knowledge of the terms in which the definitions are conveyed . He who has never seen any of the simple colors , who has not had the sensations which they excite by means of the eye , can never arrive at any conception of them by the aid of language . The spirit of this observation extends to all subjects , with which words are connected . They are nothing more than instruments of acting upon materials already in the mind . They enable us to work up the materials into any shape we wish , but they create nothing . They multiply our speculative powers , and are analogous to the effects of the lever , the wheel , the screw , and the pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to accomplish , by their aid , what could not have been accomplished without it . The mechanical powers create no force , which is not in the substances employed , but make such applications of the force as multiply the effect . Words are not the creators of mind , but call it out , and furnish a lever to its powers , by which they can raise , not the material world of Archimedes , but the world of science , philosophy , and imagination . Mind however must act upon the lever , and must fiimish the fulcrum , or rather must discover where the fulcrum is placed m our nature , and must put the lever upon it . /z/ WcHrds alone , it is obvious , are as useless as the lever would be without the fiilcrum , and without the power to act upon its aH propriate end . The7 , who give up the use and employment of the mind , because they have written words to inform them of all they most wish to know , forget that even the mechanical powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guide . The screw must have some one to turn it , the wheel must have a hand to give it motion , the pulley must have an agent to draw its cords , and the inclmed plane requires a weight to be placed upon its surface before its laws can show their force . Whatever discoveries our books may contain , and however vidaaUe they may be , our minds must be kept alive , and our faculties em ployed in amassmg the knowledge , upon which the words rest for their meaning , or the discoveries are nothing to us , imd the lamguage is an unknown tongue . * Those , who rely upon words for their opinions , dispute as much with each other as those do who rely upon things . And it is a benevolent provision in nature , that nothing shall supersede the necessity of using the faculties of our minds in gaining or preserving all real knowledge , and in enjoying all the genume and lasting pleasures of moral improvement and religious sentiment . A revelation by words is of most value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who uses the capacities of his nature to make each illustrate the other . Ardculate sounds are the privileges of man above the animals around him , and language is no doubt one of the principal means of his superior improvement . Many of the intellectual powers , and of the affections too , belong to him and to them in common . Both diink and feel , but he alone can talk , read , write , abstract , gen " eralize , and improve himself , generation upon generation , and this chiefly by the aid of that wonderfiil instrument language , the worker of so many inteDectual miracles . All this praise it deserves , but still let its imperfections , its ambiguities , and its inadequateness , be fairly acknowledged , and as full a guard as possible placed agamst unnecessary errors from these sources . /q/ It is delightful to address ourselves to minds , which are so cultivated and elastic that every idea we present to them , not only is received , but rebounds , attended by a crowd of others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliver us from an intercourse with those , on whom the best and most brilliant conceptions fall like balls upon lead . We are to excite and exalt ourselves , or we shall not be permanently excited and exalted . The gods give everything to labor , and nothing to indolence . We are to multiply the power and variety of consciousness . If our minds will not take up the trains of thought , which the words of others are designed to produce , and if we will not follow them out with our own activity , we must not expect to learn much truth , or to get much wisdom and enjoyment , either from men or the gods . We must be mstruments of music , with neither defective nor broken and disordered strings , but must keep the nerves of our minds in constant harmony and elasticity , that whenever the keys of our souls are struck , they may pour forth celestial sounds .

It is applied to persons , things , and words ; to the perceptions , dispositions , speculations , designs , and practices of persons ; to the nature , connexion , dependence and mutual adaptation of things , and to the reality , the order , the circiunstances , the relations , and the influence of events . Applied to our mmds , as they contemplate objects , truth denoted the conformity of our perceptions to the objects . Applied to thtf representations we give of our perceptions to others , it denotes the conformity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of veracity . Applied to our consciences , to the moral state of our affections , to our whole character in reference to religion , it denotes puri from falsehood , sincerity , impartiality , the hatred of deception , a desire for faithful and correct information , honesty , the love of duty , fidelity and rectitude of temper both toward God and man . Applied to our conduct as a moral virtue , it denotes a voluntary conformity to acknowledged rules of action , a due regard to the rights and welfare of others , the fulfilment of our engagements , and constancy in the discharge of all our duties . These are the principal definitions of truth /z/ If we now ask for the foundation of truth , we shall find in these definitions a clear and satisfactory answer . They teach us that truth has its foundation in the fitness , proportion , agreement , and adaptation of thmgs to one another ; as means to ends , causes to effects , laws to subjects , pursuits to attainments , thoughts tp knowledge , right affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutual influence of objects , and the dependence of all upon the Supreme Head . Some have supposed this foundation to be simply the idea of justice . But justice itself is among those relations of objects to each other , which come in as a part or species under the general account of truth . I note the error for the purpose of introducing an illustration of the general account by the acknowledged maxim , that the falsehood of one is no just reason for the falsehood of another . We receive no dispensation from truth by contemplating the iniquities of our fellow men . These , on the contrary , are additional reasons for all the lovers of truth to make new and increased effirts for its restoration , preservation , and general difiusion . From this foundation of truth we learn that its nature , although complex as to relations and influences , is yet simple , uniform , and unalterable . The relations and influences are indeed so numerous that we can not conoeive of them , much less describe them . We may lawfully suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in them , from the unchanging nature of truth , the beauty of proportion , agreement , or adaptation . /z/ Error is the creature of the imagination , a fancied connexion and dependence of objects , where either the objects themselves , or the connexion and dependence are unreal and fallacious . Actions which are predicated upon error , must of course fail of their expected success ; must lead to disappointment , and must produce embarrassment , perplexity , and suflering . Ideas alone do not constitute knowledge . We may have them without number fi:om fancied objects and relations , and /q/ Still have no perceptions of truth ; none , which deserve the name of knowledge , and none which we can reduce to action , without disappointment , defeat , and pain . Wisdom springs from those ideas only , which are conformed to the objects they represent . It is often worse than folly to sport , either in speculation or practice , with ideas and names without knowledge . Truth is the friend of our happiness ; error is its enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , or the present advantages promised by the other , this must ultimately be found to be the invariable result . The qualifications attending the rule in practice , I have not time to discuss , but am satisfied that they all consist with the correctness of the rule itself . Truth is the manna rained from heaven . Falsehood is the pestilence begotten by flesh upon transgression . ' What then , my brethren , let me now ask , is the object of our existence ? Why are we endowed with such complicated percepticms , such wonderful faculties , such diversified emotions , such excitement in pursuit , and such elasticity in application ? Why are we pleased with knowledge , and offended with error ? Why is conscience at first so prompt and discriminating , and why are our hopes so exalted and alluring ? The answer is short , but momentous . It is , that we seek and enjoy trudi . ' This is the unfailing source of aU true happiness , whether firom nature or education , from feeling or mtelligence , from thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or common sense , from morals or religion . That portion of it which each man is enabled to gain , is the pearl of great price , which no fortune or talent is too liberal to purchase . Truth is the glory of God , and the happmess of heaven . Truth is the sun of the universe , and the glorious object of its adoration . Truth is the ray of redemption , which hath penetrated to earth , and directs the soul to immortality and bliss . ' Mr HoUey 's discourse on the death of Mr Buckminster is a masterly production - in conception glowing and opulent , and Igg APPENDIX . splendid in diction . A few extracts from it shall close this article . Of the deceased orator he says ; - ' His imagination was rich beyond description or comparison , and yet mellowed by the finest moral feeling and the most cultivated taste . He was ardent but not glaring , lofty but not extravagant , animated but not boisterous , free but not loose , original but not wild or eccentric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun became more mild and gemal , the arch of heaven was spread with a more delicate bluey the meadows were clothed m a fresher verdure , the fields waved with a more enchanting grace , the streams murmured in sweeter harmony , the forests rose in greater majesty , the tempest howled with increasmg terror , or the west wind breathed in softer melody . His conceptions were always filled with life and motion . He never gave us the stiff standing picture , but the living , breathing , moving figures of nature as they were reflected fix ) m the mirror of truth and taste . The simplicity of hb mtentions , and the purity of his life , kept his mind always open to the language of beauty and elegance , which the Deity everywhere sjpeaks in the works of creation . /z/ * His eloquence was original , yet chaste and classical ; splen-did , yet spontaneous and simple ; full , and yet without the appearance of labor and art . His most gorgeous discourses would fall upon the mind , not as rhetorical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsought magnificence . Others would give us as fine images , as elevated thoughts , and as lofty expressions ; but they were too obviously artificial , and too mani- ' festly an * He had a wonderfiil talent of concentrating , without the minuteness of detail , a variety of thought into a smgle expression . His sermon on the character of Christ , " Nevw man spake like this man , " I had ahnost said , was proof that the /q/ text was made for himself . It is just to say that it ranks among the first specimens of solemn , aflTectionate , interesting , instructive , persuasive , and powerful eloquence , the pulpit has known . ' For a moment I give you a brief review . Mr Buckminster 'S ' understandbg was rapid , clear , comprehensive , and marked by the soundest ultimate views ; his imagination ardent , splendid , mventive , chaste , and abounding in the richest illustration ; his taste was discriminating , cultivated , delicate without affectation , accurate without fastidiousness , and simple while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent ; for his pursuits and acquirements corrupted not , but exalted and enlarged what his Maker had bountifully given him . * His sympathies were accustomed to frequent exercise , not where they would be hackneyed and blunted by the temptations of avarice and selfishness , but where they would be fostered , refined , and ennobled , while they were consecrated- by the offices , the hopes , and the promises of religion . *His moral sensibility was unperverted by the maxims or intrigues of worldly policy . He was distinguished by an enlightened conscience , by an honest faith , and by a steady pursuit after simple truth . His mind was endowed with that humility and piety which springs not from mysticism and fear , but fix ) ra the most noble , intelligent , and affectionate views of the divine character and government . His eloquence was the combined expression of all these talents , sentiments , and motives , supported by the varieties of general and sacred literature , employed in the most holy and momentous of all concerns , the improvement and salvation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and good ; nay , no longer hope , but knowledge and fruition . ' /z/ Note E. ' Az a teacher and governor of youths fye. p. 48 . The fairest expoation of Dr HoDey 's merit , in this capacity , and , at the same time , the highest encomium that could be passed on it , would be found in a correct history of the academical department of Transylvania University . By that , as by a faithfiil mirror , would his presidential character , in all its relations , be accurately represented . By that , in a particular manner , would it be satisfactorily shown , that , as soon as it was placed under his direction , the institution rose to a usefuhess and fame , to which it had been previously an entire stranger ; that while he was permitted peacefully to guide its destinies , it continued to flourish witii increasmg vigor ; and that , without the cooperation of any other cause of marked efficiency , it sunk when persecution mduced him to leave it . Such being the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference is irresistible , that the prosperity of the school was the result of his able and faith &l; administration of it ; and its present depressed and unpromising condition , the effect of tiie loss it sustained in his resignation . Nor does this statement exhibit the entire meed of praise , for which justice to the deceased imperatively calls . All his benefactions to Transylvania and the West , in the high capacity of President and mstructer , were performed in the midst of restrictions and obstacles , proceeding from inadequate means , and insufficient aid . From this source arose numerous difficulties and embarrassments , in a conflict witii which a spirit less resolute would have delded , and by the weight of which an mtellect less vigorous and efficient would have been crushed and subdued . ' /z/ /q/ But his was not the temperament that yields without a struggle . Obstacles but roused him to higher efforts . In the tone and style of real greatness , his resolution was braced , his resources developed , and his energies manifested , in direct proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the services which he rendered , and the labors he performed , in the instruction of classes , and the general superintendence of the affairs of the institution - an amount , which , in a pamphlet published in Lexington , in 1824 , and which , in all its details , remains uncontradicted , was pronounced to be * more than double that of the labors and services of the President of any other similar institution in the United States . Nor will the assertion ever encounter contradiction ; or , if it should , it will be empty denial , unsupported by fact . In the same pamphlet , inquiry as to the truth of this assertion , and opposition to it , could it be made , were confidently invited , in the following terms . ' By individuals who have never attended to the subject , this assertion that touching the amount of labor performed by the President may be deemed hyperbolical , perhaps imfounded . But let such be assured , that , on a fair and dispassionate inquiry , they will find it within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confiding in the statement here presented , they are earnestly invited to institute such an inquiry , and judge for themselves . This is the form of comparison and trial , which , in all cases , the President and his friends are solicitous to obtain . From this they will neither shrmk , under a consciousness of deficiency or fault , nor utter a complaint of it , be the issue what it may . ' It is scarcely necessary to add , that no investigation of this point was instituted by the enemies of Dr Holley , because they loiew that it would eventuate against them ; and they were , by nature , too cunning , too deeply practised in art and manage- /z/ ment , and too deliberately bent on schemes of mischief , to engage in anything that might benefit him . It was repeatedly proclaimed , not only by the enemies by whom the President was immediately surrounded , but by officers and other persons high in station and public confidence , that large sums of money had been lavished on Transylvania , vrithout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , for such abundant munificence . No assertion was ever more groundless than this ; nor any seat of science and letters more unjustly slandered . In proportion to the fiinds bestowed on her by the State of Kentucky , Transylvania , under the administration of Dr Holley , did more , much more , in the work of education , than was ever done , in the same space of time , by any other college or university in the United States , or , it is believed , in the world . It vdll appear hereafter , that , extravagant as this assertion may perhaps be considered , it has not been made on doubtful authority . Indeed , were this a suitable occasion to enter into a fuD and severe investigation of the subject , on fair principles of profit and loss , it could be'clearly shown , that Kentucky , as a sovereign State , has never given to Transylvania a single dollar . On the contrary , she has indirectly taken from her much more than she has , in any way , returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is actually governed , controlled , and held responsible as such , she has never , as the child of the State , been made an object of pecuniary patronage . As a contrary report has been industriously circulated and very generally believed , this statement vrill , no doubt , appear to the public extraordinary , if not mcredible . But it is , notwithstanding , true ; and the people of Kentucky ought to know it . Had they a correct knowledge of it , and of the unjust treatment the University has received , m all their aggravated circumstances , it is confidently believed , that their good sense and high-toned patriotism , not to speak of their justice , magnanimity , /q/ and self-respect , would induce them to become unmediately the active and efficient patrons of the institution , and thus wipe from the Commonwealth the stain , not only of neglect , but positive wrong , and remedy the manifold evils it has produced . It is not contended that no funds have ever been given to Transylvania ; but that none have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elucidation of this subject , which , whether intentionally or not , has been deeply misrepresented , and generally misunderstood , the follovring brief exposition will be sufficient . Transylvania University is the result of the union of two anterior and minor institutions , Transylvania Seminary and the Kentucky Academy . Of these , the latter was erected and endowed exclusively by a private association , about the year 1795 ; and the former was established by Virginia , in 1780 , when Kentucky was yet but a county of that State . The funds allotted , by the parent State , for the support of the Transylvania Seminary , consisted of escheated lands within the limits of Kentucky County . Of these , twenty thousand acres were appropriated to that purpose . But no sooner was Kentucky erected into a State , than she became much more anxious to augment her population , than to promote the interests of science and letters . For this feeling her apology was , no doubt , to be found , in the dangers which presented themselves from hostile Indians , within arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people only , could those dangers be repelled , and the meditated schemes of savage massacre successfully defeated . To this regard for self-protection , which belongs alike to individuals and communities , may be added the pride of numbers constitutionally inherent in every sovereign and independent state ; and , perhaps , an honest belief , that the descent of prcerty from the possessorsof it to their kindred , wherever they may reside , is the dictate at once of justice and equity . But these considera- /z/ tions , however weighty and popular at the time , proved no diminution of the future evils they were destined to produce . Their immediate effect was the enactment of laws , by the legislature of the Commonwealth , exempting from escheat all lands , more especially military grants , to the property of which legal heirs were known to be redent in foreign countries , with a view to induce those heirs to emigrate and occupy them . Of this policy , which many of the wisest statesmen and soundest patriots condenmed and opposed , the consequence was , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semmary received but eight ; twelve thousand being thus virtually taken from her , and given to strangers . Nor , in remuneration of this , have any other lands or property been ever transferred to her . The eight thousand acres , when sold , produced the sum of thirty thousand dollars . At the same rate , the twelve thousand acres retained would have produced fortyfive thousand ; an amount , of which the Transylvania Seminary was literally deprived by the State of Kentucky . Nor did her losses from state policy termmate here . The money received from the sale of the lands was vested m stock of the Bank of Kentucky , which was so judiciously conducted , as to peld an annual dividend of ten per cent. , amounting to the sum of three thousand dollars . The charter of the bank having expired , the Legislature of the State refused to renew it . The consequence was , the suspension of dividends , and the depreciation of the stock . So extensive was the mischief which this gtate of things produced , that the Seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . This , added to fortyfive thousand , makes sixtyfive - the lowest sum of which Transylvania University was actually deprived by the State of Kentucky . It is important to remark , that when these losses were sustamed , the currency of Kentucky was perfecdy sound . /q/ Nor , for damages so fatal , has the State done aught that deserves to be considered an attempt at reparation . She has not even openly recognised the wrong committed ; nor seemed conscious of the depth of the mischief she has produced . The entire amount of her reimbursement - contribution it was not - was a little more than three thousand dollars , a bonus due to her from the Lexington Farmers and Mechanics ' Bank , which she transferred to the University ; twenty thousand dollars in Commonwealth notes , equal to ten thousand in sound currency ; a thousand dollars from duties on auctions , and eight hundred derived from fines and forfeitures in Fayette Coimty ; making a total of about fifteen thousand dollars . This deducted firom sixtyfive thousand , leaves against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a miich larger amount , which , might conscience decide , she righteously owes to Transylvania University . Of the funds received from the Commonwealth , the whole was expended in the purchase of books and philosophical apparatus , and in the extinguishment , in part , of a debt contracted in the erection of the University edifice , and the improvement of the lot on which it is situated . When all the money had been thus applied , the institution was still in debt . The lot , itself , on which the building stands , was not derived from a public source . It was presented to the University by a company of private gentlemen , liberal in spirit , and fiiendly to the promotion of science and letters . To public patronage , then , of every description - Kentucky as a State , having had no participation in it - Transylvania University is indebted for nothing more than her building and improvements , and a part of her library and philosophical apparatus , a large portion of the two latter having been derived by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix ) m the fees of the pupils who resorted to her for mstruction . It is scarcely necessary to add , that /z/ is a condition of things which does not obtain to such an extent in any other similar institution , whose history is known to us . Yet , although abandoned thus to her own resources , and compelled to struggle with misfortunes so grievous , it will hereafter appear , that , under the administration of Dr Holley , the prosperity of Transylvania was , for a time , unprecedented . So true is this , that it is not , perhaps , extravagant to assert , that , for several years , she attracted a higher degree of public attention , if she had not more of actual celebrity , than any other seat of instruction in our country . She was the admiraticHi of strangers , and the pride of the West . Foreigners of distinctionvisited Lexington , attracted by her reputation , and retired again equally surprised and delighted at what they had seen . Hence the declaration abeady made , that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did more , in a given time , in the education of youth , than any other college or university , with which we are acquainted in this , or of which records inform us in foreign , countries . But that it may the more clearly appear to what an unprecedented extent Dr HoDey contributed , by his administration , to the splendor of Transylvania , further details are necessary . In 1798 she was erected into a university , by the union of the two subordinate institutions already mentioned . From that time , for the space of twenty years , she was not more than a respectable grammar school . The course of studies pursued by her pupils was very limited , she was scarcely heard of beyond the confines of her own neighbourhood , and she sent forth into the community , within the period specified , but twentytwo of her alumni bearing the badges of her humble scholarship . Dissatisfied with a condition of the institution so feeble and unproductive , not to caU it discreditable , and so unworthy of the high mmded people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take measures to raise it to usefulness and renown . Nor were they slow in discovering the steps to be pursued . A presiding officer of distinction was wanting . /q/ The fame of Dr HoDey was already abroad , and designated him as an individual , in every way qualified to superintend the execution of an enterprise so important . He was , accordingly , in the year 1815 , elected to the presidency of the University ; but he did not , at that time , accept the appointment . In November 1817 , he was , a second time , unanimously invited to the same trust . Early in the following year he left his pastoral charge in Boston , and made a visit to Lexington , that he might , by personal examination , be more fully informed of the condition and reasonable prospects of the institution , before venturing to identify himself with it , in reputation and destiny . Havmg rendered himself , as he could not fail to do , advantageously known to the trustees and the inhabitants of the town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he signified to the Board , on the seventh of April 1818 , his acceptance of the presidency . To all the friends of literature and science , whose feelings were not perverted by some sinister motive , this event was a subject of mutual congratulation , and sincere rejoicing . Intelligence of it spread , with an electrical influence on the public mind , and almost with electric velocity , not only through Kentucky , but the States that surround her . It was hailed as the conmiencement of a new and long wished for era , in which education would shed its beams on the regions of the West awaken into life their native germs of intellect , and bring forth , in time , an abundant harvest . It was welcomed by the proudly and sensitively patriotic , as the termination of a humble dependance of the West on the East , for that degree of mental cultivation , without which no people can rise to distinction . It was regarded by all , as an earnest of the permanent introduction of sound learning and science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley of the Mississippi . All attempts to this effect , anteriorly made , had failed , because the directors of them had been comparatively feeble . But a master spirit wajs now to rule , and success , therefore . /z/ was confidently anticipated . Nor would the anticipation have proved fallacious , had it not been for the obstacles that were subsequently erected . But , when the fiinds of the institution were rendered unavailable m some sources and withdrawn in others , when enemies arrayed themselves in dark intrigue and open conflict , treason lent its secret agency , and defamation and falsehood were employed as weapons , to have commanded success would have been more than human . Opposed and assailed by such a confederacy of evils and embarrassments , nothing but defeat could be the issue . Supply the necessary means of operation , and injuries may be repaired , reverses recovered firom , and losses retrieved . But , when deserted , disarmed , and surrounded by enemies , die bravest and strongest must fall or be vanquished . When on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Richmond , in eaph of which places he spent some time , and , by forming an acquaintance with many distinguished characters , extended , not a little , his influence and repptation . This was more particularly the case in Washington , where Congress was in session . There he mingled intimately with the first men of the nation , surprised and delighted them by the brilliancy of his talents , the variety . of his attainments , and his powers in conversation , and delivered , by invitation , in the capitol and elsewhere , some of his most able and splendid discourses . A few years afterwards he made a visit to Mr Jefl ! erson , who was deeply impressed by the great compass and richness of his intellect , and often spoke of him in terms of admiration and encomium . Returning firom Lexington to Boston , he took leave of his congregation and friends , m a valedictory discourse , which , for pathos , force , and resplendent elocution , is reported to have been a model in pulpit oratory - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its effects on one of the most crowded audiences ever witnessed m the capital of New England , were magical . An enraptured listener has been heard to declare . /q/ that as the last accents of it died on his ear , when he expected to hear the orator no more , he ' ahnost fancied them to be the knell of eloquence . ' From the remembrance of those who were present on the occasion , no time will be sufficient to erase the impression it produced . In the autumn of 1818 , Dr Holley returned to Lexington with his family . In further testimony of the distinguished estimation in which he was held , and the brilliant anticipations which his presence awakened , his arrival was welcomed by an illumination of the college edifice , and other manifestations of rejoicing and hope . On the nineteenth of December , of the same year , he was solemnly inducted into the presidency , and entered immediately on the duties of his station . This act , as had been anticipated , proved a life-spring to the institution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse of a dreary winter . Roused from a condition of torpor and despondency , all was , in a short time , fresh activity and sanguine hope . Pupils came in from every quarter , until , in numbers , the institution was , in a few months , highly respectable . In the mean time , academical arrangement , discipline , and studies were introduced and enforced . The four regular college classes were formed , and exercises as high , and attainments as extensive required of each , as are usual in similar institutions in the Atlantic States . The studies of the junior and senior classes , especially mental philosophy , rhetoric , composition , and all exercises pertaining to the heUes lettresj were superintended by the President in person . And in these did the pupils particularly excel . In confirmation of this , the weekly declamation of the classes , in the chapel of the University , was regularly attended , by the most enlightened portion of the citizens of Lexington , as a source of instruction and refined amusement ; and the rhetorical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions of public commencement , constituted the admiration /z/ and delight of crowded audiences , composed of the most cultivated and fashionable inhabitants of the West . For several years , a commencement in Transylvania was the gala of the country . So flourishing , under the auspices of the recent arrangement , did the academical department of the University become . But an institution consistmg of a single department was not in harmony with the capacious views and enterprising spirit of the presiding of &cer.; His ambition was to occupy lofty ground , and act on a scale of extended usefulness - to be chief of a University , where men are educated , and professions formed not of a college composed of boys . Actuated by these feelings , he commenced , in the summer of 1819 , a project for the establishment of a medical department . In this , by his activity , zeal , and persuasive eloquence , aided by a few liberal and enterprising citizens , he proved successful . To his exertions , therefore , in a very high degree , is the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffiising extensively the science of the profession , has conferred on it reputation , and proved to it a source of incalculable benefit . Nor did his effi ) rts for the elevation and augmented usefulness of the University terminate here . A department of law was yet wanting ; and , in the measures pursued for the establishment of that , he was also successful . For a time this important branch of the institution was administered with great activity and effect . He himself not only encouraged it by his countenance , but , participating in its labors , delivered in it several courses of lectures . Nor , as presiding officer , did this constitute any portion of his official duties . It was a very burdensome task , and a deep responsibility voluntarily assumed by him , for the benefit of the University , and of professional science . None , in his situation , but an officer of the most liberal and intrepid spirit would have engaged in it ; nor would any one , but a teacher of the most capacious and richly stored intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its accomplishment . But , rising under difficulties , , and adapting his exertions to the demands of the crisis , he cheerfully encountered it , and performed it with peculiar facility and distinction . In further proof of the liberality of his spirit , and his disinterested zeal for the usefulness and glory of the institution over which he presided , he delivered three courses of instruction , in the department of law , without accepting any additional reward . In the delivery of one of these , he performed the duties of an absent professor , in friendship to him , and for the benefit of his class ; and the fees received for the other two , he threw into the treasury , as a part of the common fund of the University , when , in justice , they were his own . Yet , to the disgrace of his enemies , they were accusing him , at the time , of a mercenary disposition . Such were the labors and successes of Dr Holley , in the short period of about three years . By means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a flourishing university . Perhaps no institution of the kind ever felt so deeply the creative influence of a master spirit , or profited so extensively by his personal services . If such a case has anywhere existed , those who have a knowledge of it are invited to name it . Should any one inquire , by what means or management the President was enabled to effect so much , the correct reply can be easily given . He did much by his personal agency ; and the brilliancy of his reputation , and the weight of his character procured for him , with facility , in some of the departments , able coadjutors . The strong delight to cooperate with the strong , and even to vie with them in enterprise and acliievement . A Napoleon or a Nelson can obtain , without difficulty , as his colleagues and cooperators , the first intellects and spirits of the age . But the gifted and the high minded do not readily descend to an association with mediocrity , on equal terms ; much less can they degrade themselves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IX . station . The law of Heaven is , that intellect , and not mere delegated authority , ought to rule . Nor will the talented and the independent voluntarily submit to wanton violations of it by human appointment . Corporeally and intellectually President Holley had a commission from nature to direct and control . Nor did those who were associated with him ever find cause to question its legitimacy . His resources never proved unequal to the crisis , whatever might be the kind or amount of the difficulties that presented themselves . With all the functionaries of the institution , whose administration he superintended , no presiding officer ever preserved more perfect harmony and friendly intercourse . The fitness of his qualifications for the station he held , was surpassed only , if surpassed at all , by the courtesy of his deportment in discharging the duties of it . In confirmation of the truth of the foregoing general representation , besides challenging contradiction from the foes of the deceased , reference is again made to the pamphlet published in 1824 , by the friends of Transylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his qualifications as an executive officer , and his capability to teach the branches of science appertaining to his province , it would be superfluous to speak . In these respects , his Plenties themselves have never denied his peculiar preeminence . Nor Is he less distinguished by his devotedness to his duties than his ability to perform them . The love of instruction is his ruling passion . /z/ * Let the present controversy eventuate as it may , in relation to the fortunes of the President in the station he occupies , the period of his direction of the affidrs of the University will be always referred to as the fairest era of reform and improvement in its general administration . Nor can an institution of the kind be found either in Europe or America , that has , in so /q/ short a time , been so signally and extensively benefited by the labors of an individual , as Transylvania has been by his , within the last six years . If these assertions be unfounded , they are susceptible of refutation , and ought to be refuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as the enemies of the West , if they do not silence them . On this ground his friends will fearlessly hazard the issue of the controversy . Let time determine whether his accusers will accept the challenge . ' The condition of the academical department of the University he has eminently ameliorated in every point that can contribute , in any measure , to exalt its character and augment its usefulness . The classes in it , which had been previously irregular and defective , he has arranged according to coUegial usage ; the course of instruction he has rendered much more elevated and extensive than he found it , and the system of discipline more strict and efficient ; and by warmly attaching his pupils to his person , by his truly paternal and conciliatory government , and by awakening m them a love of science and letters , by his elegant and attractive mode of instruction , he has implanted in them desires the more ardent , and a determination the more resolute , to cultivate knowledge for its own sake , and to merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects , as far as his present means will admit , he has brought the department to an equality with the most distinguished seats of learning in the Adantic States , and , in one or two particulars , has raised it above them . Add to this , that he has infused into it a pride of character , a spirit of ambition , and a moral energy , far beyond what it formerly possessed . In its influence on ingenuous and aspiring youth , the value of this condition of things is incalculable . It gives life to emulation and success to exertion . Without it , nothing useful or great can be achieved ; with it , everything that man is destined to achieve . 4e /z/ ' Before it became the favorite foster-child of the President , Transylvania University was scarcely known beyond the linuts of Kentucky , and even within those limits had produced as yet but litde excitement . But how changed is its condition ! Now , the pride and hope of the Commonwealth , it has become an interestmg object of national attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen States of the Union . * The enemies of the President represent the government of the University as lax and inefficient , and its pupils as idle , inmioral , and dissipated . Whatever may be its origin , or the motives which have prompted it , this charge is utterly unfounded . In order , decorum , and salutary discipline , the institution may safely vie with any other of a similar character in the United States ; the correct and gentlemanly deportment of the pupils is its own highest and most substantial commendation ; and their excellent and honorable acquittal of themselves , on occasions of public examination and commencement , the best commentary on their studious habits . The character formed m college , adheres , for the most part , to the individual through life . But the youth whom Transylvania has lately graduated , are , in their respective walks , whether public or private , as moral and discreet , and , m all their transactions , as honorable and conscientious , as any others in the community . Not a few of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament to society , and becoming deservedly the hope of their country . ' If this statement be fallacious , the enemies of the existing government and administration of the University are called on to refute it . If true , they are bound in honor no less than in conscience , to acknowledge their error and revoke their accusations . It is only by the value of the products of an institution that its real efficiencies and merit can be known . If they are excellent , all denunciation of the means and measures by which they have been formed , is but empty clamor , and must recoil with confusion on its inconsiderate authors . ' /q/ That everything may be distinctly understood , it is necessary to observe , that it is to the medical department of Transylvania , that pupils have resorted from ' fifteen States of the Union . ' It is believed that the academical department did not , when m its most prosperous condition , receive pupils from more tiian six or seven States . The department of law was filled from a district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its influence over the most extensive region of our country . After a few fiirther remarks on the prosperity of Transylvania , fix ) m 1818 until 1824 , the writer of the pamphlet thus expresses himself ; - ' It is doubtful whether an increase so rapid and extensive in the dispensing of public honors , has ever before been witnessed m any seat of science and letters . The event is so extraordinary , that if this statement of it could not be authenticated by official documents , it would scarcely fail to be regarded as fabulous . In behalf of the presiding officer it speaks a language which nothing can resist . It is not extravagant to add , that since the year 1818 the Commonwealth of Kentucky has derived from Transylvania University , a greater amount of additional consideration and lustre , compared with what she previously had , than any other State in the Union has received from a similar source widiin a period of thrice the duration . Intellectual property is the most permanent , brilliant , and valuaable capital that a State can possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-fold interest . And it will not be denied that this University is an abundant source of it , not only to her parent State , but to Western America . ' The moral effect of an institution so flourishing is not confined within its own walls . It goes forth with its cAvmni in every direction , sustaining the sentiments that have been already awakened in them , elevating their views of duty and achievement , and giving strength to their aspirations , and vigor and /z/ perseverance to their professional exertions , until its influence is recognised in the improved condition of society at large . ' Such is the propitious and encouraging state of things , ivfaich is beginning to manifest itself among the people of the West . Already , to a certain extent , are the lights of Transylvania appearing , and her influence becoming perceptible , throughout the entire populated portion of the valley of the Mississippi . Nor can even prejudice deny that this is owing , in no mconsiderable degree , to the labors of her President . ' Alluding to a wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Transylvania , to procure , if possible , the removal of Dr Holley from office , the same writer agam remarks ; - * By a mere removal from place , the present presiding officer will not be forgotten . Memory will dwell , with mcreasing admiration and undiminished regret , on his many excellent and brilliant qualities , and the ordeal of comparison through which his successor must consequendy pass , will be the more appalling . Every circumstance connected with the trial being calculated to render it peculiarly perilous , it may , in truth , be added , that few individuals could safely encounter it . For it can not be concealed , that the aptitudes of the President for the statibn he holds , are as rare as they are valuable . ' If , of the ability of Dr HoUey 's adnunistralion , and his faithful superintendence of die general interests of Transylvania , during the term of his presidency , mor detailed and authentic testimony be required , it may be found in his final report to the Board of Trustees , on surrendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . That report , together with the reply of the Board , and a record of other proceedings of that body on the occasion , are here submitted to the inspection of the public . If those who were the foes and persecutors of the President can read them /z/ without a blush of shame and a pang of ranorse , the condition of their consciences and moral sentiments generally , is not to be envied* /z/ ' My term of office as President of Transylvania University , being ended by your acceptance of my resignation , and a committee of your respectable body having examined the condition of the institution , I beg leave to offer to you my final report , and in form to surrender into your hands the highly important trust with which you were pleased nearly nine years since to invest me , under circumstances that lose none of their interest by their connexion with the present . The state of the institution may be considered in the following order ; - ' The number of students for the present session . The condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cabinet . * The course of studies . ' The number of graduates from the beginning . ' Some of the wants of the University . ' I. The number of students for the present session . ' This number is 286 , constituted in the following manner : - * Medical Class , 190 /z/ ' A catalogue of the names of this number would , according to custom , have been printed in January , had not the session been divided into two for the year . It was my design to have one prmted in the course of May next , had I continued in the University . As the trustees have by a deliberate vote , returned to the old plan of one session for the year , it remains with them to determine whether a catalogue shall now be published . I have prepared one in manuscript , which is complete , and which accompanies this report . How many may be found in the classes , under present circumstances , wiD be reported to you by the academical Faculty , or by my successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency , in January 1826 , an early period of the session , the news of which spread of course among the community , and especially in the South , whence we have been accustomed to receive many pupils ; and had the gentlemen accepted the offices , to which they were appointed in the law department , upon the excellent plan of multiplymg the Professorships , for the division of labor and the greater perfection of the instruction ; we have abundant reason , in testimony of the best character from various quarts , to believe , that , notwithstandmg the increase of schools and colleges , and the pecuniary pressure of the times , our whole number would be very little , if at all less during the present session than at any former period . * n . The condition of the grounds and buildings . * Without having seen the report of the committee , I trust I may safely refer to it for evidence that these are in good order . In the whole establishment , there is not a pane of glass out ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth , and have been recently well raked ; the gates and fences are as perfect as their age will permit ; the pavements are in excellent preservation , and the refectory , with its appurtenances , is fit for immediate occupation , and is one of the most convenient and agreeable residences in town . The north and west comers are indeed sometimes penetrated by the rain /q/ and require a little attention from the housewright to remedy the evil . ' III . The libraries , apparatus , and cabinet . ' In regard to the libraries , I here present an extract from the report of the last joint committee of both houses of our Legislature , appointed to examine the University in all its departments . ' " Law , four hundred and thirty volumes ; medical , two thousand five hundred ; academical , two thousand four hundred ; total , five thousand four hundred and thirty . In addition to these , there are about one thousand in the libraries of the two college societies , and about six thousand in the town library ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which students in this place can have access , independently of the bookstores and private collections . Of the books belonging to the University , five sixths have been obtained under the present administration of the affairs of the institution , or since the year 1818 , when the Legislature took it into their more immediate protection . Besides donations , which have been numerous , books to the amount of fourteen thousand seven hundred and seventyfive dollars , in the currency of the State have been placed upon our shelves . Nearly every one of our valuable works in science and criticism is included in this number . " ' Some additions have been made to each of these libraries , since the report of the Legislative committee . The medical now contains between three thousand and four thousand volumes . The apparatus in the department of mathematics and natural philosophy has been greatly enriched , within the past year , by the importation of many valuable and important instruments from France . The Morrison Professor is preparing a complete catalogue of these , and of the instruments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your table . /z/ in my last report The cabmet of minerals , with various specimens of Indian antiquities , which was deposited in the University by the heirs of John D. Cliffi ) rd , has been sold and removed , but nearly two hundred mteresting specimens of domestic minerals have just been received , as a present , from Dr Fowler of New Jersey , and are now in our cases . * IV . The course of study . This appears , in extemo at the end of the printed catalogue which accompanies my report . It is full , and is found on experiment to be well arranged and well adapted to the state of the institution . It has been increased from time to time , until it is equal , as it is believed , to that of our oldest and best sem** inaries . The text books are generally such as are likely to continue a long time m favor . The deficiency in regard to the course of study in one particular , wiH be mentioned in another place . * V. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 666 ' Bachelors of Arts 182 ' Masters of Arts 76 ' Those who have received honorary degrees 40 ' Medical graduates on examination . . 327 ' Law graduates on examination . . . .41 ' Living , upwards of 600 ' The first degree conferred by the institution was in 1802 , sixteen years before the regeneration of the University in 1818 . In all that time only twentjtwo persons , as far as the records show , received the honors of Transylvania . Since that date , within a period of less than nine years , although the course of study has been greatly extended and the examinations rendered much more severe and exact , five hundred and fiftyeigbt alumni have sought and received academical hcMiors at our hands , and have carried with them the testimony of our signatures into every part of our community . I should be jusdy /z/ charged with insensibility if I did not state this fact with pride , and remember it with delight , while I reflect with gratitude upon your constant cooperation , and that of my able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone is , and will be considered by the candid public as a full and unanswerable reftitation of the calunmies which our enemies have invented and industriously circulated . We are satisfied with the contrast . Are they ? * VI . Some of the wants of the University . * These may be thus briefly enumerated ; the revival of the law school with increased professorships ; a professorship of modem languages , especially of the French and Spanish ; a gynmasium , with a suitable extent of ground for the requisite variety of exercises , both useful and ornamental ; a provision for the continued increase of the academical and law libraries , and the cabinet of minerals , and the foundation of a gallery , as soon as practicable , for the reception of the productions of genius in the arts of sculpture , painting , and engraving . ' In regard to the first of these wants , the revival of the law school with increased professorships , my opinion remains the same as when the subject was discussed at large before the Board . Your deliberations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a short law session at the University for public lectures , with the understanding that the mterval would be spent by the student in a law ofiice , or in legal study with some competent jurist ; to have one of the professors from Louisiana , where the civil law is adopted , and to have particular attention paid to the science of political economy and legislation . This plan has met with very general , if not with universal approbation , and has drawn forth in letters , now in my possession , the most explicit praise from a distinguished laviryer and statesman of Louisiana , and from an able and successfiil lecturer on the science of jurisprudence in Maryland . /z/ I have unquestionable evidence that very many young men are ready to enrol their names as members of the law school of Transylvania , were it revived on this plan and put into immediate operation . The importance of a professorship of modem languages , especially of the French and Spanish , has long been felt and often mentioned among yourselves . Our position in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gpvemments , and their importance to our commercial and political advancement , together with the bearing which their efforts must have upon the common cause of civil and religious liberty , all point to the propriety of attending immediately and fully to their language , while we offer suitable inducements to lead them to attend , in the same way , to ours , that we may extensively benefit each other , and both do our duty in relation to the great interests of mankind . The French is called for , not only as in an eminent degree the language of polite life , diplomacy , mathematics , physics , and modem tactics , but because it contains as valuable and various a literature as any language in the world , not excepting eveli our own . It is acknowledged by all to be indispensable to a successful and agreeable intercourse with different countries . A knowledge of it is now demanded by public opinion for an accomplished scholar , ' Grymnastics have already begun to occupy so large a space in the eyes of the iriends and patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular favor can not be arrested ; and no institution can expect to maintain a successful competition before the community , without a provision for this department of the physical formation of character . Indeed and happily physical education has advanced in importance , just in proportion to the progress of sound philosophy . It is astonishing , that more attention has not been paid to it in the systems of instruction both in England and America . Workshops , the labors of the garden and tiie field , the exercises of the circus , the tennis /q/ court , the dancing hall and fencing room , with an area for military drilling and accomplishments , besides many other modes of exertion , are naturally suggested under this head . We have always suffered for the want of an extensive play ground and of adequate motives to call out our students regularly and effectually to the vigorous and manly exercises . A suitable establishment of this kind is as favorable to good morals and to intellectual advancement as it is to the health and strength of the body . The lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been forbidden , remains in my opinion still unsuited to them , and ought to be appropriated , as it has been , to walking , conversation , reflection , and other purposes not calculated to annoy the occupants of the public or private rooms of the building . ' In reference to the libraries , we want a much greater supply of works in modern civil law and politics ; in general history , and especially the histories of our own States ; in criticism , poetry , and the arts ; in mathematics , and in general literature . Although we have many good dictionaries , there are still more and better of which we are in want . This supply is not so much for our undergraduates as for the graduated classes and the professors . * ' A gallery for the productions of genius in sculpture , painting , and engraving , is of course not suggested as an article of necessity , or of equal importance with those which have been already ennumerated , but as a department highly interesting and desirable , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will attain . It is not to be supposed that much would be done in this way , even if a depository were established ; and yet were there such an apartment , and were but moderate exertions to be made by the fnends of the institution , donations , as I have had occasion to know on other subjects , would multiply beyond the first conception of any of you ; and a collection of works would be insensibly formed that would be of the greatest service in the cultivation of taste , and the promotion of a legitimate enjoyment . /z/ It is with great respect and deference that I make these suggestions , and leave them with your better judgment , and your united wisdom . They have occupied my mind often for years , and I have continually looked forward to a period when our means would allow us to put them into execution . Our personal and local jealousies , our political contentions , and our sectarian divisions , have thus far prevented a result which all enlightened men must acknowledge to be eminently desirable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Must we , or the town , or the county provide the pecuniary means adequate to these effects ? " I frankly and decidedly answer . No . You can not do all that is required , nor the half , nor quarter , nor dxteenth . The town can do something , the county more ; but no one section of the community ought to have this burden cast upon it , and most unque'stionably no one section will assume or consent to it . This is a State institution , declared so repeatedly and solemnly by the State itself , assembled in its representatives ; and they will doubtless refuse to let it pass out of their hands . What then is the result ? Plainly tUs ; The State must endow it amply , and endow it speedily or bear the disgrace of its decline , and perhaps of its fall . Individual efforts have heretofore chiejfly maintained it , and large subscriptions have been collected from among yourselves and your neighbours . This resource is exhausted , or nearly so ; and especially the motives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commonwealth shall see its true interests in this particular , and act correspondingly , useful and successful as Transylvania has been , and to a certain extent may continue to be , it can never maintain its eminence , and continue to reflect lustre on the State , while it levies and collects contributions among its sister republics . Grentlemen , I rejoice to be able to state with truth and sincerity , that we have lived , met , and acted in harmony and in mutual confidence , for the whole time of our administration of the afiairs of the University , since my connexion widi it . You /q/ have generously and promptly sustained me in all the trials incident to my office , and have given to me in private life the hand of sympathy and friendship . My days have been happy among you , and I part from you th the smcerest affection and regret - a regret softened , indeed , but not prevented , by the various and exhilarating prospect before me . Allow me to assure you of my unalterable attachment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . *May God bless you , myself , and the institution with its friends and alumni , wherever in his providence he may cast them . ' Horace Hollet. * /z/ The Trustees of Transylvania University , being deeply impressed with a sense of the value and importance of your faithful and distmguished services in presiding over the institution for nearly nine years past , have appointed the undersigned a committee to express to you their decided approbation of the course you have pursued , in the discharge of the arduous duties which devolved upon you . * When they recollect that during the sixteen years which preceded your coming amongst us , only twentytwo persons received the collegiate honors of this institution , and that during your comparatively short stay , six hundred and sixtysix youi men have graduated and gone forth into the world , learned , enlightened , and adorned - and who are now the pride and ornaments of our common country-7-they can not but deeply regret the causes which have induced you to separate yourself from the institution . ' Within the walls of Transylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learned , accomplished , and much loved President will never perish . The patronage of the /z/ Commonwealth may be withdrawn , the institution may decline , the walls themselves may be crumbled ; but so long as the name remains , there will be associated with it the most afiectionate remembrances that flow from mutual attachments , or have a habitation in the hearts of those who are susceptible of the emotions of gratitude . To whatever clime your destiny may direct you , you will be pursued by the esteem and confidence of those who have been so long and so intimately associated with you ; and whom we on this occasion represent . Farewell . ' John Bradford . *R . H. Chinn . ' Thomas Bodley. * To Horace HoiiiiST , LL . D. ' ' Committee . ' ' The undersigned , a Committee appomted by the Board of Trustees of Transylvania University to receive from President Holley the buildings , &c.,; and to procure a suitable person to occupy and take charge of the buildmgs lately occupied by the President , beg leave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they examined all the buildings occupied by President Holley , and the University Hall , and the grounds attached thereto , and found all the buildings and grounds in handsome and neat order . The buildings are all , completely glazed , not a light of glass now out ; every room clean swept and in neat order . The grounds around the tenement occupied by the President have been handsomely ornamented by Mrs Holley , and the shrubbery is now in handsome order . Your committee have received from President Holley , all the buildings , fcc. attached to the University lot , in as good repair in every respect as could be expected from the length of time they have been in use ; and are of opinion that Dr Holley is entitled to the thanks of the Board , for his attentention to the property belonging to the University . ' Thomas Bodley . ' John Brand . ' * Lexington , March 24th , 1827. ' /q/ After having examined the foregoing statements and documents , is any one inclined to ask ; K such were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructer of youth , and such the general excellencies of his administration , whence is it that Transylvania declined , under his superintendence , in reputation and numbers ? In the Discourse on the Genius and Charaqter of Dr Holley , and in the preceding part of the present note , this question is virtually answered . But for the more perfect elucidation of the subject , a few further details would seem to be requisite . It is well known to those who have studied human nature , as a science , or been observant of events in the history of man , that , jealousy perhaps excepted , the most inexorable and vindictive of passions are those of party in religion and politics . Nothing is sacred , respected , or tolerated , that becomes obnoxious to them , and stands within their sweep . Nor is their power , at times , mferior to their rage for indiscriminate desolation . Virtue and vice , youth and age , beauty and deformity , the innocent and the guilty , individuals , institutions , and public bodies , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . In all ages , and in most countries , they have repeatedly rendered the habitations of man the hideous abode of hatred and malice , deluged them in blood , or otherwise converted them into sinks of pollution and wastes of misery ; and produced the most revolting scenes of atrocity that the world has witnessed . And these passions were fearfully let loose , with the fell ferocity of * the dogs of war , ' for the purposes of vengeance on Transylvania and her President . Fortunately for the cause of liberal thinking and catholic research , the stake , the faggot , and the wheel , the guillotine , the stiletto , and the gibbet , as engines of persecution , whether religious or political , are forbidden alike by the laws of our country and the sentiments of the age . But others , in their nature no less vindictive , and in their effects on their victims scarcely less agonizing , are abundantiy employed , not only by /z/ the openly atrocious and profligate but by those whom the world calls patrons of virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are falsehood , calumny , and denunciation in every form that malice can prompt , and ingenuity devise - modes of moral assassination nxre detestable , because mwe cowardly , and scarcely less destructive , than that perpetrated by personal violepce . And , for the overthrow of Dr Holley and the institution over which he presided , they were employed with an industry and force of effect , that have rarely been equalled . To specify the various shapes they were made to assume , and the different channels dutugh which they were directed , would be , if not impracticable , tedious and oflfensive . They were widely circulated in secret whispers and loud reports , in private epistles traced in letters of moral poison , and breathing a spirit worthy of such characters , in defamatory pamphlets poured in a gratuitous deluge over the land , and in numerous articles in the public prints , many of them anonymous , and not a few with names . To collect facts , which , by artful interpretation , fake coioping , or daring mendacity , might be tortured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most treacherous and dishonorable were adopted . A system of espionage , of the most revolting description , was artfully organized and inexorably pursued . The nature of the means , provided they were effident , was entirely disregarded , and the end alone held sternly in view . Charity scarcely forbids the belief , that the very profligacy of the means rendered them the more congenial and acceptable to the spirits that employed them . From his liberal hoiitalities , and the frankness and inviting courtesy of his manners , the residence of President Holley was the resort of much company . Dining and evening parties in it were frequent and large , and were composed chiefly of the most enlightened and polished society of the place ; but they were not always without mixture - were not at all times an assemblage of friends . /q/ Into these gay and innocent circles of sprightliness and mirth , where the mind is unbent and the spirits unfettered ; where , in the freshness of sportive pastime and mirth , the piquant jest is promptly met by the lively repartee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit is much more welcome than wisdom ; and where die entire and most rational object of the occasion is to bury distinctions of rank , profession , and belief , forget care , throw offall thin burdensome and gloomy , and be relaxed , delighted , and refreshed - into these circles , the genume Edens of social life ; where there is no reserve , because there is no suspicion , but conversation is mere thinking and feeling aloud , and where treachery itself might forget its purpose and learn to become honest , not one , but clans of serpents gained admission ; and worthily did they personate their great archetype . Vigilant , insidious , and artful , they played , with dexterity , the part of spies and practised informers . Gliding singly through the company , yet actmg in conversations were listened to by them , expressions noted , dresses observed , songs remembered , and even the furniture of the apartments marked , and the whole thrown together m their memory for future And when the mixture , sufficiently steeped in their native hebenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrice infected , ' had become assimilated to their own spirits , they sent it forth , through numerous channels , to empoison the sentiments of the community agamst the officer of Transylvania . That this representation , neither exaggerated nor discolored , is substantially true , some of the public prints of the day , and the personal recollections of many , abundantly testify . If Dr Holley , in a spirit of courtesy , paid to any of his company a passing compliment , was amused with their dancing , delighted with a song of sentiment and feeling , pleased with a sprighdy jest or bon mot or exchanged , in conversation , for the enjo3rment he experienced , and to heighten that of others , one of his brilliants of wit , his language and deportment were pn- /z/ nounced either light and undignified , or immoral and profane . If , in color , fashion , or adjustment , a lady 's costume did not exactly suit the taste of the informer , it was indelicate , and therefore corrupting to the mind of the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust , in composition or marble , placed as an ornament on a pedestal or a mantel , was not covered to the very ears in an ' inky cloak , ' an ecclesiastic 's surplice , or some other tasteless and unfitting garb , it was worse poison to men 's souls ' than a pagan idol , or a Druid 's oak . ' Such were the unmanly , calumnious , and unchristian representations , oral and written , in which those spies and violators of hospitality treacherously indulged themselves . And for what purpose ? To prove that Dr HoUey was no Christian ! To affix on him the stain pertaining to infidelitr , and show him to be a dangerous instructer of youth ! As if Christianity must cancel taste , case the heart in marble , extinguish in it the glow of social charity , and render it msensible to those delightful emotions , which are awakened by the innocent pleasures of life ! Or , worse still , as if it were a source of letters patent , to perpetrate acts , under the guise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagans and savages hold in abhorrence ! The more certainly to destroy the character of Dr Holley , by the charges of infidelity and a defect of certain moral observances , his movements and actions , wherever he went , appeared to be placed under a system of espionage . And this was accompanied with a settled resolution , that matter of accusation against him must be attamed . When no fault was detected , therefore , one was immediately fabricated ; so that deport himself as he might , the issue was the same . Immaculateness itself would have been no protection to him . /q/ Were it admissible to descend to particulars , many curious occurrences confirmatory of this might be easily cited . But a faithful execution of the task , repulsive firom the nature of the materials to be handled , would be a satire too severe to make a part of this note . Is any one inclined to ask . Wherefore is it that a scheme was thus projected and unremittingly pursued , to destroy the reputation and standing of Dr Holley ? The answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadly foes of Transylvania . The institution was now in a flourishing condition , and he was the recognised source of its prosperity . To ruin it , therefore , they perceived that they had only to ruin him . His intellect and attainment were above their reach . They had already aimed at them with the fellest purpose ; but their feeble missiles had fallen short of the mark . Nothing , therefore , of hope remained to them , but from arraigning him before an excited public , on a charge of irreligion . On Dr Holley 's character , as a presiding officer and an instructer of youth , the highest possible encomium was virtually bestowed , in the attack that was thus made on his religious principles . The encomium was , that the pillar of strength of the University was in him ; that in his intellectual qualifications and faithful services , as a president and teacher , he was invulnerable ; and that , therefore , to overthrow , at once , himself and the institution , he must be assailed on imputed disaffection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which , were Paul of Tarsus or the beloved disciple alive , and arraigned before the prejudices and passions of the public , his reputation for Orthodox piety would be destroyed . So certain is condemnation before a popular ecclesiastical court , when falsehood is both accuser and witness , and bigotry and fanaticism sit in judgment . And , in cases of persecution , it is of such materials alone that the tribunal is composed . The following letter fi " om Dr Holley to a fiiend in Boston , is a frank and forcible avowal of his impressions and sentiments /z/ OB dus subject generallj . But it is somethmg more . It is proof of the fallacy of the assertion , made by his enemies , that , by heretical preaching , he had lost the confidence and sympathy of hb pastoral charge in Boston . Indeed , the existing proof of that fallacy , derivable fit ) m the most authentic sources , is abundant and overwhelming . The aflbctionate and glowing warmth , with which his late congregation in Boston cherish bis memory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are testimony conclusive , that no pastor can be more deeply enshrined in the hearts of his people . Traiuylvania Unkerniyj July ISth 1819 . Your letter of the 28th of June came by the last mail . The respect and affection , which 3rou express for me , give me great pleasure , and are cordially reciprocated . I shall never remember HoUis Street Congregation without a sincere regard and attachment extending to all , and to each individual . Ten years a my life were spent with them m harmony , usefulness , confidence , and happmess . In all these respects , as far as I can judge , few ministers were ever more fortunate than myself in their relation to a parish . It is remarkable that not a sdngle difficulty ever rose between me and the people , although I preached with more boldness and fireedom than perhaps any man in the place . The congregation doubled itself in the time , and we parted with mutual regret . I did not expect to bcrease my happiness by takbg a more importimt station , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privions in regard to social intercourse , and difficulties arising firom various sources . For these , however , I was well prepared , and they have not exceeded my foresight . Religious perversity is as common here as it is in New England , and sectarians are as much inclined to slander and persecution . I have a good body of intelligent and independent men to aid roe in overcoming the assaults of the fanatical and the supersdtious. /q/ What is callied Orthodoxy in Kentucky , is the same illiberal and proscribing spirit that it is in your vicinity . Genuine orthodoxy is catholic and charitable , as well as true and pious . On these subjects , I have found my sentiments illustrated and strengthened by every hour of reflection since I left Boston ; and the sermons , which I preached to you , particularly during the last year or two of my ministry in HoUis Street , appear'to me daily more and more true , and to acquire increasing practical importance . Sectarism is the bane of the religious world . Mystical preaching can never be estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practised upon the community , for which a dear price is paid , not only in money , but in peace , morals , and happLss . The miserable declamation , w Jh is handed down from one generation of ministers to another , is a most impudent carricature of God and man , of time and eternity . A multitude of ministers must of course be excepted from this censure ; but I do not know any whole sect of them deserving the exception . Many ministers of all sects are good men and ornaments to the worid 5 but others are tares mingled with the wheat , corrupting the fields of religion with the noxious seeds which they profusely scatter over the soil . All that I would say to my late congregation would be to repeat the instructions which closed my ministry with them .

Yours , with great regard , ' Horace Holley/ Is it again asked . Whence it was that Transylvania had foes , who were anxious to destroy her ? By a writer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , whose observation and experience embrace four fifths of a century , and whose opportunities to be correctly informed on the subject under consideration can not be surpassed , this question is answered in the following terms ; - ' The flourishing state to which Transylvania had risen in 1824 , excited both envy and jealousy in the breasts of some who had formerly participated in its management , whilst in a languid state . It was evident to all that the change was principally to be attributed to the judicious choice of a President . It was therefore natural that some who were in office at the time when the last election was made , and who were not reelected , should feel dissatisfied , and more especially at the flattering prospects of success under the management of a new Board of Trustees . ' The brilliant talents of the President had filled the empty fseats o the University with students . Consequently the only means of checking its growing greatness , was , to destroy the popularity of the presiding officer ; to accomplish which , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That envy and jealousy were industrious agents in the passing scenes , no one could doubt , who had a competent knowledge of persons and circumstances , and was observant of events . /q/ Few men who have ever stood out in Bght and relief , will submit , without a struggle , to be thrown into shade . And those who have failed in an enterprise themselves , are not only apt to rejoice at the failure of others in the same project , but are too often inclined to put obstacles in their way . This is human nature . Of the feeble , pusillanimous , and envious it is always true . The magnanimous alone are superior to such meanness . But , if a judgment may be formed from the tenor of their deportment , the foes of Dr Holley were strangers alike to magnanimity and justice . There is ground of belief , therefore , that the writer referred to is not entirely mistaken in his conjecture . Certainly the whole conduct of those who were the assailants of the President had so little ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason can be assigned for attributing it to motives of purity and honor . It was often asked , at the time , and the question has been since not unfrequently repeated . Why Dr Holley did not adopt , in person , some vigorous means of self-protection ? Why , since he was assailed in concert and system , he trusted to an irregular defence of him by others , instead of more efficientiy defending himself ? The answer is , he suffered himself to be controlled by the opinion and advice of over-cautious , not to call them timid friends , who , with the best intentions , do , very often , more mischief than open enemies . A ' dignified silence , ' on his part , was strongly recommended , as his best reply to the slanderous falsehoods that were circulated against him , and was confidently pronounced a sufficient armour against all the poisoned shafts of his enemies . Instances may be imagined , and have often occurred , in which such advice is founded in wisdom . But the case of Dr Holley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends remonstrated , at the time , against the passiveness of the course he pursued . They first delicately hinted , and afterwards firmly declared to him , that further delay in defendmg /z/ himself would be construed , not merely by his enemies , but by the public , into an inability to defend . Li distant batde , the commander in chief directs the movements , and confides to his troops the immediate management of the enginery of war . Yet , even then , system and concert of action must prevail . But , in close fight , when the enemy are around him , and aiming at him mdividually from eveiy quarter , he must place himself at the head of his columns , lead in person , and try the vigor of his own arm . Such precisely was the condition of the conflict in the midst of which the President was placed . By remaining inactive , therefore , he exposed himself as much as possible to the aim of his assailants , without availing himself of any of the numerous advantages of self-defence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and intention , was certainly unwise . As well might a warrior be counselled to lay aside , at once , his shield and his sword , and stand naked and defenceless , when the missiles of an enemy resolved on his death are showered on his person . President Holley was assailed most fatally through the press ; and by the same engine ought he to have been defended , supplied with materials from his own pen . Had an academical paper been established in the bosom of the institution , and ably and judiciously conducted , as it could have been , it would have succeeded , and the University been saved . Of the truth of this Dr Holley was himself persuaded , and meditated , at one time , embarking in the enterprise . But it was then too late . Mischief had done its work , and the effects were irretrievable . But had such a paper been erected at an earlier period , its influence would have been irresistible . It would have disabused and enlightened the public mind , prepared it more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made known extensively the teal condition of the University , and thus defeated the eflSrts of its enemies . /q/ Although a number of sensible and well written articles , in favor of the institution and its presiding officer , appeared , at different times , in the public prints , there was no harmony of design , or concert of action , between their authors . Ever3hing defensive was individual and irregular , and possessed nothing of the power of united numbers . But the attack was a matter of concert , and was conducted by system . The assailants moved in masses , under strict discipline , with a common object in view , and were , therefore , successful . Had the clamor against the admim'stration of the University originated in nothing but a regard for the religious instruction of its pupils , it would have been completely silenced by a plan prepared and reported by the President , approved unanimously by the Academical Faculty , sanctioned by the Trustees , and carried into effect , in the spring of 1824 . This plan will be best understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopted , on the occasion of its establishment , with a brief commentary on it from the pen of Dr Holley . It need scarcely be added , that the fact of the President being himself the author of the plan , is an ample refutation of the charge , that he was hostile to Christianity , and solicitous to train his pupils in infidelity - a charge , which , although repeated by a thousand calumniators , not one of that thousand himself believed . /z/ * On Monday last , the following plan of religious instruction and worship in the University was , by a unanimous vote of the Academical Faculty , laid before the Board of Trustees , and was by them unanimously adopted , thirteen of the seventeen members being present . By a resolution , in which all concurred , their names are subscribed to the measure . It was also resolved , that the editors of newspapers in the town be re- /z/ quested to insert in their columns a copy of this result of the Faculty and the Board . It is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sentiment , to secure general confidence , to advance the interests of truth , to extend Catholicism , and to excite a spirit of emulation in the cause of religious liberality . It would have been gratifjring to every patriot and philanthropist to witness the unanimity and excellent tone of feeling , with which a measure , having so many rekdons to personal and sectarian partialities and antipathies , was received and adopted by an unusually fuU meeting of our large Board of Trustees , embracmg a representation of the ancient church of Grod under the Old Covenant , and of the most respectable and popular denominations under the New . The truly religious and liberal will rejoice to find , that an experiment is now to be made in earnest , and under circumstances which warrant no small degree of confidence in its success , to ascertain how far the professed believers of the bible and worshippers of God , though they are known by different names and associaticms , can harmonize in the management of the great interests of education , as connected with the most important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as novel as it is interesting , and is well fitted to attract the attention and enlist the hopes of aU die friends of human improvement and happiness . The candid and reflecting will see in this measure the reality of a religious influence in its prompt and cordial adoption for the most valuable ends . In the list of names here presented to the public , may be found the representatives of seven religious denominations , namely , the Ancient People of God , the Roman Catholics , the Episcopalians , the Presbyterians , the Congregationalists , the Baptists , and the Methodists , and among these , several clergymen , who , though sincerely devoted to the jMin* ciples of their respective communions , are heartily engaged is this auspicious enterprise in favor of our common religion . A strong persuasion is cherished , and an earnest prayer is offered , that our Universal Father and Friend will , in his /q/ gracious providence , bless and prosper this united effort to do more than ordinary good , in removing prejudice , in allapng jealousy , in awakening confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extendmg the benevolent dominion of religion and virtue . Horace Holley. * Traosylvania Univeraty , AprU 9th , 1824 . ' ' At a meeting of the Academical Faculty of Transylvania University , Aprils 5th , 1824 , the President submitted for consideration the following Preamble and Resolutions , which , in substance , he had twice brought before the Faculty several months since , but had consented to the postponement of a final determination upon them , in consequence of the doubts of their utility , which were expressed by the Reverend Professor of Natural Philosophy and History . It being understood that these doubts were removed , and that there was a prospect of a unanimous adoption of the measure , the President again cdled the attention of the Faculty to this interesting and important subject . ' The By-laws of the University contain an article in regard to the religious instruction and worship of die institution in these words ; - " It shall be the duty of the President , or in his absence , of one of the Professors , to perform divine service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University , to such officers and students as may choose to attend . And it is particularly enjoined upon the students to attend public worship somewhere on the sabbath . " This duty was discharged for a considerable time by the President , when , at his own request , he was permitted , in consequence of his numerous duties , in the superintendence of the establishment , and in its general improvement , as well as in various departments of instruction , to omit this public weekly labor . The principal religious sects having churches in the town , the students had an opportunity /z/ to attend such as they , or their parents , preferred . It is believed that in this way they have generally received religious instruction , and participated m public worship , during the whole of the present administration of the affairs of the University . The Faculty , however , knowing it to be the earnest desire of the Trustees , as well as their own , to have , as far as possible , the best advantages of religious instruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding from experience that an improvement can be made in the existing regulation upon the subject , recommend to the Trustees the adoption of a measure , which provides , as it is believed , in a safe and effectual manner , for the accomplishment of the several purposes involved in this object of general solicitude , while it guards against dangers and abuses . * The members of the Faculty are aware , that sectarian peculiarities ought not to be introduced into a State University , where there is no established church with legal privileges , and where young men are collected within its walls , from famiSes of all religious denominations , to receive instruction in literature and science . At the same time it appears to be the general desire and expectation , in accordance with some of the best and strongest principles of our nature , that the great doctrines of our common religion , those in which the good and pious of all denommations agree , should be taught with the other branches of education , if a mode of doing this can be adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , and disturb , and pervert the minds of the students , and thus give just occasion for offence to the parents and fiiends . The principles of religion , in which the enlightened and benevolent of all denominations harmonize , are happily the most important , are such as all patriots and devout men would wish to see inculcated in a State University , leaving the particular tenets of different sects to be taught in families , parishes , and theological schools . The plan , now o &red,; embraces as many pomts as the nature of the case appears to admit with /q/ propriety , and provides the same kind and degree of safety for the University in this respect , which are provided for the community at large under our free government ; namely , the equal distribution of ti ? e proper means and opportunities among the ministers of the various religious denominations . All the sects are included in this catholic measure . None have a right to complain , while all have the privilege of appearing before the youth of the University to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any would be a departure from the principles which have governed , and still govern , the instructers and the Board of Trustees . Although respectable clergymen from all religious denominations are thus allowed to contribute their aid to the interests of the University , in promoting the great doctrines of our holy religion , and in illustratmg and enforcing the pure morals , which it requires , yet , from the actual circumstances of the tovra and its immediate vicinity , there are four or five denominations , whose ministers will have the opportunity to officiate chiefly in the regular course . These are the Roman Catholics , the Episcopalians , the Presbyterians , the Baptists , and the Methodists . Provision is made to give to others a suitable opportunity to be heard . ' With these views , the Faculty respectfully offer the following Resolutions to the consideration of the Trustees as the result of their deliberations . Resolved by the Trustees of Transylvania University - That , as they have heretofore considered it their duty , and have made provision in their laws to discharge it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed , has been interrupted by the force of circumstances , so they still consider it their duty to cause the great doctrines and virtues of our common religion , as they are gathered from the Word of God in the Old and New Testaments , to be taught in this institution , so far as it is practicable , free from all sectarian peculiarities , and from all the bitterness of religious controversy . /z/ ' Resolved - That the imperative fotm of the existiDg article in our by-laws upon this subject , since the President has been allowed at his own request to omit the performance of the labor assigned to him , and which was virtually modified at the time of granting this indulgence , be now , and it hereby is , exchanged for the permissive . Reeohed - That m order to carry into effect , for the futaref what has always been the desire of this Board , as well as of the President and Professors , and what is believed to be accardant with the wishes of the Legislature and of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most useful and important principles of our belief , the ministers of the religious denominations in Lexington be invited to preach in turn , during the academical session , in the Chapel of the Unir versity , at nine o'clock in the morning of each Sabbath ; and that the students , who live in town , be required to attend , unless excused by the Faculty upon satisfactory evidence of conscien tious objections on their own part , or on that of their parents or guardians . * Resolved- ' - ThdLt each clergjrman have the liberty to invite , with the consent of the Chairman or President , any minister , in good standing , of his own or of any other denomination , to officiate in his turn ; and in order to enjoy the benefit of the talents , learning , and piety of distinguished or useful preachers in good standing from abroad , when they may be travelfing through our part of the country , it is resolved that the Chairman of the Board , or the President of the University , be autiiorised to mvite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nme o'clock in the morning , or at a suitable time in the day or the evening . Should the hour of nine in the morning be selected in this case , notice must be given , on the preceding day , to the gentieman whose turn it may be to preach at that time , and his consent must be obtained . Resolved - That for the present the ministers of the following churches in Lexington , the Roman , the Episcopalian , the /z/ Presbyterian , the Baptist , and the Methodist-Episoopal , be requested by the CJiairnian to preadi in tnra , in die Chapel , according to the foregoing arrangeiaeiit , andlhatthe third Sunday of the present month be Ae period to begin this duty , it being understood , that , where there are ministers of die 4Baine denominatioD , diey be requested to take die turn altema ; tdy. lotild my of the ministers decline to preach under diis arrangement , die odiers are to be requested ito take die turn in dieir order .

Indeed those members of the clergy who had been loudest in their complaints of a want of relious discipline in the institution , were the only ones who , now , refosed to cooperate with their brethren in the introduction of it . Had it been previously wanting , these circumstances affirded abundant testimony , that the object of the compldnants was not the promotion of religious instruction among the pupils , but the gratification of feelings which shall not now be named - not to reform and sustain the University , but to destroy both it , and its presiding officer . Rendered at length uncomfortable by persecution and slander , unable to induce the Leslature of the Commonwealth to supply the pecuniary wants of Transylvania , and disappomted in his proiects of extensive usefuhess , Dr Holley signified to the Trustees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign the Presidency of the institution . The citizens of Lexington will not soon forget the feeKngs with which they received information of this event . They /q/ looked to the resignation of the President , and his departure from among them , not merely as a misfortune , but a calamity . That his personal friends , and ; the enlightened friends of Western literature , should regard with such anticipations the movement he meditated , was . altogether natural , and therefore to be expected . But not a few who had been hostile to him , especially those of them who held real estate in the town , began to repent of the course they had pursued . They seemed to awaken , as from a dream , and to perceive now , for the first time , that he was in no small degree necessary to their individual prosperity . Some of them expressed a readiness to unite m a general request , that he would retain his station , declaring that he should , in friture , have their cordial support . But their repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some months after writing it , Dr Holley was induced to recall his letter to the Board , in which he had made known to them his intended resignation , and did not actually resign until 1827 , he could not cancel the efifects it had produced . Intelligence of his declared purpose having been , in a short time , extensively diflSised , gave a blow to the institution firam which it did not recover . Havmg , by his talents and reputation , built up and sustained the academical department , the opinion was cherished and propagated , that , in losmg him , it would necessarily lose its usefulness and standing . Instead of looking to Transylvania , therefore , as a seat of instruction , the youth of the country began now to direct their attention to other institutions . Notwithstanding the slanders let loose on him , and the persecutions he encountered , these facts mdicate more forcibly than language can express , the deep homage that was paid to Dr Holley , and the unbounded confidence that continued to be reposed in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . Had he not been acknowledged to be preeminentiy great , he would not have been regarded as the @ole support of /z/ an entire depoitment . That deparcraeo as just intunated , wb known to be peca &ulj; tbe production of his genius . He had planted the seed , and reared and sustained the spreading scion f and now that his culture was about to be withdrawn , it was expected to fade , and become leafless and uninvitiDg* The vesy fact of his being slandered and persecuted , was proof of fab greatness . Addison long since asserted , that * eo and be might hare added cahunny is a tax which a man owes to his contemporaries for the privilege of being distinguished ; and both history and observation confirm tbe maxim . The oak re ceives botii the lightning and the storm , while the bramble escapes . In like manner , it is the elevated and the powerM who suffer martyrdom , while the lowty and the feeble are ptotected by their weakness . In every conspiracy for the perpetration of mischief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer themselves to be led , and are deceived . Such was the case in reladon to Dr Holley . The number of his real enemies was not great . There existed in him nodding to make it so . And in proportion as he became more extensivefy* and intimately known in person , it necessarily diminished . No one of liberal feelings was ever in his company or his hospitable mansion , without being delighted with his omver satibn and manners . He had not in him a quality to excite enmity , except in the bosoms of the envious and the jealous ; and they are enemies to all their superiinrs . . They hate dis tinction , because it overlooks them , and * keeps them fiem the sun . ' They would gladly exterminate true , to secure to themselves comparative , but spurious greatness . Id these individuals , pertness and conceit are usually as conspicuous as envy and jealousy . To all such , Prerident HoUejE could scarcely fail to be an object of dislike . His intellectual strengdi and splendor mortified diem . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chastisement of his wit , or the severer lash of his sarcasm and irony ; and he /q/ never candesceaded to gratify thrir vanity , or flatter their pride . His polished courtesy to others was construed , perhaps , into neglect of so that they hated him alike for what he gave , and what he withheld . To pedantry , of every description , and all kinds of petty pretence , he was an object no less of dread llian dislike* His scorn of them he took very little pains to conceal . Nor did learned dogmatism experience his sympadiy . But to the lowly and unpretending , in common with the highly gifted and enlightened , few men have been able to render themselves so acceptable . Could he have condescended to flatter some of the individuals who most deeply slandered him , and soothed them with the belief that he thought them distin &cuished,; they would have compromised with their inferiority , moved aromd him as satellites , cringed to him as minions , and ministered to his renown by the breath of adulation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which insmcerity would have secured to him . On the pohlical opposition and obloquy which Dr HoUey sustained , it is needless to dwell . Although less rancorous and defamatory than those which he encountered from his theological enemies , they were equally immerited , and , from alienating the feelings of a greater body of the community , were calculated to be more certainly overwhelming in their effects . The sweep of a tide of adverse political feeling , no individual , in public station , is able to resist . That a few speeches of a political character were permitted , perhaps indiscreedy , to be delivered by the pupils in the Chapel of the University , is true . But it is equally so , that they were not restricted to one side of any agitated question . Free and fair discussion was permitted . And there were never wanting youths of spirit and ability , to appear in defence as well as in attack . Nor was it ever intended that these exercises uld give to the institution a political cast . And if such an intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus aecomplisbed . The cause was entirety inadequate to the efiect. /z/ It is but justice to add , that the speech which gave most offence , was commenced by the young gentleman who defivered it , without the President 's knowledge of the subject of it ; and it was thought unnecessary , if not too severe , to rebuke the speaker by checking him in the course of it . But the President explained the matter fully to those most concerned , and never afterwards permitted an exercise of the kbd m the institution without knowing the subject of it . This ingenuousness ought to have been received as entire satisfaction ; and the wholeKeffidr should have passed into oblivion . But it is much to be lamented , that the memory of political hostility is always tenacious , its feelings too often vindictive , and its aim deadly . Nor has it often manifested these attributes more strongly and inexorably than in the present instance . That he might not only enrich and strengthen their intellects , but teach them how to use them , the President was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recitation , to debate with himself . But he never , on these occasions , introduced questions connected with the party politics of the day . In a particular manner , the topics that awakened the political passions of the State , were rigidly excluded from the halls of the University . To the truth of this , the pupils of the time are ready to testify . On one occasion , in the law department , a very animated discussion , on a question of constitutional law , was carried on , through several lectures , by the President and one of the Professors . In the opinion of a large majority of the class , the discussion resulted in favor of the former . But here again there was nothing of party . The debate was conducted on general principles , from which , in no instance , either in politics or religion , did Dr Holley , as an instructer , ever descend . As often as he called up those subjects , in his academical prelections , he treated them as sciences , rigidly excluding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be for the great and growing /q/ community of our country , were these topics discussed in as much purity , and handled with as benevolent and liberal a spirit , in aD other places , as they were in Transylvania . The belief that her peaceful and classical halls were perturbed and polluted by heresy , or dangerous doctrines of any kind , arose , not from the slightest evidence of the fact , but from the maddening effect of party and sectarian passions , in politics and religion , on the intellect of the country . The man who reels himself , from an overheated bram , fancies every one he sees in the same condition . The frenzy of party without the walls of Transylvania , induced a belief that there was party within them . By difiusing light , and imbuing with liberal principles the youth of the West , the teachings in the University were calculated to temper and weaken party asperities , not to heighten and confirm them . Hence the political opposition which Dr Holley encountered , in his official capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lamented . Indeed the entire fortunes of the President in the West , were composed of opposite and warring elements - incongruities of an extraordinary character . With manners the most attractive , and talents and attainments the most splendid and opulent , he was assailed by enemies who deeply hated him , and boldly pronoimced him superficial in intellect . Without ever once arraying himself against either the politics or religion of the country , he was openly denounced as an enemy to both . Although he exerted himself , with a fidelity which has never been surpassed , to cultivate , in the youth under his care , both as citizens and men , sound principles and sentiments of virtue , he was pronounced a corrupter of them in morals and piety . And while , in proportion to his means , he was domg much more for learning than any other presiding officer of a similar institution in the United States , it was publicly declared , that he made , in instruction , no adequate return for the monies bestowed on the University by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of wfaidi die habitants of Kentucky should be fully mlbnued . And when pfcjudice and passion , so artfully excited , AaH have passed fixm their minds , and the President shall appear to them in Jais real character , radiant in talent , faithful in service , and sound in virtue , that generous and high*ininded people will yet do justice to his memory , and visit his enemies mih merited retxir bution . Were it the object of the writer of this note to portray Dr Holley in his private capacity , as the head of a femily , and a member of the community , there would vnoi be wanting ground of abundant encomium . But the task would be superfluous . It would be to eulogise the strength and courage of Hcules . As no one ever doubted these qualities in the hero , so none , who came within the sphere of hb influence , have reason to question the private and social worth of the President of Transylvania . His hospitalities , courtesies , and general kindnesses were proverbial and conspicuous . Lexington felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she was visited . No individud of respectability was ever neglected by hirn , whether he was a passing traveller , a temporary sojourner , or a fixed inhabitant . Nor did any one fail to be equally flattered and delighted by his attentions . When he took leave of Lexmgton , it was not Transylvania alone that seemed forsaken . He left behind him , in the society of the place , a vacancy that has not since been filled , and a sense of loneliness that has not been removed . And , notwithstanding the persecution he had encountered , and the wrongs he had sustained , to the honor of humanity , when unpehrerted by sinister passions , it is confidendy believed , that there was not in the town an individual so hardened and estranged from a sentiment of benevolence , as not , in his moments of natural feeling , to wish him health , prosperity , happiness , and fame - a meed of praise to his genius , and of homage to his worth , which no prejudices , or artificial /q/ could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the more cleayly appesir , Jiow little Kentucky h9S doaa for Trawsylvania , how little he wag consequently eqtillQd to expect from her , mi how unjust were her complainti and accusations against her , th@ following summary of wht other States have done for similar institutions is presented tf the reader .

It appears from a statement drawn up in 1820 , that there then had been appropriated of the public monies as follows ; - To the literature fund , the revenue of which is annually distributed among academies $201,489 ' As special grants to academies .... 396,800 As do . for literary purposes 28,715 * To Columbia College 113,276 * To Union College 418,500 * To Hamilton College 106,800 ' Total for colleges and academies . . . $1,265,579 * To the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the city of New York $68,100 * To do .

I know them , however , to be very liberal . Of several other States in the Union the same is true . If , then , it is true , that while other States are liberal in their endowments of universities and colleges , Kentucky , instead of enriching Transylvania , in the same way , has fatally impoverished her - that instead of conferring on her pecuniary benefactions from her own resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia - and that , instead of having a right to complam of the Trustees for their mismanagement and waste of the funds of the institution , the world is justified in complaining of her for destroying a large amount of those funds , and withholding a much larger ; if these things are true , as they palpably are , why is she surprised , or irritated , or cen- S44 APPfiNmX. /z/ aorious , at the decline of the academical department of her university ? Under existing circumstances , the event is mevitable .

Why , then , has a result so impracticable and Utopian been seriously looked for by the people of Kentucky ? and why have we heard from them complaints and censures , not to call them actual denunciations , because it has not been accomplished by magic F Is it because they are tminfermed on the subject ? ortibat those , in whom they have confided , have intentionally , or , from a want ( knowledge , miskiformed ( hem That tiiey a under a strange and deplorable misconception , let it arise fiiom what source it may , can be no bnger doubted , and would to God that , by some means , the deceptive influence could be removed fi ! om their minds , and the delusion dissipated !

Might the writer of this note hope to be listened to again , with the same kind and courteous attention , wfaidi he formerly experienced , whi he apeared before the Legislature of the State , on a kindred subject , be would vture ixtoe more re* /q/ spect &lly; and earnestly to address them . Nor would he speak either in the cant of sycophancy , which he abhors , or in the cautious and studied phrase of the practised courtier , from a fear of giving oifisnce . He would employ the language and manner of a freeman , fearlessly remonstrating against what he be lieves to be wrong ; warning of consequences , in case of persistence , and faithfully suggesting the means of reformation* Thus feeling , and with these objects in view , he would resolutely represent to the people , no less than to the Legislature of the Commonwealth , that , the profession of medicine alone excepted , in all things connected with science and letters , Kentucky is on the decline ; that , both in the abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual lights , vdiich , at an earlier period , emigratixi transferred to her from the States of the East , are fast going out ; that most of them are dimmed with years , or already extinguished ; that , in the preset condition of things , no others are to be expected hereafter from the same quarter , and that she neither has any arrangements , nor is making any , to supply their places , with luminaries reared up among her native sons . He would deliberately proclaim , in the fervor of his spirit and the grief of his heart , that , to the destinies of Kentucky this condition of things is deeply portentous , and appalling to her friends ; that it is replete with a voice of solemn premonition and terrific warning , to neglect which is not only unwise , but criminal - faithless in its bearing on the highest and most invaluable interests of the State ; and that it calls for the patronage and promotion of letters and science , as the only offering by which wisdom and virtue can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more foitnidable evils . He would ask , Whence it is that Kentucky was once so avow* edly not only die pride of the West , but the admiration and perhaps the ivy of the Ekist ; and whence she derived the infkienoe she possessed , in the councils and public concerns of le nation ? The answer is plain - too plain to be mistaken /z/ even by the simplest . It was from the abundant amount of cultivated inteUectual capital she was able to throw into the national stock . But where , he would ask , is that capital now ? - Diminished , wastmg , dwindling into poverty , by the neglect and mismanagement of its unfaithful guardians . That those statesmen and public characters , who were once the pride and glory of Kentucky should fade and * be gathered In their fathers , ' is the mandate of Heaven . But it is no less so , that their descendants and survivors should make strenuous and unremitting endeavours worthily and honorably to fill their places , and complete the work for the aggrandizement of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished . And he would ask again , are such endeavours , for such purposes , honestly made and persevered in , by the Commonwealth ? - a question which must be replied to , in a mortifying negative . In equal truth and bitterness may it be asserted , that , as relates to letters in the State of Kentucky , ' the age of chivalry is gone by . ' Their beauties and attractions are no longer objects of enthusiastic admiration , few champions arm in knightly defence of them , and other favorites have engaged the affections and devotion of the community . A fearful and revolting warfare of party , political and religious , occupies exclusively the public mind . Nor can an3rthing that is peaceful in its nature , and catholic m its tendency , flourish m the midst of it . Instead of aiming at the general good , the overthrow of its antagonist , and the accomplishment of its own selfish purposes , constitute the exclusive end of each party . Nor is anything held sacred that stands in the way of temporary success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opponent defeated , even the peacefiil haunts of the Muses are invaded , their votaries and those who minister at their altars assailed and violated , their temples rendered desolate , and their groves laid in ruins . And all this is perpetrated by the passions of the few , who deceive , abuse , and madden the many , and tyrannize over /q/ them ; by mfuriated demagogues in party politics , and fanatical leaders in party religion . That such , in Kentucky , is the lamentable condition of things will not be denied . The portraiture is neither extravagant in its outline , nor excessive in coloring . That it is substantially correct , calm observers will not fail to acknowledge , and the occurrences of the time satisfactorily prove . Does not , then , a patriotic and conscientious regard for the general welfare solemnly summon the Legislature and the people , to ponder well the existing state of things , and deliberately calculate its inevitable result ? - to make a fair and reasonable estimate of what they are to gain by the objects they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have abandoned ? Of such a calculation the elements that present themselves are sufficiently abundant . History is rich in them , and observation suppKes them from every quarter . The question to be settled by them may be thus succinctly stated ; - Which of the two is most usefiil to a community , science and letters , with all their concomitants , or a maddening party warfare in politics and religion , subversive of the interests of sound learning ? Nor is there greater difficulty in solving the question , than there is in propounding it . Consult observation and examine history , and it will satisfactorily appear , that , from the latter , no state or people has ever derived unqualified good . On the contrary , great mischief has been always its product . Although something may have been gamed by it , in reference to certain kinds of knowledge , much more has been lost , on the score of feeling , and by the false and pernicious doctrines it has inculcated . It has maddened the passions , corrupted the morals , degraded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death the wise and the virtuous , and proved , in other respects , an inexhaustible source of human suffering . To real happmess it has never ministered . If , in any mstance , such has appeared to be its issue , it has been through the instni- /z/ mentality of other causes . Evil , moral or pbysicali constittttes necessarily its immediate effect . These truths are demco* strable , were it admissible to analyze them , and adduce the on which they rest . Europe , during the dark agea , and France , in the time of her revolutionary frenzy , would sup* ply me abundantly with materials for my purpose . But of literature and science , how different are the effects I When sound and judiciously applied , exclusive benefactions are their only result . They enlighten , refine , and elevate individuals , give power to communities , glory to nations , and haq ) ines9 to the human race . They regulate the passions , purify the ? morals , ennoble the virtues , and thus erect the only bais on which true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant is , like themselves , gross , impulsive , mutable , and superstitious . Although it may act on their fears , and somewhat bridle their crude propensities , it neither purifies their nature , exalts their sentiments , nor serves as a source of virtuous action . Religion without knowledge is like a ship without a rudder , that changes her course at every shifting of the wind . The uninformed concur in religious belief and feelmg , with the last pastor by whom they have been instructed . Hence sound knowledge is essential to genuine and stable religion . Look , through histary , at the nations of antiquity , and inquire where greatness and power , morality , happiness , and true and un &dbg; glory prevailed among them . You will find them alone under the fostering influence of science and letters , and their amount was in direct proportion to the efficient cultivation of the human intellect . Of the truth of this , ample and satisfactory testimony is presented to us , in the ccmdilion of ancient Egypt , Greece , Carthage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoraxice , barbarity , and comparative weakness kept the latter in shade and servitude , while the qwq /q/ Nor dataodem times fail to affi ) rd qs abundiant evidence of a siaffilar tendency . They prove to ns conclusively , that all that is most valuable m morals , religion , politics , and social felicity , fiows in tine train , as an inseparable concomitant , of science ' and letters . To be liioraaghly convinced of this , compare the present , state of Europe with that which she presented during the dark ages . She was then but little else than an appalling spectacle of moral corruption , misery , and crime . Nor , although perpetually engaged in warfare and blood , did she exhibit the strength and invmcibiKty which she subsequendy possessed . For cultivated intellect constitutes at once the source and sinew of national grandeur , prosperity , and power . France , with her present means , which are the product exclusively of intellectual cultivation , could have subjugated the whole of Europe , in the twelfth century , with much more facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her transcendent intellectual capital renders England , at this day , the mistress of the ocean , the arbitress of nations , and the wonder of the world ? Reduce her suddenly to a state of barbarism , the sword and the trident will drop from her grasp her greatness will vanish like the mist on her hills , and she will soon become a province of her powerfiil nhbour . Nor is evidence wanting , in our own country to prove the ascendency , in wisdom and efficiency , which science and literature confer on a state . What , during the war of the revolution , gave to Virginia , Massachusetts , and South Carolina , die preponderating influence , in the affairs of the nation , which they so deservedly possessed ? Not superiority in numbers or patriotism , bravery , or weatth , but in cultivated intellect , and ripened talent . In proportion to their populationv the New England States , especially Massachusetts and Connecticut , exercise , at present in various ways , public and private , a much greater influence in the concerns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ the Union . And for this they are indebted to intellectual cultivation , the result of their munificent encouragement of learning . Within the last fifteen years , Virginia has lost much of her weight in the Union . Nor is this owing solely , although it is in part , to the bcrease of the population of some of the other States being more rapid than hers . It is because she is less ably and splendidly represented , than she formerly was , in the councils of the nation . And the source of this is her well known neglect of science and letters . In native intellect , her youth , and those of riper years , who are now engaged in public life , are as richly gifted as their fathers . But , in cultivation and learning , they are not a little inferior to them . A consciousness of this , the deep mortification he experienced on accoimt of it and a noble resolution to remedy the evil , led Mr Jefferson to embark m the enterprise , the success of which has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Virginia ' - a title , neither less honorable in itself , nor less momentous in its origin and issue , than that of * Author of the Declaration of Independence . ' If , under the latter tide , he was instrumental in the establishment of our political independence , he contributed , under the former , to our independence of intellect . Should the destinies of the University be what its Father anticipated - and if a failure occur the fault will not be his - the State of Virginia owes it to herself and her young men , no less than to him , that he should stand in marble or bronze , in some of the academical edifices he erected for her . For services and benefactions , not comparable , in value , to those which he has rendered , many individuals have had statues of gold erected to their memory , and have even received the rites of canonization . His venerable figure thus constandy presented to the youth of his native State , while pursuing their studies , and preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to awaken their gratitude , strengthen their patriotism , and produce and confirm m them a resolution to excel ; a condition of the youthful intellect , fix ) m which all that is great and glorious may be expected . /q/ Such , then , are the advantages which Kentucky may confidently expect from faithfully cultivating the intellect of her youth , and such the degradation and the evils which as certainly await her , should she persist in neglecting it . In one case , influence without and glory within ; in the other , obscurity at home , insignificance abroad , and scorn everjrwhere Or , if she chooses to run a middle course , encouraging letters on a puny scale , she may then retain the rank of mediocrity , which is scarcely less humiliating than the worst of the others . But if Kentucky has much to apprehend fix ) m the positive retrogradation of her citizens , as relates to intellectual improvement , she has no less from that which is only comparative . Of the other States of the West , the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will thus continue , with increasing velocity . Their augmenting brightness , therefore , will bury her more deeply in shade . Each of them has , in lands to be appropriated to the purpose , an ample fund for the promotion of learning . And these lands , from the very misfortunes of Kentucky , they will learn to turn to a profitable account . Each will have , tiierefore , in time , a well endowed and well appointed college or university of its own , for the education of its own youth . Under these circumstances , should Kentucky continue destitute of such an establishment , the consequence is too obvious to be concealed from any one , or to require here to be elaborately set forth . She must either want learning entirely , and sink into a condition of comparative barbarism , or pay for it a price which will impoverish and further weaken her , and enrich and strengthen her neighbours . Thus will she , the elder sister , and once by far the most splendid and promising member of the great political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handmaid to the younger ; or , at least , of a humble dependant on them , for that which they should be receiving from her . If the pride of Kentucky can submit to this , then is she lost to glory and abandoned by hope . Her independence has given place to craven /z/ servility , and tbe spirit of chivalry has left her forever* Her sainted sires , who fondly planted her in the wiMemess , braved all hardships and dangers m nurturing her , and gallandy shed their blood in her defence , will turn , with burning blushes , mingled with a frown of deep indignation , from their ctegenerale daughter , and leave her to her Will any one , in answer to the preceding statement , absenre , that Transylvania once had funds , which were wasted fay the mismanagement of those who had the charge of than ; and that she , therefore , has no right to expect any more ? The reply is , that those funds , whether wasted or not , were not derived from the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large portion of them were destroyed by her . It will not be denied that the pittance which she gave was faitfafu &y; applied to the object for which it was mtended - the extinguishment rf debt . But if she has just ground of - complaint , as respects the former management of the funds of Transylvania , her remedy is equally obvious and simple . The whole matter is tmder her own control . Let her make the institution a suitable endowment , in remuneration of the lands she withheld , and the bank stocks whose value she so nunously lessened , and appoint to the superintendence of it , agents whom she knows to be &ithful; and competent . By proceeding thus , she will do justice to the Universdty , honor to herself , and good incalculable to the people of the West . Such an act would ' Contribute more to her interest and renown , than any she has performed dnce her existence as a State . It would entitle h &t; to the exaked privileges of her birthright , and secure to her the preeauiieDce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sisters of the West ; both of which she is rapidly forfeitiog by her neglect of learning . Because e failed in one ill-arranged and ill-piovided itr tempt at the pennament establislunent of a uoiversily , will abe not make another , with ampler means , and under more fikilfui /q/ managemeni ; i Will she forever abandon the olject in despair ? Such conduct would be indicative of a degree of pusillanimity , and a want of vdsdom and perseverance , which are equally desl3uctive of the prosperity and standing of individuals and states . Let her , it is repeated , endow the University- - competendy and permanendy endow it , and appoint skilfiil directors and able cheers to administer its concerns , intellectual and peottniury , and the issue will be glorious to Western America . Let her pursue an opposite course , and imbecility and mortification will be her certain reward . While her sister States around her , it b reiterated , shall be proudly blazing in light and splendour , and exulting in their strength , she , to increase their brilliancy by contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured , deeply obscured , by the humiliating shades of her own inferiority . Comjdaints have been made , that the expenses of an education in Transylvania are so heavy , that none but the sons of the wealdiy can sustain them . With a design to injure her , therefore , she has been mahciously denominated the institution of the rich ! ' This view of the subject is characterized by anything but reason and candor . In all places on earth , it is chiefly the sons of the wealthy , at least of those in easy circumstances , that receive tl advantages of a liberal education . And , from causes which it would be superfluous to recite , it is in the nature of things that it must be so . Superior wealth , which , in this country at least , is , for the most part , either directly or indirectly , the reward of superior industry , intellect , or both , will be made to purchase special privileges and advantages , is iiKded to do so , and ought to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the enjoyments of the rich , they must first secure , by energy and industry , the means to purchase them . They will then have an honest and an honorable title to diem-HDK ) t sooner . By the laws of nature , 9s well as those of every well regulated civil community , the rich as well as ( /z/ the poor hare a fair claim , not only to the immediate products of their own labor , intellectual and corporeal , but to all they possess by hereditary descent . With as much justice may it be demanded of an individual to surrender up his possessions , without a compensation , to one who is richer than himself , as to one who is poorer - to a luxurious king or lord , as to an indolent pauper . In fact , the tirade that is , in these times of portentous levelling and obstreperous misrule , so insidiouslypoured out in behalf of the poor against the wealthy , and the refusal to patronise colleges and universities , because the former can not be educated in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are anxious to conciliate public favor , by an expression of sentiments which tiiey do not feel , and which they would be the last to exemplify by acts of magnanimity or practical benevolence . These complainings are pushed , in some mstances , so far , as to pronounce the superior education bestowed on the wealthy , a measure that ought to be frowned on and discouraged , as being calculated to create , in our country , a dangerous aristocracy . Even the Academy at West Point , the foster-child of Washington and his illustrious successors , the hope and pride of the nation , and one of the most excellent seats of instruction the world contains , is to be subverted , its halls of science left in loneliness , and its bowers of the Muses to become the dwellings of owls , to gratify the fearful spirit of levelling , which is abroad in our country . This Vandalic antipathy to learning is one of the most revoltmg features of the times ; and , should it spread extensively , will become the most formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , which deluged France in blood , appalled her with horror , and covered her in mourning . If , m the fifth and sixth centuries , its product was the dark ages , its tendency , in the nineteenth , is precisely the same . Nor can anjrthing but the peculiar condition of the world prevent it from leading to a similar issue . Those , therefore , who foster it , are the worst enemies of the human race . /q/ For the many to be learned is impossible . The privilege belongs , of necessity , to the few . And those few must possess the means to purchase it . For education is as much an article of purchase as a tract of land . Nor is it less preposterous to complain , because the poor can not be versed in science and letters , than because they can not be proprietors of the soil . But if those in straitened , in common with those in easy circumstances , must be educated in colleges and universities , there is but one way in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberally , that their officers can be maintained without any fees , or with very light ones , from the pupils who attend them . Their halls and class rooms will then be open to all the youth of the country , who have means to meet the expenses of subsistence , and a few other moderate demands which necessarily pertain to a college life . It is not true that the fees of tuition , in Transylvania , have been exorbitant . They were more moderate than in any other institution , of the same rank , in the United States . But they were certainly higher than they need have been , had the University been endowed . Nor could the case be otherwise . They were in lieu of endowment , and furnished subsistence to the President and officers . Had they been more moderate than they were , that subsistence could not have been derived from them . Is it , then , the wish of the people of Kentucky , to foster learnmg and science , and yet suppress what is denominated their aristocracy ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refuse to do this , and the sons of the wealthy will receive an education , in distant places , while those of the poor will be necessarily unlettered - a condition of things constituting , in perfection , the aristocracy denounced . Should any one be inclined to pronounce some of the preceding remarks irrelevant to the object of this note , the writer of it thinks otherwise . The life of a literary man consists in his thoughts . And the foregoing were the thoughts and opin- /z/ ioDS of Dr HoDey . When living he did not conceal tbew ; not would he fail to express them , were be living stiH . Although Kentucky treated him , not only with a want cf kindness and courtef , but with ingratitude and injusdo in listening to false accusations against him , and in reiufling to sustain him in his impOTtant labors , he never ceased to be sincerely attached to her .

He was too manly to complain ; bat he would remonstrate with her , in arguments so convincing , expressions so cogent , and a manner so irreastible , that , though when living he failed , his voice from the billows , bearing with it the depth and potency of the mighty waters , would prevml over error , disenthral the mind from prejudice and passion , and accomplish the end for which he so zealously labored , the triumph of learning in Western America . He would , in a particular manner , warn the people and the Legislature of the State where he sojourned , against popular dissensions , distracted counsels , and the dangers of political and religious frenzy . He would implore them , in the name of patriotism , learning , and sound morals , and even of genidne refigion itself , of all that is most precious to them here and hereafter , their present comforts , their prospects in time , and ifaeir hopes of eternity , to bury their hostilities and live in peace .

' While he held that by the influence of education fyc. p. 50 . The following article , ' On Education in the Western States , ' written by Dr HoDey , and published in the Western Review , in 1819 , will communicate to the reader , in his own words , some of his views on that subject . * Some remarks on the education of this portion of our country are required by our common interest . There are some considerable errors which need to be corrected , and many inadequate notions which ought to be enlarged . Parents have a great desire to give , and children to receive , the advantages of learning and science , and the impulses upon this subject are as good here as in any part of the United States ; but the means , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are much less than they are in some other places . All the privations which we have suffered , and which we are still suffering , in regard to our education , are indeed rapidly diminishing , and giving place to increasing facilities and advantages . Our population has multiplied , and our property accumulated , to such a degree , that we not only have an ample field for our own talents , but for those of the most promising and enterprising young men from the Atlantic States . We are ceasing to feel like colonists who have left the mother country and the delights of home , and who always look back for the inventions and improvements which society is expected to introduce . We are thinking for ourselves , and beginnmg to adapt our policy to our condition , which we understand much better than we have /z/ done heretofore . Our strength and resources are rapidly A veloping their extent and variety under new and interestii aspects . Instead of deceiving our hopes with calculations of commercial advantages , so unsuited to our interior world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same moment , and in distant sections of the West , without any other aid than a common interest , upon the importance of manufactures , and the evils which we have incurred by nlecdng them . It b the general sentiment , forced upon us by the observatioii of every man , that too much of our population has been mcantile ; at too many foreign goods have been brought into the country ; that a paper currency is an evil chiefly because it had promoted this system of action ; that we ought to have worked our own raw materials mto articles for general use ; and that we ought not to have attempted , in the beginning of our itiiadu ( acturing career , such great and expensive establishments as are fitted only to an old state of society , where the modes of labor are settled , and sudden changes can not defeat the calculations of judgment . The establishments should havfe been smaU at first , and the cajMtal emjyed should have been given principally to the end and not to the means . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of fordgn goods to the use of our own . It must now be much more rapid . ' Something must occur in regard to education similar to that which has occurred in regard to manufactures . We must see our wants , before we can judiciously end efi*ectuaiy supply them . Some of these wants we will point out . Our ideas of an education are inadequate as they regard the student , the amount of learning and science expected , the number of books reqinred at a seminary , the extent of appara tus , the variety of professors , and the time necessary to complete an academic course . This remark is true in every part of the union , but it is pardculariy true in this part . Boys are to be put early to study . It is imposssible to wait for them to have judgment enough to determine upon the best mode of /z/ education for themselves , without sacrificing a very valuable portion of Ufe , a portion which can not be spared with impunity . Parents are , from the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards this important purpose , and mu$t decide for them what use they shall make of a considerable number of their first yeanu To refuse to do this is an act of treachery toward our offipring which ought not lightly to be forgiven . The best time for the study of language in , without any doubt , in childhood . The memory is then active , and the other faculdea are too immature for the services which they will be called upon to reader in after life . When the mind has been accu &*; tomed to the pleasure and gbry of invention , of analysis , of original and independent thinking , of the full use of its various powers , it can not consent to go back and thumb a lexiooQ for the daity drill of a school book in a dead language . We must learn vocatbiilariea when we are young . The philosophy of language we may pursue afterwards . This is deep and inter* estiB% enough to satisfy the strongest minds . Every young man who attends to the sciences first , and then undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The testimony of all well educated communities agrees in this fact It is supported by the order , in which our faculties are unfolded and our pleasures increased . It oiiht not to be reqmred that we should speak with hesitation en this point . The experience of ages is sufficient to justify the tone of decision . We must have tools before we can work . We must empl ( our senses before our minds cam be stored with ideas . We must have words before we can talk or write . We must have the same words with others before we can give them our thoughts or receive theirs . We must understand the languages , in which books of literature and science are printed , before we are furnished with a key to knowledge , even afto* we have entered a library , and the lore of ages is spread around us . It is hoiwiref a great mistake to suppose , that the chief value of an acquaintance with other languages than our own lies m /z/ the ability to read foreign books . EngUsh is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and no man can be master of it without knowing several of them . We can indeed obtain a sufficient acquaintance with our language to be very respectable and useful citizens , to be good practical thinkers , and even to be eloquent speakers ; but not to be critics , not to be teachers , not to have a fine tact in the choice of words , not to be aware of corruptions and of the best mode of prevention or removal , not to furnish the aids of grammars and dictionaries to the inquiries of others , and not to be in short accomplished scholars . It is not true that all the valuable works , which we ought to have , are translated into English ; but if it were , this would not excuse us for neglecting the study of languages , when we have the opportunity to learn them , and mean to be considered as literary men . Etymology carries us immediately and constandy out of our own tongue , and no mere English student can pursue this branch of inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acquaintance with Greek and Latin . These must be studied in order to support our claims to the character of philologists . Home Tooke has demonstrated that Saxon , and still other dialects , are indispensable to a thorough investigation even of our particles . Twenty distinct sources for the present English vocabulary are enumerated by some writers . The question of purity with us is a totally distinct one from what it was with the Greeks and Romans . The former allowed no words to be pure but those of Greek origin . The latter allowed Greek to be added to their own , but excluded all others . We must admit all the languages of Europe , and even some of the languages of the aborigines of our own country , to assist in determining what shall constitute purity in English . Were it possible for a man to be once well acquainted with the dialects , which are the sources of our language , and afterwards be unable to translate a single passage from any one of them , he would still have a power and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he never /q/ could have obtained in any other way . He , who has made himself acquainted vith the dead languages , can always tell , from the style of another , whether he also has studied them or not . * But we pursue this inquiry no further . All the colleges and universities in our country demand a knowledge of Greek and Latin as an indispensable condition of the bestowment of a degree . This alone is reason sufficient to secure for them public respect , and ought to have its proper influence upon public opinion . We have no disposition to contend that our scholars ought at present to become manufacturers of grammars and lexicons for any language but our own . These we can get from Europe , and can translate them from German or Latin when we do not find them in English . We ought however to be capable of making grammars and lexicons hereafter , if occasion should require them at our hands . Until this occasion happens , we ought not to make it an objection to American literature that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinements of criticism . The time will come when we shall write and adopt our own books in our public institutions , and free ourselves from this species of dependence upon Great Britain . The insults , which foreigners are continually heaping upon us , will contribute toward this end . Even our own citizens , when they are abroad , sometimes slander us , and grossly carricature our literary taste and condition . Blackwood 's Magazine , printed at Edinburgh , has done its part in this work of misrepresentation . But it ought to be our business to glean instruction from the slanders of our enemies , and to make falsehood itself tributary to our improvement . Our enemies often fasten upon the real defects of our state of society , and of our literature , although they magnify and color them according to their caprices , and hardly preserve likeness enough for strangers to form any just idea of the origmal . Considering the objects , which our country has been obh'ged heretofore to pursue , our learning has been adapted to our con- /z/ dition ahd wants* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature ought to be far better , and the causes are abeady na operation which will make it so . The activity and powers of the American mind are equal to those of any other , as is proved by its success in everything to which it has devoted itself . But notwithstanding our capacity for any measure and variety of improvement , we are , as scholars , inferior to those of Europe who are our inferiors in vigor of mind . We must raise our standard of literature , and introduce the necessaiy hodks into the libraries of our colleges and universities , and we shall then show that we are as able to understand them with critical accuracy as any people in the world . The number of inventicms in our country , and the rapid progress which useful science is making among us , are sure indications and a satisfactory pledge of our future success in an equal degree to any of our rivals . * There are , however , many erroneous impressions and habits to be removed , especially in this region , before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all in a most unfeis tunate hurry to finish what they call their education , and to get into active Ufe . This spirit of haste is almost universal , both with the parents and the children , and produces some of the worst effects . A scrap-education , snatched from a few months of study under all the disadvantages of a want of preparation in the first place , and of method and means in the second , must forever subject a man to embarrassments of the most painful kind when he contends with the regularly and thoroughly instructed . The period , at which boys want to enter the univ-sity , is altogether too early . They should be kept much longer at the study of languages in preparatory schools , and hera they will be qualified to attend to the sciences with advantage , and without distraction . There is a vast deal of false shame among the young men , when they are found in college at Ae age of eighteen , nineteen , or twenty . They all want to be graduated at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good age for admission ; seventeen is better ; eight* /z/ een is very wdl ; nineteen is liable to no considerable objecticms ; and twenty out not to be viewed as an insuperable obstacle . The 9e of twentyfive is early enou for any young man ID iter a profession . The Letters of an English barrister to a Student in Law advise him to continue his studies to the age of diirty , and then to commence practice in his profession . The bad consequences of admitting very young men to the active duties and responsibility of either law , physic , or divinity are numerous and important . Then education generally ceases at this period , and they form an unfortunate style and a perverse taste , while tiiey are left the victims of an imperfect , miscellaneous , and vacillating course of thinking and actings The want of a familiar knowledge of general principles and of elementary systems , ei ) ecially in political economy , is felt , to an alarming extent , in the deliberations and results of our State Legislatures . Expedients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no general policy is tried upon the settied maxims of a safe government . A better early education would aid powerfully in remedying this evil . * Our young men are not only prepared very imperfectly for the university , but they come from all sorts of teachers , and bring with them every variety of pronunciation and of literary faults . They foitn , when collected , a modey group . Most of them , at ieas very many , begin the course erroneously , and learn that at the close which they ought to learn first . Itin , Greek , and the living languages , should always be first taken up , and ieflet lettrei and the sdences afterwards . A sufficient acquaintance with English to read it fluentiy , and with perfect ease , is of course an indispensable prerequisite . But the study of philosojcal English grammar is to come after the languages have generally been obtained . We have some teachers of eminence in this portion of the country , men accomplished in the languages , and who do themselves and their pupils honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to learn Greek , and thus subject them to great dis- /z/ advantages afterward , when they are obliged to go back in their course and bring up what they had so injudiciously neglected . No teacher is to be allowed to be a guide , in this respect , for those who are to receive degrees in our colleges , if he dissuades his pupils from the study of Greek . Even an A. B. is not conferred in any institution in the United States , as far as we know , without a knowledge , or a pretended knowledge , of this language . We are not going into an argument to show the importance of Greek to the scholar , the critic , the etymologbt , the orator , the man of taste , or the man of science . It is enough that all our institutions unite in requiring it of every student . ' The great body of our people must be business men . It is right that they should be so . But we also want some scholars and men of science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the practical improvement of the community . Very many of our young men are given up to an idle and injurious life , who ought to be benefiting society by their learning or their scientific attainments . This is an age when science is showing its uses in the ordinary relations of mankind . Manufactories , labor-saving machines , economical improvements in fireplaces and stoves , the application of chemistry to agriculture and the arts , the facilities of travelling , and indeed all the departments of society , whether ornamental or useful , are displaying the triumphs of science and demonstrating the progressive melioration of the condition and character of the human family . In new states , towns and institutions are too apt to be jealous of each other , and , for want of union and cooperation , to defeat the useful ends which all propose . This evil will decrease as towns acquire a more established character , and their respective advantages become proportioned , understood , and freely allowed by each otiier . Elementary schools and academies ought to be distributed through the State ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support more than one university , even if they be sufficient , and at the same time willing , to do that . The means of a good education at any one /q/ place are very expensive and require a large capital , when buildings , books , apparatus , and professors are taken into the account . The great libraries of Europe make us ashamed of the best in the United States . That of the Vatican consists of five hundred thousand volumes ; others have three hundred thousand , and two hundred thousand volumes . The largest library among us amounts to about thirty thousand , and those of our colleges run from six thousand through three thousand down to one thousand . Our ideas of the extent of a library must be very much enlarged before we shall be able to collect the literary apparatus absolutely necessary to a finished scholar . * We want , in our education , accuracy and depth ; fewer declaimers and more thinkers ; fewer volunteers for six months , or a year , and more regular troops devoted to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we ought to have some educated men , some acquainted with scientific theories , to be associated with the men of labor and application in the details of execution . Speculation and experiment should go together . Theory and practice should be wedded forever , and each contribute to the perfection of the other . Our system of education should begin with the mother in her nursery , and so from the family to the district school , then to the high school or academy , to the college or university , where graduates should be resident for several years before they desert it for . practice in a profession . In this way we should elevate the bar , the medical faculty , and the pulpit . We ought not however to continue the idea any longer , that those only are to be . educated , who are destined for the learned professions . Our planters , farmers , merchants , and the higher orders of mechanics , ought to luimber in their catalogues many men of letters , and particularly of science .

If it be asked , Why did Dr HoUey resign the Presidency of Transyhrania University ? ' it maybe said in reply , there was not perhaps , at that particular moment , amy new or pecuHar reason for the resignation* The last drop which causes the cup to overflow has not more weight , bulk , or density , , than the thousand that had preceded it . He had kmg since arrived at conviction , that wlule the State refused encouragement and protection , and its enemies forbearance and magnaninaiky , two pmtsbecame equally hcqpeless. ; the University , if , by immense individual exertion , it could maintain its standing , could not move onward to the proud distinction his ambition had marked out . for it ; without adequate funds , depending for dsuly subsistence upon the income from students , an iiicome always fkctuadng , and graduated by the other resources of an instilaiiKticm as furnishing inducements for pupils to attend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends and be spent freely , le hope remained ; but to labor hard and tabor in vain , and be reviled for it too , he . could no longir brook . In , behalf , kf the University he begged and entreated , urged and reconj mended , in person and by agents , exhibited its present state , itsf. prospects and wants , invited examination and ioquiiy , all to no purpose . The last effort of lUs sort , was a vbit to- Frankfort in the autumn of 1826 , in order , if possible , to make an impression upon the Legislature , then in session . The case was considered /q/ desperate , and no attempt was made . It was after the publication of the Message of Governor Desha , in which he insidionsljr denounced the President of Transylvania , expressed much interest , on the part of the Executive , in the University , great friendship for its prosperity , spoke in extravagant terms of legislative munificence , but added , that it had entirely failed to meet public expectation . To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated his determination to resign , and who endeavoured to persuade him to disregard this denunciation of the Governor , and to consider it no more than the manifestation of a vindictive spirit , which was willing , in order to promote its own ends , to blast the fair prospects of literature and science in the State , Dr HoUey thus expressed himself ; - Tbat he had sacrificed bright prospects , torn himself from very dear friends , and spent a considerable portion of his life , to rear for the State an institution worthy of her ; that he had succeeded gready beyond his means ; had withstood sectarian and individual persecution , but that he could not , and would not bear that of the Executive ; that whatever he thought of the man , the people had made him Governor , and if their Governor chose to destroy tiidr only hope of a literary institution , the fault was not his ; that he should leave Kentucky with sincere soitow , and wilii it many friends ; and he hoped the Trustees might select some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , by the Trustees , and by his attachment to the University , whose affidrs might be still further depressed by a sudden change in the administration of there , to retain the Presidency one year longer ; But tiie blow was given , his purpose of resigning had gone /z/ The funds abeady in possession wre chiefly nominal , the property being improductive , as were those boasted of as the beneficent appropriation of the Legislature . For these , what was withdrawn by their previous acts , was more than an equivalent . It was a continual struggle for which tiiere were no relief /z/ aws . Dr HoUey , though little liable to feelings of discouragement , could not but see that he was contending against fearful odds , and was himself , as well as the darling of his hopes and ambition , becoming impoverished . He had made immense sacrifices for his adopted State ; had merged m its interests every personal consideration , while its native sons , the proprietors of the soil , at least a proportion of them , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored with a zeal worthy of a better cause , to pull it down . He had devoted to it nine of his best years ; applied to it all the energy of his unUring mind ; had resisted the suggestions of his less sanguine friends ; borne all that could be borne from enemies , until no experiment was ever more faurly made . He felt that he deserved better things . The spirit of the contract was broken , and he resolved to cultivate his hopes , and seek the rewards of a generous and elevated ambition , under more genial influences , and with more cheering prospects . He never would allow that the ill founded attacks on his name and management of the University , had any power over his determination . Undoubtedly they had an influence , as whatever comes into every day 's experience , operating through the affections , must have , however m the pride of integrity and self-dependence we strive to conceal it from ourselves and from others . Hence he manifested something of that impatience we all discover on finding our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disdaining all intrigue himself , he felt insulted at the suggestion that he regarded such litde artifice in others , and could the University have risen above it , could it have triumphed over insult and injury as he did , above all , could it have lived without pecuniary means , it might still have been the boast of its own State , as it had been the admiration of others . Had the views been supported and followed out , which were offered and dwelt upon , to induce his acceptance of the office , and the relinquishment of a situation unrivalled in point of agreeableness , /q/ but not in his view furnishing so wide a field for usefiilness , So great and dazzling a goal for his ambition - a situation , as it proved , of greater emolument , and not liable to losses from a fluctuating state of things - he might still have been moving on in his laborious career , with undimmished glory . Having , after much deliberation and many painful struggles , come to the resolution of leaving to other experimenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he matured a plan , on which he had often thought , that would combine useful exertion with agreeable recreation , before again engaging in any arduous and permanent enterprise . This was desirable for one who was so unwearied in attention to the duties of his office , and who had been harassed by innumerable and perplexing difficulties and embarrassments . He had previously undertaken the charge of a number of small boys , sons of highly respectable and wealthy planters of Louisiana , who resided in his family , and from whom , for a year or two , he had derived the greater part of his income . He suggested to these parents the following plan , which he entitled , ' A Plan of Education for the few who can afford it . ' This plan , conducted by himself , he justly considered as in no small degree recommended to patronage by his mature age and standing in life , the constant intercourse of the pupils with his family , and by his previous pursuits and long employment as a successful teacher and lecturer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , as defective in the following particulars . ' 1 . Their want of interest sufficient to engage intensely the attention of the pupil . 2 . Their want of the requisite superintendence of the morals and manners by the instructers. 3 . The excess of the pupils , in number , beyond the ability of their teachers to insti'uct. 4 . The too great distances between /z/ the teacher and the popil , preventing the proper influeiioe of die former over the lalter as his instructer and friend . During the period of education it is best that government be parental , embracing influence and authority through the kindest patfiies of our nature . 5 . The want of situatkxis and circumstances to call out the observations of the pupil , that they may be directed , and his errors and prejudices , that they may be met and removed , 6t . The inherent difficulties and inconveniences attending an education conducted throughout on the same spot . Such an education can not fail to contract and narrow the mind , and unfit it for enlarged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual plans oi education , in rdation to manners , morals , religion , politics , and countries . 8 . The want of oqK ) rtunities to attain by OHiversation , practical acquaintance with livmg languages . 9 .

The misconceptions formed in relation , not only to religious sects , but to people and nations , differing from ourselves ; sucfaasJews , Mahometans , and Pagans. 12 . The too high estimajie placed on all localities about us , whether good or bad . 13 . The extravagance that marks feelings of nationality and sentiments of republicanism .

The whole system , for its completion , was to include from six to eight years . The plan , if feasiHe , seemed delightful . His family , especially his oalj wofuld share largely in its benefits , while his own taste , curiosity , , activity , and love of travelling would be gradfied . He would be acquiring knowledge on all subjects , and in particular on thcxse relating to literary institutions , and the science of educati ( Hi . The libearal parents of those children , some of whom had themselves as well as othears of their sons , been educated abroad , adopted the scheme without hesitatioQi , pleased with an opportunity of giving to these branches of theiv house so complete , though so novel , a mode of instruction . /z/ To cany into execution this plan , Dr Holley left Kentucky , not without feefings of regret and sorrow ; not without that anguish of soul which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking up of habits of daily intercourse , cemented by the friendship and kindness of years ; but he was blessed with that bright sunshine of the soul , an approving conscience . No person ever possessed a conscience more pure than was his , in regard to Kentucky- Every duty , expressed or implied , had been performed ; every obligation , whether of mercy or sacrifice , discharged ; every debt , pecuniary or of gratitude , faithfiilly liquidated - those only of envy and ill will were left uncancelled . With the Great Auditor of all human accounts , let them forever remain ! His valedictory to the students and the citizens who thronged to hear it , was affecting in the extreme . It consisted of an outline of his course since he had resided in Lexington , given with animation , dignity , and feeling .

' Trustees , Professors , friends , families , farewell ! ' He left Lexington on the twentyseventh of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pupils , citizens , and friends , testifying by every expression of affectionate sorrow , their.sbcere attachment to his person and character . Had they known it was to be his only funeral procession , they could not have shown more sympathy and respect . Having at length bid adieu to the State , to the ties of office , the attachments of a nine years ' residence , the friendships of a numerous circle , the stronger claims of natural affection in an only and beloved daughter , now married and established in Kentucky - all broken , the parting scene over , the tears wiped away , the agitation of spirits occasioned by so trjdng a crisis havmg , after some days , subsided into the calm of repose - like one relieved from an oppressive burden , he seemed to have entered upon a new existence . His spirits rose with the elasticity of youth . And while gliding down the beautiful Ohio , and borne along the rapid current of the majestic Mississippi , his mind and his heart expanding at every remove , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of nature . The scenery was new , the Father of Rivers , was a sublime spectacle . Moving triumphantiy over the congregated floods , and carried swiftly through several varieties of climate , whose new and peculiar productions aroused the curiosity and the fancy , while the conversation of intelligent and accomplished companions , elucidated their character and history - verdure /z/ and flowers soon bursting upon the view , and ravishing the senses , his mind was excited , his native buoyancy of spirit returned , the poetry of life revived . With these lively , free , and elastic feelings , after passing a few days with friends upon the Coast above the city , he entered New Orleans . Here it was his intention to enlarge his plan by forming a class of older youths for the proposed European excursion . As soon as he arrived , however , and before he had time to make any arrangement for that purpose , he was vmted upon by some of the most influential gentlemen of the place , for another purpose . They suggested , the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . The arguments oflfered as inducements , were very plausible , and the plan proposed extremely liberal . The College of New Orleans was entirely prostrated , and there was no establishment for education . Many persons could not affird to send their sons abroad , who might be able to educate them , if the means of education were provided at home . Those who went abroad for this purpose were often disqualified , by their habits and the influence of climate , for a residence in Louisiana . After an absence of the many years necessary for a collegiate course with the preparatory studies , they were strangers in the place of their birth , and like strangers liable to disease . A generous subscription could be obtained immediately , and hundreds of youths were ready to avail themselves of the advantages of a home institution , the moment it should be established . It would be the foundation of a great university , free and independent of the trammels of legislation , or the dilatory measures of numerous trustees , who , with concert of opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means and power ; and who , with divided attention , and the want of comprehensive views , can not be supposed to understand fully all the exigencies of a great institution , or to be so well qualified to manage them as an individual who has made the subject his study , and who can give to it his whole time and attention . Such was the outline , as expressed in the following extract from a letter to the author , fix ) m one of those gentlemen . /q/ * We had heard , long before the receipt of your letter , of the melancholy scenes of the Louisiana . The loss which you deplore is that which afflicted us the most . In the death of Dr Holley , Louisiana has lost him on whom she had cast her eyes for the education of her youth . * It was at the solicitation of many of our most respectable citizens , that Dr Holley was persuaded to abandon his projected tour to Europe . In order to induce him to acquiesce in their wishes , two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy for him , by means of a subscription , a tract of land in the vicinity of the city , and to erect on it the necessary buildings for the reception of students . To enable Dr Holley to refund to the subscribers the money thus advanced , all the profits of the institution were to be abandoned to him . The subscribers once paid , Dr Holley was to become sole proprietor of the land and buildings . The second proposal was , that the subscribers should retain the property and abandon to Dr Holley , as long as he continued in it , all the profits that should arise from said institution . This last proposal is the one which pleased Dr Holley the most and it was accepted by both parties . * In these two proposals , Dr Holley , was to have had the exclusive management of the institution . Our confidence in him was unlimited . This plan of retaining Dr Holley in Louisiana , was conceived by some of our most respectable and wealthy sugar planters , who felt anxious to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us , the subscription , as well as I could ascertain , amounted to upwards of twentysix thousand dollars , and that in the space of three or four weeks . If this project had taken place in the winter season , when all our planters , from every part of the State , are collected in the city , I have no doubt but that the subscription , in the same space of time , would have amounted to sixty or seventy thousand dollars . If Dr Holley had not become apprehensive of our climate , and had not abandoned us , for it was he that left us and not we him , my opinion is , and it is the opinion of many other persons , /z/ thai from one hundred and fifty to two hundred young men would have been placed under his care . ' To a mind constituted like Dr Holley 's , having recently ceived a deep wound in a favorite point , views were unfolded worthy of all consideration . An opportunity was o &red; him of practicaUy vindicating to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could now act with promptness , decision , and energy . The emolument would be ample and at command , and would moreover redeem what he considered a culpable negligence in his past life - the failure to provide for the pecuniary wants of the future . It was not , however , without reluctance that he abandoned the first project ; a project so much in unison with his taste , so full of various and delightful promise , and at the very moment of firuition . But the other enterprise would create a permanent institution of vast importance to an mterestbg and growing conomunity . It would benefit society , make his family independent and happy , and reflect honor on his name . His mind , as it ever had done , yielded to the beauty of utilily . After some reflection , he determined to accede to the proposal , and the foQowmg Prospectus , in French and English , was issued . Prospectus of a College near Kew Orleans , for a complete Course of Academical Instruction in the Languages and Sciences J loith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community have long been sensible of the want of a sufficient number of academical institutions in Louisiana , to give an adequate education to the youth of the State . We are aware that honorable exertions have been made to remedy this defect , and that there never has been any just cause for complaining of a parsimonious patronage on the part of the mhabitants . Much good instruction has been , and is still given in various ways to our children . We observe , however , at the present time , an unusual inadequacy in the means of a /q/ sound and thorough American education , in this vicinity , for our sons , and we are eamesdy desirous of effecting a change in this respect . We are obliged to send our children to various and distant States , and to seminaries greatly difiTering from one another in their systems of instruction , in the principles which they teach , and in the characters which they form . Large contributions are thus levied upon us from abroad , and sums , to a great amount , are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clear necessity be made out , to be employed at home . Such a necessity we do not believe to exist , and we are determined to make a full and fair experiment of the correctness of our opinion . We do not like to see our sons lose either the physical or mental character , by which they are adapted to our climate and to our social condition , although we would qualify them to travel , where circumstances permit , and inclination directs , for their own improvement and that of the commonwealth , after the basis of patriotism has been laid amidst the families in which they were bom , and among which we wish them to live . We believe that a college of the very best kind may be successfully conducted in a healthy situation near to this city , and we are ready to raise a liberal subscription for this purpose , as soon as a gentleman of experience , reputation , and acknowledged qualifications can be selected . Such a gentleman we are sadsfied we have in the late President of Transylvania University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , with a private class of Louisianians . Dr Holley has already had the care of many of our sons for years , and all of them are grateful to him for the instructions which he has liberally imparted , and for the parental attentions which he and his family have perseveringly shown to them . We ardently encourage the hope , that he may be induced to give up for the present his European tour , and establish himself permanently among us , as the superintendent of a college in our neighbourhood , and as a citizen of our State . We know the importance which he attaches to the sound and liberal principles that be- /z/ come an enlightened republic , and to the improvements wluch are now the objects of so much attention in a course of physical education in the Eastern institutions of our Atlantic border . Gymnastic and military exercises are found to be of great utility in promotmg health and strength , and may be considered as the best , if not the indispensable means of a perfect training of the body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . A provision will be made for these , that all the pupils , whose parents wish , may enjoy them . * We also know the high opinion which Dr HoUey entertains of the value and necessity of the modem languages , and of the accomplishments which unite to form the gentleman and the scholar in the present advanced state of society . Not only will Greek and Latin be taught at his college , but the most sedulous attention will be paid to the English , French , and Spanish languages . The literatiu'e of these is now more abundant and useful than the literature of departed nations . The course of mathematics , now of so much importance in the best schools of the country , will be as full and complete as any in the United States . * The immediate execution of this project is the object of the communication which we now lay before the friends and patrons of learning in New Orleans and its vicinity . We , who underwrite our names , engage , for the purpose here specified , to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , or within six months , or a year , the sums which we put down , expecting that at least thirty thousand dollars will be thus raised , which are to be devoted by him to the purchase , furniture , and general adaptation of a place in this neighbourhood , above or below the town , according to his judgment , after advice and information from some of our most judicious citizens , in an unquestionably healthy situation , for accomplishing , in the best manner , the ends already designated . We agree to let Dr Holley have the use of the sums , here named , for six years without interest , to encourage and enable him to make this establishment . /q/ We will either pay to him the money at the time the place purchased is conveyed to him , or we will give our notes with an endorsement to render them negotiable according to the known rules of men of business . The money is to be refiinded to us at the end of the time above mentioned , and the place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be more agreeable to a portion of the subscribers to make a donation of a small sum , rather than to loan a larger one , and thus to aid so valuable an object with less inconvenience , a provision of this kind is here introduced , and a colunm is arranged for such subscriptions . ' It is intended ultimately to establish schools of law and medicine in connexion with the college ; but the instruction of undergraduates claims our first attention , and is therefore the more immediate object of our present e &rts.'; A subscription was rapidly filling up , and a suitable and delightful situation , a few miles below the city , and near to the Battle Ground , was already the subject of negotiation . He engaged a connnodious house in the same vicinity , until arrangements could be made for more extended operations , and in order to be on the spot to conduct them . It was furnished , and every preparation made for the pupils already under his care , now on a visit to their friends , that on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eve of returning to their studies . The season had now advanced to the beginning of July . The weather , though serene and beautiful , was excessively hot . Persons who have never been in tropical climates in the summer months , have no idea of such heats , of their oppressive , prostrating influence . This influence , in the zeal and recklessness of self , incident to a new enterprise , was not taken into the account , and here was the great and fatal error . The proper course would have been , to have retired from the scene , until the season had become more propitious to mental , as well as bodily /z/ exercise . But the character of Dr Hdley 's mind , and it wais , as we have shown , an inheritance from his father , was remarkable for its impetuosity , both of purpose and execution* When he had willed , which he did almost with the quickness of intuition , he could not rest until he had also brought his plans into operation . There bemg now no obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them with great energy . His plan contemplated an absence from Louisiana during the acklj months , but the first year he thought required his presence , and having necessarily been detained so long , by important considerations , and the delays incident to them , he concluded to remain . He was moreover assured that there was but little danger out of the city . There might have been no danger upon certain conditions ; but those conditions are such as an active man can never attend to . When the more timid urged the contrary opinion , be did not wish to listen to it , and he would not be interrupted in his project . When , with extraordinary exertions , all was ready to commence the experiment , his manly and athletic form began to yield to the insidious and irresistible influence of climate . By constant exercise and exposure to the sun , debility , lassitude , and depression , the most annoying enemies to a vigorous man , overtook him . His active powers struggled long and nobly agamst the unseen foe . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discouragmg indeed . It was the more mortifying because not contemplated . Men of sanguine temperament are not always patient under bodily maladies ; his patience was now severely tried . It was dSecting to behdd a person so robust , a mind so noble , about to be overcome by so ignoble a foe . It was like a giant bound by innumerable silken threads . The struggle could not be long . To live , and not to act was impossible ; and to act in such intense heat , was out of the question . How could one , all life and animation , whose every moment was devoted to some intellectual pursuit , remain passive during the long months of /q/ summer ; how could so much time be wasted ? Thus , virtually , he reasoned . The perpetual sunshine , the ever blooming flowers , the soft air and rich perfumes , the luscious fruits , the now gentle Mississippi , diminished in volume , and like a mirror reflecting the verdant shores , or , as he called it , a sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sickened senses . The silence and solitude of man , amidst diis profusion of sweets , was itself full of melancholy . It was the language of deep sentiment addressed to the senses and the heaii , with force and pathos , while the understanding slept and mourned . The naked slaves , whose broad shoulders were scorching beneath the fervid sun , appeared to his disordered fancy with more than their real deformity . Nor was the effect diminished by the sound of their deep-toned voices chanting the midnight chorus to the dashing oar , as they bore to the market the fixiits of their toil . * One breath of air , ' he exclaimed , ' from the Northern shore of freedom , though borne upon the eastern gale , were worth all the boasted luxuries of the ever smiling , violet-scented South , alluring but to destroy . ' It was in vain that the common opinion was now urged upon him , that in this state of things any change would be hazardous ; that it would be safer to remain quiet , yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative than positive character , than to expose his irritable system to new and violent action . The resolution was taken , and , as if to brave every species of danger , he determined to go to New York . The sea air he thought would invigorate him , and a visit to his friends would restore the tone of his mind , and his spirits . The arrangements were speedily made . Everjrthing , hastily , with great fatigue and considerable exposure to the noonday sun , was adjusted . Neatness and order were soon restored to their primative chaos . The passage was taken in the first packet ship , and it is believed the only one of the season , which /z/ bore in its bosom , disease and death The ship Louisiana , not less conscious than its unfortunate inmates of its fatal commission , was destined , by that inscrutable Providence which guides its simplest agents with the same unerring wisdom as the nobler elements of the universe , to be the scene of the last act of the tragedy we are relating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly parents , for which his heart yearned , and to which his last pulsation was true , but to a better land , a better home - to Him , whose paternal attributes he loved to recognise , and contemplate , m a spirit of profound admiration and reverence , to that Father who dweUs in heaven . The letter which is here introduced - it is the last he ever wrote - will best exhibit the state of his mind , as well as of his physical system , on leaving New Orleans . ' New Orleans , July 19 1827. /z/ * Your mother 's letter has probacy informed you , before this time , that we are on the eve of embarking lot New YcMrk . The entire reason for this is the effect of the extreme heat upon my system . I became excessively bilious first , vomiting every evening for four days , and then was covered with a universal rash , denominated here and elsewhere , prickly heat . It is upon me now , and produces , after dinner and at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . This is not dangerous , but is a good symptom of a successfiil acclimation . The process , however , is peculiarly disagreeable , and keeps my physical system in such a state of irritation as to be almost beyond endurance . I am now satisfied that I should ultimately have good health in this climate , but I think it hazardous to spend the first summer here , although I have thrown off favorably the late bilious attack . The most trying season is yet to come , and I intend to fly from it . We are to embark in the Louisiana , on Sunday next , the twentysecond , a good ship , with a handsome and airy cabin . /q/ * We had just fixed ourselves at housekeeping when I was taken iD . We should have had our pupils with us in a day or two after I determined to break up and go north . Several of them had purchased their bedsteads and mattresses , and were ready to set out for my college . It was necessary for me to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been difficult to break up at all . I chose the alternative , as you see , and still think I did right , although I am now much better , and although your mother was for remaimng . We shall probably return here in November , as the patrons of the institution are determined to persevere in it , according tp the plan already adopted . They urge me to return , and the prospect here is unquestionably a good one . It must be acknowledged that the climate for nearly four months of the year is a great drawback on the pleasure of existence . This is compensated in part by the agreeableness of the air for the remamder . Had it continued to affect me as delightfully as at first , and as it seems to affect your mother yet , it would be a paradise ; but sometimes I feel as though immediate suffocation would take place . The sea breeze is feeble when it reaches us , and the still air of summer is remarkably oppressive . The whole twentyfour hours are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I always experience great depression then . Activity in the atmosphere is peculiarly important in New Orleans . When the thermometer does not vary , our sensations do , to a wonderfiil extent , as the air moves , or is still . When the breeze is firesh , if you take a comer or nook , where it is not felt , there seems to be no vitality in respiration . Judge Martin says , in his history of Louisiana , that the heat is not as oppressive in any of the West India Islands . After all this , there are very strong inducements to live here ; and here we shall probably spend the remainder of life , after our northern tour . Of this , however , we shall keep you informed , after we arrive in the Eastern States . Your afiectionate Father , Horace Hollet. ' /z/ As if there were a more than comnKHi charm in the idea of returning to the scenes of his youth , when on board the ship and the anchor weighed he recovered at once all the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last hospitalities at a fiiendly board , his spirit , moved with the fervor of excited feeling , exhibited that pla3rfulness and brilliancy which ever distinguished him on such occasions . Amidst the sparklings of wit , the kindest feelings were reciprocated in the usual expressions of Health and happmess ' on one side , A prosperous voyage and speedy return ' on the other . The last adieus , rendered touching by the retrospect , exchanged , the ship moved from the crowded Levie . It passed down the stream under the full pressure of sails , steam , and current , along that beautiful Coast , then exhibiting the richest luxuriance of nature , as if revelling in the glowing influence of the climate . The sweetest odors were wafted on every breeze from the wide waste of flowers . The shores on either side , studded with the elegant villas and cottages of the plantations , displayed their fields of young sugar-cane expanding its glossy leaves to the vivifjdng sun , now verging to the west . The scene was lovely and mspired his imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberance of Nature . It was a delicious evening . The heat was softened by the breeze created by rapid motion , and the heart by tender recollections of the fond regrets and affectionate wishes of friends , whose kmd hospitalities and generous attachment had consecrated the period of a short residence amongst them - a period as delightful as brief . He conversed , while passing the field of war , on the scenes of the glorious Eighth , their military and political bearings , of other points on the river of domestic or historical note , with the origin of their names , and their date - his excursive mind running over all that was remarkable m the past , or desirable in the future . He spoke of his own contemplated achievement in this glorious field of literary enterprise , giving to martial deeds also /q/ a classic celebrity . Alas ! to him there was to be no earthly future . The ship , hitherto conducted by that beautiful combination of nature and art , a steam tow-boat , was left to its own powers of locomotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken slumbers , after sending by the return boat , hasty and final adieus , and an ' All 's well ' to anxious and dear , some of them distant friends , we soon passed that venerable point of nautical celebrity , the residence of pilots , lights , and such other aids as the suffering , benighted mariner must often need , and always be grateful for - the Balize . The wind was fair and fresh . The canvass spread to the breeze . The ship , as if conscious of its self-moving power , went proudly on . Every heart within its enclosure beat high with hope and pleasure . Every eye was animated , with the inquiry . Who were its neighbours , and what were to be the enjoyments of these new associations - this new existence , where there was to be no business , no constraint , no care . The first object that arrested attention was a vessel aground , which three days before had been borne down the stream as gayly and as triumphantly as the Louisiana , the captain just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence from the pilot was appalling - nay , to Greek and Roman philosophy would have conveyed a dark and fearful omen . But as Christians we passed on m hope and confidence , thanking Heaven for our happier lot , our perfect security from similar danger . It was interesting to trace the different passes , or outlets , of this great river , diverging like the ragged and extended roots of an aged oak ; to observe the bodies of soil and vegetation brought down by the immense volume of the spring current , and deposited in ridges just discernible above the surface of the water , corresponding with the passes , and annually encroaching upon the sea . Next came the strongly marked line which divides the turbid river from the emerald gulf , before it gives place to the dark deep blue of the ocean . Entered upon that world of waters , to the eye as boundless as the ocean , it pre- /z/ seated to the imagmation an emblem of eternity . To some of the company how near was that ocean of time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuQ of novel and curious matter for speculation . So many people of different countries , characters , views , and pursyits , suddenly brought together m so small a space , in a sort of domestic relation , requiring reciprocal offices of good will and forbearance , afford abundant scope for reflection . Such a mind as has been described , placed in a situation so new , having passed rapidly ( farougfa scenes so various and interesting , could not but have its sensibilities awakened in an uncommon degree . Among the passengers were several gentlemen of Louiana , distinguished alike for their intelligence and courtesy . With these Mr Holley discoursed often and long , taking a wide range over the fields of literature , cridcism , and poetry ; the wonders of nature and of art ; and the variety , capacity and astonishing adaptation to all its purposes , of the human character . He spoke of Louisiana , and of his contemplated project ; for although the singular , and to him almost insupportable influence of the climate had for the moment disinclined him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthful feeling revived his ardor for their prosecution and consummation . He spoke of returning to resume his labors , with renovated health , at the season favorable to mental action . He even dwelt with enthusiasm on the excellence of his plan ; the libera and generous views of the gentiemen who had been active in promoting it ; and the certainty of success . ' But who shall avert the divine decree - who dispute its unerring wisdom ? ' as elegantiy expressed by the pen of an accomplished female , who , in common with many persons in that land of sensibility , regarded with sympathy the melancholy event . Les desfseins de la Providence seront toujours couverts d'un voile impenetrable k la firagile humanity , qui court k sa perte . ' For the first four days , with the exception of the dSsagrimens of sea-sickness , the voyage was delightfid . It was like a /q/ party of pleasure , and some of the company were ready to exclaim , ' How charming it is to be at sea ! ' The most perfect harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a circumstance of the least unpleasant nature to mar the scene , except a slight indisposition of one of the passaigers , which called forth the sympathy and attention of the rest , but excited no alarm* Though this gendeman manifested , at times , symptoms of delirium , he was dressed , walking the deck , and , as it was hoped , recovering . On the fourth day , in particular , when the eflcts of seasickness had subsided , the most perfect contentment and satisfaction lighted up every countenance . The weather was fine . The sun 's fervor was softened by a gende breeze , which wafted the ship smoothly on its course , while , with the best possible spirits , not only from the happy influences of the present , but from the fond anticipations of a speedy meeting with friends , all yielded to the simple though various occupations of a sea life . Some were gazing on the immense profound , and watching the gambols of the sharks , porpoises , and dolphins , with their attendant the flying fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively frail bark seeming a world in the midst of infinity . Some were interested in the little contrivances that fiimish the amuse ment of a ship , where no one is disposed for serious occupation , but every one for ease , and those gentie exercises of skill , or imagination , which belong to a passive life - to games of chance , or to contemplative reveries , according to the disposition or habits of the individual ; all serving to beguile die moments , and to soothe , without fatiguing , the mind . Having dined , the passengers were on deck , inhaling , as they thought , the health-giving breeze , and disposed in groups according to their elective affinities , attracted by conversation or song ; and one was striking the lively guitar . As if to increase by contrast the horrors of the scenes which were soon to follow , all was peace and joy and delightful presentiment . Those who preferred the loftier themes of philosophy , of whom was our gift- /z/ ed friend , gave the bright moments to moral sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That noble mind , like the fabulous bird , which , about to expire , breathes its richest notes , beamed in brightness then . It was the last illumination of that brilliant intellect . The sun sunk beneath the wave . The wind stifiened . There was a solemn darkness and a sullen swell of the sea , which seemed portentous . The ship rolled and tossed ; the elements grew angry ; the storm began . All was dismay . Every individual silendy crept to the nearest couch . The writer , impelled by a dreadful sickness , dropped upon a settee on the deck , a quiet witness of the tremendous scene . Every man was at his post . Every voice was hushed , save that of the captain , whose hoarse tones mingling with the blast , gave the word of command to the fearless , faithful mariners . The tempest howled , the lightning flashed in such a blaze of brightness , as , for the instant , gave to every object , with magnified dimensions , the distinctness of day . The giddy masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and successively manned by the hardy and the brave , alternately rising in the air and dipping in the surge , presented to the eye of the silent , suffering spectator , a reality that needed no effect from the coloring of fancy . At intervals might be heard the groans of the dying ; for at twelve this night the sick passenger expired , adding an awful and religious solemnity to a moment of terrific grandeur . AH these circumstances formed a scene of dismay which required not the force of contrast to deepen it . And tiiough the skilful sailor , in a good ship , on the broad sea , fears no danger , to the inexperienced landsman there was enough of the natural and moral sublime . To the timid there was an effect which no imagination could heighten ; to the female heart a touching power which no language could portray . Those /q/ profound for utterance . The penetrated soul could but look up to that Bemg , who alone can hush the mighty storm and bid the waves be still . But terrible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disasters which were to follow . Whilst gazing upon this conflict of nature , and deprecating its fatal issue , no thought occurred of other danger . But amidst the war of elements without , the silent and insidious agents of death were effecting , with less erring aim , the work of destruction within . The morning light brought to view , not only the ragmg surge , but the equally raging fever . Headaches , and other forms of indisposition prevailed . The deceased passenger , with as much order and decency as the motion of the ship would admit of , the last sad rites performed , was committed to his ocean grave . The prayers , though short , were solemn arid heartfelt . To those whose strength and spirits were prostrated , and especially to the occupant of the settee , who had to resign it for the last office to the dead , and then resume it agam , there being no other , this ceremony seemed no very auspicious omen . But with that blunted sensibility , which irresistible calamities never fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly awaited their fate . The subject of this memoir , having slept , or rather watched , below , came , with difficulty , upon deck , clinging by all the objects m his way , his temples throbbing , and complaining of excessive lassitude , nausea , and headache . He inquired of one and another if it was usual for sea-sickness - he had not before experienced that evil - to be attended with such violent symptoms . Assured that it often happened , and that there was no cause of alarm , he quietly resigned himself to the influence of a disease , which , had it been suspected , might possibly , at this stage of it , have been arrested . Three days and nights the storm without , and disease vdthin , continued their force unspent . One and another of the crew fell victims , while others sunk and rose again . Such /z/ medicines were administered as are emplyed in common cases , and as were compatible with the situation of the sufierers a situation but litde adapted to the comforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question . A still , dark room , a bed of suitable with constant and careful attendants - any one circumstance included in the word home , had been more than luxury . Let those who would leam die full meanmg of that dearest of all names , experience a distressmg , paralyzing illness at sea , and they will know its iull import . Hitherto no one had expressed a fear of a dangerous disease on board , so little do we feel and understand impending evil . It now became calm , and there was time and opportunity to attend to the suffering and helpless . The danger of Dr Holley 's situation became too apparent . His eyes were half closed , his mind wandering . The same medicines were repeated , the doses doubled , and aU other means of relief applied , which the kind hearted , though unskilled , in their goodness could command . The disease which in its early stages might perhaps have been checked , had now acquired force and strength , and soon triumphed over one of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fifth of the disease , and the thirtrfirst of the month , was the fatal day . The sun rose in all the brightness and intense heat of a tropical region . It was a dead calm . Not a breath of air skimmed the surface of the sea , or fanned the burning brow of the sufferer . The writer of this article , who still lay in silent anguish , a speechless spectator of the scene , expected , while conscious of anything but distress , to be the next victim , and who , losmg at times even all sense of suffering in the womanish feeling occasioned by the circumstance of there not being a female hand to perform the last sad offices of humanity , has a confused recollection of horror , of the solemn looks of the passengers pacing to and firo upon the deck , of a deathlike stillness , broken by groans , and half uttered sentences , and of a little soft voice trying to soothe the last moments , and to interpret /q/ the last accents of his dying parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carried to the spot , or to realize that it meant death . When the groans and spasms had ceased , it seemed to be only a release from pain , a temporary sleep . When all was hushed , and the report of pistols , and the fumes of burning tar announced the fatal issue , trusting in that Divine Being , into whose presence she expected soon to be ushered , believing , as far as reflection had exercise , that the separation was but for a little space , she heard , with the firmness of despair , and with silent awe , the parting waters receive the scarce breathless form of him who had been her pride and boast , as he had been the admiration of all to whom he was . known - his winding sheet a cloak , his grave the wide ocean , his monument the everlastbg Tortugas - all this she heard and lives . Days of protracted suflFering passed heavily on . During the long nights of sleepless anguish , the only wakeful eye being his at the neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solemn stillness , like some soft spirit of the air chanting a requiem to the dead. * That the author lives to tell the story , is matter , perhaps , of greater surprise to herself than to others ; for who could know the extent of her suflferings and her danger ? It need not , if it could be told , how returning strength and increased sensibility brought also that mental anguish which attends a clearer sense of calamity , of the blow which prostrated , which crushed every hope of life , but did not quite destroy . But it may not in gratitude be omitted to state how that ebbing life was sustained . Unprotected and helpless , and with only the glimmerings of reason , the writer was thrown upon the mercy of strangers . To man , in this case , may be ascribed * The child had a habit of singing to himself , and being feverish and wakeful , his voice might be heard for hours in the night , as he lay in his birth . As it was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it from their slumbers in the cabin below , would come to him and feel his pulse to discover if it proceeded from delirium. /z/ that praise which our countryman Ledyard so liberaDy bestowed on woman . * It is grateful to the philanthropist to observe such spontaneous goodness . It is delightful to those who admire the wisdom and goodness of God 's works , to be able to bear testimony to the disinterested benevolence of abused human nature . It is a duty in those who experience such goodness , and such benevolence to make the sacred record , f To the passengers , and to the Captab and officers of the ship , this praise is due . By them , under Heaven , the writer 's life was pireserved . From them , not only respect , but every delicate attention was experienced . Their voyage was rendered unpleasant and tedious , having continually to act the physician and nurse , to suffer privation and annoyance from groans , sighs , and lamentations , with all the other dismal attendants of severe illness , with constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , not a murmur escaped them . They cheerfully administered to the wants of the dying , and the scarcely living . That breath which should be spent m praise to God , and thanks to them , were worth preserving , if but to express this unaffected tribute of gratitude . One more struggle and this melancholy narrative is closed . A death-bed scene is always solemn , always impressive . We can not look with unconcern upon the last moments of the humblest individual , much less upon one who has been so distinguished . When genius and talent are taken from the world , our sensibility is more deeply engaged , our reflections more profoundly exercised . * See Sparks 's Ledyard , p. 264. * t Upon the whole/ says the great traveller , * mankind have used me well . I feel myself much indebted for that urbanity which I always thought more general than many think it to be ; and were it not for the mischievous laws , and bad examples of some governments I have passed through , I am persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of our fellow creatures , p. 189 . Hospitality I have found as universal as the face of man . ' Life of Ledyard , p. 202. /q/ The writer feels that there must be some who would experience a mournful pleasure in being admitted to a nearer view of the last end of him , whose history has been briefly traced in the preceding pages . There may be others who are only curious to inquire , as matter for cavil , if that great mind , whose elevation they could not reach , was not appalled by a retrospect of its own sentiments on the approach of death . Into the particulars of Dr Holley 's death-bed scene , it is not to be expected that the writer of this narrative can possibly enter . Neither her condition at the time , nor her feelings now , permit the effort . But she trusts she is not wanting in that knowledge of the subject , or that degree of self-command , which may enable her to give a correct , though general view of it . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , whether near or remote . For the friends of the deceased , it is proper to relate , that the views of religion he professed , were those which make the best preparation for life , or for death . He was always ready die . L many persons recoUect his often expreid vdl that his death might be sudden . The doctrine he preached , and endeavoured to illustrate as well as inculcate , was , that in order to die well we must live well . He had no great respect for that preparation which is got up for the occasion . He believed that the example and precepts of the Saviour demonstrated the same doctrine . The issue of this faith he was willing to leave with the Supreme Being , to whose will we should be resigned in death as in life . Few men were more intimate than he with the scriptures , or sought more diligently for the divine will , whether expressed in them , or manifested in the works of creation . His was not therefore a blind faith . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . It was the result of light and evidence earnesdy sought for , diligently collected , and faithfully considered . It was the food of that hope which never , for a moment , withdrew its enlivening beams - which cheered him in health and prosperity , sustained /z/ him in sickness and adversity , and , while reason remamed , extended its influence to his latest hours . While his friends , therefore , have reason to rejoice in the abundant splendor and usefulness of his life , his enemies can gather fixm his death nothing to serve them as a ground of triumph . He exhibited , at all times , that sereneness and calm confidence of soul which belong only to the man , * Whose yesterdays look backward with a smile . Nor like the Parthian , wound him as they fly . '
