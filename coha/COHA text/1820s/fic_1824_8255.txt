Longfellow , Henry Wadsworth , 1807-1882 : Daughter of Coelus ! as of old from " Daughter of Coelus ! as of old " ( 1824 ) I. 1 . Daughter of Coelus ! Footnote : 1Kb as of old The lute of Memnon , to the morning strung , Sweetly Hyperion 's welcome sung , His sapphire crown and glittering car of gold ,  --  The breathing shell salutes thine ear ; O , from thy arching house appear ! Thou , that in ancient day didst give to earth Beauty in the Muse 's birth , For whose embrace the doting god , in love , Forsook his starry courts above , And sought thy silvan bower , and wooed A love so pure as thine in some more gentle mood . 2 . And thou , the master of each song , Footnote : 1Kb Whose voice was musick and the breath of love , Solemn Enchanter ! that above On Fancy 's seraph pinion sailed along , And rode the stormy cloud on high , Whilst rapture lit thy searching eye ; Sweetly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And touch the golden lute , whilst round The lyre of more majestic sound Breathes loud and deep with solemn swell , Till listening Echo speaks from her enchanted cell . 3 . Silver Avon ! as the dirge Of evening , by thy twilight verge , Wandering winds sung faint and far , And Titan plunged his burning car Deep in the western surge , There he , to Nature 's worship kneeling , In devotion 's purest feeling , Touched the love-enticing viol , Whilst the listening goddess smiled , And , to more ambitious trial , Every tone his hand beguiled ! And we can trace that Genius in its flight , Like the fierce eagle , with an eye of fire And untamed pinion , to a dizzy height And brightness more intense , till we admire The dauntless spirit and the undazzled eye , That scanned the azure deep of the abyss on high . II . 1 . Mighty Magician ! round thy throne , When thou didst wave thy golden wand , how came The Passions , soothed to gentler frame ! Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear , and haggard Care , Revenge , and silent , sad Despair !  --  Young Love came smiling through his tears , and Joy Led to thee the smiling boy , Though lynx-eyed Jealousy stood near And listened with a cunning ear ; Whilst Melancholy , from the shade Of russet woodlands came , sad , broken-hearted maid ! 2 . As fervently Pygmalion prest Erst the cold marble , till with life it glowed , So , from thy birth , the passion flowed , Tempered to chaste sensation , in thy breast , For the coy nymph of modest eye , Nature 's sweet child , Simplicity , Till the pure essence of her birth became Thine , and her 's the holy flame , That burned within thy bosom 's sacred shrine :  --  And not with love more pure than thine The daughters fair of Pyrrha 's race Gave to Deucalion 's sons their youth and virgin grace . 3 . When thy soul , to rapture wrought , Inspiration 's brightness caught , Freer than the morning wind , It left this dwindling world behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ambitious ever , Reached to more sublime endeavour !  --  Child of song ! thou didst inherit Amphion 's fire and untamed pride , And the Theban 's Footnote : 1Kb eagle spirit Soaring o'er Ismenus ' tide . Yet to more soft enchantment did thy hand Sweep the light chords of Sappho 's thrilling lute , As by Ilissus ' stream in Grecian land Her fingers taught the chastened chord to suit A broken spirit ,  --  and the quivering wire Breathed to the echoing air with Love 's decaying fire . III . 1 . Softly , as when the zephyr 's wing Fans the soft chord at evening 's holy tide , Or , where the babbling waters glide , The breathing lute , with melancholy string , Sounds sadly to the morning gale When night withdraws her sable veil , Could the enchanter Love 's divine control Soothe to numbers sweet thy soul , And give to feeling a more hallowed tone ;  --  And so , when from her solemn throne Grief touched with chastening hand thy heart , It beat to sadder measures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageant train ! And , as from angel harps soft musick breaks , When the unfettered spirit takes Its farewell parting from the world and pain , So , on the ravished ear grows mute The musick of the love-strung lute ! Again the seraph sings from yon light cloud ;  --  Mimick Echo laughs aloud , Where Comus and his Bacchanalian band Of Satyrs , moving hand in hand , And sylvan nymphs , with roses crowned , The car of Thalia draw with lutes of silver sound . 3 . Not unto the Paphian Queen , Moving in her silver sheen , Be the song , for now is hung O'er his tomb the lyre unstrung , And wreathed with cypress sad ! See , see its master-spirit languish ! Tuned each quivering chord to anguish , Till , with madness in its numbers , Bursts the string , HE swept before ! Never , woken from its slumbers , Never , hand may sweep it more ! The earth has taken back the dust it gave , And sadly now , with melancholy eye , Afflicted Memory lingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genius sigh , Whilst there the pilgrim 's solemn footsteps turn , And Beauty weeps at night o'er Love 's forsaken urn.
