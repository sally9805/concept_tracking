Pipkin Corporal of the Guard , ( the Corporal advances , ) pursue the deserters directly , and bring them safe to camp , ( here the Corporal touches his up to the Colonel , and retires . ) An example , ( continues the Colonel ) must be made of these men , otherwise the service is ruined .

Pipkin You , gentlemen , who compose this court martial , are no doubt , well aware , that the sixty-fourth article of the rules and articles of war prescribes , that " General courts-martial may consist of any number of commissioned officers , from five to thirteen . " It would , in the language of that article , have been in this our emergency to the " manifest , injury of the service , had a larger number been convened , and even as it is , the army is subjected to great inconvenience by the detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed . Relying on your integrity I entertain the most earnest belief that the prisoners will have ample justice at your heads .

In consequence of the recommendation of the court in favour of the following , viz. James Arnold , Burwell Hobby . Thomas Wood , John Manning .

" By Command : Robert Butler , Adj . Gen. ( Exit Pipkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes , denoting that the order of the General has been carried into effect . Enter an Adams and a Jackson-man . Adams-man . An Adams-man Say , brother Bulletbutton , what do you think of your hero , the general now ? Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Why , comrade , Turncoat , I think of him as I have ever done , that he is a brave and good man . Adams-man . An Adams-man For sartin , you do n't mean to call him good after ordering the late bloody deed . Jackson-man . A Jackson-man What bloody deed ? Adams-man . An Adams-man Why now man , do n't think to bamboozle me . Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Bamboozle , you talk gibberish , what do you mean ? Adams-man . An Adams-man Why , the murder of the six militious men to be sure . Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Who murdered them ? Adams-man . An Adams-man Who ! ! ! ( with surprise . ) Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Yes , who ? Adams-man . An Adams-man Your hero , the general . Jackson-man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Old Hickory a murderer  --  why , consider Turncoat , ( pulling Turncoat first one side and then another , ) you must surely have not only your feet , but your head turned  --  call my old general a murderer , who never hurt a hair of a man 's head , is enough to make a saint swear  --  call Old Hickory a murderer , who has saved the lives of millions , is downright slanderation . General Jackson had no more to do with the shooting of the deserters than the sun is the moon . Adams-man . An Adams-man Well , who had then ? Jackson-man . A Jackson-man No matter , though I could say , yet is not proper to be telling on others  --  it 's sufficient for my purpose to ' suade you that General Jackson is no more a murderer , no , not so much on one as you are for he does not murder reputation as you do , when you come bolt out with charging him as the murderer of men perhaps he never saw , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans waiting for the red jackets , who instead of stinging him , fell by the Kentuck rifles . They say Old Hickory can not spell rifle , but John Bull as well as Uncle Sam , can bear witness that he knows how to shoot one . Adams-man . An Adams-man All I know is , people talk about General Jackson shooting the militious men for going home when they had served their time out . Jackson-man . A Jackson-man It 's no such thing , the law said they must be drafted for six months , and ' stead of behaving like men , and staying until discharged , they deserted , and mutinied , and made the other men do the same , so that the law , and not the General , had them shooted . Adams-man . An Adams-man The law ! Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Yes , the martial law , so say no more about Old Hickory and murder . Why , man you mought , for the varsal warld , just as well say , Chief Justice Marshall ,  --  I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil chief , as difference in respect from milontary chieftain , what Mr. Clay , the Scratchitary of State , I think they say he is , calls Old Hickory ,  --  But I was saying , as how , you mought as well say , that civil Chief Justice Marshall , is a murderer , if he sentence a person , whether man , woman or child unborn , to be hanged , who the law says is guilty of death . Adams-man , An Adams-man ( not seeming exactly to understand his comrade 's mode of reasoning . ) O ! is that it . Jackson-man . A Jackson-man I declare I tell you the honest revarnished truth , and not a word more  --  that Old Hickory had no more hand in the construction of the six miluntary men , than civil Chief Justice Marshall would have in sentencing a poor cretur to be hanged , whom the jury had found guilty of a crime punishable with death  --  or the Governdor of Maryland for signing a death warrant , or Mr. Adams himself , who has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams-man " May bees do n't fly about this time of year . " Mr. Adams ! Mr. John  --  Quincy-Adams sign a death-warrant ? I ca n't for sartin , sure , bleave no such thing  --  ( going . ) Jackson-man . A Jackson-man Stop . Why man did n't you knowed that afore ? Adams-man . An Adams-man No ! ( with wonder . ) Jackson-man . A Jackson-man It 's the truth as I 'm a hickory-man ; that seems somehow odd howsever , when I 'm made of dust and not wood ; any how it 'll do , for dust , that is saw dust , comes of hickory wood  --  ergo  --  I 'm an hickory-man , but as I was saying , as I 'm an hickory-man , it 's true that Mr. Adams may have signed more than six , aye , sixty death-warrants , but that 's neither here nor there , General Jackson no more murdered the six deserters than I murdered a horse chestnut . Adams-man . An Adams-man Huzza for Jackson ! sixty death-warrants ! aha ! Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! huzza ! Huzza ! Enter a Subaltern . Subaltern . Corporal Halloo ! what is the matter  --  are you here making a hubbub , when you should be brushing up . Adams-man . An Adams-man Brushing up ! for who , or what ? Subaltern . Corporal Who , why Jineral Jackson , and as to what come along with me , and you 'll soon know .  --  ( Exeunt Adams-man , Jackson-man and Subaltern . ) SCENE III .

May the Hero of Orleans triumph over his accusers by proving himself a military chieftain , since he as a military chieftain saved the country , while his accuser was crying peace , when there was no peace for us poor maidens . Jacintha . Jacintha A second Joan of Arc truly . Well Euphronia phronis , I like something of the heroine , and I find you are a true one ; I fervently join you in wishing success to our brave champion . Euphronia .

Enter a Maiden Attendant Maiden Attendant with a Basket of Flowers , which she leaves on the stage and retires . Come ( continues Euphronia , ) let us , Jacintha examine this fresh offering to our deliverer , whom even the pious sisterhood of our convent can not but view with regard , since , when disturbed in their vigils , before the dawn of the ever memorable eighth , by the cry of all invading army , the calendar which pointed out the prayers for the day , was opened , it indicated the conspicious name of Saintess Victoria . ( Here she takes the flowers out of the basket and arranges them in wreaths . ) Jacintha . Jacintha And in compliment to the tutelar lady victory was shouted ' ere daylight was shut out . Euphronia . Euphronia What sound is that ? Enter another Female Attendant . Attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson is coming . Euphronia .

Andrew Jackson ( Takes the crown , but declines placing it on his head . ) Fair one , excuse my not wearing the crown , however I may prize it , since to be honoured with your approbation is more gratifying to me , than the most brilliant diadem .
