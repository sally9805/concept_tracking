Percival , James Gates , 1795-1856 : I. TRUST IN GOD . from Clio ( 1822 ) Thou art , O Lord ! my only trust , When friends are mingled with the dust , And all my loves are gone ; When earth has nothing to bestow , And every flower is dead below , I look to thee alone . Thou wilt not leave , in doubt and fear , The humble soul , who loves to hear The lessons of thy word ; When foes around us thickly press , And all is danger and distress , There 's safety in the Lord . The bosom friend may sleep below The churchyard turf , and we may go To close a lov 'd one 's eyes ; They will not always slumber there , We see a world more bright and fair , A home beyond the skies . And we may feel the bitter dart , Most keenly rankling in the heart , By some dark ingrate driven ; In us revenge can never burn , We pity , pardon ; then we turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thou , O Lord ! who shield'st my head , And draw'st thy curtains round my bed , I sleep secure in thee ; And O ! may soon that time arive , When we before thy face shall live Through all eternity .
