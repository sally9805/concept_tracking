txt ART . 11. - On the complaints in . dmerica against the British Press . . ln Essay in the New London Monthly Magazine for February , 1821 . Tnt laws of reviewing , like the laws of war , seem to have provided some small alleviations for the inherent cruelty of the pursuit . In war , it is considered honorable and lawful , to storm a town and put man , woman , and child to the sword ; and to turn armies into a defenceless district and subsist them on the plunder of a ruined peasantry is a practice , if not formally authorized by the international code , far too common to be thought strange . But to poison wells and massacre unarmed prisoners are held highly inhuman and barbarous ; and it takes a good deal of patient reasoning on the one hand to reconcile a person of timid nerves to an unrestrained use of Congreve rockets , charged with tartarean sulphur and strange fire , ' or to bring him wholly to feel delight , on the other hand , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , and blows up a frigate in the dark . So in reviewing , and we may say periodical and anonymous writing *n general , to judge from the most respectable precedents on both sides of the water , a pretty wide range is authorized by the common law of the literary republic ; and it is permitted under the names of remark , stricture , observation , and reply , to mix up a good share of heterogeneous materials , and to make tolerably free use of that particular figure of speech , // which the gods call misrepresentation , but for which the plain spoken men have invented a shorter name . All this , however , is thought to fall within the limits of authorized literary warfare while a kind of sullen courtesy dictates an abstinence from gross personalities , and has especially made it a part of etiquette , in the various critical journals of a respectable class , to abstain from direct controversy with each other . We have no disposition to break through this usage , as regards our brethren beyond the sea ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to avail ourselves of it . We have accordingly confined ourselves , in general , to those passing allusions and references , which can not well be spared in a journal , that would keep the current of the literature of the day ; and in a single instance only have ever undertaken a formal reply to any thing , which has appeared in the English periodical works . We are led to wish to continue in this course , not the more from considerations of propriety , than of convenience . A half anonymous controversy is a game too unequal to be wisely played ; and in engaging in it one is never sure that he may not find himself involved in a contest with those who , however weak their cause , possess the advantage of having nothing at stake ; whom it is impossible to silence , and no credit to refute . The essay at the head of this article has appeared to us to justify a departure from the general practice , and to form an exception to the maxims to which we have alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a journal , for which has been industriously claimed the recommendation of a name , to which none would pay a more cordial deference than ourselves . We have strong reasons , which will appear in the course of our remarks , for hoping , as well as believing , that no sanction is due from that quarter , to the statements made and sentiments expressed in the essay in question . We are willing , however , to testify our regard to the distinguished person who has been represented as the conductor of the New Monthly Magazine , by a more particular notice than we should otherwise permit ourselves of remarks , which we are compelled to think not to be throughout deserving of his patronage . We do this the rather as the essay in question furnishes us with a convenient opportunity of illustrating the mode of speaking and writing , with regard to this country , which still finds favor in England ; of which , being itself expressly occupied in treating the subject , it must be allowed to be a fair example . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the British press ; ' and the immediate topics of it are suggested by Air Walsh 's dppeal , and the review of that work in our own journal for April 1820 . The spirit , in which this production is written may be estimated from the motives ascribed , in its first paragraph , to those American writers , who defend their country against the alleged injuries done her , by the English press . These are compendiously assumed to be the ambition of a self-sufficient and irritable author to create a bustle about himself , ' or if not that , a more expanded fretfulness in behalf of his country . We think that the imputation of such motives and feelings would come better at the end , than at the beginning of an article ; and we see nothing to exempt it from the operation of the common law of construction , that promptly to ascribe mean and unworthy springs of action , proves nothing so certainly , as that he who makes the charge is himself obnoxious to it . This holds in all cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers how much has been said to the disparagement of this country in England , in all quarters alike the low and the high ; the number of low bred persons who have fled , some of them from the clutches of justice in their own country , to traverse and vilify ours , and whose slanders , by being incorporated into the most respectable literary journals , have acquired an importance , to which even the strongest complaisance in them would not otherwise have raised them ; when one considers that from the correspondence of a minister of state down to the schoolboy 's declamation , the English public has shown itself a too willing patron of abuse of America , we do think it somewhat unfair to speak of any reply on our part , however passion .. ate in itself , as irritable and fretful . Our press was long , very long silent ; and did little but meekly reprint the calumnies , which were sent over to us , as our brethren at Edinburgh justly state , in another connexion , by the bale and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought proper to lay before the public a most ample refutation of most of these aspersions , and what probably constitutes the main indication of irritability and fretfulness , ' an alarming offset and parallel to most of the dark shades , with which the English pencil has saddened the portrait of America ; and now that we , in our humble capacity , have reviewed that work , in a style sinning , we are quite sure , far more by its temperance than its warmth , we // hold it no strong trait of generous warfare , to give us no credit for better motives and a better spirit . Nor is the regret with which we notice this general want of liberality at all diminished , by the particular allegations and statements of the writer of the essay . We hope it is not wholly our American simplicity , that makes us turn with something like disgust from charges of considerable exaggeration , and occasionally , we regret to observe , either direct falsehoods or suppressions that amount to falsehoods , ' made in the first instance against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is due to all of whom we speak by name . And when we add , what will not have escaped the readers of the essay in question , that these charges of falsehood and suppression want the only sanction which should have induced any one to make them  --  the sanction of a clear specification and distinct proof , we think we have given one good reason for doubting whether the essay be entitled to protection , as comm6 from the respectable source to which it has been ascribed . We know not but we shall expose ourselves to a repetition of the charge of fretful and irritable retort ; but being thus accused before the American and English public of direct falsehoods , or suppressions that amount to falsehoods , ' we shall ask our readers ' attention to one or two passages , which will show at least with what clearness of conscience the author of this essay has cast the first stone . We can perceive , ' says he , from the tone of Mr Walsh 's book and of his Boston reviewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit far exceeding that of an ordinary literary quarrel . They have labored hard to impress upon . /Imerica , that she has become in this country the object of systematic hatred and contumely . ' This is distinct and tangible . We therefore ask our readers ' permission to repeat a few lines from our article , which is alluded to by this writer , and on which , as far as we are concerned , he rests his assertion . After having stated our opinion , that the praise and blame , alternately bestowed on America in England , have often had no other foundation in that country , than reasons of party annoyance , on the part of the ministry and opposition respectively , we add , meantime we , who like all honest people wish to be thought and spoken well of in the world , and are sorely perplexed with this pitiless pelting from all quarters , are too apt , it may be , to generalize on the subject , and to suppose that there is a systematic and organized // hostility to us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate such an hostility , may be more easily accounted for . ' * We then proceed to find this account partly in the wish of the English government to discourage emigration ; but still more in the fault finding spirit apt to infest not only English travellers in America , but all travellers in all countries . We particularly quote other instances of this , in the case of other nations , and we express the opinion , that much of what has found its way into the most respectable journals in England is to be laid to the personal account of the unknown individual writers . Nor is it , till after all these qualifications , that we add the remark , that we do not wish to have it inferred that there is really no settled , regular hostility to America , in any portion of the English community . ' And we explain this portion to be the relics of the old antiAmerican party of the revolutionary age . Now after these statements and qualifications , in making which we certainly could not expect the approbation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry much farther than we their conceptions of British hostility , it gives us no very exalted opinion of the candor of this writer , or of the conscientiousness with which he deals out his charges of falsehood , to find him accusing us of labouring hard to impress upon America , that she has become in England the object of systematic hatred and contumely . ' But we hope to make this matter a little plainer , and settle one point at least in the controversy , viz : the discretion of this combatant . With the generality of our readers , ' saith he , it might indeed be sufficient to assert and to appeal to their own knowledge of the fact , that in this country America is the object of no such hatred or contempt ; but as the Boston critic has boldly cited some examples to the contrary , we may as well stop to examine how far his selection has been fortunate . ' He accordingly quotes , as one of the examples of systematic hatred and contempt , boldly cited by us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Edinburgh Review , an article which we on the contrary cite as an example of the very reverse , and on which we make this remark ; many of the attacks made on us , especially in the journals of the opposition , may well be ascribed to the personal feeling of the unknown individual who writes them , and // not to any supposed party , far less of the nation . ' Though this writer , therefore , did well to stop to examine how far our selection had been fortunate , ' he would have done better to stop longer , and be sure that he did not represent us as citing that for one purpose , which we cited for the very opposite . Though somewhat weary of pursuing this topic , we shall furnish a little further illustration of the principles of this writer , who calls persons by name , and charges them with falsehood . Here is praise enough , one should think , for national vanity of an ordinary appetite , but Mr Smith has had the arrogance to glance at two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston critic seems particularly sore ,  --  the scantiness of their native literature , and the institution of slavery , the greatest curse and stain upon a civilized community ; and this foul proceeding on the part of the reverend reviewer has cancelled all the merit of his previous panegyric . ' Here are implied two facts , one that we shewed ourselves to be sore on the subject of the scantiness of the American literature ; ' the second , that we took offence at the reviewer s allusion to the existence of slavery in this country . To these charges we have to reply , that in all our article there is no allusion whatever , to the subject of the scantiness of our national literature ; there is no attempt made to explain , to deny , to palliate it ; the topic is not glanced at . As to slavery , after proving that this greatest curse and stain upon a civilized community ' was introduced into America , while it was a colony of England , supported here by the English government against the express petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions against the slave trade twenty and thirty years before the English abolition , our remarks had no further object , than to deplore the decision of the Missouri question made by Congress in 1820 ; remarks , for which we were duly censured , in the journals of the Southern States . We trust , moreover , that there are not many Englishmen who will deny the justice of the following observation made in the same connexion : As far as the reproach of holding slaves goes , England is as deeply involved in it as America ; her colonies being all stocked with them , the fruits of their labours regularly sent home to old England , and their treatment no better , if as good , as in America . ' Whatever may be thought of this , we did not prepare ourselves to be accused *s the champions of // slavery , nor do we think such a charge reflects great credit on the discrimination of him who makes it . There are one or two other illustrations of the principles , on which this writer thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these . We proceed to what is of far greater moment than himself or ourselves , that is , the real merits of the dispute between England and America , as far as they are touched in this essay . And here we shall pursue no close method , but take up the different points , as they are successively suggested by this writer . The first then , which demands attention , is one of importance . The author of this essay would persuade us , that the abuse , of which America complains on the part of England , is only a little harmless pleasantry . Did they never pass by one of our caricature shops , where kings and queens , ministers and oppositionists , judges and bishops , and every man , woman , and child , who has had the good fortune to be of sufficient celebrity for the purpose , are regularly gibbeted for the entertainment of a people , who consider one of their most glorious privileges to be that of laughing at their superiors ? ' Here we are almost afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are afraid that our brethren of the English nation-known in either hemisphere for their modesty-*- ' . are making game of us vain Americans . It can not be with any other design than that of extorting amusement from our credulous self-conceit , that we are bid to put the Edinburgh Review and the Quarterly Review , and Lord Grey and Mr Canning , on the level with the makers and venders of caricatures , and our simple country on the height of kings and queens , judges and bishops ; and that amidst all the charges rung upon us from grave to gay , from lively to severe , ' we must remember it is only a rude , boisterous populace , laughing at their superiors . If we may venture to he serious , we would say , that while this injustice to our country was really confined to the low sources here pretended , a silence and disdain which they owed to themselves were maintained by the respectable writers of this country . It was only when tourists , to whom grammar was a mystery and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English bailiffs to America and back again from the American constables to England , it was only when this worthy class of travellers was espoused ,  --  quoted , and believed , in the most respectable and honorable quarters , that we thought the quarrel werth taking up . // And here having reluctantly surprised ourselves in alluding to Mr Fearon , who must be amazed to hear his name so often quoted in good company , we shall take the liberty of showing cause why we shall continue , not to be angry , ' against which the writer in the New Monthly Magazine warns us , but exceeding sorrowful , to have Lord Grey still appeal to him as a gentleman . This gentleman , ' we have been well informed , had been an apprentice to a Jewish stocking weaver in England , and received the highest character for his knowledge of hosiery , from his worthy principal . The historical muse has hid in obscurity how long and patiently he toiled at the stocking loom and retailed its productions , by day , and lay down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve of care . ' His merit could not long confine itself to this humble sphere , and at the time of his sailing for America , he had actually risen to be a member , whether as a partner , or , as they call a clerk who goes round the country to solicit orders and collect debts , a traveller , ( an appellation doubly appropriate to most of these gentlemen ' that visit us , ) we know not , but in some capacity or other , he was actually a member of a very reputable trading house on Ludgate hill . On the arrival of this gentleman in America , he applied for admission at a genteel boarding house in New York , and received , we presume , much the same answer that Anacharsis did at the door of Solon , that he had better go back to Scythia . Our gentleman , however , would not be put off ; and when told that the apartments were all full , prayed to be taken into an attic , occupied by the menial servants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an applicant for the office as well as the lodging , of the servants , he was admitted into this same garret . What furniture he found there we know not , as we have only his own account , and how far that can be trusted our readers will judge by his adding , that he paid something more than four guineas a week ! This we think will satisfy our readers as to the gentility of Mr Fearon , if it be any part of a gentleman 's vocation not to take up with lodging in garrets , nor to bear false witness against his neighbour . But we really thought we went on safe ground , in the present case ; and confess ourselves to have been a little confirmed in our idea of Mr Fearon 's pretensions to gentility-which after all is a much less essential quality than veracity , to which we trust he does not even lay claim-by an authority which , if we mistake not , // stands high in the estimation of the writer in the New Monthly Magazine . A certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , 1819 , spoke of forty families resident , we believe , in the neighbourhood of Southwark , on whom to transfer their allegiance and their affections to an-. other government , sits as lightly , as to remove , in the fashion-. able season , from the ward of Farringdon without , to Margate or Rotting Dean . ' And this worthy community , continues the same document , selected and sent out Mr Henry Fearon to the United States , to explore the way before them , and to prepare for their own emigration. * Now we profess our little familiarity with the topography of London . We are so uninformed in this department , as not to know even the bearmgs of Farringdon within , far less of that , which is without ; and as for Rotting Dean , it is terra incognita to us . By the time our country has sent to England a few such travellers as England is daily sending to us , we doubt not we shall be made better acquainted with these points of geography . Though , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound in their names , and a lurking sneer in the air , with which our brethren of the Quarterly pronounce them , which lead us mainly to fear that they are not  --  to speak safely-.  --  the central abodes of British gentility . If we may trust*a kind of instinct in such things , there is a misgiving in our minds that Farring-. don without is not the first region , in which a countess in her own right would fix her abode , and that Rotting Dean after all , even in the fashionable season , is one thing , and Brighton another . And yet these are the seats of the forty families , whose ambassador is before us , in the person of Mr Fearon . What , says Pope , must be the priest where a monkey is the god ? ' If such were the principals , what must have been the agent ? That nothing moreover might be wanting to establish us in this , we had Mr Cobbett 's testimony in confirmation of that of the Quarterly Review ; and he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , in which we suppose these two authorities ever concurred . The next topic , which offers itself to us , is suggested in the following sentence . Surely a moment 's reflection might have shown them that , on such occasions , silence and good humour are the only effectual weapons of defence , and that no wise and sober American should feel serious alarm for the characQtiarter*y Review , vol. xxi , p. 125. // ter and dignity of his nation , even though a Scotch critic should make unreasonably light of Mr Joel Barlow 's inspiration , or because Mr Sydney Smith 's pen , in an hour of thoughtless gaiety , addressed some words of friendly admonition to the United States of America , under th' homely appellation of Jonathan . ' Now the objections we make to this insinuation , trifling as it is in itself , are , that it betrays a total ignorance of the real state of facts , on an important subject , which it professes to explain . Nothing is more notorious than that the Columbiad of Barlow , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky Old Testament name is no small part of the joke to our brethren abroad , nothing is more notorious , than that Barlow 's Columbiad has ever been regarded by the judicious public of the United States , as a total failure ; that it has been little read and less liked ; and that on its appearance the critical journals of this country handled it quite as severely , if not as wittily , as those on the banks of the Thames or of the Forth . Had those , who accuse us or suspect us of feeling sore on the subject of the Columbiad , done us the favor to ascertain the real feeling of the intelligent portion of the American community , they would have found that no annoyance could ever be felt , but at the suspicion of being champions and patrons of the work ; and that every American , solicitous for the repute in which the taste of his country would be held abroad , was afflicted that so unhappy a specimen of it should have appeared , with such typographical splendor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the multitude of new and worthless words , which were fabricated by the author of that poem . We can safely challenge all the critics and purists in England to produce criticisms more unsparing upon them , than those which teemed from the presses of this country . Nor do we confine our remarks to the coinage of Mr Barlow . The persecution of Americanisms at large has no where in Great Britain been pursued with as much keenness , as in this neighbourhood . We have in our view now a most learned individual of our Commonwealth , whose life has been devoted to the study of the English language in its sources , and whose success in these researches we believe to admit of honorable comparison with those of his most respectable colleagues abroad , who from his indiscreet haste of innovation and his patronage of sundry provincial terms , has found no favour , we had almost said no // mercy among those of his countrymen best able to do justice to his acquisitions . And yet American scholars are charged with patronising the innovations of Barlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is upon the state of the English language in America . We explained our views on this subject in our review of Mr Walsh 's work , and the writer in question suggests nothing , which calls on us to correct them . We stated then , and we repeat now , that , on the whole , the English language is better spoken here than in Ei*igland . We do not wish to be misunderstood ; though we shall doubtless be misrepresented . We did not affect to say , that the English language was better spoken by well educated individuals in America than by well educated individuals in England ; but we sufficiently explained ourselves as maintainmg that the corruption of the language has gone so far in no part of America , as in the heart of the English counties . As to the specimens of the pretended American dialect found in such writers as Mr Fearon , we doubt not the populace of Boston , New York , and Philadelphia may speak basely enough , and we cheerfully concede to Mr Fearon a degree of intimacy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to speak to this point , with far more confidence than ourselves . We pity , however , any fair minded Englishman , who can suppose for a moment that there is any truth in all his dialogues and conversations ; and whose knowledge of human nature , if nothing else , does not teach him , that they are wretched fabrications , compiled from a few local observations among such associates , as an ordinary foreigner falls in with . Whence should we learn our bad English ? We are derided and taunted with our dependence on the English press . We are scorned for the poverty of our own literature . It is well known that our children 's books are English ; that many of our text books at the colleges are English ; that our standard professional works are English ; that we reprint every English work of merit before it is dry from the English press ; that our stage is supplied . " . - miserably supplied too , in all the modern drama. - from England ; that the English version of the Scriptures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of its English , is venerated as much here as in England ; that Byron , and Campbell , and Southey , and Scott , are as familiar to us as to their countrymen ; that we receive the first sheets of'the new novel , * // before the last are thrown off in Edinburgh : and how is it possible then that we should not speak good English ? Moreover , as to the standard of the language , the writer , on whom we are remarking , very justly says , that when we speak of the period , at which a language becomes fixed , we seldom annex a very definite or accurate meaning to the expression ; ' and he proceeds correctly to state , that the period , in which a language is fixed , is that in which its best writers flourish ; and of course not to be ascertained by contemporaries , who can not tell that better may not arise , than any who have gone before . Had this judicious conception always regulated the English critics , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much trouble . They would not have been at the pains of turning over the leaves of their Johnson 's Dictionary to see if a word were there , and if they found it not , of branding it as an Americanism . But considering that language is a fluctuating thing , never stable , but con-* stantly on the improvement or decline , or at any rate changing , they would have asked , whether it were not possible that a good and useful word brought to America by its first settlers , and of approved use in their day , might not have survived on this side of the water , while it was lost on the English side ; and if so , whether we or they , in respect to said word ; have done the language most harm . Again , they would have considered whether a few such words as congres'sional , of , or belonging to a body of representatives equally chosen by the people , a sort of body , we believe , unknown in England ; or pre*idential , of , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , an idea also not familiar to the old world ,  --  whether a few such terms , forced upon us by the peculiarity of our institutions , really furnish any ground for the charge of corrupting the language . Though we assent to the doctrines on the subject of language which this writer holds , and will not allow ourselves , even by his positive assertion , to be put on the other side of the question , and made the champions of any new fangled dialect whatever ; yet he errs in one thing , in saying that it is only by the great writers that any authoritative and permanent innovations can be made . ' The great writers like the small ones are much in the condition of Augustus , and make far fewer alterations , than might at first be thought . With some improvement , with the introduction of a few terms from a foreign or learned tongue , // with a little more regularity perhaps than the common parlance observes , they must write the prevailing dialect of the day . They record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who were the great writers between Homer and the Attic dramatists , that converted the language from the lonian to the Attic dialect ? Who were the great writers that translated the Latin of the Salian Songs into that of Plautus ? Who were the great writers that formed that illustrious vulgar tongue , ' of which Dante speaks , which he did not make , but found ; and who were the great writers that transformed the Saxon of King Alfred into the English of Chaucer ? It is a well known fact , that a written literature does not hasten , but delays these innovations , and that new languages almost spring up in barbarous tribes , among which there is no writing , in the time that it takes to produce a little change of orthography , in the language of a writing and reading community . We , it is true , have gone through great and wonderful political changes since the settlement of our country . It would have been natural that the human mind , transplanted to such new and untried scenes of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , this most flexible instrument of its will . But we have been fast anchored to the rock of English literature . There has never been a period , in which this did not constitute the far greater part of our intellectual aliment ; and if any proof were wanted of the fact , it would be this , that a thousand leagues across the water as we are , the language has been going through the same changes on both sides the ocean . With the exception of some half dozen words , which have been preserved here and are obsolete there , and perhaps as many more of which the reverse holds , the sympathy kept up by means of the press has been so entire and perfect , that even down to cant words , and those indefinable shades of meaning which play on the top of social intercourse , and find their way into no book but of the most light and ephemeral cast , there is still an identity in the language . No one able to make the comparison can or will deny this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must needs repeat it , is a calumny ; to charge us with actually writing or speaking a corrupt dialect is equally so . And we should be glad to know with what reason the peculiarities of individual American writers , industriously culled and exag* gerated , furnish any better ground for a charge of corruption // against the language generally prevailing here , than similar peculiarities in English writers , for a similar accusation against the purity of the tongue as written and spoken in England . We presume that the press set up by the American missionaries in the Sandwich Islands will furnish a good deal better English , than Mr Bentham 's Church-of-Englandism , and we protest our inability to see why we should , as Americans , be made to answer for Mr Barlow 's new words , any more than the English public for Mr Bentham 's . We come now to a character , which this writer thinks fit to attribute to the large majority of American - travellers in Europe , whom from personal observation he undertakes to say are vulgar , vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose conversation is made up of violent declamations against slavery , s1meric* monarchy , and as loud assertions of the superiority of America , over all the countries of the globe . ' Now we presume the writer would not undertake to speak from personal acquaintance , as he does , of any but those whom he had actually had the misfortune to know ; and if it is really true , that the great majority of American travellers whom he ha* known are of this sorry description , he has been more unlucky in the choice of his company , than commonly happens to a man , by no fault of his own . An occasional acquaintance of no very agreeable cast may now and then be forced upon one , and hospitality is sometimes put to severe exercises , by an unjustifiable facility of obtaining iptroductions . But where the large majority of a man 's acquaintance , with any class of men , coi*sists of the vulgar , vain , and boisterous , it is apt to awaken a suspicion of his own fine qualities . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer of a better sort of American travellers , of whom he has had the good fortune to know several ; ' a hint which convinces us that this whole discrimination is imaginary , and that he is really in total ignorance of the opinions , which Americans carry to England , form there , or bring back . He says , that among the American travellers he has known , were several , who might be compared with the best specimens of the best classes of any community , that can be named-accomplished gentlemen and scholars , who had crossed the seas for the honorable purpose of enlarging their views , and travelling down their prejudices , ' &amp;c . It is this last clause , on which we propose to remark ; but would first observe , that // the passage we have cited , if sincerely meant , goes well nigh to refute all that has ever been said in England against America , and much that is asserted by this writer , in the sequel of his observations . What , accomplished gentlemen and scholars , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes in England ! *-Where born , where bred , where educated ? In America ? In Mr Bristed 's America ; in Mr Fearon 's America ? - Gentlemen , in that country where the emigrant is told that he must live in loneliness , dejection , and despair , with the certainty of receiving at last , the burial of a dog , and the memorial of a ditch , or puddle ? - Scholars , from a country , where they speak the nauseous ribaldry quoted from Fearon , by his Reviewers ? Persons to be compared with the best specimens of English society from that country , where there is a total absence of early religious education ; from a country yet in its infancy ? ' Is this agreeable to the nature of human things ; and would not the appearance of one , or two , or three such persons as are described , prove the falsehood of the common pictures of America , to the satisfaction of any one , who considers that manners are not formed by the individual , but caught from the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public support and public resort ? But we proposed to show that this writer speaks without information on the topic , and that , alike where he praises as where he condemns . He mentions die travelling down of prejudices , as one of the characteristics of respectable American travellers . From the connexion in which this remark is made , it is fair to conclude that it was intended to refer to extravagant republican and anti-Britannic prejudices , and that it is these , that the intelligent Americans travel down in England . On this head , we shall but state the fact , and leave the inference to be made by our readers . It is well known , that , till the close of the late war , a strong partiality for the English name and character was felt by one portion of the American community ; a portion which yielded to none other , in any kind of respectability . It is no part of our purpose here to inquire into the grounds of this partiality . We think them to have been natural , nay honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , this feeling has been declining ; a fact equally notorious , but also not one , which we are concerned now to explain . There is no part of America from which more persons , in proportion to the population , have // of late years visited Europe , than that which was also the centre of this warm British feeling ; and the majority of those who went abroad may therefore fairly be presumed to have carried this prejudice in favor of England with them . We hope moreover that this fact will make the writer in the New Monthly Magazine willing to find among them a fair propor* tion of his better class of American travellers . And yet it is a fact , of which no one this side the water needs the proof , that almost without exception , those , who have gone abroad with the warmest zeal for every thing which bore the British name , have come back with moderated feelings . Our memory scarce supplies an instance of an individual , of consequence enough to have his opinions known , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it , by going to England . The prejudice they have travelled down has been the insensibility to the worth of their own happy country , and an exaggerated estimate of European superiority . The causes of this have been chiefly two . The one is the old cause , presentia minuit famam , and the discovery that with all the glory , wealth , and strength of England , all the public magnificence and private comfort , all the noble institutions , the venerable characters , the hearty hospitality which command the respect , admiration , or gratitude of the traveller , there are defects of which he had formed no adequate conception , and which show that things are severely balanced in the system of Providence . But there is another cause and one far more operative , why the partiality which an American traveller carries to England is diminished there : and we quote it with the simple design of corroborating the statement , that justice is not done us in that country . It is this ,  --  when an American goes to England he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of England or a friend of France , but he is an American ; and he is exhausted with finding the most absurd misrepresentations of his country credited , and the ignorance which prevails with regard to us , equalled only by the positiveness of those who labor under it . Now a man must have a constitution which we are sure no high spirited Englishman would for a moment approve , who could be so bribed and soothed by private courtesies and personal hospitality , however kind and hearty , and no where in Europe are these so kind and hearty as in England , as to be reconciled to this estimation in which his country is held , and ever has been // held , to this contumely with which she is too often treated . Accordingly it is a fact , exceedingly notorious , that the warm attachment to England carried to that country by many of the most respectable Americans , who have visited it , has been much diminished on their return . If there be exceptions to this , they are but exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a matter of more familiar observation , than that a voyage to England is the sovereign remedy for an excessive attachment to that country . Philosophical and candid minds will of course prevent this from running to the opposite extreme . They will not allow the estimation , in which they hold the land of their fathers , the land from which they derive their language , their laws , and their manners , to be permanently affected by the unkindness or injustice with which America is treated in England . They do not allow that England and the great treasure of its illustrious names belong so exclusively to the present generation of men , that we , whose fathers were Englishmen and in whose country English principles of liberty have taken deeper root and produced finer fruit than they have done in their own soil , are not entitled to our full share of the inheritance . But we repeat the assertion , that if , among the prejudices of intelligent and liberal Americans , alluded to by this writer , coolness to England is to be reckoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are acquainted with ten , where it is travelled up ;  --  and that in general , it is only on his return to his native land , and by studious abstinence from the vehicles of aspersion , and by dispassionate weighing of the great merits of the English character , and fond gazing on the bright spots in their history , that the best disposed American becomes able at last again to say , England , with all thy faults , I love thee still . ' The next subject of remark , which is suggested to us , is treated in a series of sentences pleasant enough in themselves , and which , if meant only as pleasantry , would have called for no reply from us , as containing a charge against the American character . If , however , any thing serious is intended , as we presume , from the pains which the writer is at , to ring the changes on one idea , through a page or more of his essay , then we would rejoin , that to one half of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is true of it , instead of being , // as he designs it , a matter of ridicule and reproach , reflects nothing but honor on our country . We quote for the edification of our readers a part of the passage in question . This irritable and exaggerated self love arises from a striking peculiarity in the foundation of an American 's national vanity . Other nations boast of what the are or have been  --  but a true citizen of the United States exalts his head to the skies , in the contemplation of the FUTURE grandeur of his country . With him , the pride of pedigree is reversed . Others claim respect and honor , through a line of renowned ancestors ; an American glories in the achievements of a distant posterity . Others appeal to history ; an American to prophecy . The latter modestly calls on us to discount his predictions , and , on no better security , to hand him over the full amount of ready praise . His visions are like those of the Trojan prince in Elysium , gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants . You must beware how you speak of a worthy native of Kentucky , as the son of a respectable planter . No , nO* " you do'nt catch the thing at all . " He is to be considered and duly venerated as the great grandfather of some immortal warrior , legislator , or poet . This system of raising a fictitious capital of renown , which his posterity is to pay off ( an invention much resembling our financial anticipations ) is the secret of an American 's extraordinary preten .. sions , and of his soreness when they are not allowed . With Malthus in one hand , and a map of the back settlements in the other , he boldly defies us with a comparison of America , as she is to be , and chuckles with precocious exultation over the splendors which " the geometrical ratio " is to shed upon her story . This appeal to the future is his never failing resource . If an English traveller complains of their inns , and hints his dislike to sleeping three or four in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is advised to suspend his opinion of the matter , until another century shall demonstrate the superiority of their accommodations . So in matters of literature and science , if Shak*peare , and Mil* ton , and Newton be named , we are told to " wait till these few millions of acres be cleared , when we shall have idle time to attend to other things , only wait till the year 1900 or 2000 and then the world shall see how much nobler our poets , and profounder our astronomers and longer our telescopes than that decrepid old atmosphere of yours could produce . " ' This is very pleasant . We are not sure that it is meant for any thing more , and with pleasantry no one is ill-natured enough to enter strictly into judgment . If , however , the writer means to be believed for a moment as speaking truthr // when he hints that Shakspeare , and Milton , and Newton are not prized in America as they are in England , and especially if in marking his last sentence in inverted commas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that passage in any American authority , then we take leave to say that his remark borders hard upon that species of fiction , which is not thought particularly becoming a man of veracity ; and instead of being in any degree borrowed from American writers , is an ampli .. fication , neither very ingenious nor very neat , of a passage in an Edinburgh Review on the subject of our country . As for the rest it is of course mere caricature . There is hardly as much justice in it , as there would be in the following humble parody . The characteristic vanity of the English nation springs from an extraordinary and unusual source . Other nations boast of what they are or hope , in the natural progress of things , to be ; an Englishmen boasts of glories which are faded , and ages which are gone by . For that natural complacence , which a man has a right to feel , in the fruit of his own labors , the success of his own efforts , and the happy consequences of institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Briton carries you back to an ancestry , from which he has degenerated , and to an inheritance which he has squandered and lost . He suspends his habeas corpus , and tells you he is the champion of liberty , because Hampden would not pay the ship money , and he turns out his dragoons on an unarmed populace , and quotes you the glorious provisions of the bill of rights . Others appeal to futurity , and rejoice in the train of blessings , of which they have done all they can to insure the succession ; an Englishman 's glories are laid up in the records of the herald 's office , and he goes to the antiquary and the historian for something to be proud of . An American bids you look at the rulers , which he has chosen to rule over him , and who will therefore consult his welfare ; a Briton reminds you of the brave barons of Runnymede . Other nations in decline assume a grave and chastised manner , and say little of glory or greatness ; an Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his infancy wascrowned in Paris . " Address a thriving citizen of Abergele by the title of mister , and he will tell you the glorious tale of the Morva Rudlan , or lead you back to the illustrious era of Caractacus . Other nations boast of the literature they have or the taste which is maturing among them ; an Englishman , with O'Keefe and Reynolds on // his stage , will talk to you of Shakspeare and Johnson , and bid you crown him with bays , because his great grandfather could remember the Augustan age . An American 's heart di. * - lates at the prospect of the glorious career before him , which he and his children are to travel ; an Englishman looks up to the summits from which be has descended , and tells you how high they be . The visions of other nations are like Berecynthia 's on Olympus , " Who sees around her , in the blest abode A hundred sons and every son a god , " but an Englishman goes down to the shades , and evokes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In all this and much more , which the ingenious hints of the New Monthly Magazine might suggest , we honestly profess there is not the shadow of justice , and we feel almost ashamed of ourselves for indulging in it . We mean it as a pendant for his own absurd picture of American vanity . One thing we ought to thank him for , could we possibly believe that it did not proceed from oversight . In saying that our vanity is prospective , that other nations boast of what they are or have been% but we of our future grandeur , he acquits us of voluminous charges of vanity and self-conceit , with which the writings of his countrymen abound . He acquits us of any exultation , at having been the first to exhibit to the world a true model of representative government , of having set the example to mankind of an equal deputation of power in the compound ratio of property and numbers , a principle no more exemplified in the British parliament than in the Turkish divan ; he exonerates us from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprize of our citizens , and by Lord Chatham to the wisdom and skill of our statesmen ; with all our exaggerated self-love , ' he acknowledges that we bear meekly the glory of having with most disproportioned means successfully withstood the force of the British Empire , and raised ourselves from the degradation of colonies to a level with the most powerful nations of the earth ; he grants that we demand no credit for Franklin and Washington , whose names , says Herder , are those , by which the eighteenth century will be quoted ; he gives the lie to all the tales , which have circulated in octavo and quarto , of our being vain of the naval achievements of the late war ; and though before the close of his remarks , he forgets himself , and tells us that America is do // 40 July , ing wonders , ' and gives us credit for the formation of- ' a great empire , resembling in its best points the best times of Great Britain ; ' he acquits us of all vanity and seif-gratulation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary selfdenial of appealing to prophecy , and demanding a discount of ready praise for what our posterity are to do in the year 2000 . Now if the writer is sincere , we really think that his charge of irritable and exaggerated self-love ' is badly made out ; that he can not expect to be believed , when he accuses us of vanity and self-sufficiency ; and that he would have better consulted the interests of his argument , to take care how his *Ieasantry bore upon his logic . But to argue this point of boasting a little closer , we are not sure , upon the whole , that we Americans have not the better side of the question , even in our writer 's own grotesqtkie picture . He tells us that while others appeal to history , we appeal to prophecy , and that while an Englishman boasts of his grandfather , an American boasts of his grandchildren . Mere boasting is no very reputable practice on any score , even that of personal merit ; and the true notion we apprehend to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellences , Which a man may think he possesses himself . This is peculiarly true of national boasting , or what the rhetoricians call jactatio reipublicce eausa , because it is ten to one that the man , who takes on himself to be the organ of his countrymen on these occasions , shall be the last in the community entitled to any credit for the alleged excellence . It has hut a sorry appearance to see a stupid , common-place , selfish American or Englishman boasting of their Pitts or their Hamiltons , and taking a portion of credit to themselves for talents , they do not share , and for actions they did not accomplish . , But inasmtrch as merit is personal , and all self-complacency , if excusable at all , is so in proportion as it proceeds from7personal merit , we do hold , with all submission , that to boast of our posterity is more rational than to boast of our ancestors , nay of ourselves . What our nation has been , and , in a good degree , what it is , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed nothing ; and our own institutions , at least in the old countries , do our wisdom and virtue no more credit than the beautifularchitecture of a house , built a hundred years before we were born , does our taste . But what our children and posterity will ' be depends mainly on us . If we hand // them down an inheritance unburdened with debt , and with dangerous precedents of power encroaching on right ; if w* abstain from the sacrifice of our children 's happiness to our own ease ; if we so administer the republic that those who come after us shall bless our memory ; if , disdaining temporary cxpedients , we can lay claim to the credit of having left the law unincumbered and sovereign , and the practice sound and faith .. ful , and of having laid up more examples to be imitated than errors to be amended , then we think it quite fair , quite natural to appeal to posterity ; ' then we think we have a right to make a prophetic boast , ' and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have done or forborne is a bet-* ter ground of complacence , than the benefits we have receiv-* ed from our ancestors . It is true the future glory is uncertain , the past is sure : but it is also as sure that the credit of it belongs not to us ; and we can not be so faithless in transmitting our institutions to our descendants , but after all , we imagine we shall do as much for them , as any nation has done for its ancestors . We suppose our writer will set it down to our republican prejudices , and quote it as an instance , that mon .. archy reads . dmeric* slavery . Yet we always thought that Marius had the better of this argument , and we beg leave to say with him , Nunc videte quam iniqui sint . Quod cx aliena virtute sibi arrogant , id mihi ex mea non concedunt ; silicet quia imagines non habeo , et quia mihi nobilitas nova est , quarn certe peperisse melius est , quam receptam corrupisse . ' But we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other remark we have made , that we allow ourselves to be carried beyond the bounds of justice and of our own opinion , by a foolish extravagance of retorting . We do not wish to say that we look upon the English nation , as in a state of decline . There are certainly considerable evils in the state of the country . A high authority pronounces the poor rates an evil , which can neither be remedied nor borne , and another authority on the other side equally high , says the corruption of par .. liament has reached a ruinous point ; while the national debt exceeds , by nearly ten times , the amount which Hume declar .. ed must produce a bankruptcy . With all this , we believe , we certainly hope , that England will long survive , and exert her present preponderance in the world . Not certainly that we think her influence always brought into action as it ought to be , but because we see not the spot on the map of Europe , to . TV*ew &amp;rier , . TV'Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because we lool* upon ourselves to be quite too immature , to engage with prudence , in European politics . England , moreover , has a tower of strength , a great depository of moral and physical power , in her numerous orderly , intelligent , middling class , which the corruptions , that exist in the two extremes of society , have as yet scarcely touched . And ages we trust will pass by , before the happy abodes of this virtuous community , will feel the overwhelming power of political and moral degeneracy and corruption . We wish this for the sake of humanity , order , and peace abroad , of which the English char.b acter is certainly the great assurance . Still , however , and it is a topic which for its gravity ought scarcely to find its place in a connexion with our foregoing remarks , we suppose that nothing exempts England from the fate of kingdoms and empires , and that the thousand years which she has stood on the list of the great nations of the earth , must bear some assignable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence . We on the contrary are , if this writer pleases , in our infancy ; at any rate quite unprepared to hold the scales of European politics . The influence we are to exert upon them hereafter , is a matter of momentous interest , and we think the happiness of the civilized world essentially involved in the turn , which our institutions and character take . It is for these therefore , that our politicians and statesmen ought to labor . Blest with a form of government and a state of society , which do not task to the uttermost all the energies of the state to keep the fabric together , it becomes our enlightened men to look to the future , to build for other times , to fit well together the parts of this great machine , so that the hour shall be long deferred when an ominous crashing shall be heard deep within the enginery , where none can venture in to repair it . We would revert a moment to another topic of reproach , to which more than one allusion is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery in this country ; a subject . which we have already touched . He bids us make no fine speeches of freedom while a slave contaminates our soil , ' and something like this was said by our brethren at Edinburgh about the extraordinary incongruity of our principles and practice , in that the clanking of chains and the sound of the scourge are heard beneath the walls of our Congress . Now we certainly shall not allow ourselves to be betrayed into a defence of // slavery either by unjust taunts from abroad , or the desire of favor at home . No one defends it , no one approves it . But if these remarks of the English writers are intended to convey a reproach , that reproach is , that we tolerate a slavery , of which we could rid ourselves if we would . And if they lay claim to the character of candid men , if they wish to be thought competent and fair judges of hard questions of political economy , we would ask them by any effort of imagination or any device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eradicating negro slavery from this country , or any country where it exists . If they can devise no such plan , and the evil is without remedy , then we would ask the candid Censor morum in England , who may wish to pass judgment on us for this , to reflect a moment how and when this evil came upon us , and on the comparative merits of the British and American governments in regard to slavery in this country . This is one point ; another is the actual state of England in regard to slavery . We are bid to make no fine speeches about slavery , while a slave contaminates our soil . ' Truly whose soil then is Jamaica , and whose is Tobago , and whose is Barbadoes , and whose are all the isles ? But they are distant colonies , you reply , they touch not England ; not so much as by an isthmus . But are they not English soil , owned by English proprietors , governed by English laws , cultivated on English account ; and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and furnish the wherewithal for English luxury ? We should be glad to see , if slavery is stamped deeper and blacker on a bale of cotton or a hogshead of tobacco , than on a puncheon of rum or a box of sugar ; and if providence should enter into judgment with the civilized world for this offence , we would fain know whether Bristol and Liverpool would be last visited ; and if assiento would be the word , which would stand lowest on the accusing angel 's book . Besides , we beg leave to inquire of those who read us our condemnation on this score , whether the law of slavery in England , even as it respects England herself , is such as to fur. * nish great cause for exultation . So late as 5 Will , and Mar. it was held in the English court of Common Pleas , that a man might have a property in a negro boy , and might bring an action of trover for him* because negroes are heathens. * Nor // England *and . ilineriea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the famous case of the negro Somerset , which is considered as having settled the law of England on slavery . This case is briefly reported in the eleventh volume of the State Trials with Mr Hargrave 's argument in full , and given in Loft 's Reports with the judgment of the court . James Somerset had been made a slave in Africa and was sold there . lie was carried from Africa to Virginia , where he was bought by Charles Steuart , esq . *nd by him brought to England . Here he r*n away from his master , who however recovered him , and confined him in irons on board a vessel , to be sent to Jamaica and sold as a slave . While he was thus confined , Lord Mansfield granted a habeas. corpus , ordering the captain of the ship to bring up the body of James Somerset , with the cause of his detainer . The above mentioned circumstances were stated on the return of the writ , and after much learned discussion in the court of King 's Bench , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Somerset ought to be discharged . Lord Mansfield , however , gave his judgment dis. * charging Somerset , with the greatest hesitation and reluctance , alleging great inconvenience on both sides of the question , and stating distinctly that a contract for sale of a slave is good in England : the sale is a matter , to which the law readily and properly attaches and will maintain the price , according to the agreement . But here the person of the slave himself imme** diately is the object of inquiry ; which makes a very material difference . The present question is , whether any dominion , authority , or coercion can be exercised in this country on a slave according to the American laws , that is , the British Colonial Laws . The difficulty of adopting the relation , with .. out adopting it in all its consequences , is indeed extreme , and yet many of those consequences are absolutely contrary to the municipal law of England . ' For aught that appears to the contrary , Lord Mansfield here teaches , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave , which were contrary to the English municipal law ; and had Mr Steuart , instead of pursuing and confining his slave himself , appealed to the magistrate to protect him in the enjoyment of the fruits of the legal contract , by which he had purchased the slave , the magistrate would have protected him . Jo consequence of the inconvenience and embarrass .. ment of the case , the parties were advised by Lord Naffs // field , to compromise the matter ; and the cause was ordered to stand over for this purpose . But a decision being demanded , it was delivered at the next term , by Lord Mansfield , in the same hesitating style , in which the remarks just quoted are made . He first observes , that the court pay all due attention to the opinion of Sir P. Yorke and lord chief justice Tab . hot , whereby they pledged themselves to the British planters for all the legal consequences of slaves coming over to this kingdom or being baptized ; recognised by Lord Hardwicke , sitting as chancellor Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notion prevailed that if a negro came over or became a christian , he was emancipated , but there is no ground in law for this notion : that he and lord Talbot , when attorney and solicitor general , were of opinion that no such claim forfreedom was valid , *c . ' He finally rests his judgment on the want of an express English statute , and in the following terms : So high an act of dominion must be recognized , by the law of the country where it is used , The state of slavery is of such a nature , that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons moral or political , but only positive law , which preserves its force long after the reasons , occasions , and time itself , from whence it was created , is erased from memory , &amp;c . ' This is very well ; but if we take it on trust from Lord Mansfield , that the English law would still enforce a contract of sale of a slave , and if we consider that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would still have no allow .. ance for past services ; * if we remember that the abolition of the trade certainly was carried in the English parliament , by a different process from that of acclamation , and above all that perhaps as many slaves are at this moment held in bondage by the arm of the English power , as by that of any other nation ; we think it somewhat indiscreet inEnglishmen to speak of our soil as contaminated by slavery , or to make any fine speeches about universal emancipation . When it is said , that the air of England is too pure for a slave , ' it means merely that tobacco and cotton , sugar and coffee , will not grow in Norfolk ; not that when an island , where they will grow falls // into British possession , there is any scruple felt in resorting to the labor of slaves . But we are anxious to close our article , which we do not send to the press without some reluctance . A reperusal of the observations , to which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , that they had any other object than that of surprising assent , by a few candid remarks , to many sneering and some calumnious ones . Of all modes of warfare conducted by that potent instrument , the pen , we are constrained to look upon the practice of masking a tissue of unfriendly , sneering , and injurious reflections , by a few general compliments , as one of the least ingenuous ; and are sorry to see it thought so clever , by our brethren abroad . Tho present writer accuses us of an inordinate appetite for praise ; but we think it must be an appetite ravening indeed , which can swallow praise , with such poisonous condiments as this Should these and the preceding observations chance to fall under the eye of an American , he may perhaps imagine , that we ' too have been indulging in offensive animadversions upon his nation ; but we sincerely assure him , that we have no intention to offend . We think that America is doing wonders , and we most heartily congratulate her . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great empire , resembling in its best points the best times of Great Britain , must prove an auspicious era in the history of the human race . A community provided with ample resources against an endless increase of members , and enjoying a free bar , a free senate , and a free press , if true to herself , must do great things . But America is yet in her infancy ; and must not , like a froward child , born to a great estate and the dupe of domestic adulation , immaturely assume the tone and pretensions of a riper period ; she must be docile and industrious , and patient of rebuke that conveys instruction . She must not talk too much of glory , till it comes , She must not make fine speeches about freedom , while a slave contaminates her soil . She must not rail at English travellers , for visiting her cities and plantations , and publishing what they see . She must not be angry with:lord Grey , for calling Mr Fearon " a gentleman , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there exists in this country an organized conspiracy against her literary fame . There is no such thing . ' While we copy these remarks , we perceive in the quarter whence they proceed , an American Eclogue ; ' a performance of which the justice is quite equal to the spirit ; and Jonathan // Kentucky 's Journal ' is announced in another number . This satisfies us wholly , and shows that the warfare is not one for us to engage in , nor the weapons proper for our hands We sincerely assure the authors of these judicious perform .. ances , that whatever they intend , ' we shall take no offence .
