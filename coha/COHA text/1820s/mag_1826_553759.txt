txt ART . 111. - si List of Patents granted by the United States , for the Encouragement of sirts and Sciences , alphabetically arranged from 1790 to 1820 ; continued by Supplements to 1826 ; containing the . iVames of the Patentees , their Places of Residence , the Dates of their Patents , *c . Washington , D. C. Printed and sold by S. Alfred Elliot . The above work , though merely a catalogue of inventions and names , possesses an interest of the highest kind to an enlightened American citizen , and affords us an opportunity of c*Iling the attention of our countrymen to the importance of the Patent Law , the influence it has had upon the practical industry of the nation , the present state of the system of granting patents , and the necessity of the law being revised and made more efficient for its original purpose . Our own attention has been axvakened to these topics , by the following passage in President Adams 's Message to Con*ress , at the of the last session . opening The laws relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration , and , perhaps , susceptible of some improvement . The grant of power to regulate the action of Congress on this subject , has specified both the end to be obtained , and the means by which it is to be effected- " to promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . " If an honest pride might be indulged in the reflection , that , on the records of that office , are already found inventions , the usefulness of which has scarcely been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity , would not its exultation be allayed by the inquiry , whether the laws have effectually insured to the inventors the reward destined to them by the constitution -- even a limited term of exclusive right to their dis-coveries ? ' Such a notice , coming from such a source , and at such a time , was sufficient proof that investigation was on some account or other indispensable . It is a little strange therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protracted to almost six months , Congress passed over this subject in silence and unconcern . They did indeed refer that part of the Message , as well as other parts , to a committee , at the commencement of the session ; but such a reference of this , and many other important subjects , // seems to have been of the nature of final interment . Much noise is sometimes made about the extravagant and useless expenditures in the executive departments of government ; but do members of Congress forget , that they are not sent thither by their constituents , and handsomely paid , merely to make flourishing and accusatory speeches , but actually to look into and examme the state of those departments , rectifying what is wrong and supplying what is wanting ? Can the almost total neglect of this be justified , by delivering long tirades , Lhat cost the nation some four or five thousand dollars each ; and calling for wagon loads of papers and documents , of no earthly use to any one when produced , except to the public printers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great body can not be brought to act promptly and efficaciously on the measures submitted to it , we can not understand why the committees should not investigate , and report upon , every subj*ect referred to them ; the people would then at least know the state of things , and where blame or praise is due . With respect to the Patent Office , it is not an incidental pubject of their attention , the result of other powers which they possess ; but it is specially and expressly confided to them , by the words of the constitution ; to promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . ' Such is the will of the sovereign people ; and three great objects , relating to the progress of science were distinctly recommended by the Executive to the consideration of their representatives at the last session , the Patent Office , an Observatory for astronomical purposes , and a National University . Hardly the slightest notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring these subjects , in another form , before the nation . At present we can spare time and space only for the first . The Patent Law was passed in the year 179*3 , during the presidency of Washington . It enacts for substance the following regulations . Section 1 . Any citizen of the United States , alleging that he has invented any new and useful art , machine , &amp;c. or an improvement upon such art and machine , which has not been known or used before the application , may petition the Secretary of State for letters patent bearing test by the President of the United States , and granting to such petitioner , his heirs , adminis // trators , and assigns , the full and exclusive right and liberty of making , constructing , using , and vending , the said invention or discovery , art , or machine , for a term not exceeding fourteen years . The letters patent , giving a short description of the subject matter of it , shall be delivered to the Attorney General of the ( Jnited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and if he find them conformable to law , he is to certify it at the fbot thereof , and return the same to the Secretary of State , who is to present the said letters patent to be signed , and cause the seal of the United States to be affixed thereto ; and the same shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose , and shall be good and available to the grantee by force of this act . Section 52 . A mere improvement on a machine already known , used , or patented , shall not give a right to make the machine itself which may have been formerly patented to another ; neither shall the first inventor be at liberty to adopt the improvement without permission from the patentee . Section 8 . The inventor must swear or affirm that he verily believes himself to be the true inventor ; he must also make a written description of the same , clear and intelligible , and accompany it with drawings and models , if necessary , to be lodged in the patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the said machine , or other article , by the said description . Section 4 . This section gives the power of assigning the patent right to others , provided the assigner duly records the said assignment in the office of the Secretary of State . Section 5 . The forfeiture for invasion of a patent right , shall be at least equal to three times the price for which the patentee has usually sold such right to others . Section 6 . But the defendant in such action for damages may plead the general issue , and if he shall prove that the specification filed by the plaintiff has concealed any part of the truth relative to said invention , for the purpose of deceiving the public , or that the thing was not originally discovered by him , but had been used , or described in some public work , before the supposed discovery by the patentee , or that he had surreptitiously obtained a patent for another person 's discovery ; in either of these cases* the patent shall be declared void . Section 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appointed as arbiters , whose decision as to the granting of the patent shall be final . Section 10 . Actions to set aside a patent right must be brought within three years after the issuing the said patent . Section 11 . Every inventor , before petitioning the Secretary of State to obtain a patent , shall pay into the treasury thirty dollars // and the money thus paid shall be in full for the sundry services to be performed in the office of the Secretary of State , consequent on such petition , and shall pass to the account of clerk hire in that office . Nevertheless , for every copy that may be required of any paper respecting any patent that has been granted , the person requiring it shall pay twenty cents for every hundred words contained therein ; and also two dollars for every copy of a drawing . ' We have given a digest of the act , rather than a copy of all its words and provisions , both to save room and to render its features more distinct . An additional act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obtaining patent rights , to all aliens , who shall have resided for two years within the United States ' ; but declaring , that if it shall afterwards appear that the said invention , art , or discovery , so patented , had been known or used previously to such application for apatent , the patent shall be utterly void . It is obvious therefore that original invention , or improvement , is the only thing contemplated by the law as entitled to a patent , whether that invention he by a citizen , or an alien resident in the United States ; and that , failing to prove its originality , the patent right fails . It is , in fact , a reward given to stimulate the industry of mind ; a wise provision to call forth the energies of the country in practical and useful improvements , without costing the national treasury a dollar ; for every thing is paid for by those , who voluntarily avail themselves of the privilege held out by the law , and who again remunerate themselves , by selling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced they shall be profited by the purchase . Under this law we are informed that four thousand patents have been obtained ; and if it could be proved , ( which we do not believe ) that three fourths of them were for mere useless speculations , there would still remain a thousand useful inventions , distinctly and intelligibly specified and described by words , drawings , and models , applicable to almost every variety of human ingenuity and industry . But in fact there are two thousand models , ingeniously executed , and preserved in the model rooms of the Patent Office ; a museum of the mechanical arts , as applied to the interests and labors of agriculture , domestic and rural economy , manufactures , and commerce . Bridges of various constructions , steam engines , boats , ploughs of every form , carriages of all hinds , bedsteads. chairs . chimneys , cooking appa // ratus , salt works , glass works , clocks , machines for making hats , shirts , and shoes , nail machines , slitting iron , brewing , distilling , carpeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or water , locks , improved rigging for ships , window blinds , cotton presses , rice cleaners , corn shellers , pumps , rail roads , docks ; all these are but a sample of the motley variety of models of improvements in the essential parts and features of those implements that are lodged in the office . We sincerely wish , that a more ample space could be allowed for their exhibition ; and that instead of twenty or thirty models being crowded on a shelf not more than three feet long and half as deep , so that it is almost impossible distinctly to examine them , and observe their forms and proportions , they could be displayed singly on a series of proper shelves , in a building exclusively appropriated and sufficiently large for the purpose . At this period , when schemes of general improvement occupy the public attention so much , it is particularly desirable that every thing that has been suggested , should be classified , and exhibited in a perspicuous and satisfactory manner , to the numerous visitors , from every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would form a valuable study , and afford the most important hints to many a perplexed projector . For the same reasons , all the patents should be distinctly , chronologically , and clearly recorded in uniform volumes , that they may be referred to and read , without creating needless trouble to the clerks , in searching out long forgotten papers ; and , indeed , that the risk may be prevented of losing such altogether . It is gratifying to learn , that the present administration has ordered a system of this kind to be commenced . The previous neglect of it has been matter of astonishment , although it may be accounted for from the fact , that the business of the office was such , that the persons allowed by Congress for its tranaction were entirely inadequate to its labors . If , on account of this neglect , the laws do not effectually insure to the inventors , the reward destined to them by the constitution , ' it is high time the matter was looked into and a remedy applied . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of this branch of the executive duties , and the time is arrived we trust , when it will no longer be permitted to remain in that state . The law made it the duty of the Secretary of State to issue patents ; he is in fact , and to this day , the only real and le*gal superintendept of the Patent Office* In 1793 , and for some // time afterwards , this branch of duty was so trifling , that there was no necessity for either a distinct officer or building , to accomplish the purposes of the law . But the business gradually became more onerous , and it was found necessary to employ a clerk to perform the duties of this office exclusively ; and out of courtesy he has been considered as the superintendent of the Patent Office . Still , however , the law recognises only the Secretary of State as the true superintendent , and other appointruenis are only viewed as clerkships , to aid in the discharge of his duties . The space required by these duties became equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of state , and a portion of the large building assigned for the general post office was appropriated for this purpose . Thus the state department has been , in a degree , disincumbered of details and operations , very incompatible with its other , more exalted trusts . But both this , and the patent office , have grown with the growth of the nation , and the duties of each have multiplied so thickly , that circumstances seem imperiously to require , that the Secretary of State should be more entirely relieved from the perplexing details of this office , locally separated from his own , and of a nature peculiarly incongruous with the other objects of his solicitude . If , indeed , the suggestion so repeatedly made , of dividing the department of state into a home and foreign office should be ever carried into execution , then the Patent Office would fall under the control of the home department . But whether it be so , or not , it appears to us that the business would be much simplified , by placing the Patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of state , as the Register 's and Auditor 's offices bear to the treasury . Let all the business relative to the patents be transacted , from first to last , in the office itself , and accounts be regularly returned to the department of state , by the official head of the sabordinate office . Besides the person , who has for so many years acted under the Secretary of State , as superintendent of this office , there has been another authorized hy law for ten years ; and a messenger was found necessary about five years since . In 1824 a machinist was added to take charge of the models , and koep them in repair ; and , as the business of obtaining patents has increased with unprecedented rapidity , two more clerks , for extraordinary writing , have been employed , and paid out of the contingent fund , during the last year . // To impress the necessity of reducing this important and growing office , to some regular and intelligible system of operation , we shall here state its progress for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patents . 1822 201 1823 164 1824 204 1825 301 1023 These patents , at thirty dollars each , produced a revenue to the treasury of $30,690 . Yet , we are assured , the salaries of clerks , and contingent expenses in the patent office , did not exceed $4000 a year , leaving a balance unapplied to the purposes for which the money was actually paid of $10,000 . Why , then , should any part of this business be neglected , or slovenly performed ? That no falling off , but on the contrary a large increase , of the business of this office is to be anticipated , may be inferred from the fact , that a hundred and fifty patents were applied for in the first quarter of the year 1826 ; and there seems no reason to doubt , that at least four hundred will be granted in the course of the current year , yielding a revenue of $12,000 . To meet this state of things , Congress will , doubtless , at the approaching session , make considerable alterations in the Patent Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to be necessaay . The Secretary of State should be relieved from the trouble of superintending this office , except so far as to receive an annual return of the state of the office from the actual superintendent , to be laid before Congress . The clerks in the Patent Office should be sufficiently numerous to discharge all its duties , without applying to another department , or its contingent fund , for extraordinary assistance which is altogether needless . What the requisite number may be , Congress will of course ascertain by their committee . But it seems to us that a superintendent will have enough to do , in receiving and answering letters , and transacting the money affairs of the office with the treasury . A principal clerk will also be fully employed in examining specifications , and reading and correcting patents before they are issued . Then for engrossing four hundred patents in a year , there can not be less than two clerks required ; and the same you . xxm. - No. 53. 39 // number , of course , for recording them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides the machinist and a messenger . This is the least augmentation that can be adequate to the current business of the office , and any increase of that business will require a larger establishment . To prevent an error heretofore fallen into , we should suppose it necessary for the law to make it imperative , that every patent shall be duly recorded before it is issued to the patentee . We see no reason for that haste , by which we understand many patents have been hurried through , and issued on the very day they were applied for . Many evils arise from this precipitancy . And if there can be any danger from delay , it may be prevented by making it lawful to enter a caveat , to prevent any other interfering patent from superseding the one first applied for . In all cases thirty days , at least , should elapse , between the presentation of the petition and specification , and the issuing of the patent . There is no necessity for the present plan of sending them to the attorney general for examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to law . The truth is , that he can know , no more than any other man , whether tbey are issued according to law or not ; and it is an undoubted fact , that all which have been issued , without being duly recorded , have been issued in violation of the law , the certificate of the attorney general to the contrary notwithstanding . The only thing he knows about the matter is , that the printed form with the blanks filled up , to which be has set his name , is the regular and le al form in which such documents are issued . But whether all other parts of the patent law have been complied with , is a thing of which he knows nothing . No one can imagine for a moment that he , with all his other important avocations , can read throucrh in a day , specifications which frequently fill a score of sheets of parchment , embracing objects the most various and dissonant from his usual train of thought and action , and then pronounce any deliberate opinion upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a most objectionable and useless one , and the attorney general ought to he relieved from it . The head of the Patent Office , whoever be may be , whether the Secretary of State , or any other person , is the proper officer for certifying that the patent is issued in all respects conformably to law . The signature of the President of the United States* // of course , accompanies the seal , which stamps the instrument with legal validity . There is a particular difficulty arising from the very first paragraph of the first section of the act , which we have cited above , that demands rectification ; not known or used before the application . ' What is the antecedent of this word application ? We do not perceive that it has any . And although we may conjecture what it means , yet nothin in a law should be left to conjecture . What a noble field for litigation is here opened ; and what a mass of property is involved in the consequences of judicial decisions on such ambiguous phraseology . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have actually sold them for as much ; but if on an average they should not be worth more than four or five hundred dollars apiece , here is the amount of a million of dollars or more depending on the construction of an equivocal sentence . We need say no more . We are sure that this matter can remain no longer unrevised . In our free government , such usages as we have commented on , will not be suffered to prevail long in defiance of common sense and of justice . If any of our legislators have been so mistaken , as to view the subject of this article as trifling , and unworthy of their serious attention , we trust they will soon see it otherwise ; and that While they are hound by the constitution and laws to attend to the interests of the arts and sciences , and have funds placed at their disposal so much more than adequate to the object proposed , they will not suffer an institution so important to the cause of internal improvement , and so gratifying to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity . If it be thought advisable to erect a separate building , on the fireproof plan , for the better security of these valuable treasures of American genius , we believe it is only necessary for some member of Congress to call for the amount of moneys received from the Patent Office , and disbursed on account of it , to show that there is somewhere an actual balance quite sufficient for the purpose .
