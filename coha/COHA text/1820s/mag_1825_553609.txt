Majoi* General JV'atlzaniel Greene . 8vo. pp. 37 . Baltimore , 1824 . THE dismemberment of Poland , effected by the perfidy and ambition of three despotic powers , has ever been regarded , by the friends of liberty and justice , with the utmost indignation and abhorrence . It was a deed of infamy , which can find no parallel in history , and which , under any of the forms of civil society , would be looked upon as a crime , that could only be expiated by the severest penalties of violated law . The government of Poland , it is true , had grown weak by factions , and was sunk under the burthen of its ill organised constitution . It had once been the pride of the Poles to rally round the standard of what was called , and what in reality was in some of its features , a republican system . The privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enjoyed to a considerable extent , and for a time afforded a salutary check to absolute tyranny in the rulers . In the best periods of its administration , however , the Polish government was composed of strangely mixed and discordant elements . The King was elected , but the authority conferred by the crown was almost nothing ; the Diet , or legislative // assembly , was elected , but this assembly was always a theatre of anarchy and faction ; it was composed of nobles , who looked only to their own interest , and who were encouraged by each other 's example to practise any enormity without shame , to gain their ends . The mass of the people were serfs , degraded by slavery and ignorance . In short , the government of Poland was of a most anomalous character , exhibiting the singular union of a corrupt and factious aristocracy , a monarchy without power , and a democracy without freedom . Such a system must necessarily decay and go to ruin ; the nobles perpetually encroached on the royal prerogatives , few and contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length they took the government effectually into their hands , by introducing into the Diet the liberum veto , or the privilege of any member by his single voice to dissolve the assembly , and stop further proceedings . This was usurping a power , which the king did not possess , and which was plainly destructive of all the good purposes to be effected by a deliberative body . The responsibility of public officers was destroyed , for none could fail to find a friend in the Diet , who would stop any investigation into his conduct , if occasion required . It was at the time when these evils in the government had grown to their greatest height , and its vital energies were paralysed , that the cabinets of Russia , Austria , and Prussia , formed the insidious design of taking advantage of the weakness of Poland to crush its political existence , and , in the true spirit of freebooters , to divide among themselves the plunder of the country , which they had conspired to dismember and ruin . This scheme of infamy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of its projectors , which will forever remain as one of the deepest stains in the history of the civilised world . That the Poles should be roused by so flagrant an act of indignity and oppression , was not surprising . Civil wars broke out ; the despots procured partisans by the influence of money and intrigue , and by the force of arms ; they spared no pains to kindle the flame of civil discord , that they might the more easily conquer and divide . The spirit of freedom is natural to man , and it was not yet extinct in the // breasts of many of the Poles , notwithstanding the degraded state to which they were reduced as a nation . The crisis called out some men of high and noble minds , genuine patriots , in whom the love of country and of freedom overcame every other passion , and incited them to deeds of heroism and valor , that have seldom been surpassed . To many distinguished Poles , who signalised themselves at that time , and during the succeeding struggles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less force , than to the renowned hero , whose fame they celebrate ; But should we wish to warm us on our way Through Poland , there is Kosciusko 's name iN'Iight scatter fire through ice , like Hecla 's flame . ' Among those , who stood in the foremost ranks of patriotism and valor , at the beginning of the contest , who were the first to resist oppression and raise the standard of freedom and right , was Count Pulaski . He fought to restore the falling liberties of his country , with an ardor which nothing could repress , and with a perseverance which no obstacles could diminish , while a gleam of hope remained , that Poland could be saved from the destiny threatened by its enemies . The combined power of three empires drove him from his country , and he arrived in America in time to fight for our own cause of independence , and to die on a foreign shore in defending those principles of justice and liberty , whose growth a wicked conspiracy of despots had blasted on his native soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fame of Pulaski ; he came to us in the rrmidst of our wants and our perils , when we needed the aid of soldiers like himself , ardent in our cause for its own sake , and tried by the severest discipline of experience ; he died in assisting to procure the freedom , which we now enjoy , and which every American deems the first of his earthly privileges . We care not to look farther ; to these claims alone we are willing to yield up our hearts . In a case like this , we should revolt at the thought of removing the veil , and searching for personal motives ; these no doubt he had , for without them he could not have been a man ; hut it is not by his private personal views , whatever they may have been , that his character is to be weighed ; nor by the cold cant that he was a soldier of fortune , // that his merits are to be estimated , in the United States . The plain question is , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our behalf ? He served us most devotedly , he fought bravely , and he sacrificed his life . We envy not the feelings of an American citizen , who has not gratitude for deeds like these , and whose sense of justice , as well as of gratitude , does not place Pulaski high on the revered list of heroes , by whose united exertions our independence was achieved . Under impressions like these , it was with sincere regret , that in this country we should find occasion given for any one to write a pamphlet , with the avowed object of vindicating the fame of Pulaski from the injurious charge of an American , historian ; and surprise is mingled with regret , when we learn , that the charge is intended to throw a slur on the military character of a man , whom the world has lauded with a unanimous voice for his skill and bravery as a soldier . To this point we shall again recur . The author of the pamphlet , we are given to understand , is a gentleman of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the time it was first organised till its dissolution , who was . daily with the commander during this period , was at his side when he received the fatal wound at the attack on Savannah , and attended him during the last moments of his life . From such a source the work claims our fullest confidence , and we shall take the liberty of presenting to our readers , in the author 's own words , such portions of his narrative , as throw light on the character of Pulaski , and as contain some facts . but little known in the history of the revolution . A very brief sketch is given of Pulaski 's exertions before he came to this country . Cit is well known , ' says the author , C that for several years previous to the first flagitious partition of Poland , in 1772 , by Russia , Austria and Prussia , that unfortunate country was a scene of turbulence , anarchy , devastation , and bloodshed . Stanislaus Augustus , the reigning monarch had been raised to the throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by a corrupt and degenerate faction , and by the intrigues and even the violence of Russia , whose troops , stationed at a small distance from the plain where the diet of election was held , had overawed his numerous opponents . Among these was Count Pulaski , a nobleman no less* // distinguished by his talents and his courage , than by his birth and his rank . Firm , incorruptible , undaunted , he had uniformly resisted the insolent dictation of an ambitious and faithless neighbor , and in Stanislaus he saw a Russian viceroy , rather than the chief of an independent nation . In those confederacies , which were soon formed in various parts of the country , to defend and vindicate its insulted sovereignty , the ardent patriotism of the Count , his implacable hatred of foreign usurpation , his indefatigable zeal , his unshaken constancy , his heroic intrepidity-in short , his towering genius and his stoical and truly republican virtues , rendered him the scourge and terror of the Russians . " During eight succeeding years of a bloody war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poland in those calamitous times , " the operations of Pulaski were such as almost to challenge belief . Sometimes vanquished , much oftener victorious , equally great in the midst of a defeat as formidable after victory , and always superior to events , Pulaski attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe , and astonished her by his long and vigorous resistance . Obliged to abandon one province , he made incursions into another , and there performed new prodigies of valor . It was thus that , marching successively throughout all the palatinates , he signalised in each of them that eternal hatred , which he had sworn against the enemies of Poland . " It was Pulaski who , in 1771 , conceived and organised the bold design of forcibly - carrying off Stanislaus from Warsaw , and bringing him to his camp ; not , indeed , to assassinate him , as has been basely and falsely asserted by partisans of Russia , but with a view to make him a rallying point for the nobles , and all the patriots of Poland , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , to crush , or , at least , to drive away from the territory of the republic the satellites of that unprincipled and perfidious power , by whose haughty mandates it had too long been governed . The enterprise , confided to forty brave patriots , succeeded only so far as to seize on the monarch , in the very bosom of his capital , and to convey him away to some distance from it , in spite of every obstacle and danger . The darkness of the night , and other unforeseen casualties , prevented the final execution of a plan , which might eventually bave saved Poland from that political annihilation , which has since become her lot . When , from nearly the same motives as induce robbers to disgunse or suspend , for a time , their jealousies and animosities , and to unite their efforts and their strength , the more easily to secure a common prey , Russia , Prussia and Austria jointly invaded Poland , in 1772 , and at a " fell swoop** seized upon the fairest portion of her territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only kings and freebooters dare to claim-the // 380 April , right of superior physical force  --  the Polish confederates were compelled either to acquiesce in the degradation of their enslaved plundered , partitioned country , or to flee from the beloved and hallowed land which had given them birth-from the land which they had disputed , inch by inch , with the lawless potentates wh&amp; have since entirely erased it from the map of independent nations . Very few submitted ; many fell into the hands of the Russians or of their adherents , and died martyrs to that noble cause , which they had so strenuously supported ; others escaped to foreign climes . Pulaski was the last to retire from the glorious contest . In a desperate and bloody engagement with the Russians , his army , vastly inferior in numbers , was routed , annihilated ; but his courage still remained . To rush furiously on death would have been useless to his country ; he chose to live , in the hope of again serving it , should heaven and time favor his wishes . Through countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of singular disguises , wonderful adventures , and hairbreadth escapes , he reached Turkey , whose hostilities against Russia accorded with his hatred of that power , and at the same time , flattered the patriotic schemes which his ardent spirit had not ceased to cherish . On that side , however , his hopes were frustrated by the peace concluded between Russia and the Porte , in 1774 . ' Wraxall tells a long and tragical story about the attempt above mentioned to seize on the person of Stanislaus ; he calls it an atrocious enterprise , ' and says it was planned by Pulaski , whose design it was to take away the life of the king . It must be remembered , however , that Wraxall is very suspicious authority on this subject ; that is , his information came from a quarter , in which it was hardly possible for him to arrive at an unprejudiced account of the affair . He was in Warsaw a short time after the events took place , but his connexion was entirely with the Russian party , and from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he derived all he knew of the circumstances . That Pulaski formed the scheme of taking the king , and that he put it partially in execution , there can be no doubt , but that he ever had an intention of assassinating him , there is not a shadow of proof . The contrary , indeed , is abundantly manifest from the fact , that the persons to whom the enterprise was entrusted had Stanislaus several hours in their possession , and might have taken his life at any moment , had such been their purpose . This was not done , and he was suffered finally to escape . Pulaski 's true motive was unquestionably // the one suggested by the author in the passage just quoted . President Adams , in his Defence of the Constitution and Government of the United States , was misled by the authority of Wraxall , and has seemed to countenance the suspicion Thrown by him on the designs of Pulaski . As far as we can learn , the charge rests with Wraxall alone ; we have seen it in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it wholly unworthy of credit . By the Russian faction in Poland , Count Pulaski 's property bad been confiscated ; he was degraded from his rank , and declared to be an outlaw . Failing ol success Ii* attempting to engage Turkey in the cause of his country , he went to France . He remained there but a 51 ) Ort time , when he resolved to hazard his fortunes with those of America , and , in the year 1777 , we find him in Philadelphia , tendering hi* services to the American Congress . The inherent ardor of his warlike spirit , his habits of activity , and the desire of efficiently serving the cause , which he had so warmly embraced , did not permit him to wait for the decision of that body on his application ,  --  but he immediately joined the army . He was at Brandywine , on the day of the battle , with the Marquis de Lafayette , arid other distinguished foreign officers , in the suite of General Washington . At the time when our right wing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid re . treat of the right and centre of our army became the consequence , Count Pulaski proposed to General Washington to give him the command of his body guard , consisting of about thirty horsemen . This was readily granted , and Pulaski with his usual intrepidity and judgment , led them to the charge and succeeded in retarding the advance of the enemy  --  a delay which w*rs of the highest importance to our retreating army . Moreover , the penetrating military coup d'wil of Pulaski soon perceived , that the enemy were manoeuvring to take possession of the road leading to Chester , with the view of cutting off our retreat , or , at least , the column of our baggage . He hastened to General Washington , to communicate the information , and was immediately anthorised by the conimander in chief to collect as many of the scattered troops as he could find at hand , and make the best of them . This was most fortunately executed by Pulaski , who , by an oblique advance upon the enemy's front and right flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage , and the retreat of our army . This important service was justly appreciated hy General Washington , who did not fail to recommend Pulaski to Congress ; // and that body passed the following resolution , on the 15th of September , 1777 . " Resolved , that a corn mander of the horse be appointed , with the rank of a Brigadier . " " The ballots being taken , Count Pulaski was elected . " On the next day after the battle of Brandywine , 12th of September , the army rested about Chester ; on the 13th , it passed through Philadelphia , and proceeded as far as Germantown ; on the next day , it recrossed the Schuylkill , and halted on the Lancaster road , about what was then called the Warren tavern . On the 16th , Pulaski 's indefatigable activity preserved the army from a complete surprise . This is a most interesting fact , and one highly creditable to Pulaski . Of this fact , our biographer does not seem to have been apprised ; nor , indeed , does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , as the annexed account , copied from his 1st vol. page 78 , evidently shows . " Washington , " says Judge Johnson , " prepared again to give his enemy battle . But , with an army inferior in numbers , deficient in cavalry and artillery , and dispirited with defeat , he could not venture on an engagement , except under advantages , which his prudent adversary was resolved not to afford him . On the 16th of September , in the neighborhood of Goshen , the two armies again approached each uther , with an intention to risk another battle . A deluge of rain separated them , and so damaged the arms and ammunition of the Americans , that Washington was compelled , for the present , to decline fighting , and give up the hopes of defending Philadelphia . " Far from Washington being " prepared to give his enemy bat* his army was then in a most deplorable condition ; not only " dispirited with defeat , " but , harassed with fatigue and hunger . The men were here served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time deprived . They wanted rest . Pulaski , who could not for a moment remain inactive , went out with a reconnoitering party of cavalry , and did not proceed very far , before he discovered the whole British army in full march upon our camp ; he retreated in full speed-went to head quarters-communicated the important intelligence to General Washington , who , as can well be imagined , received it with equal surprise and uneasiness-for , he had not the most distant idea of such a movement from the enemy . At his request , Pulaski expressed his opinion . It was , that a detachment of about three hundred infantry , with his cavalry , would be sufficient to retard the approach of the enemy , long enough to enable the commander in chief to make his dispositions to receive them . The command of that detachment was given to Brigadier General Scott , // of Virginia ; and they were scarcely engaged , when a tremendous easterly storm came on , which brought upon us that deluge of rain mentioned by the Judge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences were not exactly as he says , viz. " that the arms and ammunition of the Americans were so damaged , that Washington was compelled for the present to decline fighting . " The arms and ammunition of the enemy were not in any degree better protected ; the continual rain respected neither side ; it fell tremendously upon both , and placed between them an insurmountable obstacle to fighting ; and how . ever great the sufferings of the Americans were that night , they were not the less fortunate , as probably this circumstance saved our army from total destruction . We will not follow Pulaski throughout that campaign , in hi* active services , at the head of his cavalry . On the day of the battle of Germantown , he was sorely disappointed and mortified . There were but four regiments of horse raised , and not one of them completed . Three of them only , such as they were , had joined General Washington 's army , and on the day of the battle , guards were furnished out of those regiments , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals  --  or employed in other service , so that Pulaski was left with so few men , as not to have it in his power to undertake any thing of importance . This was to him a matter of deep regret and bitter chagrin . When General Washington had taken his winter quarters at Valley Forge , the cavalry were sent over into New Jersey , on account of forage , and for other service , on that side of the Delaware . Pulaski made Trenton his head quarters . Thence he represented to Congress the situation in which he had been placed at the battle of Germantown , where he had , in reality , found himself a mere nominal commander . He therefore proposed that Congress , to enable him to be more useful , should give him the command of an Independent Legion , to act with it as a partisan . On the 28th of March , 1778 , Congress , after reading his letter , and taking into consideration a report of the 19th of that month , from the Board of War , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain his rank of Brigadier in the army of the United States , and that he raise and have the command of an independent corps of horse and foot ; the horse to be armed with lances , and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry ; the corps to be raised in such way , and composed of such men , as General Washington shall think expedient and proper ; and that it will not be injurious to the service , that he have liberty to dispense , in this particular instance , with the resolve of Congress against enlisting deserters. " pp. 23-27. // April , As the writer was at the battle of Brandywine , and was one of Pulaski 's reconnoitering party in the affair of the 15th of September , on the Lancaster road , this narrative is to ho received as resting on the authority of an eyewitness . Pulaski 's legion was recruited in Pennsylvania and Maryland , and was organised and disciplined in Baltimore , the place of rendezvous . The enlistment was much mote successful than had been anticipated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched to the theatre of the war in New Jersey . Here it was soon engaged in active service , in the course of which it met with a severe loss in the death of the lieutenant colonel , Baron de Botzen . On the 5th of October , 1778 , the legion was ordered to Little Egg Harbour , with a body of Jersey and Pennsylvania militia , and a field piece from colonel Proctor 's regiment of artillery , the whole under the command of Pulaski , for the defence of the place against an attack , which was expected from the enemy then on that coast . It was here , that colonel Botzen was surprised by the treachery of a Hessian deserter , and killed . This Hessian , who had been injudiciously countenanced by the board of war , and suffered to enter the American army in the capacity of an officer , was attached to Pulaski 's legion as a second lieutenant , and put under the immediate command of colonel Botzen , a distinguished German officer of tried courage , and a high sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deserter , or from any particular cause , it is not known , but he was observed to treat the Hessian with marked severity . This treatment was fatally resented . Botzen 's division was stationed at a distance from the other part of the legion , and the Hessian found means , by stratagem , to communicate with the enemy , and land a party of men near the place . A sudden and unexpected attack was made , and a short contest ensued , in which Botzen was pierced several times through with bayonets , and died with both his pistols discharged in his hands . After the active operations of this campaign , the legion went into winter quarters at Minisink , on the Delaware . But a new scene for its exertions soon opened . On the 2d of February , Congress passed the following resolution . " Resolved , that Count Pulaski be ordered to march with his legion to South Carolina , and put himself under the command // of Gen. Lincoln , or the corn manding officer of the southern departIn obedience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march , as soon as every necessary preparation could be made , and reached Charleston at the very time when the British general Prevost , having suddenly and rapidly advanced from Savannah , appeared before that city , on the 11th of May , 1779 , in the confident expectation that it would surrender to him , on the first summons . The unlooked for arrival of Pulaski baffled all his hopes . Already , had the governor and council agreed on terms of capitulation , not the most honorable , when Gen. Pulaski , accompanied by the brave Col. Laurens , repaired to the council chamber to protest against that precipitate measure-declaring that , as a continental officer , he would defend the city for the United States . Prevost was immediately informed of that determination . Pulaski saw the necessity of reviving the drooping spirits of the inhabitants ; accordingly , he sallied out with the legion , which had just arrived . In that sortie , the Colonel of the legion was killed , but Prevost abandoned his enterprise , and retreated over to the islands . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following account is from Gordon . Nine hundred of the British army , their main body and baggage being left on the south side of Ashley river , crossed the ferry , and soon appeared before the town . The same day Count Pulaski 's legionary corps of infantry crossed Cooper river , to Charleston . They had scarcely arrived two hours , when he led eighty of them out of the lines , and stationed them in a valley behind a small breastwork , with the view of drawing the British into an ambuscade . He advanced a mile beyond the infantry , and joined a party of regular horse , and mounted militia volunteers , and with that force engaged the British cavalry for a while , and then retreated to his infantry ; who , from an eagerness to engage , had quitted their breastwork , and so rendered abortive the advantage of the intended ambuscade , and were , by superior numbers , compelled to retreat . Pulaski , however , by discovering the greatest intrepidity , and by successful personal rencontres with individuals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general panic , and in introducing military sentiments into the minds of the inhabitants . ' In this engagement before Charleston , was killed the colonel commandant of the legion , Michael de Kowalz . He was advanced in age , having passed // his sixtieth year , a soldier of long experience , and covered with scars ; a Hungarian by birth , who had been a colonel of hussars in the service of the great Frederick of Prussia , and decorated with the cross of merit . After the death of lieutenant colonel Botzen , no one had been appointed to fill up the vacancy , and on this emergency at Charleston , Pulaski put the infantry of the legion under the command of the old Hungarian colonel . He engaged the enemy with great eagerness , and advanced so far in front of the breastwork , that he came in contact with the British dragoons , by whom ' he was sabred to death while fighting with the greatest courage and firmness . After the retreat of the enemy from Charleston , the aid of Pulaski was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count D'Estaing arrived on the coast , September 1 , 1779 , with an intention to cooperate with the American forces , and make an attack on Savannah . Pulaski 's legion crossed the Savannah river for the purpose of scouring the country , and while employed in that service , an express was fortunately intercepted with two letters from Count D'Estaing , one for General Lincoln , and the other for Pulaski himself . This latter was extremely complimentary , and the French commander said in it , that knowing Count Pulaski was there , he was very sure he would not be the last to join him . On the 16th of September , Pulaski met D'Estaing at his landing place , and the two officers greeted each other in the most cordial manner . The plan of an attack on Savannah , then occupied by the British , was immediately concerted between them . Without waiting for General Lincoln , they arrived before the town , and D'Estaing sent in a summons demanding its surrender to the arms of France . The British commander , Prevost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could prepare his terms of capitulation . This was inconsiderately granted , and , in the meantime , Lieutenant Colonel Maitland , after encountering many obstacles , succeeded in entering the town with the troops under his command . Thus strengthened and encouraged , the garrison determined on resistance . General Lincoln with his forces formed a junction the next evening , and it was finally concluded to act against the town by a regular siege . From that time till the 6th Of Octobe ; , // whilst preparations for an assault were going on , Pulaski 's legion , with the volunteers attached to it , was kept in constant motion , and had frequent skirmishes with the British piquets and small parties . At length the fatal 9th of October arrived . After the necessary preparations , a heavy cannonade was opened upon the enemy 's works , and br1skly kept up for several days , but without the desired effect . D'Estaing 's marine officers remonstrated against his continuing to expose so valuable a fleet to the fury of the elements , at this tempestuous season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval force , and loudly urged his departure . An assault was , consequently , resolved upon . This assault was to be made on the right of the British lines . Two columns , one French , and the other American , were to attack , at the same time , each a particular redoubt . In the rear of the columns , the whole cavalry , American and French , was to be stationed , under the command of Count Pulaski . Should , as was confidently expected , the redoubts be carried , and the way opened , that entrepid leader was , with these united troops of horse , to enter the place , sword in h*.nd , and to carry confusion and dismay among the garrison . WEstaing led in person the French corps of attack . Wishing to uvoid a circuitous advance round a swamp , and supposing the ground at the bottom to be sufficiently firm , he marched directly through it . The enemy had been informed of his plan by spies . They knew the intended point of attack , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . Accordingly , they collected all their force where it would be required , and , at the first alarm , opened a tremendous and deadly fire . Pulaski , impatient to know when he was to act , determined , after securing his cavalry under cover , as well as the ground would admit , to go forward himself and called to accompany hini one of the captains of his legion , who is yet living , but far advanced in years . They had proceeded only to a small distance , when they heard of the havoc produced in the swamp by the hostile batteries . D'Estaing himself was grievously wounded . Aware of the fatal effects , which such a disaster was likely to produce on the spirits of French soldiers  --  and hoping that his presence would reanimate them , Pulaski rushed on to the scene of disorder and bloodshed . In his attempt to penetrate to the murderous spot , he received a swivel shot in the upper part of hi* right thigh ; and the officer who had accompanied him , was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . ' pp. 28 , 29 . This officer , we are led to understand , was the author of the pamphlet from which the abQve extracts are made . Be- // 388 April , fore the day of battle , he had been twice wounded in the neighborhood of Savannah , and had two horses shot under him . This assault on the town proving unsuccessfid , the enterprise was abandoned , and the allied armies separated in mutual harmony . The French troops and artillery were reembarked , and Pulaski , and the wounded officei ' mentioned above , were conveyed on board the United States brig Wasp , to be taken round to Charleston . Pulaski had every attention , which could be rendered him by the most skilful of the French surgeons , but the wound proved mortal , and he died just as the brig was leaving the Savannah river on her way to Charleston . His remains were committed to a watery grave , and when the vessel arrived in Charleston with the news of his death , a sentiment of universal sorrow pervaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor and council of South Carolina , and the municipal authorities of the city , to pay a marked tribute of gratitude and respect to the memory of Pulaski . A day was appointed for the solemnity , a magnificent funeral procession was formed , the pall was borne by three American and three French officers , and a discourse suited to the occasion was delivered by the chaplain of the army . The whole scene was in a high degree impressive and solemn , and gave strong indications of the sympathy , which the people felt in the untimely fate of one , whose life had been a series of struggles in favor of the just rights of his fellowmen , and who , but one short month before , had contributed , by his wisdom and his bravery , to save the city from the conquest and pillage of an invading enemy . These expressions of feeling were honorable to the citizens of Charleston . Their own historian , Ramsay , has done injustice equally to them , and to the fair fame of Pulaski , by neglecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city by the Polish general , in the manner they deserve . Congress was not unmindful of the duty they owed to the man , who had so ardently espoused the cause , which the whole nation was then in arms to support , and when a letter from General Lincoln was read , giving official notice of the death of Pulaski , it was immediately resolved , That a monument be erected to the memory of Brigadier Count Pulaski , and that a committee of three be appointed to bring in a re* // solution for that purpose . ' A committee was accordingly appointed , but as American citizens we are mortified to acknowledge , that a resolution , frought with so much justice and generosity , and pledging in terms so positive the good faith of Congress , has never been carried into effect . rrlie same unmerited and culpable neglect has awaited a similar resolution of the same body , by which it was ordered , that a monument should he erected to the memory of the brave Baron de Kaib , who fell , pierced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which occurred during the American revolution . Let the time soon come , when a sense of justice , if not of gratitude , shall awaken the thoughts of our national legislature to a proper estimate of a duty so long neglected . From the account here given of the assault on Savannah , which , as coming from an eyewitness , merits implicit confidence , an error may be corrected , that has been transferred from Gordon into all the other histories of the American revolution , respecting the manner in which Pulaski received the wound that caused his death . Gordon says , that Count Pulaski , at the head of two hundred horsemen , was in full gallop , riding into town between the redoubts , with an intention of charging in the rear , when he received a mortal wound . ' All this is essentially incorrect . Pulaski was not at the head of his troops , nor was he riding into the town ; on the contrary , his cavalry was stationary and properly posted , and himself , at the time he received his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was known that D'Estaing was wounded . The further history of Pulaski 's legion may be learned from the following sketch , which we take from Niles 's Register for October 16 , 1824 . It is contained in an article describing the entrance of General Lafayette into Baltimore . As the general passed down the line , a sacred and interesting relic of the revolution was presented to his notice . It was the original standard of the brave and generous General Count Pulaski , whose heroism and devotion to the cause of liberty are conspicuous in the records of the war of independence . The corps of Forsyth 's riflemen had solicited and obtained from its possessor , the worthy Colonel Bentalou , the honour of carrying this standard upon the day of the General 's arrival in the city ; and it was on // this occasion displayed upon one of the spears used by the lancers of the legion , ent*vined with Pulaski 's sword belt . It was when this gallant officer received his mortal wound in the attack upon Savannah , on the 9th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about leaving its earthly tenement , that he bequeathed this belt to his loved and equally brave conipanion in arms , Colonel , ( then captain , ) Bentalou . The legion of Pulaski was raised , organised , and disciplined in Baltimore in the spring of 1778 . At that period the country generally was destitute , none of the fine or useful arts were cultivated  --  the whole energies of the country being bent on war . The army was poorly clothed and badly fed-and , in the absence of more elegant materials or accomplished artists , the standard of the legion was formed of a piece of crimson silk , and embroidered by the Moravian nuns of Bethlehem , in Pennsylvania . On one side are the initials , U. S. with this rnotto-unita virtus fortior-on the reverse , the all-seeing eye , surrounded with thirteen stars , and the motto , non alias regit . It may appear , as it certainly is , a singular circumstance that the standard , ( first consecrated at Baltimore when a small village , ) after having waved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the same place , now a large and important city , and there be permanently enshrined . The history of the " times which tried men 's souls , " while it shows the unsurpassed bravery , and great S*rvices of the legion , furnishes also an explanation of this circumstance . We find that in the summer of 1778 , the lieutenantcolonel of the legion was killed at Egg Harbour , in New-Jersey , by British bayonets . In 1779 , the colonel , at the advanced age of nearly seventy , ( and who had been a colonel of hussars in the armies of Frederick the Great of Prussia , ) fell under the cuts of sabres before Charleston , South Carolina . On the 9th of October , of the same year , the General Count Pulaski was mortally wounded by a swivel shot , at the attack on Savannah , in Georgia . In 1780 , we find that the major was sabred at Monk 's corner , in South Carolina , and the command then devolved upon Captain B.entalou , of the first troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . When the legion was disbanded at the close of the war , the standard was retained in the possession of Colonel Bentalou , by whom it had been carefully preserved . ' As a military man of science , knowledge , and experience , as a soldier in the highest sense of the word , quick to perceive and decide , prompt to act , unwearied in perseverance , collected in the midst of danger , brave without rashness , and discreet in his designs , Pulaski has few rivals in the lists of eminent warriors . His fame spread over Europe during the // short space in which he maintained the unequal contest in Poland , and even Wraxall says of him , that he was acknowledged by the Russians , his enemies , to possess military talents of a very superior nature ; nor were they ever able to take him prisoner during the civil war . ' Dr Franklin says in a letter to General Washington , dated Paris , June i3 , 1777 , Count Pulaski , who was a general of the confederates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is esteemed one of the greatest officers in Europe . ' These testimonies to his military character were fully borne out by his conduct in this country . XVherever he appeared , he showed himself a brave and skilful soldier , inspiring his officers and men with a warm attachment to himself , and confidence in his talents . In respect to the charge of Judge Johnson , above alluded to , very little needs he added . It is presumed that no one , who takes pains to become acquainted with Pulaski 's history , will entertain the impression on the subject , which seems to have existed in the mind of the biographer of General Greene . Speaking of the unfortunate result of the battle at Gernantown , he uses the following words . It is a melancholy fact , of which few were informed , that the celebrated Pulaski , who commanded the patrol , was found by General Washington himself , asleep in a farm house . Policy only , and a regard to the rank and misfortunes of the offender , could have induced the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most probably , we are to attribute the success of the enemy 's patrol , in approaching near enough to discover the advance of the American column . ' Now , admitting this to be true , it is a most extraordinary thing , that it should have been kept secret so long , especially as all the circumstances of that engagement were of a nature to call forth the severest public scrutiny into every transaction , to which the failure could possibly be ascribed . Whatever may have been the indulgence of Washington , it is not credible , that the few who were informed , ' and who can not be supposed to have had any such motives of delicacy , should not reveal a fact , so well calculated to screen the American officers from the disgrace of a defeat , by throwing the burden on the shoulders of a foreigner just then arrived in the country . Nor is the imputation , which this charge casts on Washington himself , such as we should be willing to admit . The // kind of policy , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that which became the commander in chief of a nation 's forces , nor was it that which Washington was known in any other case to exercise . Such a policy , indeed : , would have been little else , than betraying the high trust con* fided to him , and a most unjustifiable breach of right conduct , in suffering the odious consequences of the neglect of one officer to be borne by those , who had faithfully done their duty . Moreover , Washington afterwards recommended Pulaski to Congress , was instrumental in procuring him a very high and responsible appointment in the service , and always treated him as an officer , whom he respected , and in whom he had the fullest confidence . These considerations alone are enough to destroy the force of the charge . It needs not be inquired whether Pulaski was found in a farm house , or what he did , or whether he did anything , at the battle of Germantown ; it is enough to know , that Washington was acquainted with all his conduct there much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whisper of censure for neglect of duty , but on the contrary aided his future promotion . In short , we doubt not , that Judge Johnson has been deceived , and that the authority on which he relied , from whatever source it came , is not entitled to credit ; and every generous minded citizen of the United States must lament , that he should have sanctioned by his name a charge , calculated to reflect no honor on the character of Washington , and to cast reproach on the memory of a brave man , whose fame was so well earned , who devoted his best days to a defence of the rights of outraged humanity in his native land , and , when exiled by the usurpers whom he could not conquer , gave the last years of his life , and the last drop of his blood , to the struggle for the liberties of America .
