ART . V.-Reports of Cases argued and determined in the English Courts of Common Law . Edited by THOMAS SERGEANT and JOHN C. LOWBER , Esqrs , of the Philadelphia Bar . Vols . I , II , II ,  --  V , VI VII Viii . 1822-1825 . Carey and Lea . THE laws , by which the people of the United States are governed , are usually enumerated in the following order ; the constitution of the United States , and the acts of Congress , made m pursuance of its provisions ; * the constitutions and statutes of the several states ; so much of the common law of England , including the law of nations , the admiralty law , and the law merchant , as is applicable to our situation ; and such special customs as have grown up from peculiar local or political circumstances . But this enumeration , though sufficiently complete , does not give an accurate idea of our system of jurisprudence . The habit of viewing it in parts , as a collection of sel ) arate and somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it ought to be regarded , but has led to some important practical errors . The laws under which we live are , in truth , principles derived from the common law of England , but modified in the first place by the peculiar circumstances in which our ancestors were placed , as colonies planted in a distant wilderness , and , after the revolution , by the principles of the constitution of the United States , and those of the several states , and by subsequent legislative enactments . The principles of the common law are the basis of all our institutions . They are the common soil , which may be cultivated in different modes , but to which we are indebted for whatever harvest of law and justice our industry may reap . And , if we may pursue the metaphor , when the fruits of our own cultivated grounds are tnsufficient for our wants , we are accustomed to go forth into the wide fields that surround us , and gather the spontaneous products of the soil . The constitution of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authority of the common law . When our national and state governments were established , they were not designed to abrogate the laws then in force , and establish new systems in their stead , // but to adapt the existing laws to our new situation . Thus the constitution of the United States provides for the trial of public officers by impeachment , and for their removal from office in case of conviction , and declares that the party convicted shall , nevertheless , be subject to indictment , trial , judgment , and punishment , according to law . In other words , the Senate of the United States was substituted for the English House of Lords , and the House of Representatives for the Commons ; but the meaning and effect of impeachment , trial , indictment , judgment , &amp;c. was to be determined according to law , ' that is , the existing , operative , common law . The same remarks may be made on the articles in the constitution , relating to the writ of habeas corpus , to bills of attainder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high seas , and trial by jury ; and still more appropriately to the seventh article of the amendments of the constitution , which speaks in so many words of suits at common law . ' In the constitution of several of the states it was expressly declared , and in all it was implied , that the laws then in force , including of course the greater part of the common law of England , should continue to be in force until altered by the legislature , except such usages as were inconsistent with the constitution then adopted . In all the states , except Louisiana , the common law forms not only the groundwork of their system of jurisprudence , but is itself emphatically the body of the law . Let any one compare the statute book of any state with a good abridgment of the common law , Comyns ' Digest for example , and he will he surprised to find how small a portion of the whole system has been abrogated or altered . Many extensive titles in the law have been left untouched by legislative enactments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Exchange , Arbitrament , &amp;c. the common law has been altered in only a few unimportant paiticulars . A striking instance of the pervading influence of the common law , is found in the trial by jury . The right to this mode of trial has been secured in general terms by all the states , but few of them have thought it necessary to declare the number of jurors , or that the trials shall he in open court , on the testimony of witnesses examined by both parties , and in the presence of judges , who are authoritative expounders of the law . These are circumstances implied in a trial by jury at // common law , and therefore required no particular enactment . In all parts of the Union , the common law is first resorted to for the rule of decision , and then the constitution , statutes , and customs of the state , for the modifications of the rule . What then is the common law ? And where is the evidence of its existence to be found ? The common law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding , which have been gradually developed and received by general consent in that nation , during the long period of its independent existence , and which have been adapted to its successive periods of improvement . As it grew out of the circumstances of the times , it was necessarily suited to the character , situation , and pursuits of the people . And when the English colonies were first established in this country , our ancestors brought with them the English common law , as it then existed ; but in the spirit of the common law , they at once rejected what was not applicable to their peculiar situation , and carried the principles already established , to new results arising out of their new circumstances . In the progress of society , new principles were developed in the colonies , as well as in England , and these were in each adapted by analogy to the exist ng system . At the period of our Revolution there was a distinct colonial common law existing in each of the colonies , differing in many particulars from the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same tree . They shot forth , indeed , on opposite sides , and diverged more and more from each other ; but in their widest separation , they continued to bear a general resemblance , and derived their nourishment and support from the same trunk . From an iml ) ortant quality of the common law , which we shall presently explain , we had , during the century and a half of our existence as colonies , adopted nearly all the improvements that had been made in England , besides making many more of our own . When the Revolution took place , we still adhered to the maxim , that so much of the common law was to be adopted as was applicable to our situation , and some parts of the system , such as the principles which relate to national sovereignty , which had never been applicable to the circumstances of the colonies , and of course had never been acted upon by them , were immediately adopted and applied to the states . // In the United States therefore , as in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have been adopted by tacit , but universal consent , or which have been derived from other acknowledged principles , and developed by the circumstances in which we have bee*placed . These principles are found not only in the decisions of our courts of justice , and the treatises of learned lawyers , but in the history of our country , and of the nation from which we have descended . The origin of many of our customs , it is well known , may be traced back to the Gauls and Germans described by C*sar and Tacitus . And even our modern commercial law is to be sought in the digests of Justinian , the usages of the free cities of the middle ages , and the marine ordinances of France and Spain , as well as in the opinions of Lord Mansfield , and the customs of the merchants at Lloyd 's . The jurisprudence of every nation , with whom we or our ancestors have had intercourse , has been laid under contribution ; and our laws , like our language , have flowed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are adapted to our present character and wants , and admit of indefinite expansion and improvement . A code of laws is a coat of mail , which , bowever perfectly made , admits of hut few movements , and can fit but one person and that for a short period ; while the common law is an elastic garment , which adapts itself to every size and every variety of motion . This flexibility of the common law is a quality of vast importance to us as a young and improving nation . Our jurisprudence is a philosophical science , not derived merely from an abstract consideration of the nature of the human mind , but adapting the rules of action to the precise character , situation , and wants of those whom it governs . Its objects , and of course its operations , are as extensive and various as human actions . In its general principles it is founded on right reason , neque opinione , sed naturd constitutum essejus ; and in the application of those principles to particular cases , it is guided by rational analogies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human knowledge , without a corresponding improvement in the science of law . The manner in which this improvement is made will be readily understood by those , who are familiar with the proceedings of courts of justice . In the larger number of litigated cases , there is generally no difficulty in reducing the // question to its proper class , or in discovering the general principles by which it should be decided . It is the application of those principles , and their limitation or extension to the new case , that occasion the contests of the bar . In the examination of conflicting argun*ents and analogies , the question is considered , not only in its relations to the general system of law and to the habits of society , but in its remote consequences ; and , when decided , it becomes itself a new illustration of the general principle , and may affect all subsequent reasoning upon the subject . Every case , therefore , rightly decided , is a new step in the progress of the science . An illustration of these remarks may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general principle is , that a witness , in giving his testimony , shall appeal for the truth of his declaration to a God , who is the avenger of falsehood . But what God ? The God of the Christians , said the ancient common law ; and therefore neither Jews , nor Pagans , nor unbelievers , could be permitted to testify . The form of taking an oath , which was settled in Popish times , was plainly founded upon this opinion . The person about to testify laid his hand upon the books of the Holy Evangelists , * who , as well as the Supreme Being , were invoked as witnesses , and after repeating the oath , he devoutly kissed the book in token of his belief and reverence . It was soon found , however , that the testimony of Jews was often necessary for the due administration of justice ; and it was held that a Jew might be examined as a witness , after swearing upon the books of the Old Testament , and appealing to the God of Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , till the year 1657 , when in the case of Dr Owen , Vice Chancellor of Oxford , it was held that kissing the book , about which he had religious scruples , was no essential part of an oath.t As the commercial intercourse of England * The several oaths , prescribed by acts of Parliament to be taken in the English Custom House , conclude with the adjuration ,  --  ' as God you help , and his Saints . ' Our ancestors in Ne* England very early entertained the same scruples , and altered the form by tacit consent . By an act of the General Assembly of Massachusetts , in 1692 , it was declared that no person serving as a justice , juror , witness , or otherwise , shall he obliged to use any other ceremony in taking of their respective oaths , than lifting up the hand , as has been accustomed . ' // with other nations increased , the narrowness of the rule began to be felt ; and in the great case of Omichund vs Barker , in 1744 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three chiefs , that the depositions of a Gentoo , residing in the East Indies , relating to a contract made there , and sworn to according to the forms of his religion , could be received in evidence in the court of chancery . One step further was taken in 1804 . On the trial of certain persons indicted for felony , before Graham B. at the Old Bailey Sessions , a native of China , after dashing in pieces a saucer , which he took in his hand for that purpose , and declaring his belief , that his God would so dash him in pieces , if he uttered a falsehood , was received and examined as a witness . And in exact accordance with this , the deposition of a French witness was received in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , who made his declarations a la maine droite levee ; ' it being proved that in France the lifting up of the right hand is held to imply an oath . In these several cases the general principle was preserved , but its application was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public opinion . A code , or a statute prescribing the form of oaths in judicial proceedings , would have been inflexible . Another consideration shews the value of the accommodating principle ' of the common law , as it has been happily termed by Judge Wilson . The laws of a free people can never be much in advance of the actual state of society . In monarchies , where a code of laws may be framed and imposed by the power of an individual , something may be done in the code itself to alter or raise the character of the people . But where the people themselves make their own laws , they will of course adapt them to their existing state and their pressing wants . They will do little for posterity . New cases must be provided for , after they have occurred , by new statutes ; but these will not be enacted until the evil become general , and be generally felt . A system of statute law must altvays be behind the actual state of society , instead of keeping pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as a system of jurisprudence , which are plausible , and deserve to be considered . It may he said , that its principles are vague and uncertain , and that it gives the judges , in effect , the // power of legislation . To the first , it may be replied , as we have said above , that the greater number of contested questions regard the application of a principle , and not the principie itself . But much of the uncertainty of law arises from the narrow limits of our knowfrdge , and from the unavoidble imperfection and ambiguity of language . In the infinite variety of human actions , no legislator can foresee or provide against particular cases , and even classes of cases , which are continually arising . He can only establish general principles ; and we are not certain , that a general principle can be laid down in terms , more accurately than it can be collected from a series of adjudged cases . The English Statute of Frauds , reputed to be the joint production of Sir Matthew Hale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been reenacted in nearly the same words by almost every legislature in the Union , is a memorable instance of the imperfection of language , and of written law . Lord Nottingham used to say of it , that every line was worth a subsidy ; and the profession and the public have generally acquiesced in the opinion of Lord Kenyon , that it is the wisest law in our statute book ; ' yet it has , without doubt , occasioned as many lawsuits , as there are words in it , and it may probably occasion as many more . The Reports , which we are now examining , contain sixteen cases , which turn upon the construction of the words of this statute . No written law can possibly meet all the emergencies of a great and busy people ; as no dictionary can fix the language of such a people . When a new case arises it must be settled by the analogy of existing laws ; and new customs must be tolerated or sanctioned , when they spring from the necessities of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . Et nova , factaque nuper , habebunt verba fidern , si Gr*eco fonte cadant , parc* detorta . In general , however , recourse is had to the usages of other times , or the institutions of other nations , to supply the deficiencies , or illustrate the meaning of existing laws . Notwithstanding the acknowledged excellence of the Napoleon Code , we have the authority of Mr Duponcean for the assertion , that the digest and code of Justinian , the former laws and ordinances of France , and the immense collection of the // Oct. works of the civilians and French jurists , are as much used in the courts of France as they formerly were . They constitute the common law of France , and are gradually incorporated with the code , by means of judicial decisions ; of which the French , as well as th' English and Americans , have voluminous reports . We took occasion in our last number to advert to the second objection , and in some measure to answer it ; but as the subject is important , it deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly than by taking a particular example ; nor can any instance be selected more favorable to the objector , than that of Lord Mansfield , to whom England is indebted for almost her whole system of commercial law . Before his time , the law of insurance , of bills of 6xchange , and of agent and factor , scarcely deserves notice , and the additions to these subjects made by his successors have been little more , than the development of principles established by him . Yet , in establishing these principles , Lord Mansfield never acted as a legislator introducing a new law . He found certain usages existing among merchants , which had generally been borrowed from foreign countries , and certain loose and somewhat discordant opinions , derived from the commercial ordinances of other nations , and which might often be traced back to the civil law . These usages and opinions he inquired into , compared , and digested ; and wherever they were not inconsistent with the law previously established , he gave them the sanction of a judicial decision . Before his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercantile cases was thrown together . They were generally left that is , without any distinction between law and fact to a jury , and they produced no established principle . From that time , the great study had been to find some certain general principles , which should be known to all mankind , not only to rule the particular case then under consideration , but to serve as a guide for the future . They had beard these principles stated , reasoned upon , enlarged , and explained , till they had been lost in admiration at the strength and stretch of the human understanding . ' This is nO more than a just account of the labors and merits of that eminent jurist , whose opinions even now are affecting the modes of thinking and habits of business of half the commercial world . // Ifthe view we have taken of the common law be just , a reason is furnished for the continued circulation of English lawbooks among us . The cases adjudged in the English courts are received by us , not as authorities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practice , or as instances of new principles derived from others previously established . They have the same effect upon our system of jurisprudence , that a new series of experiments would have upon any existing system of philosophy . They serve to illustrate , confirm , or correct it . In numerous classes of cases , the courts in Westminster hail , and in this country , reason upon the same acknowledged principles ; and though we by no means admit the superior knowledge or ability of their tribunals , it would be absurd to contend , that we can not derive instruction from their decisions . Still , however , in their printed reports there is much that can not in any way be useful to us . Their system of ecclesiastical law , with all the incidents of tithes and advowsons , their copyholds , stamp acts , poor laws , and their technical points of practice , are subjects of more curiosity than use to the American lawyer . In the lawbooks , which we receive from England , there is much that is truly valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly useless . It is the design of Messrs Sergeant and Lowher , in the volumes before us , to give the substance of the cotemporary English Reports , carefully separating the wheat from the chaff . The plan they have adopted is very judicious , and deserves to be followed in all American editions of foreign Reports . They preserve the marginal note of every case , and the whole index , but wherever in their opinion the case is not applicable to American jurisprudence , nothing but the marginal note is given . The cases which are preserved are reprinted without abridgment . The first volume contains the substance of the fifth and sixth volumes of Taunton 's Reports ; that is , the cases decided in the Common Pleas and Exchequer Chamber , from Trinity term 1813 , to Easter term 1816 . The very first case in Messrs Sergeant and Lowli*br 's volume is an instance of the only fault , which we have to charge upon them ; that of admitting too many cases , which are superfluous , or inapplicable to the jurisprudence of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows . // If the Court direct any proceedings to be set aside on tennis , the terms are a condition precedent ; and till performance of the terms , the proceedings stand , and the plaintiff may pursue them without application to the Court . ' This certainly is plain enough , *nd did not require the insertion of even a short case to illustrate it . The marginal note is sufficient of itself . In our examination of this volume , we marked seventyfive cases , occupying about one hundred and thirty pages , which might have been omitted without lessening its value to the American reader . We apprehend , indeed , that it would have been more acceptable to the profession , if it had been reduced to one half of its present size . The second volume contains the cases in the 7 . Taunton Common Pleas , in 1816 and 1817 and the 1 . Starkie Nisi Prius Circuits in 1814-1816 . Of two hundred and fortyeight cases in Starkie , only nineteen are omitted . The third volume consists of the Nisi Prius cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports , and the cases of 1816-1819 , in 2 . Starkie . Mr Holt is the Reporter of the Common Pleas , and Mr Starkie of the King 's Bench . The fifth volume* contains the cases determined in the Common Pleas in 1819-1820 , from 1 . Broderip and Bingham , and in the King 's Bench during the same period from 3 . Barnexvall and Alderson ; together with the Nisi Prius decisions of the Common Pleas in 1818 from 1 . Niel Gow . The sixth volume is composed of the 2 . Broderip and Bingham , and the 4 . Barnewall and Alderson , and brings down the decisions of the King 's Bench and Common Pleas to Trinity term 1821 . The seventh volume in like manner is composed of the 5 . Barnexvall and Alderson , and the 3 . Broderip and Bingham . The eighth volume furnishes us with the decisions of the King 's Bench to Easter term 1823 , from 1 . Barnewall and Cresswell , and of the Common Pleas to Hilary term 1824 , from 1 . Bingham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically the original Reports , from which the work of Messrs Sergeant and Lowber is compiled ; but the perusal of these volumes * The volumes have not been published in their numerical order , and the fourth has notyct reached us. // has confirmed a suspicion , which we have for some time entertained , of the declining state of the English bar . There are doubtless men of powerful minds and extensive reading found in the English courts ; but judging from the arguments and decisions contained in the printed reports , it is rare to witness , at the present time , the display of dither great talents or profound learning . The profession of law in England holds out so many inducements to ambition , that it must always attract the most active and energetic minds . The want of talent , therefore , at the bar , if such be the case at present , must be entirely accidental . The cause of the decline we have mentioned must be traced to other circumstances . One of the most obvious of these is the great increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for argument , nor to the court for examination and study* An argument , as it is called by courtesy , at the bar , is nothing more than a dry citation of adjudged cases ; and the opinion pronounced by the court is seldom founded on general principles or fortified by reason . it is enough for the case if it can be sustained by the practice of former years . Another cause , and one of the most effective , is the illiberal policy which has confined the studies of the profession to their own jurisprudence , and prevented them from deriving assistance from the institutions of other nations . So far has this prejudice been carried , that those great lawyers , who have in fact availed themselves of this secret Source of wisdom , have not dared to avow it . It is now well known , that many of the most celebrated opinions of Lord Mansfield are derived almost literally from passages in the civil law ; yet he never refers to it by name . And in the case of Omicliund vs Barker , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of his argument , and citing freely the Scriptures , the writings of the Fathers , the Greek poets , and foreign jurists , was constrained to make an apology for referring to the civil law . The origin of this prejudice is well known to professional readers , but it would take up too much of our remaining time to explain it . Happily for our country it does not exist with us . In our courts of justice , the writings of civilians and foreign jurists are referred to freely and fearlessly . The Institutes of Justinian , and the commercial treatises of Pothier , Emerigon , and Roccus , are natLiralised among us ; // and in many libraries , Bynkershoek , Heineccius , and Valin , have taken their place by the side of Blackstone and Coke . Our printed reports show the fruits of this liberal study . They are not filled with technical subtilties , nor are they merely libeili de stillicidiorum. ai. * de parietitm jure . That they are not read in England , and quoted in her courts of justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is a prejudice , which we should be the last to imitate in our own conduct . We should rejoice to find English lawbooks in our courts of justice , as we do to see English machinery in our manufactories . We have little doubt that we shall improve upon both .
