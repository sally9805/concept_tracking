txt 115 ART . VI. - Essai sur lVlrt d'Etre Heureux , par JOSEPH DRoz , de 1'Acad*mie Fran*aise. 4 ' * Edition . l2mo. *p. 335 . Paris . 1225 . THE author of the little work before us has not attempted any regular definition of happiness ; but assuming that we all know pretty well what it is , has employed himself principally on inquiring how we may attain it . We are not sure that a more thorough investigation of the nature of the end would not have modified in some degree the notions of Mr Droz , in regard to the means . However this may be , it appears that he has made , as he conceives , some important discoveries , or at least greatly simplified and improved upon received notions . He has methodized his principles into a series of rules , which he entitles The *1rt of Being Happy ; and he believes that by a steady and judicious application of them , a man may realize the summum bonurn with a good degree of certainty . The subject is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth examining , should they cven turn out to be somewhat less origiual and valuable than they are considered by their authors . Mr Droz commences by expressing his surprise at the apparent indifference of most persons to their own good . Our object , in life , ' he remarks , is happiness . One would think this a sufficiently familiar truth ; but how often is it overlooked or despised ! To see the restlessness and agitation of many persons , one would suppose that the great affair was not to be happy , but to be rich , or to obtain some office . ' And again ; Make happiness the principal object of your life . When one of your neighbors says to you , " My speculations are successful ; 1 shall certainly become immensely rich ; " and another , " I shall doubtless carry my election , and am on the high road of political advancement ; " reply with equal self-satisfaction , " As for me , I hope to enjoy many happy days . " ' Although the mass of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlook , in the opinion of our author , the search after happiness , he admits that there are some illustrious exceptions ; and reckons among them our countryman Dr Franklin , of whom he speaks in the following high terms . We see , from time to time , appearing among us , some of those rare individuals whom nature intended as models of moral beauty* // Such was Benjamin Franklin , the pride of the new world . I have often perused the pages in which he describes his plan for aiming at moral perfection , and which he concludes as follows . " Although I have not attained the perfection at which I aimed , and have even fallen very far short of it , my endeavors have nevertheless rendered me better and happier than I should have been if I had not made the attempt , as a person who tries to improve in penmanship by imitating a copperplate model , although he should not equal the correctness and elegance of the engraving , may yet acquire a more easy and legible hand than he had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I owe , under Providence , to this little artifice , the happiness which I have constantly enjoyed up to my seventy-ninth year , in which I write these lines . Should the rest of my life be disturbed by misfortunes , the recollection of the preceding period will enable me to support them with resignation . " ' While we perfectly agree with Mr Droz , in his estimate of the character of our illustrious townsman , and particularly in his approbation of the doctrine contained in the above extract from his Memoirs of his own life , we can not but remark that it does not appear to confirm , so explicitly as our author supposes , his favorite notion of the great importance of making the direct pursuit of happiness the principal object . Dr Franklin assures us in this passage that by the use of certain means , which he describes , he had lived happily up to a very advanced age . But what were these means ? Did they consist in making happiness the direct and principal object of pursuit ? Quite the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have often perused , ' says our author as above quoted , the pages in which Franklin describes his plan for arriving at moral perfeclion . ' Moral perfection , then , was the mark to which our philosopher directed his view . By aiming not immediately at happiness , but at moral perfection or virtue , he succeeded , it appears , in making himself , to a certain extent , both virtuous and happy . The conclusion is ( as far as a single example can be depended on ) that if a man would be happy he must endeavor to be virtuous , and that if he succeed tolerably well in this , happiness will come of itself . Mr Droz , on the contrary , advises that we should aim directly and immediately at happiness , leaving moral perfection ( of which , indeed , he says but little ) to come in by the way , as it may or can . Waving any inquiry into the respective merits of the two systems , we can not but remark that the example and precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to imagine , the theory of our author , are exactly opposed to it , and as far as they have weight , completely refute it in its foundation . Had 1*lr Droz examined more carefully , and followed out into its consequences the principle supposed in the single passage above quoted , he would probably , if he really feel the veneration which he professes , for the pride of the new world , ' have spared himself the trouble of writing his book , at least in its present shape . In fact , his theory and that of Dr Franklin , instead of coinciding , plainly exhibit the adverse colors of the two great rival schools of philosophy , into which the moral world has always been divided . Franklin wishes us to frequent The marble porch where wisdom wont to talk With Socrates and Tully ; ' while Mr Droz would conduct us , in preference , to certain pleasure gardens of somewhat doubtful fame , which were laid out in olden time in the neighborhood of the said porch , but were never much patronized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bye , to learn that our fair friend , Miss Frances Wright , lately consented to pass a few days in these same suspicious gardens ; but venture to hope , that she has only been upon a tour of observation , and will not think of making them her habitual residence. * By aiming at moral perfection , it appears that Dr Franklin not only partially attained his object , but succeeded besides in realizing a good measure of happiness . Whether a man , who , in compliance with the advice of Mr Droz , should regard happiness as his direct and immediate object , would in that way be likely to make any corresponding approaches towards the attainmeat of moral perfection , is perhaps uncertain . But waving this point , which does not belong to our present subject , there is room to fear that the method recommended by our author may not be so effectual , even for the acquisition of happiness itself , as he appears to imagine . There are some things which are come at by an indirect process , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled .71 Few Days at *Whens , which contains a very ingenious exposition and defence of the Epicurean philosophy , in the antique form of dialogues . Although we disapprove the doctrine , which is also decidedly at variance with the principles recommended in the Views of Society and Manners in .71rnerica , by the same lady , we can not but regard the literary execution of it as highly cred* itable to the learning and talents of the fair writer . // one ; and many competent judges believe that happiness is one of the number . We strongly incline to this opinion , and susl ) ect that the pretended art of being happy is very much like the art of making gold , which at one time occupied the attention of so many of the learned , but which has long been admitted to be almost the only process by which gold can not be made . Make shoes , make coats , make hats , make houses , make almost anything you please ( except perhaps books ) , and you in fact make gold , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , converts itself naturally in your hands into that valuable metal . But once attempt to make gold by a direct process , and you not only fail in your object , but sustain a total loss of the time , labor , and capital employed in the operation . The case , we imagine , is nearly the same with studying directly the art of being happy . Study politics , study law , study commerce , study agriculture , study any of the fine or mechanical arts , and you in fact study happiness , because independently , of the immediate fruit of skill , in this or that department of knowledge and practice , which you derive from your studies , there is no more certain way of being happy , than to pursue with activity and diligence almost any honest employment . But no sooner does a man set about studying directly how he shall be happy , than ho is pretty sure to become completely miserable . D'Alembert maintained , in conversation , that happiness was an ex-* clusive privilege of those whom the world calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then replied to his own question , Quelque mis&amp;able ; that is to say , Your poor devil is your only happy man . ' And there is a good deal of truth , as well as much consolation , in this . The common blessings which Providence distributes abundantly to the prudent and virtuous of even the humblest classes , are no doubt quite as conducive to happiness as the imaginary and illusive advantages of the favorites of fortune . But if , reversing the question of D'Alembert , we ask , Qui est-ce qui est mis6rable ? Who is the real poor devil ? ' we may perhaps reply with confidence , that it is the man who is always studying to be happy . The experience of the world in all ages and nations , from Seged , king of Ethiopia , down to the luckless schoolboy , groaning under the burden of a holiday , confirms this notion . And there appears to be a deep philosophical reason for the fact , at which we have already hinted . It is , that happiness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operation , performed with the immediate // purpose of attaining it ; but on the contrary , the indirect result of an operation intended immedintely and principally for the attainment of another object , which is ( according to the theory of Franklin , no doubt the true one , ) moral perfection or virtue . The leading principle of Mr Di'oz , which makes happiness the direct and exclusive object of pursuit , is therefore , we think , erroneous , and his whole doctrine fails of course in its foundation , or , in the French phrase , piche par sa base . Nevertheless , as our author professes to teach us the art of being happy , and as credit is generally allowed to every man in the art he professes , omni perito in sud arte credendurn est , it may be proper , before we condemn his theory , to survey it a little more in detail . After establishing as a preliminary maxim , that the attainment of happiness is the proper object of life , our author proceeds to explain the means by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected . The first requisite is , that we should exempt ourselves entirely from the trammels of all the ordinary business of the world that is going on about us . It is only in this way , that we can be independent ; and independence , according to Mr Droz , is essential to happiness . The only true independence is that which we enjoy when we dispose of all our time at discretion , without being embarrassed with professional or other business . This sort of liberty is oppressive to the unoccupied ( hommes inoccup6s ) , but to others is a source of real happiness . How charming it is to say to one 's self , upon awaking in the morning , " This day is wholly my own . " The Epicurean passes a delightful hour , before he rises , in reflectin on the pleasures of independence . ' g We may remark , en passant , that Mr Droz avows in this passage his adhesion to the school of philosophy with which we had identified him . Habeo eor*fitentem reurn ; in the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , our author 's Utopia bears a singular resemblance to that of Gonzalo in the Tempest . In order to be happy , we must have nothing to do , no professions , no trades , no business of any kind ; no kind of traffic Would I admit , no name of magistrate ; Letters should not be known ; no use of service , Of riches or of poverty ; no contracts , Successions ; bound of land , tilth , vineyard none ; No use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil ; . A " o occupation ; all men idle , all And women too , but innocent and pure ; No sovereignty ; ' // and afterwards All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor ; treason , felony , Sword , pike , knife , gun , or need of any engine Would I not have ; but nature should bring forth Of her own kind all foizon , all abundance , To feed my innocent people . ' The picture , no doubt , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in the ease of our author , as in that of the honest old counsellor of Naples , the latter end of his cornnonwealth forgets the beginning . Gonzalo , after declaring that he would have no sovereignty in the island , concludes by affirming , that he would with such perfection govern , Sir , To excel the golden age. * Mr Droz , in like manner , while setting forth the freedom from all occupation as the cbief element of happiness , remarks in the same sentence , that to unoccupied men the want of occupation is oppressive , but that to others it is a source of real happiness . ' Now we profess ourselves unable to conceive who are the others intended in this phrase . We agree with our author in thinking that persons who are unoccupied will be unhappy ; but on our view of the subject , all persons who have no occupation are unoccupied . The others who , on the theory of Mr Droz , are to enjoy the delights of the dolce far niente , seem to us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three children , who ran away when their comrades fell into the water ; Three children sliding on the ice , All on a summer 's day , It so fell out they all fell in , The rest they ran away . ' Mr Droz may perhaps reply , that the happy few intended are those who , having really nothing to do , are able to create occupation for themselves . But this explanation , which can hardly he reconciled with the language , is also in itself replete with difficulties . Why present , as the principal element of happiness , what is misery to the greater number , and paradise only to one in a thousand ? And again ; How does it appear , that the occupation which a man creates for himself is so much more agreeable than that which devolves upon him by the effect of circumstances ? Is occupation , in the opinion of our author , a sort of moral disease , which is fatal when forced upon a man in the natural way , but which , when he gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the smallpox when contracted by inoculation , but is actually converted into a principle of health and wellbeing ? Does experience confirm this singular theory ? We think not . Take the example of the Count de Caylus , a French nobleman , well known to the scientific world by the publication of a collection of engravings from antique vases , with a learned and elegant commentary . . Je grave , said the Count to a brother nobleman , by way of apology for devoting himself to an employment which the other regarded as beneath their common dignity , je grave pour ne pas me pendre . I engrave , that I may not hang myself ! * The Count was one of the select number who , having really nothing to do , are able to create occupation for themselves , and ought , on our author 's system , to have been perfectly happy . Yet what was the extent of his felicity ? Forsooth to escape hanging . A pretty definition of the summum bonum ! Instead of confirming the theory of i*Ir Droz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse . Many excellent citizens , in all countries , have obtained reputation , wealth , and happiness , by pursuing , as a means of support , the same respectable occupation of engraving , which seems to have conferred upon the Count no other benefit , than that of saving his neck from the pocket handkerchief or the penknife . And we doubt not that the general current of examples would sustain the moral deducible from that of the learned Frenchman . Independently therefore of the glaring inconsistency observable in this passage , we are quite clear in the persuasion , that the common sense of the world is against Mr Droz on the main point , and in favor of the pursuit of some honest employment , as one of the most efficacious means for attaining happiness . All the principal books are agreed in this . What says Voltaire , for example ,  --  a high authority with our author ? Le travail doigne de nous trois grands maux , le vice , le besoin , et 1 ' ennui . Labor secures us against three great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What says Dr Franklin , the pride of the new world , '  --  the ma gnus . /Jpoiio of Mr Droz ? If our author would know , let him read Poor Richard , Le Bonliomme Richard , as the French translate it , where he will find but slender encouragement to be idle . We can not indeed but express our wonder , that a writer , whose chief purpose seems to be to inculcate the advantages of idleness , should have selected the author of the Way to Wealth , ' as his guide , philosopher , // and friend . Finally , what says the Bible ? For we take it for granted , that Mr Droz is a good Christian , and will acknowledge the authority of the precepts of the wise king of Israel . The Epicurean practice of lying in hed an hour or two in the morning , in order to ruminate upon the pleasure of having nothing to do through the day , is alluded to by Solomon in no very flattering terms . As the door turneth upon its hinges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does Mr Droz conceive , that the happiness of a wise and good man consists in imitating the mechanical action of a door turning upon its hinges ? So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as an armed man . ' Are poverty and want the chief elements of happiness ? Even the weaker sex are exhorted to be up hetimes and doing . The pattern wife riseth while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household . She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness . ' Her place , it seems , is no sinecure ; hut what reward has she for her trouble ? Her children rise up and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he p*aiseth her . ' Approved by her hushand , honored by her children , the pride and love of all around her , our busy , little housewife is , after all , not so badly offi Can Mr Droz promise his fair disciples anything better than this , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our belief , the common sense of the world is therefore , as we have already remarked , against Mr Droz on this point , and in favor of the diligent pursuit of some regular occupation , as a principal element of happiness . It is true that we hear at times , from the Italians , of the doice far niente , or the delight of having nothing to do ; hut even in the same quarter , there are not wanting respectable authorities in favor of a different system . The Marquis of Spinola , an Italian general , celebrated for his military exploits in the war of the independence of the Netherlands , passed the latter part of his life in retirement , upon a handsome pension , and of course in the full fruition of the dolce far niente ; but being one of those persons without occupation , who are also unoccupied , he found himself ( as usually happens , even according to our author , with gentlemen of this ( lescription ) rather ill at ease . While in this situation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades of inferior rank in the army , a captain perhaps , or possibly a colonel ; and upon inquiring into the nature of his disease , was answered , that he died of having // nothing to do . . Alori della malattia di non tenere niente a fare . Basta , replied the unhappy 1*Iarquis , with a strong feeling of sympathy in the fate of his departed brother of the war , basta per an generate . T is enough to have killed him , had he been a general . ' Such , even on Italian authority , are the pleasures of the dolce far niente . They appear to he enjoyed in the same way in other ranks and walks of life . Read , for example , in Lafontaine , the story of the cheerful cobler , rendered miserable by a present of a hundred croxyns , and finally returning in despair to lay them at the feet of his would-be benefactor , and recover his good humor and his last . Behold the luckless schoolboy ( to recur again to one of the examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his natural occupation on some Thursday or Saturday afternoon , and perishing under the burden of a holiday . See him hanging at his mother 's side , and begging her , with tears in his eyes , to giv&amp; him something to do ; while she , poor woman , aware that the evil is irremediable , can only console him , by holding out the prospect of a return to school the next day . Observe the tradesman who has made his fortune ( as the phrase is ) , and retired from business , or the opulent proprietor enjoying his dignified leisure . How lie toils at the task of doing nothing ; as a ship without ballast at sea , when it falls calm after a heavy blow , labors more without stirring an inch , than in going ten knots an hour with a good breeze . How he groans and sweats , ' as Shakspcare has it , under a happy life How he cons over at night , for the third time , the newspaper which he read through twice , from beginnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist , reduced by good fortune to this forlorn condition , has assured us , that he often begs the domestics , who are putting his room in order , to prolong the operation as much as possible , that he may enjoy again , for a little while , the lost delight of su perintending and witnessing the performance of useful labar . But this is not the worst . No sooner does he find himself in the state of unoccupied blessedness , than a hcst of nuxyished for visitants ( doubtless the same with those who took possession of the swept and garnisheri lodgings of him in Scripture ) enter on his premises , and rieclare his body good prize . Dyspepsia ( a new name of horror ) plucks fromn his lips the untasted morsel and the brimming box 1 , bedims his eyes with unnatural // blindness , and powders his locks with premature old age . Hypochondria ( the accursed blues of the fathers ) ploughs his cheeks with furrows , and heaps a perpetual cloud upon his brow . Hepatitis ( like the vulture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints ; Gout grapples him by the great toe ; so that what with black spirits and white , blue spirits and gray , ' the poor man suffers martyrdom in every nerve and fibre , until Palsy or . lpoplexy , after all the kindest of the tribe , gives him the coup de grace , and releases him from his misery . His elysium is much like that of the departed Grecian heroes in the Odyssey , who frankly avowed to Ulysses , that they would rather be the meanest day-laborers above ground , than reign supreme over all the shades below . In the above course of remarks , we have given Mr Droz every advantage in the argument , because we have supposed , that it is entirely optional with every man , whether he shall work or be idle , and that in making up his mind upon the subject , he has only to consult his own convenience or caprice . But our author seems himself to have been aware , that this is not precisely the case , and has anticipated the objections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make themselves useful , by turning their talents to account in one way or another , while a still larger class are compelled to labor by the imperious call of necessity . These difficulties , we say , our author anticipates and endeavors to remove ; but in what manner ? The reader shall judge . The first objection appears to give him but little embarrassment . Moralists tell us , ' he observes , that we must make ourselves useful , that we must pay our debt to society . But in order to be useful to the world , I see not why a man must necessarily exercise a profession or hold an office . Tell me not that my morals are dangerous , and that my system would deprive the community of the services of the individuals who compose it . Be not alarmed ! You will never be in want of governors to rule you , bankers and lawyers to fleece you , or physicians to extricate you from their hands . ' Refraining , at the special request of Mr Droz , from telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remark , that his logic appeared to us to be defective . The question , as we understand it , is not , whether individuals will or will not work ; whether there will or will not always be such professions and employments , as those of bankers , lawyers , // public functionaries and physicians , ( concerning which very respectable occupations the author expresses himself , in our opinion , in much too unceremonious terms ; ) but whether it be better for the world that individuals should or should not work , and that these and other similar professions should or should not exist . Mr Droz contends , that it is in general the preferable course , for people to be idle rather than to work ; and when pressed with the objection , that if the habit of idleness were to prevail generally , the community would be without laborers , he turns round upon us with the naked assertion , that individuals will at all events work . This may be and probably is true ; but whether it be or not , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument . If individuals will at all events work , it follows of course that they will not be idle ; and in that case the community will certainly not suffer for want of their labor . But in the case before us , the supposition is that they do not work , and on that supposition the conclusion follows with equal rigor , that the community will suffer for want of their labor . If Mr Droz do not feel the necessity of it , we must in conscience ( at the risk of appearing uncivil ) advise him to sell his Montaigne , and buy with the proceeds a copy of Watts 's Logic . In order to be useful to the world , I see not , ' says our author , why a man should exercise a profession or hold an office . It is enough that he lay in bed two or three hours every morning , to ruminate upon the pleasure of having nothing to do through the day . ' A mighty profitable thing , no doubt , to the community ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing the case home to the individual supposed , because it is certain that he will at all events work . In plain lan0uage , and reducing the argument to its simplest terms , it is unnecessary for a man to work in order to make himself useful , because it is certain that he will at all events work ! Shade of Peter Ramus ! what dialectics ! The mode in which our author meets the objection drawn from the necessity of labor to the subsistence of the individual , is in our opinion still more unsatisfactory . It is here indeed that the difficulty really presses . in all the systems with which we are acquainted , including that of Mr Droz , it appears to be regarded as one of the principal elements of happiness , that a man should have his regular three meals a day . Even the dolce far niente , were it ten times as sweet as Mr Droz thinks it , would turn sour on an empty stomach . It is also well known , // that there is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that which was discovered hy the late premier of Great Britain between the breeches pocket and the animal spirits ) , by the effect of which , the operations that usually go on in the latter , are greatly affected by the state of those which appertain to the former , and proceed vigorously , or come to a stand , along with them . When the spinning wheel ceases to revolve , and the shuttle to vibrate ; when the hammer no longer descends upon the anvil , and the goose reposes coldly on the shopboard ,  --  the spit in like manner stops in its course , the fire goes out in the oven , and the water in the pudding-pot recovers its natural level . Such are the acknowledged principles of the economy of domestic life . In one word , a man who will not work can not eat . While this is the case , and while eating is necessary to happiness , it is in vain to tell him , that in order to be happy he must be idle , for the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ventre aJfam* n'a pas d'oreilles . Our author , to do him justice , feels the force of this objection , and admits it to a certain extent . But with what sort of grace ? Does he yield with the good humor of a philosopher and a Frenchman , who knows how to take his parti , and after a passing shrub of the shoulders resigns himself with equal noncltalance to either fortune ? Quite the contrary . His tone and language are rather those of a pettish schoolboy , who , being compelled against his will to study his lesson , purposely neglects it , recites it of course imperfectly , and is punished at night for his want of attention . If our author must work , he will do as little , and that little as carelessly , as possible . If compelled , ' says he , to renounce the pleasures of independence and the charms of Epicurean indulgence , I should attach no importance to the choice of a profession . Not being able to do what I wished ( that is , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I should , however , carefully avoid all lucrative and brilliant employments involving responsihihity and care . After sacrificing every day the number of hours absolutely necessary to furnish me with the means of subsistence , I should devote the rest to enjoyment , my main object being , not to become rich , but to be happy . ' We shall not quarrel with our author , on the score of his indifference to the choice of his profession , or of his avowed preference for an obscure occupation over a brilliant one . The // feeling may doubtless be carried to excess . Few persons of good sense would take as much satisfaction in flourishing a cl ) imney-sxveeper 's brush on the housetop , as in leading the debates in the councils of a nation . But leaving out of view extremes on either side , it may be safely enough admitted , that individuals , exercising such employments as naturally place them in the middle walks of life , enjoy , on the whole , as large a share of happiness as any others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the common lot of humanity , are also proportionally less acute , and their condition possesses in stability what it wants in brilliancy . The choice between the kind of tranquil wellbeing , which a man enjoys in such a situation , and the glorious but often agonizing struggles , the alternations of triumph and despair , that attend on those who pursue their way along the stormy summits of social life , is a matter of taste and character , rather than of principle One man , as Horace says , delights in raising a cloud of Olympic dust around his conquering car , while another is satisfied with a quiet pinch of snuff in his little back parlor . The eagle and the stork On cliffs and cedar tops their cyries build while the swan , with arched neck Beneath her white wings mantling proudly , ' bathes her downy breast in the smooth waters of a silver lake , or sails in graceful majesty along its green velvet magin , without envying the superior elevation of others . There is room in the world for all God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a fortunate thing , as it serves to prevent competition and promote the general harmony . But while we allow to Mr Droz all the latitude upon this point which he can reasonably wish , we must decidedly enter our protest against the other part of the doctrine set forth in the above extract . Has our author fully considered what he is saving , when he recommends to his disciples to take no interest in their employment , whatever it may be ; to work at it carelessly and negligently , just long enough to obtain a hare living , and then hurry ho*ne to l*ed , or to the tavern to keep Saint . Monday ? Meeting him on his own ground , and takinr our b pIes from the middling and loxver walks of life , does Mr Droz really mean to tell us , that a tailor , for instance , will best consult his happiness by working as little as possible at his trade , // receiving as few orders as he can , executing those which he receives in a careless manner , disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instead of wielding incessantly the shears and needle , passing most of his precious hours in spinning street-yarn ? Is that barber in a fair way to realize the summu*n bonum , who intentionally hacks the chins of the public with dull and wretched razors , or burns their ears with his curling tongs , on purpose to deter as many of them as he can from coming into his shop ? Admitting for argument 's sake ( what no honorable man would allow for a moment ) , that the only object of exercising a profession is to obtain a bare subsistence ; is it not perfectly clear , that an artist , who should follow the system of our author , would completely fail , even in this miserable purpose ? If a tailor send home a coat awkwardly and unfashionably cut , or negligently made up , the indignant customer forthwith returns it on his hands , and transfers his order to a more industrious and attentive workman . From making a few coats , and those badly , the recreant knight of the shears would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would inevitably starve by the side of his cold goose , upon a vacant shopboard . A barber , in like manner , who should adopt the ingenious practices alluded to above , for clearing his shop of the surplus number of long beards , would not probably find the ebbing tide stop exactly at the point , necessary for supplying him with bread and bedclothes . He would soon find himself , like Ossian 's aged heroes , lonely in his hall . From keeping his own shop , he would be compelled to enter as journeyman in that of another , and by continuing to pursue the same process , would sink in succession through the several gradations of houseservant , street-porter , and vagabond , into the hospital , the port where all who sail by our author 's chart and compass will nat-. urally bring up . The only way , in fact , by which a man can expect to turn his labor to account , in any occupation , is by doing the best he can , and by putting his heart into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the rank , among his brothers of the trade , to which his talents entitle him ; and if he can not rise to the head of his art , he will at least be respectable , and will realize an honorable living . It is not every barber that can aspire to the fame of a Smallpeace , a Higgins , or a Williams ; but any one who is diligent and assiduous in his shop , and who takes a just pride in seeing his customers leave it with glossy chins , well dressed hair , and neatly shaped favori ( es , // should his natural aptitude be even something less than firstrate , will yet never want the comforts of life for himself and his family through the week , his five dollar bill to deposit in the savings bank on Saturday evening , and his extra joint to entertain a brother Strap on Sunday . And while he thus realizes an ample revenue , the zealous and attentive artist reaps , as he goes along through life , the best reward of his labor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , and the approbation of his fellow citizens . A high-minded tailor feels as much satisfaction in seeing a well made coat go out of his shop , as the dandy to whom it is sent , in putting it on , for the first time , to appear at an assembly . And when ( as may often happen in our blessed country ) the artist meets his customer in the fashionable circle , and finds his work commended by acknowledged connoisseurs ; when he listens to the praises bestowed upon the knowing cut of the collar , the nice adjustment of the body , and the graceful fall of the skirts , his heart dilates with a secret rapture , which is worth ten times as much to him as the profit he makes upon the article . It differs specifically only , hut not in kind , from that which , as the poet tells us , was felt by the goddess Latona , when she saw her daughter Diana , The silver-shafted queen for ever chaste , ' leading up the dances of the mountain nymphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of Mount Cynthus , and excelling tbe*n all in grace and beauty ; Qx*alis in Eurotm ripis ant per juga Cynthi Exercet Diana choros ; quarn mule secut*e iliac atque hinc glornerantur Oreades ; illa pharetram Pert humero , gradicasque dens supereminet omnes : Laton*e taciturn pertentant gaudia pectus . ' These gratifications Mr Droz loses for the sake of his dolce far niente ; and , like Shakspearc with his quibble , is content to lose them . Next to idleness , he seems to consider disregard for public opinion as the principal means for obtaining happiness . T is a great folly , ' he remarks , to expect to be happy , and at the same time to obtain the general approbation . Hypocrites may protest against this doctrine , and certain feeble souls may inquire , if it he not dangerous to preach up contempt for public opinion . I answer , No ! provided we are sufficiently resolute and firm in our purpose . T is a truth , which we should never cease to present , in a thousand forms , to the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , be some risk for those who follow // only a part of my prescriptions ; but those who obey the whole , are safe . ' The desire to excel , and obtain the favorable opinion of others , is of course inadmissible on this system , and is denounced in unequivocal terms . An indispensable condition for obtaining happiness , is to shut the soul against ambition . If I yield to ambition , I must quit my retirement , renounce the pleasures which I derive from the society of my family and friends , and from my liberal occupations . No more delicious morning reveries ! I must no more live for myself ; in quitting my obscurity , I resign repose and independence . ' XVe may remark here that Mr Droz , notwithstanding his previous xvarni eulogies on the pleasures of idleness , is unable to make out a picture of a happy life for himself without including his liberal occupations ; and thus renounces inadvertently his own declared doctrine , and conies back to the one recommended by the common sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to despise public opinion . But in giving this last somewhat hazardous counsel , has Mr Droz duly weighed all the consequences of the line of conduct which he advised us to pursue ? Has he fully considered the well known remark of one of his own distinguished fellow countrymen upon this subject ? ii y a quelqu'uu , said the Prince de Talleyrand , qui est plus fort que . N'apol6ou , et qui a plus d'esprit que Voltaire ,  --  c'est tout le monde . There is somebody ' ( the language is so idiomatical as hardly to bare translation ) , there is somebody who has more power than Napoleon , and more wit than Voltaire ,  --  that is , every body . ' The Prince is clearly of opinion , that this terrible somebody is not to be trifled with ; and M. de Talleyrand is a person of so much talent and experience that he ought to be heard with great attention . The result has , in fact , established the truth of this remark , as far as Napoleon is concerned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loftiest height of fortune that any mortal ever attained , to perish miserably on a burning rock in the middle of the ocean . Is Mr Droz quite sure that his disciples , by following even the whole of his l ) rescriptions , will come off with flying colors from a conflict that proved fatal to this political Colossus ? There is no danger , ' replies our author , provided we are sufficiently firm and resolute . We have only to take courage , and all will be well . ' These are bold words , but are they proportionally // just ? Did courage restore to Napoleon the empire he had lost ? Would it rescue an overdone tailor from the hospital , replace him in his shop , and gather round him anew his train of offended customers ? Will courage feed and clotb.e a poor man and his family ? Will it pay his rent , and serve him to settle his weekly bill at the baker 's and the butcher 's ? Can he deposit courage in the savings bank ? We all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will answer none of these purposes . The error of Mr Droz , in this part of his system , seems to be , in taking it for granted that the only unpleasant effect of despising others , is to be despised by them in turn ; a moral evil , against which the moral remedy , courage , might be expected to afford some relief . Populus me sibilat , at mi/ti plaudo . But the real objection to the theory is ( as we have already shown ) , that contempt for public opinion brings upon a man material and physical ruin in all its worst shapes ; and this is a case in which the moral specific , recommended by our author , loses all its virtue Who can hold a fire in his hand , By thinking on the frosty Caucasus ? Or wallow naked in Decembcr 's snows , By dreaming on fantastic summer 's heat ? ' But as we wish to give our author every advantage in the argument , that he can possibly desire , let us meet burn on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctness of his doctrine , as he understands it , let us suppose an example , in which the immediate consequences of contempt for public opinion , are in fact no more than to encounter in turn the contempt of the public . Let us take the case of a schoolboy , or a student at college , who happens to meet with The sirt of Being Happy , and finds himself exhorted to cultivate a habit of idleness , as the best method of attaining this desirable object ; and to despise the opinion of the world , or , in other words , to disregard the advice and reproof of his parents and instructers , which might probably be opposed to our author 's system . Why , ' says Mr Droz , waste your precious hours , and wear out your young eyes , in fagging over old hooks ? Why immure yourself this fine weather in a close and crowded school ? It is surely far pleasanter to pursue your sports with your merry mates in the open air upon the green . Your instructers and parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for keeping at the foot of the class , and some of your fellow students may possibly ridicule your stupidity . But why should you regard the prosing of a musty old peda // gogue , or the gibes of a group of thoughtless boys ? Of what consequence is it to you , whether you take your place at one end or the other of the file , in which they are drawn up to recite ? Be of good heart , and if they laugh at you , laugh at them in turn . Take your own course ; be idle and be happy . ' This doctrine would sound pretty well in the ears of our supposed pupil , who would also find no difficulty in reducing it to practice . Nor would he suffer immediately in this case , in consequence of his contempt for public opinion , any considerable diminution of his material comforts . The sunshine of paternal affection , like that of Providence , illuminates ( for a while , at least , ) with equal favor the evil arid the good ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lodged , as well as his busier brothers and sisters . For a few days , the experiment might appear to have perfectly succeeded . But when examination comes , at the week 's end ; when our infant Epicurean sees the prizes for good behavior and superior attainments , distributed to others , and nothing awarded to himself hut notes of infamy ; when the honored father looks coldly on him , and the kind mother has no smile of consolation , while the merry and mischievous urchins about him are all in high glee , at his expense ; - Mr Droz may say what he pleases about courage , but we are after all not stocks and stones ; nature , we apprehend , would have her way , and in spite of scorn , Tears , such as schoolboys weep , burst forth . ' But grant the contrary ; grant that our little philosopher brazens it out manfully , and gives no external signs of palling in resolution . Grant that lie shows all the courage that Mr Droz could desire ; that he proves himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what follows ? Is martyrdom happiness ? The precise object of oni author , as we understand it , is to avoid painful efforts of all kinds , and lead an easy , sans souci life but we are now called upon to exercise courage , fortitude , and longsuffering , in order to he able to endure his Epicurean paradise . Does not our author feel , that the call for courage supposes of itself , that we are in presence of pain and difficulty , instead of ease and pleasure ? Does it require so much fortitude to support prosperity ? so much longsuffering , to hear up under a course of uninterrupted happiness ? Does a man brace his nerves , and steel his heart , to encounter a comfortable fire , a good dinner , and a circle of smiling friends ? Our author invites // us to recline upon a bed of roses , and when we accept his proffer , and put ourselves into his hands , he stretches us out upon St Lawrence 's gridiron . This result agrees sufficiendy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad ways , the rocky and the flowery paths , that conduct respectively to life and death ; but we hardly expected to hear the same doctrine from Mr Droz . In this , as in the other instance , the latter , end of our author 's commonwealth forgets the beginning . It appears , therefore , by the admission of Mr Droz , that the contempt of public opinion , which he so strongly recommends , leads to nothing better than the crown of martyrdom ; a situation to which , however enviable it may be , in some respects and in some causes , few would aspire as the ne plus ultra of ease and comfort . On the other hand , the feeling of respect for the ju*lgment of the world , which leads us to endeavor to excel in such arts and qualities as may render us agreeable and useful to others , does not seem to be productive of any equally serious inconveniences . The apprehensions of our author in regard to this point are , we think , exaggerated . In quitting my obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , repose and independence . No more delicious morning reveries ; I must no longer live for myself . ' If , by repose and independence , as the words are here used , our author mean complete idleness ; if he have no other notion of happiness , than that of turning every morning for two or three hours in his bed , as a door turneth on its hinges , there is , of course , nothing more to be said . Happiness , thus refined , is doubtless incompatible with honorable distinction , in any line of life ; but even on this view of the subject , it might be pertinently asked , whether the sacrifice of ease , required by respect for public opinion , be worse than the martyrdom which it seems we must suffer by despising it .. If , however , our author means , by repose and independence , what men of sense generally intend by these words , that is , rest after labor , and the occupying of a favorable and commanding position in society , we conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment of honorable distinction , are its natural consequences and rewards . Persons of eminence in the various walks of life , are doubtless much employed because the value of their services is known ; but this , to a man of right feeling , to one whose heart is in his business , is not dependence and drndgery , as Mr Droz seems to think it ; t is itself a pleasure , labor ipse voluptas . The // healthy excitement of arguing an important case and thereby securing the rights of an injured fellow citizen , of pleading the cause of truth and justice before the assembled councils of a nation , affords a pleasure , if our author did but know it , which would be well worth the sacrifice of one of his brightest morning dreams . As to independence , does our author mean to be understood , that a person who has attained a high distinction in any honorable pursuit , is less favorably situated in the usual*re1ations of social life , than those about him ? On our view of the subject , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can do for each individual , what no individual can do for him . His convenience , therefore , must be consulted by all . If he choose to labor , he selects the time , the place , and the manner , at his discretion . The favored mortal for whom he works , is too happy in obtaining his aid , to pretend to have an opinion about the manner in which it is to be given . He performs himself the interesting and important parts of the task , and assigns the rest to subalterns . When he has finished , he sets his price upon what he has done , and whatever it may be , it is paid with a sentiment of gratitude , and not of superiority . What citizen of the United States did not feel himself deeply obliged , when Canova and Chantrey sent us out their admirable images of the majestic form of the father of our country ? Who ever dreamed , that the service was in any way requited by the payments which these illustrious men may have consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this by the tone and language employed on these occasions . Here , my worthy fellow , ' ( such , in substance is the manner in which we apply to an ordinary hami ) here is a piece of work , which I am willing to put into your hands , if you will perform it at a reasonable rate ; if not , I shall give it to some one else , for there are enough others who can do it as well . ' When we address an artist or professional person of eminence , the style is different . My noble friend , I am in the greatest possible embarrassment , and you are the only person who can extricate me from it . Your assistance is indispensable to me . Let me beg you to undertake the business , and make your own terms . ' Who , then , in such a case , is the dependent , and who the independent man ? Mr Droz certainly takes a false view of this matter . Independeuce is peculiarly the attribute of those , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful labor . As they pass through the world , they are constantly distributing // favors on every side , and the people look up to them as public benefactors , and delight to do them honor . As the Muses in Virgil 's eclogue stood up in presence of the poet Gallus , Utque viro Plirebi chorus assurrexerit omnis , so the Roman people , by a charming application of his ownverses , rose with one accord to salute the Mantuan himself , when he appeared at the theatre . And as to repose , when they wish to indulge in it ( which is not so often or for so long periods , as our author would probably think necessary ) , the business of the world ( for no one else can do it ) must wait their leisure . Cicero , at the height of the practising season , at a time when , as he says in his letters , hardly a day passed in which he did not argue some cause , could retire for two or three weeks together from the Forum and recreate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh breezes from the Tuscan ocean , that rolled below his windows , and composing his celebrated six books upon Government . The leisure of these great men of antiquity seems to have been more productive , than the working hours of the worthies of this degenerate age . Even the caprices of distinguished men must be indulged , because their aid must in many cases be secured at all hazards . When Achilles in a fit of ill humor quits the Grecian army , and holds himself aloof in his tent , the king of men , after attempting in vain to go on without him , is compelled to yield the point in question ( however delicate ) , and court him back with more messages , than the other chiefs are willing to carry . The deep diplomacy of Ulysses , the uncompromising frankness of Ajax , the fatherly affection of Phcenix , and the garrulous wisdom of aged Nest or , are all put in requisition , in fruitless endeavors to persuade the haughty youth to make peace on his own terms . Something similar to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . There is therefore , we think , but little foundation for the fears of Mr Droz , that in quitting obscurity , he shall renounce at the same time repose and independence . Instead of agreeing with him in considering a contempt for public opinion as one of the principal elements of happiness , we should rather say ( like the generous old Roman when he first heard the same Epicurean doctrine expounded by a Greek philosopher ) , May the gods give such principles to our enemies . ' To our friends we should rather recommend ( in conformity to the wisdom of ages ) to seek the good opinion of others , and to aim at a just // and honorable distinction . Such was the parting counsel of his aged father to Achilles , when he sent him forth , under the care of Nestor and Ulysses , to accompany the Greeks to the siege of Troy ; linesdeleted // opinion . Although he may not have exercised any r egular profession , he has given satisfactory evidence of a laudable degree of activity , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo.rk before us , if it be not thought to demonstrate his good sense , is at least a proof of his industry . His Essay on . Ailoral Philosophy , or the D ' *fferent Theories of the . /lrt of Living , is another ; his Studies on the Beautjful in . /lrt , a third ; his Eulogy on Montaigne , a fourth ; and so of his various other writings . Mr Droz is , in short , a person who cultivates letters with zeal and assiduity in his own way . This pursuit is after all an occupation tout comme un autre , and in some cases one of the most honorable and useful , in which a man can engage . We put it to our author 's conscience , whether the delicious morning reveries , of which he makes so much account , are always devoted literally to reflections on the pleasure of having nothing to do through the day ; whether they are not sometimes taken up in meditations on the forth-coming work . Mr Droz talks at his ease of the dolce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manuscript open on his writing-table. l3ut let his study be locked up ; let him be debarred from the use of pen , ink , and paper ; let him be excluded from reading rooms and public libraries ,  --  let all this continue for a few weeks , and he will hold , we suspect , a different language . We should probably find him laboring under the same disease , which carried off the comrade of the Marquis of Spinola . Nor do we believe , that he can alle *e his own experience in support of his recommendation of contempt for public opinion , with greater justice . It is remarked by Cicero , that the very philosphers who advise us to despise the opinion of the world , put their names to the books containing this counsel . Our author , we are sorry to say , is an example of this inconsistency . Upon turning to the head of this article ( where the titlepage of the work before us is copied ) , the reader will see at full length the name of Joseph Droz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of his christian and family names , follows the honorary addition of . Illember of the French academy . He is willing we should know that his art has enabled him to scale the celestial towers occupied by the Forty Immortals , who preside over the world of French literature , and take his place among the nun*-her . Even this is not all . After the qualification de l ' . /Jcad5-mie Fran*aise , we next find the significant memorandum , quatriime Edition , Fourth Edition . ' Is this then the end , or // rather the beginning , of our author 's superb indifference ? Why should Mr Droz , who holds the judgment of the many so very cheap , be at the pains of informing us that they have takcn off three editions of his book ? * Is it consistent in one who scorns the suffrage of his fellows , ' to proclaim upon the house-top , that he has been received into the French Academy ? Did it become this contemner of public opinion to indulge in the petty vanity of being known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our author , while recommending to his disciples the primrose path of dalliance , ' has had the good sense to pursue himself with some degree of firmness the steep and thorny road ; ' and while advising others to despise public opinion , has made no scruple of doing everything in his power to conciliate it in his own favor . This management appears at first view singular , and upon a second may be thought suspicious . Timeo Panaos . Is Mr Droz endeavoring to put us to sleep that he may have the field entirely to himself ? At all events , we like his example better than his precepts . It is time , however , to close our colloquy with this writer , which we have already continued somewhat longer than we at first intended . Beside the chapters to which we have particularly adverted , there are several more upon a considerable variety of subjects ; such as Pleasure , Pain , Love , Hatred , Melancholy , Marriage , Life , Death , and others of equal moment . They are all treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to comment upon them in detail . In combating the arguments of our author , in favor of idleness and contempt of public opinion , we have had occasion to intimate that , on our view of the subject , his theory is directly the reverse of the truth , and that a diligent pursuit of almost any honest occupation , and a decent* regard for the judgment of those around us , are among the most effective means , that we can employ , for the attainment of happiness . We may add here , that the real art of being happy is nowhere stated in a more satisfactory form than in the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament , and the Two into which they are abridged in the New . The person who shall diligently and faithfully practise upon these digests , will have but little need of the assistance of Mr Droz . A good * One of our author 's books ( if we are not mistaken , the work now before us ) obtained the prize which had been offered by the French Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , that should appear during the year . Credite , posteri. // familiar and practical exposition of the spirit of these approved codes is to be found in the common saying , The art of being happy , is to endeavor to make other people so ; to which the most judicious pl*ilosophers have subjoined as a supplementary principle , that a man is never happy without a good wife .
