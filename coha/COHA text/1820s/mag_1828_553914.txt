By CAPTAIN BAsIL HALL , Royal Navy . ISmo. pp. 331 . G. &amp; C. Carvill . New York . Tna embassy of Lord Amherst to the court of China twelve years ago , together with the events of the voyage performed by the British vessels of war , the Alceste and the Lyra* on that occasion , and particularly the account of the Loo Cho* islands narrated by the voyagers on their return , are doubtless in the recollection of many of our readers . The Alceste , commanded by Captain Murray Maxwell , and the Lyra , a ten gun brig commanded by Captain Basil Hall , were despatched to convey the ambassador and his suite to the river Pei Ho , at the confluence of which with the Yellow Sea they were to debark and proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recount , but confine ourselves to the little volume before // us , from the perusal of which we acknowledge at the outset , that we have derived much amusement and profit . Soon after Captain Hall 's return to England , he published an account of his voyage in an elegantly printed volume , accompanied with appropriate drawings , an appendix containing original charts constructed from his own surveys , and several scientific tracts suited for the instruction of future navigators , who should explore the seas which he had visited . This work was too expensive for general circulation , but it was so well received by the public , that the author was induced to prepare another edition , from which he excluded the scientific articles , and clothed the narrative in a somewhat more popular dress . He seems , indeed , to have spared no pains in this revision . The style is essentially altered throughout , four entire chapters have been added on topics connected with the voyage , but not embraced in the first narrative , and numerous original paragraphs are here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , therefore , we deem it a new work , and shall proceed to make our readers acquainted with its contents as such , notwithstanding the general interest , which Captain Hall 's description of the Loo Choo people excited at the time it was first published , as well in this country as in England . The edition now offered to the American public , we suppose to have been reprinted from the last Edinburgh edition , although it bears indications of some very slight alterations by the author . The curious and important events , which thicken upon us as we advance in the volume , will not allow us to dwell with Captain Hall in his first chapter , which takes us very agreeably from England to Java . We will venture to remark , however , that the story of his interview with the natives at Anjeer Point , of their appearance and amusements , is told in his best manner . He describes a wedding which he had the honor of attending , and at which he found , among other guests , ten venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , round several smoking bowls of rice , and messes of meat cut into small pieces . ' Being invited to join this group of ancients , and partake of the wedding feast , he instantly complied , mounted the table with becoming gravity , and in default of forks and spoons , and in imitation of his associate guests* he made that use of his fingers for which nature contrived them . His companion was in a less tractable humor , protested he // saw no fun in this , ' and refused the proffered hospitality . INileanwhile the happy couple were seated in great state in a deep recess on one side of the apartment , bolstered up with a dozen of large pillows covered over with gilt trimmings . ' These persons were solemn and demure , said nothing , and took no notice of any body , nor of anything that passed . How the wedding ended we can not report , for at this stage of the ceremony , to our no little disappointment , the author abruptly leaves us , and goes abroad to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to the coast of China , there to communicate with Sir George Staunton , chief of the English Factory at Canton , and with other persons destined to accompany the expedition . The Emperor had already been informed of the intention of the Prince Regent to send a mission to the court of Pekin , and his reply was hourly expected . The vessels took in water at Hong Kong , one of the Ladrone Islands , where they awaited the Emperor 's answer , which was at length received by an express from the Factory . Full permission was granted by it for the embassy to advance up the coast in the vessels , and land at the port nearest the capital . Twelve days after quitting Hong Kong , they passed around the promontory of Shantung into the Yellow Sea . As their charts availed them little in these unknown regions , they were obliged to move onward with caution . The water became sl , allow long before land was discovered , and apprehensions began to be entertained , that the vessels would be stopped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually ploughing in this sediment , which was perceived by the yellow color of the water in the wake , and also by the retarded motion of the vessel , and the difficulty of steering . The same thing was observed by Dr Clarke , the traveller , as he passed the mouths of the Nile out of sight of land . In this instance the vessel 's wake exhibited a deep black color , and the muddy sediment was so impalpable as to present only a slight resistance . Captain Hall thinks , with apparent good reason , that the tradt of water called the Yellow Sea will one day be filled up by these deposits of the rivers that run into it and that the whole region will become alluvial , like that of Bengal or Egypt . After a good deal of difficulty the mouth of the river Pei Ho , the destined place of the ambassador 's debarkation , was discovered . The water was so shoal as to oblige the squadron to // anchor eight or ten miles from the shore , and two mandarins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in the civil , came off to pay their respects to Lord Amherst . Previously to approaching the ship , two visiting cards were despatched by an inferior officer from these great persons , which were at least a foot and a half in length , and not less than a foot wide . They were made of red colored paper , with the name and title written in a perpendicnlar line in the centre . ' These mandarins were deputed by another of higher authority , to whom the ' charge was assigned of conducting the embassy through the country to Pekin . At last the ambassador and his attendants landed at Tacoo , a town about a mile above the mouth of the Pei Ho . Here the navigators took leave of the ambassador , whom they did not see again till they met him at Canton five months afterwards , on his return over land from the Chinese capital . The visiting cards of spacious dimensions , sent by the mandarins to Lord Amherst , remind us of Father Horta 's description of the ceremony of visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people rises to the dignity of a book . Wben a person pays a visit , be stops at the gate till the porter comes , and then gives him several loose leaves of paper , on which are written in large characters the name of the visit*-er , his titles , and the purposes of his visit . The common color of these leaves is white with a red cover , but there are other colors varying according to the rank and quality of the person to whom the visit is paid . An invitation card is still more formidable . It consists of several leaves , on the first ' of which is written the name , address , and titles of the person invited ; then follows the invitation ; and last of all the bill of fare for the proposed entertainment . Father Horta transcribed a form of invitation on a card which he saw , which ran as follows . Chao-ting has prepared a repast of some herbs , cleaned his glasses , . and arranged his house , in order that Se-tong may come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the eloquence of his learning ; he therefore begs , that he will not deny ' him that divine pleasure . ' As our voyagers were not invited to an entertainment of this sort by the Chinese , they hadi no means of knowing the forms adopted on such occasions . From the Pei Ho the two vessels sailed in different direc. lions , the Alceste steering northward for the purpose of examining the Gulf of Leotung , and the Lyra southward along the voL. xxvi. - No. 59. 66 // coast that borders the Gulf of Petchelee . In eleven days they met again at Che-a-tou Bay , and , after refitting , sailed in company to the harbor of Oei-hai-oi , to the eastward of the former port on the coast of* Shantung . This place Captain Hall supposes had never before been visited by Europeans , and he speaks of the reception , which they met from the inhabitants , as favorable to the Chinese character . A vast concourse of people gathered round to see the strangers when they landed , arid ct 's they proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were escorted to the neat and elegant mansion of a mandarin , where they were regaled with tea , hot wine , and sweet cakes* They were allowed also to walk through the village , and in its environs* By the time this visit of ceremony was over , the mob had dispersed , and we separated into different parties , to stroll about the country , no sort of objection being made to our doing so . I have often remarked that on these occasions , where no harm is intended , and the gratification of curiosity the only object , the best way is to go straight forward , without putting difficulties into the people 's heads , by seeming to imagine any permission necessary . At least during this voyage , whenever we began by soliciting leave to walk into the country , or to look at anything , our request was almost invariably refused . It is always easy enough ' to discover when such a proceeding is really disagreeable or improper ; and it seems then full time to turn back . The first house we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by a wall or fence , made of neatly wattled twigs . On the steps before the door sat a woman sewing , who as soon as she beheld the apparition of half.a dozen strange looking men , screamed out , threw down her work , and in spite of all our attempts to pacify her , continued to alarm the neighborhood with her cries . Among ' the people who came to her relief was a middle aged man , probably her husband , who , with great roughness , turned us round by the shoulders , marched us out of his grounds , and pointed to the ships . There was no mistaking this , and finding our eloquence only augmented the lady 's fury , and the honest man 's indignation , we gave up the point , and turned from this uncivil couple towards a party of men and women employed in winnowing corn . This was done on a hard smooth mud floor , raised three feet above the level of the field , near a farm-house . We observed that they first beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then tossed it into the air , that the wind might blow away the chaff . One of the farmers showed me a double drillplough , and when I expressed some curiosity about these matters , // he put the plough into my hands , implying that he wished me to keep it . In the course of the evening he brought it on board , hut would accept nothihg in return . We succeeded in gaining ground much better with this group than with the scolding lady , chiefly hy making friends in the first instance of the children , to whom we gave buttons , curtain rings , and such trifles as we had put in our pockets on leaving the ship . This speedily opened a way to the good will of the parents , and as soon as we observed them , softening a little in their reserve , we engaged their full attention and respect , by allowing them a peep through the telescope , always an object of great wonder to such people ; after this had gone roqud the circle , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great delight , and a sight of our watches completed the treaty of amity between us . While this was going on , a countryman driving a donkey loaded with vegetables , joined the party . We instantly tried to open a traffic with him for his whole cargo , but ht*re an unexpected difficulty arose . He knew so little of our money , that he refused to part with his vegetables in exchange for Spanish dollars , a coin we had always been taught to believe passed current in every corner of the earth . All the trinkets we had brought with us had been already disposed of , and nothing but what was valuable remained ; our friend , however , though evidently much amused , and willing enough to sell his cabbages , would give nothing without some equivalent . In this unwonted dilemma , when silver was of no avail , it occurred to me to try the efficacy of a more showy metal , and borrowing the countryman 's knife from him , I cut a button from my uniform , then seizing a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anchor in the other , I appealed to the company whether the bargain was not a fair one . This was irresistible ; and I carried my point by acclamation . In this way , by stripping one side of my jacket of its row of finery , and debatiig the value of each item , I became possessed of the whole cargo . The winnowing party , including several women , and a number of children , had left their work , and assembled round us , listening to this discussion , which I need not say was carried on with much laughing and joking on both sides , although neither party understood a syllable of the other 's language . I was a little at a loss what to do with my purchase , for my sole object , in which I completely succeeded , had been to produce good-humor , and I had nobody with me to carry the vegetables . At length , however , I explained to the peasant that I wished them carried to the boat , and although I took no farther charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the afternoon . ' pp. 52-55 . Towards the evening of the same day Captain Hall and Mr // Clifford crossed over to the opposite side of the harbor , and took a walk for some distance into the country . Pursuing a path leading from the shore , they passed a low ridge of hills , and soon found themselves in a neat little hamlet , at the bottom of a secluded valley , embowered in groves of trees . The villagers flocked around them with much curiosity , and received them with kindness and hospitality . They examined the dress of their visitants , and such articles as they had about them , with expressions of astonishment . The following picture is not more novel in its incidents , than beautiful in its moral , and may well he contemplated with admiration by communi. * ties , which boast of a much higher degree of civilization and refinement , than it has been usual to allow to these remote Chinese . During the inspection which was instituted into my apparel , I had given to one man my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and the company by opening and shutting my penknife , and in the confusion my watch was passed from hand to hand , till lost sight of altogether . At length these good people were satisfied ; and fancying everything was restored , we took our leave as the day was closing . But we left the village by a different path from that by which we had come ; and after wandering for some time among the hills , till it became almost dark , returned to the shore . Before stepping into the boat , however , I wished to make a record of the time of tide , and then first discovered that my watch was gone* I had no recollection of the person into whose hands I had given it ; and even if I had , was without any means of discovering him . All the stories about the thievish disposition of the Chinese now crowded upon our recollection ; and the good opinion we were gradually forming of their character , was shaken to its foundation . The watch , however , was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we resolved to return to the village , to give it a chance . All was now silent among the cottages , and we wandered about f*or some time , till attracted by a light at a window , we we*it up to it , and addressed two people sitting at supper in the room . They were much alarmed at our sudden appearance , pushed us rudely away , and closed the window . This was an unpropitious begin-. fling ; but we persevered till , on reaching the court or square near the centre of the villa* e , we fortunately lighted upon a party of eight or ten men , some lying on the ground , others seated on chairs , smoking their pipes , and enjoying the delicious coolness of the evening air , which had succeeded to the burning heat of the day . I was not much in a humor to notice fine grouping or pie .. // turesque effects , but happening to remember the Chinese for watch , Pee-o-i , I repeatedly pronounced it , exhibiting at the same time my empty pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my loss . But as I was under the full conviction all the while that I never should see my watch again , I may probably have expresed some impatience on the occasion . This , however , produced little effect on the Chinese , who merely took their pipes from their mouths , leaned on their elbows , and listened with great attention to all I had to say . When I had finished my speech , which consisted principally of signs , interspersed with occasional mention of the word Pee-o-i , an old gentleman of the party got up , and patting me good-naturedly on the shoulder , gave me his ready-lighted pipe to console me , and with great gravity , in the midst of which I fancied I could sometimes detect an ironical smile when he looked towards his companions , made me a long speech , which , although I could not understand a single word of it , seemed to set forth that it was quite useless to be angry about the matter . The rest of the party laughed heartily at the oddity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the discussion was over . As I saw very soon that there was nothing for it but good-humor  --  or rather , that nothing was to be gained by impatience , I sat down among them , accepted the orator 's pipe , and puffed away as well as the most experienced smoker of the party . I had no sooner been seated on a chair which was brought for me , as they would not suffer me to stretch myself on the ground , than the spokesman of the party , who had just lectured me , as L conjectured , upon the virtue of patience , looking over his shoulder and laughing , spoke a few words to one of the young men seated on the grass near him , who immediately rose and left the party . In about five minutes the messenger returned , bringing along with him another person , who held my watch in his hand ; and I now tecognised the face of the man I had first given it to . He explained , as I understood him , that as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one way , and then to the other ) he had quite lost sight of me , but that next day he meant to have brought the watch on board . This I inferred from his pointing to where the sun rose , and then towards the ships . At all events , I was happy enough to recover my lost property , and the first impulse naturally was to give him some reward . I had only a dollar , and two or three smaller coins with me , which I put into the young man 's hand ; but this was no sooner observed , than two or three of the others jumped on their feet , and taking the money from him , thrust it back again into my pockets . I made him sit down , however , and it will easily be understood that the recovery of the watch was more efficacious in restoring good-humor than the old fellow 's lecture had been ; and so my sententious friend // himself seemed to think , for he addressed me with the former affected seriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed to the watch . It is wonderful , indeed , how without language , people can generally make themselves mutually undetstood when there is good will on both sides , and how difficult , even with all the advantages of speech , the most simple explamition becomes , when temper or interest opposes an obstacle to the mutual apprehension of the subject . ' pp. 56-59 . As they placed no value in money , Captain flail tempted their curiosity with other articles , which he would gladly have left with them as a token of his gratitude , but they positively refused to take anything that was offered to them . When the man who restored the watch came on board the Lyra. the next day , he still persisted in his refusal of a reward , nor could he be prevailed upon by any inducements to alter his determination . The lower classes at Canton are remarkable for thieving . They have probably acquired the vice by their intercourse with foreigners . Neither the expedition of Lord Macartney , nor that of Lord Amherst , in passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort in the inhabitants . Captain Hall observes , that in every village , however small , which he visited in China , there was invariably a school , where both reading and writing were taught to boys . ' In the village , where the adventure of the watch occurred , the school was kept by a very formal , perpendicular , elderly gentleman . ' Speaking of another village , the author says , we were attracted by the well known hum to a school , which the master , who came out to the door , begged us to enter . Everything within was remarkably neat and clean , and the room well ventilated ; but the day was very hot , and one of the scholars , observing Mr Clifford fanning himself with his hat , left his seat , and presented bim with his ftw ; at the same time , turning round , be gave me his book , opened I suppose at the place of the *iesson . The whole school were then ordered to read at once , during which the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in error ; a mode of teaching , it may be observed , universai from ahi time over the east , but only recently introduced from that hemisphere into this country , and I believe with much effect . ' We hardly understand what our voyager means by the last clause in this sentence ; hut if he intends to say , that children can be taught to read by this Babel jargon of sounds , uttered simultaneously from every mouth in // the school , whether in the Chinese or the English idiom , we must beg leave to demur . We have strong doubts , also , of the teacher 's ability , under such circumstances , to distin .. guish every truant voice in the midst of such confusion . To us the predicament of the unlucky pedagogue would seem to be not less embarrassing , than would have been that of the Speaker of the House of Representatives , in deciding who was in order or out of order , who was talking sense or nonsense , had all the members chosen to make their speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon expect light to shine on the counsels of the nation 's guardians from this mode of debating , as improvement in a school founded on the Chinese model . Captain Hall remarks , that no schools for girls came under his observation in China . In a few days the ships took up their course across the Yello wSea to the coast of Corea . Long before they came to the main land they fell in with innumerable clusters of Islands , which were afterwards found to fringe this inner border of the Corean peninsula for a great distance . The voyagers landed at some of these islands , and were led into amusing adventures with the natives , which we shall pass over , and take our readers at once to the harbor on the main land where the vessels at length came to anchor . As soon as the ships were secured , Captain Maxwell , Mr Clifford , and I proceeded in one of the Alceste 's boats towards a considerable village , or rather town , in the northwestern angle of the bay . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in a commotion , much ress*mbling the sort of bustle into which a colony of ants are thrown by the thrust of a spade . This sensation extended to a fleet of boats riding at anchor off the town , the crews of which were busily employed weighing anchor , and getting their oars to pass . Before we could reach the landing-place , eight or ten of the largest vessels were seen steering towards us , escorted by more than a hundred canoes and small boats , bustling and paddling ah*ng in tumultuous procession . Every boat , even the smallest that had a mast at all , was decked out with long streamers , and crowded almost to sinking with people . On arriving within a couple of boats ' lengths of the headmost vessel , our ears were saluted with sounds not unlike those of the bagpipe , which issued from three pipes , or trumpets , played by men raised high in the bow of the boat . In the middle part of the deck , between the masts , we discovered a huge blue umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important looking // personage , seated cross-legged on a mat , surrounded by attendants in richly colored dresses . The chief himself , for such he was dubbed the moment we beheld him , is worthy of a par* ticular description . His principal garment consisted of a showy robe , or mantle , of blue satin , in whose ample folds he was well nigh lost ; in front hung down his venerable white beard , as far as a rich embroidered girdle , confining the robe . On his head was placed a hat of a size in proportion with that of the other parts of his dress ; the rim measured not less than three feet , over which rose a very small peaked crown . In his right hand he wielded , with an air of mighty importance , a slender black rod tipped with silver , from which hung at one end a small slip of black crape , and a. narrow leather thong was tied to the other end-symbolical , it was thought , of the summary course of justice in Corea . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger his pipe , trimmed , from time to time by an attendant , stationed for that purpose close to his elbow , who took the tobacco from a silver box carried by a little boy . ' pp. 86-88 . The whole procession , like a royal regatta , now proceeded slowly towards the Lyra , to the sound of the pipes , which began to play the instant the boats went on . Captain *VIaxwell and I rowecl to one side of the brig , while the chief 's boat was pl*aced on the other in a very seaman-like style . To get on board was not so easy a matter , and it was all our discipline could accomplish to keep the sailors from laughing at the manner in which the old chief got up the gangway , encumbered as he was with his immense robes* A* the evening was fine* we thought it best to entertain our guest oi the quarter*deck , instead of irrviting him to my little cabin , hardly large enough , as some one observtd , to hold the old gentleman 's hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to despise these European inventions , and would accept , of n* accommodation but his own mat . Even to this he at first objected , leaving us completely perplexed to discover his wishes . It has occurred to us since* that the publicity of the conference may have displeased him and we regretted not having carried him below , however inconvenient the accommodation . At length he sat down , and immediately the whole of his own crew , and the men from about twenty other boats , leaped on board in all directions , to assist at the ceremony . Some of them climbed into the rigging , others established themselves on the poop , and one unbroken line of copper*colored wondering faces was ranged along the hammocks from stem to stern4 When every one was seated , silence and something like order wa* established , and the chief , drawing his pipe from his mouth , and flourishing his wand , commenced an oration which lasted fully // five minutes . When he had concluded , Captain Maxwell , who had listened with admirable gravity and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not quite so long , but quite as much to the purpose . The chief opened his eyes , stared , listened , and looked round to his attendants , as if to inquire the meaning of all this ; but obtaining no satisfaction from the appeal , as they all shook their heads , he called to a person who seemed to be his secretary , and touching him with his rod , made him sit down before him . The secretary took his place with all due formality , and having rubbed his cake of Indian ink upon a neat blue stone , which he carried with him , drew forth his camel-hair brush , and arranging a long scroll of paper on his knees , began , at the chief 's dictation , to write a despatch , the by-standers assisting from time to time in the composition of this document , which they no doubt thought was to set all matters right . When completed , the chief looked it over , and then handed it to us . We looked at it too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance with the best grace we could . The chief was exceedingly provoked , and showed by his gestures and the angry tones of his voice how stupid he thought us. ' pp. 89 , 90 . To account for the surprise and disappointment of the chief on this occasion , we must consider , that in China , Corea , Japan , and the neighboring islands , the same written language is universally understood , even among persons from different parts , whose conversation is totally unintelligible to each other . The Chinese characters are used for this purpose , and they . communicate ideas in the same way as the Arabic numbers , which are understood by all the nations of Europe , notwithstanding the wide dissimilarity of their languages . As this was probably the first time , that the Corean chief had seen persons of so much apparent distinction , as were the officers of the vessels , who could not read the common written char .. acters , he'must be supposed to have ascribed so singular a circumstance to their obstinacy in pretending not to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could inspire him with very high respect for his visiters . Although puzzled with this result , he soon recovered his good humor , and seemed pleased with what he saw . When he took leave of the Lyra , his boats were seen rowing towards the Alceste , which he reached just as the officers had arrived from the other vessel to receive him . It appeared that he had forgotten the fate of his despatch on board the Lyra , or else he wished once more to fathom the depth of // our ignorance , probably not conceiving it possible that the owner of such a dwelling should be unable to read or write . Whatever his reasons might be , he ordered his secretary to prepare another writing without delay , and as soon as it was examined , handed it with great formality to Captain Maxwell . The original document is now in my possession , as well as the translation , made by the interpreter to the British factory at Canton , which runs thus ; " Persons , of what land are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come hither ? In the ship are there any literary men , who thoroughly understand , and can explain what is written ? " We readily conjectured that something to this purpose must be the import of the writing . Had we known it then , however , as correctly as we do now , the knowledge would have served us little purpose , for we had no means of reply , except indeed to the latter part of the question , which Captain Maxwell answered in a manner certainly the most effectual that could be devised . He did it , however , with so much ceremony , and at the same time such perfect gravity , that it was singularly ludicrous . Having called for his clerk , he proceeded to imitate the chief , and wrote a letter which he presented with a low bow . This despatch was not quite so long as the chief 's , and contained simply this ; " I do not understand one word that you say. ** The chief , not doubting in the least that he should irnderstand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspected the paper , and turned it first one way and then another , but all to no purpose . At last he looked towards Captain Maxwell with an inquiring air , and pointed impatiently to the paper . Captain Max .. well took up the chief 's letter and did exactly the same , implying an equal degree of ignorance ; but it was not till a considerable time had elapsed that the chief saw the similarity of their predicaments , and finally gave up all hopes of communicating by any means but signs . ' pp. 94 , 95 . While the vessels lay in the harbor , the old chief and many of his people came frequently on board , and were extremely curious in examining everything that could he seen , rummaging even the midshipmen 's lockers , the sailors ' chests , and invading the cook 's premises , taking due cognizance of the tea-kettles , coffee-pots , and other utensils . Some of the chief 's retinue were also busy in measuring the Lyra with lines and rulers , noting down particulars respecting the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deemed worthy of observation . They ate and drank on hoard with much hilarity , accommodating themselves with apparent ease to the English customs , and mutual confidence and cheerfulness // prevailed . Nothing seemed to discompose the old chief , but the proposition on the part of the officers to land , which was mAforrnly met with coldness . As all intercourse was carried on by signs , they thought it not expedient to understand everything that was meant to be conveyed on this subject , but resolved to man the boats and row ashore without ceremony . As we approached the beach , the old man 's distress augmented ; and when at length our keel touched the sand , and the bowman , by leaping out to fix the gang-board , actually landed on the foifbidden soil , Ihe held up his hands in despair , drooped his wo-begone countenance on one side , and drew his hand repeatedly across his throat , from ear to ear , unequivocally implying , that some one or other must lose his head on the occasion . This was perplexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed , and reached the shore , it was thought that without any great aggravation of the offence , we might enjoy the satisfaction of a walk in this unexplored country . Accordingly , we stepped out , followed in very miserable plight by our venerable friend . As it was low water , we had to scramble through sea-weed and wet sand for about fifty yards , before reaching a dry spot , where a halt was made in order , if possible , to console our worthy companion . We tried to signify that our wishes went no farther than to walk about for half an hour , to stretch our limbs stiffened by so long a voyage ; after which it was our intention to return on board to dinner , To the latter part of our discourse , which consisted in making the action of eating and pointing to the ships , his only reply was , to repeat the beheading motion with which he had before endeavored , in the boat , to work on our fears or our compassion . " How can I eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the late Dr M ' Leod , a man of infinite jest , as every one knows , who has perused his most amusing narrative . The humorous manner in which this was spoken , made all our party laugh ; but our mirth only augmented the chief 's distress , and we began seriously to fear that we had proceeded too far . The town , however , not being half a mile from the spot where we had landed , our purpose was merely to walk through it , to climb the wooded hill behind , and to return by the top of the ridge to our boats , which were ordered to wait at the beach . Before advancing many paces , however , we were surrounded by upwards of a hundred of the natives , and there was reason to think we might pay more dearly for our curiosity than at first had been reckoned upon . A word from the chief at this instant might have finished our expedition in a trice ; but on appealing to him against this interruption , he spoke some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with bows and // arrows . The military soon got the better of the populace , by pelting them heartily with stones ; thus inverting the usage of more polished communities , where these missiles are the estab lished weapons of the mob . The roadheing now clear , we turned to prosecute our walk , when lo ! the old chief was in tears , litterally sobbing like a child , with his head resting on the courtier 's shoulder . This was rather too much ; for however pitiable and ludicrous it may now seem , it had then a very different character , and all idea of going . farther was instantly given up . Every one regretted that , *natters had been pushed to this extremity , but Captain Maxwell probably more than any other person , as he had been in some degree urged into it , against his better feelings and sounder judgment .

Before dismissing this portion of the author 's adventurers , we will give his description of a Corean house , which he examined on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upright moveable bar , fitted into a cross-beam above , and a hole in the threshold stone below . Before it lay a neat smooth little court , surrounded by a close hedge , of a sweet scented red and white flower , resembling the honeysuckle in shape . On the ground were lying some bun'dle* of corn , and two wooden mortars , with double-handed pestles , for removing the husks . Cooking utensils were ranged along the wall on one side of the door ; to the left of the court were several corn stacks . The house was overshadowed by large trees , whose leaf resembled that of the Portugal laurel ; and the trunks of these trees and the ends of the house were covered with a thick matting of small-leaved ivy . Nothing within corresponded to the taste and neatness of the exterior . The room , for there was but one , was dark and dirty , the walls and roof being either covered with cobwebs or glazed by the action of wood smoke . The floor was diversified by hill and dale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen nearer home , with the appropriate appendage of a lake here and there . The fire-place stood between two large boilers , sunk deep in rude brick-work , the use of which vessels we could not surmise . On the hot embers of the fire lay a couple of fish , one of which , a fine fresh haddock , we took the liberty of helping ourselves to , in the inhospitable absence of the rightful owners . On the wall opposite to this miserable fire.place , were ranged on two shelves a goodly store of coarse crockery , and two or three round shining metal pots and pans . On one of the shelves also stood what seemed two wooden stools , handsomely carved , and varnished with the brilliant lacker used in . China . These implements , if we did not mistake their use , certainly am // peared much too fine for the rest of the establishment , and quite out of place standing on a shelf . The roof was of thatch , resting on a network of rods , and the eaves extended more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade to a narrow verandah in front of the house , and giving shelter to the window from rain  --  a precaution quite necessary to its existence , as it was composed of oiled paper , pasted over small square openings in a wooden frame . The walls themselves were built of stones and mud , most inartificially put together  --  a want of neatness and skill which did not apply to the more difficult branch of architecture , the frame. - work of the roof , this being constructed precisely on our principles , with a king-post and rafters , very neatly morticed in their proper places . ' pp. 115 , 116 . Several days were passed in sailing among the clusters of islands mentioned above , till at length the vessels departed from the coast of Corea , and proceded directly to the Great Loo Choo island . As they approached this island , the Lyra narrowly escaped shipwreck on a coral reef , but , without any other danger , good anchorage was obtained in the Bay of Napakiang , in the southern part of the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them in canoes before they reached Napakiang , was calculated to make a peculiarly favorable impression . One of them , the instant he came alongside , handed up ajar of water , and the other put on board a basket of boiled sweet potatoes , without asking or seeming to wish for any recompense . The manners of our new acquaintances were very gentle and respectful ; they made a rule of uncovering their heads when in our l ) resence , bowed low whenever they spoke , and , when we gave them something to eat and drink , made a low salam to every person standing near , before they tasted what was given them . ' Another party , when a rope was thrown to them from the ship , attached a fish to it and paddled away . ' These marks of extraordinary kindness at the first acquaintance promised well , and the future conduct of the people fully confirmed the favorable opinion thus formed of them by the navigators . The earliest account of the Loo Choo islands is derived from a Chinese work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1719 the Emperor Kang-hi sent an ambassador to Loo Choo named Su-poa-koang . On his return to Pekin , the yeat following , he published in two volumes a particular description of the islands , both in regard to their productions and the history and manners of the people . Such is the report of // the Jesuit Gaubil . Nothing more was known of Loo Choo , till it was visited by Captain Broughton about thirty years ago . He was a few days in the harbor of Napakiang , but was not permitted to laud . No other European had probably visited this people before the present expedition . The island is under the Chinese government . The ships were hardly anchored when they were surrounded by numerous canoes filled with people , many of whom came directly on board . Among these was a person of higher rank than the rest , who inquired into the motives , which induced the strangers to visit Napakiang , and gave notice that other chiefs of superior rank would shortly come off to the vessels . Luckily he could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interpreter , and thus rendered the communication with the people of Loo Choo much more easy and satisfactory , than it had been with the suspicious Co .. reans . Much curiosity was excited among the inhabitants by the appearance of these new visiters . Canoes were moving rapidly around the harbor , crowds assembled on the beach , and every place suited for observation was occupied by the gazing multitude . An amicable intercourse was immediately established between the chiefs and the commanders of the vessels . Large supplies of provisions were sent to each ship , which were continued from day to day , and for which neither persuasion nor importunity could induce the chiefs to receive anything in return . The dress of these interesting persons was singularly graceful and picturesque . It consisted of a loose flowing robe folded over the breast , so as to leave the neck bare ; but fastened round the middle by a broad rich belt or girdle of embroidered silk , nearly hid by the overlapping folds of the drapery . The sleeves were so wide that when the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the knees . Each of them wore on his head a yellow cylindrical cap , and on his feet a neatly plaited straw sandal , laced over a short cotton boot or stocking . Two of the chiefs were dressed in light-colored yellow robes , the others in dark blue , streaked with white , all made of cotton . Their caps or turbans were flat at the top , and appeared to be formed by winding a broad band diagonally round a frame in such a manner , that at each turn a small portion of the last fold should be visible above in front , and below at the hinder part . The sandals were bound to the feet by a stiff straw band passing over the instep , and connected with the fore part of the sole by a slender string drawn // between the great toe and the one next to it , the stocking being oddly enough contrived with a division like the finger of a glove , to receive the great toe . Each chief carried a fan either in his hand or thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch , enclosed in a small bag dan* , ling at his waist . It seemed to be the fashion of the country not to cut the beard , in the nice arrangement of which they appeared to take particular pride . That of the senior chief was nearly a foot long , while those of the two others , though much shorter , were evidently cherished with great care . ' pp. 137 , 138 . As in Corea , so at this place , the people of distinction that came on board were extremely curious in examining everything they could lay their eyes on . Although their curiosity was eager , yet their manners were gentle and unassuming , and they were never troublesome or obtrusive . After two or three days had passed in this interchange of kindnesses on board the vessels , Captain Maxwell intimated his intention to land , and pay his respects to the great chief of the island . This proposition at first excited a good deal of alarm , and was met by several evasions on the part of the islanders respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other particulars calculated to throw obstacles in the way . They said , for instance , that he lived a thousand miles off ; although the island was hardly half that extent in its whole length . Sometimes they denied , that there was any such chief , and then they affirmed that the Loo-Chooans were by no means a people of so much consequence as the %Z*aptain ' would make them , and that they were wholly unworthy of the honors he designed . By one artifice of this sort after another , . they actually prevented the intended visit to the king , although the vessels remained six weeks in the harbor , and the voyagers were well satisfied that his residence was in sight , shrouded in groves of trees , at a distance of three or four miles . Permission was granted to land on the beach for the purpose of taking astronomical observations , but the persons who went on shore were carefully watched , and none was permitted to walk into the country . By degrees , however , a little mor&amp; confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about under the shade of trees , and to recreate themselves within a limited space . When any one of the officers attempted to extend his walks , he was instantly met by a person in authority , who reminded him of his prescribed bounds , not refraining from gentle force , if admonition did not have its // proper effect . But as peace and good humor were objects of special consequence to the visiters , they took care to avoid direct occasions of offence , and always yielded to serious alarms and obvious manifestations of displeasure . Partly by stealth , however , and partly by a bold , strait forward manner , some of the officers contrived to stroll about the immediate environs of the landing-place , and to make some discoveries in the domestic economy and rural occupations of the people . Everything indicated contentment , plenty , and happiness , with much good taste in the arrangement of their grounds , and neatness and comfort in the structure , order , and furniture of their dwellings . No women were ever seen during the whole stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two occasions , and then by accident . It is supposed , that they wer&amp;* sent into the country as soon as the strangers arrived . We shall here present our readers with Captain Hall 's description of a Loo Choo entertainment , to which Captain Maxwell invited himself and his party rather unceremoniously , for however prompt and generous the Loo-Chooans were hi sending all kinds of provisions on board , the chiefs had never hinted that it would give them any pleasure to meet their new friends on shore . Captain Maxwell insisted , that he could not any longer deny himself the satisfaction of showing his sense oF their unbounded civilities by paying his respects to them in a proper way , and made it known to them that he should land for this purpose . Finding the Captain determined on this point , some preparation seems to have been made for the event , as will appear by the following extract . After a good deal of consideration , it was agreed that Captain Maxwell should take with him several dozens of wine , some books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of blue broad cloth . I took half the quantity of Captain Maxwell 's presents . Smaller donations were also made up for each of the chiefs . Thus prepared , we set out at one o'clock in the Aijibassador 's barge , with a large union-jack flying ; and the wind being fair , soon reached the harbor . As we rowed past the shore , the people were seen running along the different roads leading into the town , so that by the time we reached the entrance , the crowd on both sides was immense , and the sight as striking and animated as can well be conceived . On our entering the harbor , four or five of the chiefs came down to a point of land , and made signs , by waving their hands , that we must row past the end of a pier or mole , forming the // inner harbor . By the time we had performed this circuit , the chiefs were ready to receive us at the landing-place . They gave us their hands to help us from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gokoorna taking Captain Maxwell 's hand , the chief called Shayoon giving me his , and Jeema taking charge of Mr Clifford . The other natives , according to their rank , conducted Dr M ' Leod , surgeon of the Alceste , Mr John Maxwell , the commodore 's son , and another midshipman , Mr Browne , selected to accompany us on account of his proficiency as a draughtsman . They held our hands nearly as high as the shoulder , and we moved along pretty much in the fashion of a minuet , with a sort of measured step , which made it still more ludicrous . In this manner they carried us through a lane opened for us among silent , gazing crowds of people . The children were , as usual , placed in front , three or four deep , all shining in their best dresses , and looking as happy as possible . The next two or three ranks crouched down , so as just to look over the heads of the children , and in order to allow those behind to see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good sight of the strangers , than if they had been crowded indiscriminately together . We were thus paraded slowly along for about a hundred and fifty yards , till we reached the gate of a handsome wooden temple , where we were met by the principal chief , our guest of the preceding day , who stooa just outside of the threshold on a small square pavement of polished stones . Ookooma , who had brought Captain Maxwell thus far , now relinquished his office to the old chief , who gave his hand , and showed the way to a small flight of steps leading to the temple , two sides of which were completely thrown open , and the whole skirted by deep verandahs , precautions which rendered the interior shady and cool . The apartment was large , and neatly furnished with gaudy paintings hung round the walls , richly carved wooden cornices and pillars , and everything shining with the brilliant varnish in which the Chinese excel all other nations . In the centre stood a large table , finely japanned , and two ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seat for Captain Maxwell and me ; benches being placed at the sides of the table for the other gentlemen . The chief , as soon as the party were all seated , opened the conversation by expressing how much gratified he had been by the reception he had met with the day before , and how glad he was to see us at his table . He then asked our ages , begged to know which of us were married , which single , and expressed himself greatly pleased with the account of Captain Maxwell 's family , which happened to correspond exactly as to numbers and age with his own . But he could scarcely be made to believe that young Maxwell , a strapping youth of six feet , was not more than VOI* . XXVI. - NO. 59. 68 // sixteen years of age , insisting that he must be at least six-and-twenty . The same mistake was often made by the natives , who judged of the ages of our young men by their height alone . After some time spent in this easy kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed round in very diminutive cups , filled to the brim by one of the chiefs , out of a small metal pot , in which this beverage was kept constantly warm . The chief and his companions , after we had drank , followed our example , and took off their cups fairly ; and during the whole feast the sackee pot never left the table , being considered a proper accompaniment to all the strange messes which were brought in one at a time , and handed round by the attendants . When the first dish was placed on the table , a pair of chopsticks was given to each person present , and these were not changed during the feast . Chopsticks , it is possibly not generally known , are two polish .. ed pieces of ivory or of some hard wood , about a foot in length , and as thick as an ordinary quill . They are used instead of knives and forks in China , and all the countries in that quarter of the world . They are both held in the right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the meat is caught up , as it were , by a pair of pincers . The middle of that chopstick , which is fixed , rests on the tip of the third finger and its top in the hollow space between the thumb and the knuckle of the fore linger ; the moveable one is grasped by the fore and middle fingers and thumb . Until the manner of using these implements is learned , they are perfectly useless ; and the chief observing some of us make no advances in acquiring the requisite knowledge , ordered sharppointed sticks to be given to us , that we might fork up our meat . As this would not do for rice , however , we resumed the chopsticks , but could make little progress , till we observed how the natives ate it , and even then our imitation was not very successful . They held the bowl in which it was contained close to their mouths as if going to drink , and then by means of the implements described , tumbled or rather stuffed in the rice till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther progress by the agency of the chopsticks , in a very ludicrous manner . The next dish , consisting of slices of fish fried in butter , we found excellent ; after this , came smoked pork sliced , and then pig 's liver cut into small square pieces and boiled . Then tea was handed round , which was quite new , and not very good in its way , resembling , as our facetious doctor observed , more an infusion of hay than anything else . The short intervals between the numerous courses , were filled up with smoking , our pipes being filled and lighted by an attendant , whose sole business it was to run about with a small bag in his hand , and watch when any one required tobacco , which was not unfrequently , as the pipes were s* // diminutive that some of the gentlemen of our party found no difficulty in smoking nine of them during the feast . The next dish was the oddest thing we had yet seen in the way of eatables , its very appearance disgusting most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black sugar , wrapped up in unbaked dough , powdered over with rice flour , dyed of a yellow color . This dish was certainly very unpalatable , but most of the others were so good , that we made a hearty dinner long before the feast was over . The succession of dishes , however , continued without intermission , till our goodhumored host , seeing we no longer ate anything , ordered them all away , and then , suiting the action to the word , recommended the sackee by pledging us over and over again . * By carrying this good example a little too far , the old gentleman 's eyes at length began to glisten , the remaining crust of formality fell off , and observing that the room was hot , he requested us to take our hats off , as , till now , according to Loo Choo custom , we had kept them on . The chief , who by this time was quite in a merry mood , seized Dr M ' Leod 's cocked hat and fixed it on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to profit by a good hint , did the same with the chief 's hatchee-matchee , or band turban . The oddity of this transfer fairly overcame the gravity of all present ; and excited the rapturous mirth of the chief 's sons , two fine little boys , in gaudy dresses and high top-knots of hair , who stood one on each side of his chair during all the entertainment . ' pp. 170-175 . We should gladly enter more minutely into Captain Hall 's account of this peculiar and interesting people , but we could do little justice to the subject within the limits to which we are necessarily confined . The picture he draws contains a great variety of objects , well selected , and skilfully delineated . Could the Loo-Chooans read his book , tbey would be ungrateful if they did not accord to him unmingled praise for his favorable opinion of their character and manners ; and they would at least allow him the merit of a goodnatured observer , whatever they might think of the freedom with which he speaks of their jealousy and caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loo Choo . It may be premised that Maddra was a person , who had been much on board , was a favorite with every body , and had made considerable progress in the English language during the short space of six weeks . At day-break on Sunday , the twenty-seventh of October , // diately , and meant to give them the slip without bidding adieu . This was very far from our intention ; but the alarm spread frnme* diately , and brought the chiefs off in a great hurry ; not in ; a body , in their ordinary formal way , but One by one , as they could find separate canoes to paddle them from the shore . Old Jeema , called on board the Lyra on his way to the frigate ; be was a good deal agitated , and the tears came into his eyes when I drew a ring from my finger and placed it on his , in exchange for a knife , which he took from his girdle to present to me . The other chiefs called alongside on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them I was just going to the Alceste myself . In the meantime poor Maddra came on board with the sextant in his hand ; he was in such distress that he scarcely knew what he was about . In this distracted state he sat down to breakfast with us , during which he continued lighting hi* pipe and smoking as fast as he could ; instinctively drinking and eating whatever was placed before him . In a little while he recovered his composure in some degree , and asked what books it would be necessary for him to read , in order to understand the use of the sextant ; I gave him a nautical almanac , and told him he must understand that in the first instance ; he opened it , and attentive- - ly looking at the rows of figures for a few minutes , held up his hands in absolute despair , being at last forced to confess it a hopeless business ; he then put the sextant into its case , and bade us farewell . Before leaving the Lyra , he gave Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to it , saying , as he held them out , " You go Ingeree , you give this to your childs . " Mr Clifford gave him a few presents in return , and expressed his anxiety to be always remembered as his friend . Maddra , with great earnestness , and with the tears streaming down his cheeks , placed his hand several times upon his heart , and cried , " Eedoosl*ee , eedooshee ! " . - My friend , my friend ! To me he gave a fan , and a large picture of a man looking up at the sun , drawn , he said , by himself , probably in allusion to my usual occupation at the observatory . After he put off in his boat , he stood up and called out several times , " Ingery not choo sibitty yootusha , " -I shall always remember the English people . When he went to the Alceste , one of the chiefs remarked to him , that he had come on board without his hatchee-matchee , or his state robes , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last time , in his ordinary dress ; particularly as all the others were in full array . Maddra , who , poor fellow , had been too much concerned about other matters to think of dress , was distressed at this apparent neglect of propriety , and immediately apologized to Captain Maxwell , who took him kindly by the hand , and , giving him a present , told him , he was always much too happy to see him to nQtice what dress he had on . // On going to the Alceste , I found the chiefs seated in the cabin , all looking very disconsolate . We tried in vain to engage them in conversation ; but their wonted cheerfulness had quite deserted them ; and , indeed , it was natural that they should be so affected , for , unlike their visiters , these simple people could have had little experience of parting scenes . I took this opportunity of giving each of the chiefs some trinket , as a farewell present , and they in return gave me their pipes , fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly expressions . Mutual assurances then passed between us , of being long remembered , and the natives rose to take their last leave of us . Gokooma , who , as well as the others , was much agitated , endeavored to say something , but his heart was full , and he could not utter a word . The rest did not attempt to speak ; and before they reached their boats , they were all in tears . Maddra , who was the last to quit the ship , cried bitterly as he wrung the hands of his numerous friends , who crowded round him , and loaded him with presents . While we were heaving up the anchor , the natives assembled not only in canoes round the ships , but in vast crowds along the neighboring heights ; and as we sailed away , they all stood up , and continued waving their fans and handkerchiefs till they could no longer be distinguished . ' pp. 275-277 . Among the most extraordinary particulars related by Captain Hall of the Loo-Chooans , is the fact that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , nor any knowledge of either obtained from the inhabitants . Although the travellers saw no evidences of these potent engines so universally used in carrying on the operations of civilized society , it hardly follows that nothing of the kind actually exists . Grosier , probably on the authority of Swpoa-k.oang 's work above mentioned , speaks of their tribunals of war , their manufactories of arms , and their soldiers , which would imply at least that they have at some time known other arts than those of peace . As to money , it is very possible that they have no use for it . Even in China it is compariAively little used . Taxes is that country are for the most part paid in articles of produ*e , and the salaries of the Emperor 's officers are likewise paid in the same , such as grain , silk , and cloth . The first currency in China was in shells , but it is now extended to silver and copper . The silver pieces are exchanged by weight , the copper coin being the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep constantly with them small scales for the purpose of weighing silver , and scissors to clip // pieces of a suitable size . Dollars may perhaps pass as currency in the neighborhood of Cantou , where they are brought in such numbers , that the people have learnt their uniform weight , but we have seen that they would not take them in remote provinces . Captain Hall mentioned to Bonaparte , whom he afterwards visited at St Helena , the circumstance of there being no arms among the Loo-Chooans . No arms ! ' he exclaimed , that is to say , no cannons . They have muskets ? ' Not even muskets , ' I replied . Well , then , lances , or at least bows and arrows ? ' I told him they had neither one nor the other . Nor poignards ? ' cried he , with increasing vehemence . No , none . ' But , ' said Bonaparte , clenching his list , and raising his voice to a loud pitch , but , without arms how do they fight ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had no wars . JV'o wars ! ' reiterated the ex-emperor , with an expression of countenance , which showed how little credit he was disposed to give to such a report . He seemed equally incredulous , when he was told the Loo-Chooans had no money . The Iwo last chapters in Captain Hall 's volume , the one on his interview with Bonaparte. at St Helena , and the other describing Captain Maxwell 's attack on the batteries at Canton , contain entertaining matter , and are written with spirit and vivacity . Indeed we think the author 's style uniformly happy , and peculiarly well suited to this species of composition . He is a discriminating observer , his topics are selected with good judgment and good taste , his language is terse , appropriate , and varied ; sometimes perhaps a little too much studied , but never stiff nor ponderous . In short , we could hardly name a better model of journal-writing , than the little volume , whose contents we have just been reviewing ; and whoever would read for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly compensated for the time they may give to its perusal .
