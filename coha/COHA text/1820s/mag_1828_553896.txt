txt ART . VIII . Lettres sur 1'slngleterre ; par le BARON DE STAEL* . HOLsTEIN . Svo. pp. 428 . Paris . 1825 . THE author of this work is the son of the celebrated female writer , with whose name we have so often had occasion to adorn our pages , and whose premature loss we so lately regretted . With her illustrious title , he seems also to have inherited some of her most valuable qualities , and exhibits already // the elevation of thought and feeling , the attachment to literary pursuits , and the generous passion for liberty , that so honora-. bly distinguished the daughter of Necker . Avoiding the frivolous and merely sensual pursuits , that exclusively occupy the attention of the greater part of the young European nobility , he devotes his life and ample fortune to the cultivation of science and letters , and the encouragement of every project that tends to diffuse knowledge , promote civilization , and improve the condition of society . We may venture to add ( it ' it be not indelicate to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily introduced herself to the public ) , that his sister , the Duchess of Broglie , is not less distinguished by all the accomplishments and virtues that grace the walks of private life in its highest and most polished circles . It is known that Madame de Sta*l bestowed much attention upon the education of her children , and was fortunate enough to obtain the aid of one of the most eminent German scholars , Baron A. IV . de Schlegel , in the direction of their studies . The success , which has attended hef efforts , does great honor to her judg-. ment and maternal affection , and in general to the intellectual and moral character of all the parties . While we regard with strong disapprobation the European system of hereditary magistracies , we can not but view the lineal transmission of the real nobility of nature , namely , pre*iminence in worth and talent , as one of the most agreeable spectacles which the moral world affords . It seems to relieve , in some degree , the distress with which every benevolent mind must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depravity are almost unavoidably produced by the influence , that vicious parents necessarily exercise over the character of their offspring . Baron de Staiil was advantageously known to the literary world , before the publication of the present work , by several political pamphlets , and by an edition of the works of Necker , with a life by himself . The Letters on England ' are , we believe , the first independent essay of much extent that has proceeded from his pen ; Without pretending to the character of an elaborate and standard production , it has nevertheless merits of a high order , and affords a fair promise of what may be expected from the maturer labors of the author , should he continue-as we trust he will , and as his illustrious mother and grandfather did before him  --  to cultivate the field of letters with increasing // zeal and assiduity , as he advances in years . The present work is in substance a series of political and philosophical essays on the theory and practice of the British government ; and belongs of course to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent corresponding to their importance , rise above the level of ordinary travels . The author displays throughout a thorough and intimate acquaintance with hi* subject , as well as a wide investigation of others that are naturally connected with it , together with the rare endowments of a power of original thought , and a truly liberal and philosophic temper . The style is pure , unaffected , and simply elegant . it has little or none of the warm poetical coloring that illuminated , sometimes to excess , the pages of the author of Corinna . The genius of the son may perhaps , in this respect , be different from that of the mother ; or he may possi-. bly have considered an attempt at rhetorical beauty of language , as inconsistent with the sober discussion of the gravest subjects , which forms the staple of the work , and may reserve his flights of fancy and his words that burn , ' for future and more suitable occasions . It would be superfluous to enlarge at this time of day , upon the intense interest that attaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British constitution , the great model of all the forms of free government , including our own , that have been established within the last half century in Europe and America . It is also not a little extraordinary , considering the extreme importance of the subject , as a theme of philosophical examination , that it should be still not only not exhausted , but we may almost say , unattempted . The essay of Delolme is the only one that has acquired any considerable notoriety ; and this , although it has been found useful on the continent , as a sort of directory to mere external points , is entirely superficial , and is in fact a work of jurisprudence , rather than of politics . During the last fifty years , the attention of the British public has been constantly occupied by the controversies between different parties repecting the spirit and principles of the Constitution ; but notwithstanding the large supply of cultivated talent that seems in that country prepared to meet , and even anticipate every demand that can be made upon it , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent these debates , by establishing beyond dispute the elementary truths of political science , as exemplified and // practised in England . This is one of the striking proofs of the neglect into which the great subject of moral philosophy , in all its departments , has now fallen , in the country of Bacon and Locke ; and of the extent to which the whole mass of British intellect is occupied , in ministering to the pursuits and pleasures of merely practical life . Baron de Sta*il has not attempted to supply the deficiency alluded to , but has selected a few of the most interesting questions connected with the subject , which he successively discusses , each in several letters . These are the state of property , and its influence on the welfare of the nation ; the state of the press ; and finally the effect of the public assemblies of various kinds that are constantly meeting for political objects , including the two houses of Parliament among the number . In connexion with this last point , the author exa mines the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Radicals respecting it . We shall briefly review his remarks upon each of these topics , interspersing occasionally such observations of our own , as may be suggested by them . In one or two letters , which serve as a sort of introduction to the rest , Baron de Stai34 touches on the difficulties that attend an inquiry into the principles of the British government , and notices particularly the singular fact alluded to above , of the exclusively practical character that distinguishes all the de* bates and other political discussions of every description , written or verbal . We are tempted to quote a part of his remarks on this head , as they tend to confirm our own opinion , and illustrate what we think a curious feature in the present moral aspect of the mother country . Our author contrasts , in this respect , the habits of the British statesmen with those of the French , who are perhaps too much accustomed to indulge in general inquiries , especially in connexion with the practical despatch of business . Our philosophical writers and speakers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lay down general principles with much more precision than those of England . I was one day reading some of our late pamphlets , most remarkable for vigor and expansion of thought , with Sir James Mackintosh , whose philosophical reputation is too well established to require any aid from my pen , and I took the occasion to inquire what impression they made upon him . " They are admirably done , " replied he , but in our country we take all this for granted . " In fact , what // is still problematical with us , is reduced to axioms with the English ; and they employ in acting , the time which we spend in de-. monstrating or teaching . This is an immense advantage which they have over us , for axioms or settled principles may be turned to account by any one ; while very few persons are able to understand a demonstration , and profit by the truth which results from it . If a shipmaster were obliged , before e could take an altitude , to settle the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out to the satisfaction of his men , instead of using rules that are previously prepared , he would very probably run his vessel ashore . Now political forms , and the habits created by them , are the rules of the science of government . They should doubtless he constructed on sound theoretical principles ; but when this has once been done , it is a loss of time to be always engaged in tracing them to their sources . Nevertheless , the respect for existing forms may be carried too far , and without meaning to deny the superiority of the English over us in this respect , it is certain that they fall , to a greater or less extent , into this error . I was a witness myself of something of the kind that occurred in a debate in the House of Commons , in the year 1822 , upon a motion made by Mr Canning to allow the Catholic Peers to take their seats in the House of Lords , from which , as is well known , they have been excluded ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Commons , but failed in the House of Peers , after a very remarkable discussion . I had the good fortune to be present on this occasion , and have rarely enjoyed a higher intellectual entertainment . All the principal Peers of both parties , including the Lord Chancellor , Lord Liverpool , Lords Grey , Holland , Grenville , and others , took a part in the de .. bate . The avowed object of the motion was to prepare the way for the emancipation of the Catholics ; and this was the ground on which it was sustained by its friends and attacked by its enemies . It was therefore , as I thought , natural to expect that the debate would have turned , in a great measure , on general principles . Instead of this , they were not mentioned ; nobody once thought of such a thing . The immediate practical effects of the measure proposed , occupied exclusively the attention of the orators and of the public . It may be said , no doubt , that the general principles belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and also that it was the policy of the friends of the motion to limit the range of the debate as much as possible ; but after making all proper allowance for these circumstances , I can not but think that my remark is in the main correct . Lord Holland exhibited on this occasion the union of close rea // soning and warm feeling , that belongs , as it were , by consanguinity , to the nephew of Fox . But in this speech , which , as I am told , approached very near to the most successful efforts of his illustrious uncle , his only object was to establish , by reference to the history of the period , the absurdity of the evidence on which a decision had b en taken against the Catholic Peers . Though familiar with the iighest questions in political and moral philosophy , he never once thought of touching upon them in debate . The Lord Chancellor 's speech was not less remarkable in this respect . The proposition on which he founded his conclusions , was simply this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Great Britain , the Catholic will of course become so . It was easy to see , by the energy and warmth of his manner , that he was perfectly sincere in the opinion . This profound lawyer , who had grown gray in the practical business of legislation and administration , had never once conceived the notion , that it was possible for a government to exist without an established religion . Suppose now the same question tobe debated in one of the French Chambers ; and there can not be a doubt that the leading topics would be , liberty of conscience , the nature of the relation between Church and State , and the general principles that recommend religious toleration . It is equally certain , that under circumstances at all favorable , the public feeling would be strongly . engaged ; and thus far the advantage is perhaps on our side But these discussions , however able , would have produced only a transient effect . The question might have been carried ; but whenever the tide of public opinion or of ministerial influence should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost again with equal promptitude . In England old opinions are more firmly established , and attempts at innovation are met by a stronger resistance ; but when a victory is once gained , it is gained forever . ' Our readers , we think , will be struck with the general correctness , in point of fact , of these remarks , upon the style of parliamentary discussion in England . The debate that took place last spring in the House of Commons , upon the same question of Catholic emancipation , afforded another singular exemplification of their substantial truth . There was certainly no want of ability in the principal speakers on both sides . Mr Canning , Sir John Copley ( the present Lord Chancellor ) , and Mr Peel are orators and statesmen , of whom any country might well be proud ; and their speeches on this occasion were not inferior to their just renown ; but were still conceived // in all respects on the common model of British elo .. quence . No attempt was made by any one to settle the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government , or to arrive at a decision of the question by the aid of any great elementary truth , of which the admission should supersede all controversies about minor points . The debate turned wholly upon the direct and practical effects likely to result from the adoption or rejection of the measure proposed . The tone of discussion corresponded with the substance ; and instead of putting on the serious air which would probably accompany a more regular examination of the theory of these great points , the orators indulged with perfect freedom in bursts of petulence , and in sallies of pleasantry , approaching to buffoonery . Mr Canning and Sir John Copley nearly came to a personal altercation ; and the former entertained his audience with much excellent wit about the Pope 's bulls , which were supposed to be roaming at large about the country , to the great danger of His Majesty 's loyal subjects , but which he was not afraid to take by the horns . Rapturous cheers , accompanied by hearty and unanimous laughter , attested the success of this appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger who had entered the hall at the moment , would hardly have suspected , from the aspect of the audience , the nature of the question in debate . The Catos of the House might perhaps have repeated with more than equal propriety , the sarcastic remark of their Roman prototype upon Cicero- Qudm ridiculum kabemus Consulem ! But these are accidental matters of little moment , and we cordialJy agree with our author in approving the practical character of the debates in the British parliament , and preferring it to the more scientific and theoretical one which marks those of the French chambers . It is in fact irnpossihle to discuss general principles with impartiality and coolness , in connexion with practical questions , involving immediate interests of great importance ; and the effect of attempting it is merely to vitiate the public opinion respecting the principles , without altering in any way the decision of the point in dispute . It is possible , for instance , that the present mode of electing the president of the United States , may be susceptible of improve* ment ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its merits , the question should be considered without reference to the circumstances of any particular contest , or to the preferenc* VOL. xxVI. - NO. 58. 22 // that individuals may feel for any particular candidate for the office . Whenever it may be taken up , as it has been twice in the short period of our political history , under the excitement of a recent election , it will of course be decided , as it was in both those cases , by the momentary party feelings and interests of the members of Congress ; and it will be fortunate for the country , if the decisions made under such circumstances shall always be , as on the second occasion , against innovation . But while we agree with our author in his preference for a practical and matter-of-fact style of parliamentary debate , we also think with him , that the leading British orators , and we may add , those of our our country , might recur with advantage , more frequently than they do , to general principles , not a& questions to be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire a familiarity with the theory of political science , is ( or should be ) a part of the discipline of practical statesmen ; and if all or most of those who assume this character , were as fully prepared for the discharge of its duties as might be wished , the most important principles would be agreed upon among them by common consent . Unfortunately , the aids necessary for the acquisition of such an education are almost wholly wanting both in England and the United States . The science of government , and even history , which forms its natural complement , are nearly overlooked in the usual routine of collegiate and professional studies ; and most of our statesmen e*iter the halls of Congress and of the state legislatures , unprovided with any other notions on the great subjects of politics , ethics , political economy , and history , ancient and modern , excepting such as they have picked up by chance in their leisure reading . How then can they recur with precision and certainty , upon each particular question , to the appropriate general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in most cases supersede it ? Lord Holland may be , as Baron de Stad assures us that he is , familiar with moral and political philosophy , and may avoid recurring to principles from habit or compliance with the prevalent taste ; but with most practical statesmen , the reason lies in their want of acquaintance with the principles . This defect can only be remedied by a change in our system of public education ; and we are happy to perceive a pret*-ty strong tendency towards an improvement of this kind , already exhibiting itself in several parts of our country . The // professorships of political economy lately established in some of our colleges will effect much real good ; and we can not but hope that our venerable Alma Mater at Cambridge will not , in this respect , fall behind her younger sisters . The magnifi. cent donation of Mr Gore will afford the means of establishing one or two foundations ; and we should be highly gratified to see a part of it appropriated in this way . it is really singular that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches of physical science , and for dead languages , of less direct utility , we have had only half a one for the vast field of politics , and ethics , and political economy , and none at afl for history . Of these subjects , the last is left entirely to the tutors , and less insisted on than any other branch of study . We make not These remarks in the spirit of cavil , but in that of friendly suggestion ; and we trust that they will be received as proceeding from warm friends and sincere well-wishers of the College . But we have much matter and little space before us , and must hurry away from these interesting topics . The state of property in England , and its influence on the political and economical condition of the people , are treated by our author at considerable length . We hardly know how to dispose of this vast subject in two or three paragraphs ; but must nevertheless be indulged in a few hasty notes . This is almost the only point upon which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail in England . He is a declared partisan of the system of an equal division of estates among all the children upon the death of the proprietor ; while the law of primogeniture , by which all real estates pass to the eldest son , is established in England , as our readers are aware , to a greater extent than in any other part of the world . This principle is in fact in the mother country , the common law that regulates the descent of landed property ; while in most other countries , as for instance in Spain , it forms an exception , though one of extensive application , to the general rule . In Spain , landed estates are equally distributed among the children of the proprietor , excepting when they are tied up by an entail , or , as it is called there , a mayorazg6 ; but as this is uniformly the case with the immense possessions of the grandees , and as those of the clergy are unalienable , it follows that nearly the whole of the land is kept out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is generally acknowledged that the Spanish grandees are intellectually and morally the most degraded and imbecile body of nobility in Europe ; while the British aristocracy , whatever may be their defects , are commonly reckoned , as a class , superior to any other . Our author touches this point , and endeavors to account for the difference . In England , ' he observes , nobility , far from being exclusively hereditary , is accessible to every one who is worthy of it , and is open to all on the principle of fair competition . The public opinion of a free people is also more effective in stimulating the faculties than the soporific* influence of hereditary wealth and fortune in destroying them . ' The first of these reasons is , we think , or little weight . Nobility is not less accessible in other countries than it is in England . The king of Spain creates as many grandees and Titulos de Castilla as the king of Great Britain does marquesses and earls ; and the only difference is , that in the former case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter they are more frequently the reward of ace. tual merit . The cause of this diversity is the power exercised in En*. gland by public opinion over the movements of the king and his ministers ; so that this same wholesome control , which the Baron assigns as the second reason for the superiority of the British aristocracy , is in fact the only one . After all , we are inclined to think him ( partially at least ) mistaken in the fact ; and if it he generally allowed that the British aristocracy , as a class , is superior to any other , it is , we apprehend , because it always regularly contains a large proportion of members who do not properly belong to it as such , but have been placed in it by the government ( acting in obedience to public opinion ) , in acknowledgment of the eminent qualities which they had dis .. played in another . If at any given moment we survey the list of the British House of Lords for the time being , we shall find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way distinguish .. ed for worth or talent , have either been created peers themselves , or were born and educated before their fathers had risen to rank and opulence . Within our time , for example , the late and the present Lord Chancellor , the two Liverpools , father and son , Lords Grey , Grenville , Redesdale , Lauderdale , Erskine , Thurlow , &amp;c. were all titled commoners . The illustrious Wellesley family , though technically noble , was a poor tw 'd decayed branch of the Irish aristocracy . Lord Byron // came to his title and fortune by accident . In all these cases , the aristocratic principle had no room to operate ; and we rather suppose , that on a fair examination , it would be found that the bon6 fide British nobility is not much better than that of the Continent . Do we see the descendants of Warwickand Marlborough leading on the British armies to victory ? or those of Oxford and Bolingbroke preeminent in council or in parliament ? Are the Shaftesburys , Verulams , and Boyles of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and benefactors of the age ? Is it possible to point out a single person of this or any former period , who has felt the full influence of hereditary rank and fortune , and who is in any way distinguished for high intellectual and moral excellence ? Should it even be practicable on an accurate research to indicate a few exceptions , the general rule will hardly , we think , be denied . The effect of the aristocratic principle , of which the law of primogeniture is the essential feature , upon the persons immediately subject to its influence , is , therefore , the same in England as it is elsewhere ; that is , ruinous to every valuable quality of mind and heart ; and the exception , which M. de Sta*l is disposed to make in favor of the British nobility , is , we fear , grounded either in personal partialities , or in a failure to discriminate between peers of new and old creation . The economical effect of the law of primogeniture is another question on which the public opinion of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment ; and holds that an equal division of estates among the children of the owner , has the happiest influence on the wealth of individuals and of the nation . He states some facts in regard to the extent to which the subdivision of the land has been carried in the neighborhood of his own castle of Copet in Switzerland , that we think curious . The estate of Copet is situated in a part of French Switzerland , which was prepared for liberty by the protestant religion , by the general diffusion of knowledge , and by the paternal , if not enlightened , government of Berne ; and which now enjoys in quiet happiness the blessings of independence . The land around my estate is generally subdivided to such an extent , that most of the farms contain less than an acre . I can venture , notwithstanding , to affirm that no part of Europe exhibits an appearance of equal prosperity . Not only is there no excess of population , but the rate of wages is actually higher than in any other country on the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise their charity ; and the few distressed persons who gratefully receive such assistance as is offered them with kindness , would disdainfully refuse it if proposed with the least affectation of superiority . The poor exhibit no jealousy of the better fortunes of the rich , nor is there either base servility on the one side , or lofty arrogance on the other . No false pride deters any one from embracing any useful profession . All are independent and happy . ' This is indeed a charming picture , and it is the more remarkable , since the subdivision of the land has been pushed in this instance , to an extent which we should have thought un* natural and inconvenient . We see not , in fact bow a family can subsist upon the product of less than an acre . The value of a peck of wheat a day is considered as the ordinary wages necessary for the support of a laborer in England ; and if we make the large estimate of forty bushels of wheat to an acre , and allow nothing for seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be only one hundred and sixty , which is less than half the quantity required . If the Baron 's representation be strictly correct , it will necessarily follow that all these families have some other resource besides the cultivation of their little peculium ; and in that case it is evident , that the division of estates has been carried to an inconvenient extent , since it counteracts the great and beneficial principle of the division of labor . Of ten or twelve neighboring families , it is better for the comfort and happiness of all , that a part should raise agricultural products for the common support , and the rest produce something else to be given in exchange for them , than that each should raise half its own grain , and also produce something else wherewith to purchase the other half , and such other articles as are wanted at the nearest market . We call this extreme subdivision of the land unnatural , as well as inconvenient ; for when the estate of a deceased proprietor is so small , that , if divided among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large to support a family comfortably , it seems to us more natural that an arrangement should be made , by the effect of which one of the heirs should receive the land , and should pay to the rest an equivalent for their shares in money . Such , we believe , is the common mode of proceeding in this country , nor are we aware , notwithstaiiding the length of time that the law of equal partition has been in force among us , // that it has ever produced any inconvenience of the kind here specified . We agree entirely with our author in regard to the economical operation of the two systems , and consider that of equal partition , as every way much more favorable to the wealth and happiness of society . The tendency of it is to bring more land into cultivation , and thus to increase the number of inhabitants on a given territory ; while at the same time it improves their condition , economical and moral . The hereditary proprietor of a very large landed estate , like those that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of course by the effect of his social position , education , and habits , a man of pleasure , rather than business . His affairs are badly managed by stewards and attorneys , and his immense resources are turned to no account . Such is the case with nearly all the Spanish grandees , most of whom , with whole provinces in their possession , are in want of money to pay their tradesmen and servants . When estates are managed in this way , large portions of them remain uncultivated ; other tracts of great extent are converted into forests , parks , and pleasure grounds , and it is only upon the remainder that the industry of the people is really employed . Thus the number of agricultural laborers who would otherwise be kept at work , is greatly reduced , and population proportionally diminished . The few that find employinent , having no property in the land , and lying wholly at the mercy of the owner , are generally found in a wretched condition ; and in all the less improved parts of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe , to be the natural effect of this system , because we find it taking place almost universally wherever the system prevails . Strong moral and political causes may no doubt counteract its injurious influence , as they do in England ; where the extraordinary activity with which the principle of liberty has inspired every branch of industry , has so far remedied the evils that result from the law of primogeniture , that the land , though held in very large estates , is better cultivated than in any other part of Europe ; and where the actual cultivators , although they have only a temporary interest in the soil , are nevertheless nearly or quite as independent , enlightened , and moral , as the small freeholders of our own country . Every view that can be taken of the condition of man in all its varieties , brings us back to the conclusion that liberty , secured // and regulated by wise laws , is the exclusive principle of individual and national prosperity ; and that where it has opportunity to work out its full effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of evil . The late Lord Londonderry , was accustomed to assure his continental brother ministers , in the effusions of diplomatic confidence , that he did not consider the liberal features of the British constitution , as the best parts of it . With all proper deference to his lordship 's judgment , we must express the belief , that he was entirely mistaken on this point ; that these principles are not only the best parts of that constitution , and the direct sources of all the good that is enjoyed under its protection , but that they are also the powerful antidotes which serve , in part , to correct the poison of certain other principles , more agreeable , perhaps , to Lord Lon-. donderry 's taste , but which , if left unchecked to their natural operation , would very soon depopulate , impoverish , and completely ruin the country . Without the general influence of freedom , Kent would very shortly be as Castile , and Liverpool as Cadiz , in spite of all the leather and prunella , ' that grace the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day This . consideration brings us very naturally to the state of the press , which is the next great topic taken up by our author . On this swbject , as on all the others treated in the work , the opinions of M. de Sta*l , are decidedly liberal . He takes for granted the expediency of a free press , and indeed its absolute necessity to the existence of free government . His remarks on the character and circulation of the British periodical works , and of their value , as compared with those of France , will be found interesting by our readers . The periodical press is , in all countries , one of the most important results of modern civilization ; but it nowhere forms s* essential an ingredient in the organization of society , as in England and the United States . In other countries , the newpapers are a powerful engine , wielded alternately by the government , and the various political parties ; but in the two just mentioned they are the indispensable agent for every species of social communication . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not regarded as a necessary of life ; and I am assured , that in America , domestics often make it a condition in their engagement , that they shall be allowed to read such as are taken in by the family . Qucere de hoc . But even in England , // the circle of readers is comparatively much larger than with us . It is computed that there are about a thousand circulating libraries in the kingdom , and more than three hundred book-clubs , a well imagined institution , that might be introduced with profit among us . The number of newspapers has quadrupled within forty years . In 178*2 , it was estimated at seventy-nine , and in 1S*1 , in a report made to the House of Commons , at two hundred and eighty-four . With the exception of The Observer , a weekly paper , none of these journals ( which are all much dearer than those of France ) have as many subscribers as the Constitutionel , or the Journal des Debats . Even The Times , which has now a larger circulation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or ten thousand copies , but each passes through many more hands than with us . The writers in these journals , are obliged in consequence , to accommodate their language , in some degree , to the popular taste ; and often employ a familiar and even coarse phraseology , in order to please the lower classes . " When I took charge of The North Briton , " said the noted John Wilkes , " I found it in the hands of Churchill and Lloyd , who were men of taste and wit . I soon saw that this would not answer ; and giving up all pretensions to elegance of atyle , I began to cry out with all my might , Down with the Scotchman ! Down with the Scotchman ! In this way , I pretty soon despatched Lord Bute . " In fact , the great power of a newspaper consists in the repetition of simple and familiar arguments . In England this power is immense , and is constantly increasing . It is the more formidable , in as much as the editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , no proportion between their standing in society , and the power they exercise . In the United States , their influence is still greater ; and such is the terror they inspire , that many persons are deterred by it , from engaging in political life . Though warmly attached to liberty , they apprehend either on their own account , or that of their friends , the torrent of invective , that is poured upon all public characters by the journals of the opposite party . The French are perhaps better fitted by their peculiar intellectual character , than almost any other nation , for the publication of newspapers , a branch of literature , that requires the power of quick observation , lively repartee , and rapid , perspicuous narrative . It is also certain , although our legislation on ths subject is extremely vicious , and although we have enjoyed the liberty of the press only for a few short periods , that much talent has been exhibited among us , in this form . I seldom open one of our journals , without being struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasoning ; and I have met with many Englishmen , who have also admitted their great merit , VOL . XxvI. -.  - -  NO. *S. 23 // with apparent surprise that a Frenchman should be able to do so well . But our editors have nevertheless adopted an unfortunate plan in conducting their papers , and have introduced the division of labor where it is not only useless , but injurious . With us the political and literary news is separated from the advertisements and law reports . Now very few persons can afford to subscribe for several different journals , although they may be all more or less interesting to the public ; and it thus happens that each class of readers remains in ignorance of all such matters as do not come within the range of his own immediate pursuits . The provincial manufacturer is not informed of the progress of the arts at Paris and elsewhere ; while the Parisian capitalist is unacquainted with the economical situation of the provinces . The decisions of our six and twenty Royal Tribunals are unknown to all but the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might very probably produce much practical benefit . A British newspaper , on the other hand , is a sort of microcosm , and displays , in miniature , a view of the whole circle of interesting contemporary events . You find there every day the debates in Parliament , reports of the proceedings in all the courts , not only such as are likely to excite particular curiosity , but in all cases , civil and criminal . Speeches delivered at political meetings and assemblies for various purposes , religious , philanthropic , and commercial , at the sessions of the East India Company , and of the Common Council of London , and other important corporations ; - all are published in the newspapers . Through this channel , the government makes known the conditions of its contracts , the candidate for Parliament solicits the votes of the electors , and thanks his friends for their exertions ; rivals , of all sorts , publish their respective pretensions . the *births , marriages , and deaths of persons of any note , their arrivals and departures , the entertainments they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives are all known and printed . The whole kingdom seems to resemble the glass house of the Roman philosopher . Literature is , however , almost entirely excluded from the British newspapers , rind , in my opinion , not without good reasons . Within the small compass afforded by a daily paper , literary criticism* must be , of necessity , superficial and frivolous . If the critic aim at gravity , and attempt to sound the depths of thought , he becomes pedantic and stiW and seems to be out of place , like a learned professor at a convivial party . Facts , and a very few reflections upon them , are what the British public requires , with reason , of the journalists . It looks to more extensive publications , appearing at longer intervals , such as the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews , for instruction in science and philosophy . ' // 1828 . Be Staiil 's Letters on England . There is much good sense in these observations , and we cordially assent to most of them . We rather doubt , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives to the English mode of conducting a newspaper , over the French . What is the model of a first-rate daily paper , is , we think , a question of high importance , and one which is not yet satisfactorily solved . Newspapers are , in fact , rather a late invention . They attracted but little attention , till within the last half-century , and it is hardly probable , that their form has already attained perfection . There is room to suppose , that experience will , in the course of years , suggest various improvements upon the now e*dsting fashions . As at present advised , we incline to regard the French model as the best in use . We see not why the wholesome principle of the division of labor , should not have as good an effect in this department of industry , as it confessedly has in most others ; nor do we understand very clearly the advantage that results from spreading out before the mass of readers , the endless columns of advertisements , which occupy more than half the space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , and which the mass of readers most assuredly never think of looking at . If in each of our principal cities , as at Paris , a single journal were devoted exclusively to advertisements of all kinds* to the exclusion of other matter , and the usage of employing the political papers for this purpose , were abandoned , the expense of advertising would be greatly reduced , because it would then be only necessary to do it in one paper , instead of ten or twelve . The present system leads to a great waste of capital ; but a still more unfavorable effect resulting from it , is the excessive multiplication of newspapers , and the consequent degradation of the political and literary character of all . If the advertisements were published in a separate form , the political papers would depend wholly for success on the talent of their editors and writers . None could exist excepting such as were conducted by persons of respectable powers and good education , because no others would obtain readers . In this case , there would probably be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at most two or three political ones , representing the views of different parties . These would all he well written , and enjoying the whole patronage which is now divided among a much greater number , would afford sufficient profits . At present , the quality of the literary and political matter is a // point of secondary Concern , as respects the profits of the establishment , which result almost wholly from the advertisements . The necessary consequence is , that it is comparatively neglected in almost all the journals , both here and in England . In France , on the contrary , where the other system prevails , tha best and most brilliant pens in the capital are engaged in providing matter for the daily papers . We could mention a writer who has , within a few months , been received into the French Academy , solely on account of the merit of his literary articles published in the Journal des Debats . Constant , Chateaubriand , Bonald , K*ratry , *tienne , Michaud , Devaux , and others , who are either editors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first names in contemporary literature . In England , there are few if any examples of newspapers edited by persons of eminent literary reputation ; and the writing in most of them is of a very ordinary stamp . It is rumored that Time Times has fallen into the hands of the poet Moore ; and if this be true , we may expect some improvement in the style , which has hitherto been extremely coarse . As respects literary execution , we may claim perhaps in this country some advantage over the British . Our eminent statesmen and good writers have always been more inthe habit of communicating with the public in this way , than theirs . With the exception of the letters of Junius , we recollect no series of valuable political articles that have ever appeared in England in jthis form ; while our newspapers have been constantly enriched with the treasures of the first minds in the country , from the time of . N'ovanglus and . lliliassachusettensis down to that of Fisher Ames , and so on to the present day . Our editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alloy , a considerable portion of truly precious metal . It comprises at this moment some of our most distinguished literary characters , and could lately boast , in addition to its present list , the name of the accomplished and lamented Haven , who for , several years conducted The Portsmouth Journal with the highest credit to himself , and to the signal advantage of the public . We can not agree with Baron de Sta*il , in thinking that literary matter is better excluded from the daily papers . When good ( as it must he of course , to be useful or agreeable anywhere , anc as it is habitually in the French Journals ) , we are // of opinion that it is not only not out of place , but that its introduction has the happiest effect , both intellectual and moral . It conveys much valuable knowledge to rnaiiy persons who are not accustomed to read hooks or formal reviews ; and what is perhaps of still higher moment , it gives to the journals a tone of humanity , politeness , and civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempers the ferocious party spirit which is apt to embitter their whole substance , and makes them channels of sometbing else besides hard words and angry feelings . For these reasons , we have seen with much satisfaction some of the most accredited papers in the country , such as the New-York American and the National Gazette , habitually filling a part of their columns with interesting and instructive selections from foreign publications of a literary cast . We shall be still better pleased when the state of the press and of the public patronage shall enable our editors to enlist in their service the ablest writers of our own country , and to present us with the rich original fruits of native genius . It is generally believed that the polish , good humor , and fine feeling of The Spectator had much effect in subduing the virulence of party spirit in Great Britain ; and we have little doubt that an ample infusion of well written literary matter into the daily papers , would exercise an equally auspicious influence in this country , where , no one will deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The immense size of the British newspapers , and their superiority in this respect over those of the continent , are constant themes of exultation and triumph with their editors ; and many an excellent joke is daily cracked by them upon the puny and diminutive constitution of their foreign rivals . In point of fact , however , if we look into the reason of this difference , it does not appear to be greatly to the advantage of the British , as it is owing wholly to the enormous stamp duty imposed upon them by the government . This makes it impossible to sustain a paper upon the strength of the subscription money , and has led of necessity to the admission of advertisements , to the expansion of the size of the sheet , in order to make room for them , and to the comparative neglect of the literary and political execution of the matter , which , as we have shown above , naturally results from these circumstances . Thus these very features in an English journal , which Baron de Stad so ingeniously justifies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain , are neither more nor less than badges of subjection to an unexampled and intolerable excess of taxation . With us , where there is no stamp duty , the same features are a mere imitation of the British usage , and this is one among many other singular cases ( as for example , the general consumption of Portuguese and Spanish , instead of French wine ) , in which we continue voluntarily to wear the trammels of colonial dependence , while we are boasting so loudly of having shaken them entirely off . In order to effect the improvement we have suggested , it is duly necessary for some enterprising editor in each of our great cities , who enjoys a good share of advertising patronage , ( with the consent of his patrons , who would find a great economy in the change ) to separate his establishment into two parts ; one devoted exclusively to advertising , and the other to political and literary intelligence . Each , if judiciously conducted , must of course prosper . Of the other journals , the feebler would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compelled , in self-defence , to copy the new model , and would become exclusively politiical and literary . We freely offer the benefit of this plan ( which would prove a mine of wealth , if skilfully reduced to practice ) to any of our editorial friends , who may think proper to work upon it ; and must now hasten to follow our author in his farthur speculations on the state of England . The next topics to which he adverts , are the various assemblies that are held for political purposes , including the two Houses of Parliament . In common with these , he touches on the great question of parliamentary reform , and enters at some length into a developement of the respective opinions of the Whigs and Radicals concerning it . This inquiry closes the volume . Baron de Sta*il 's observations on these subjects , which are generally very correct and judicious , are probably newer and more interesting to the French public than to us ; since in most of the particulars he notices , our institutions and customs so nearly resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merely a picture of what we see every day passing before our eyes . The most amusing passage is the account of a meeting held at Maidstone , in Kent , at which our author was present , and where the notorious Cobbett succeeded in defeating the Whigs upon their own ground . We recollect reading at the time , in the newspapers , a report of the proceedings , but have nevertheless been much entertained with the Baron 's more succinct narrative , which is as follows . // The meeting to which I allude ; ' says our author , was held in the county of Kent , one of the most extensive , wealthy , and populous in England . The inhabitants , in the pride of certain ancient privileges belonging to them as such , generally call themselves the men of Kent . The place of meeting was the city of Maidstone , thirty-five miles from London . I set off to attend it early in the morning in company with several wealthy Whig landholders , with whom I have the honor of being acquainted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the road , my companions were uniformly treated with the respect which is regularly paid by all classes in England to such noblemen as are at all distinguished for merit and talent . As we appr*ached Maidstone , we encountered large numbers of freeholders and farmers repairing to the meeting , mostly on horseback ; for with all the supposed distress of the country , there was hardly a farmer who did not keep one or two horses for his personal use . We alighted at the tavern , where we found a number of the most considerable persons of the county already in consultation on the subject of the meeting . A draft of a petition had been made the evening before , which set forth the distresses of the agricultural class , and demanded a reduction of the taxes , and the adoption of measures for raising the price of grain , and withal a reform of Parliament , as the only remedy for the standing diseases of the state . The draft appeared well fitted to satisfy the most democratic taste . It was fully discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that it should be submitted the next day to the consideration of the meeting , when it was anticipated that it would * unanimously adopted . At the hour appointed , we repaired to the market-place . As it was a market-day , several thousands of persons were assembled , and the windows of the neighboring houses were all occupied . The tumult occasioned by the crowd , was mingl*d with the lowing of oxen , the bleating of sheep , and the confused movements of buyers and sellers . The people were pressing impatiently around several carts , which were to serve as stages for the speakers ; and on one of which , two pine boards were placed crosswise to support the sheriff 's arm-chair . Some of the spectators mounted upon the wheels , others ascended a ladder and remained upon it in a most uneasy position for the purpose of hearing a little better ; so intense is the taste for political discussion that pervades even the lowest classes of the British nation . I remarked , how .. ever , that with one exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eager to enjoy the pleasures of the day , thought of taking possession of them , although there was no authority , military or civil , to guard them . " For whom then are these places reserved 1 " said I to a person at my side . " For the gentlemen , " // replied he . Now who were these gentlemen ? Persons who had a right to these reserved places by any special privilege ,  --  who had any visible badge about them to attest their pretensions ? Far from it . The public sentiment was the only criterion ; and yet in the midst of this scene of confusion , there was a full understanding that the best places belonged to the Peers of the Realm , the Members of Parliament , the Justices of Peace , and other persons who were able , from their education and situation in life , to speak upon the business of the day , and who were collectively and concisely designated as the gentlemen . Scarcely had the gentlemen taken their places , and the sheriff opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded upon and into them in such numbers , that the speakers had hardly room to move their arms . The sheriff stated the object of the meeting , and a member of Parliament representing the Whig interest of the county , then made a speech in which he enlarged upon the matter of the petition , and exposed in detail , the misconduct of the ministry ; and the augmentation of the taxes occasioned by ruinous and impolitic wars . He was often interrupted by thunders of applause , from ten thou. * sand hearers . The meeting appeared to be unanimous ; hut Sir Edward Knatchbull , the ministerial member for the county , though nearly alone of his opinion , thought it necessary to make some reply to the speech of his colleague . Accordingly , after a number of complimentary phrases , of which the English are as prodigal at this kind of meetings , as they are sparing in their courts of justice and in Parliament , he boldly undertook the defence of the ministers , who , here at least , were in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still with respect and attention ; and the people , as they said , were rather pleased to hear ) *im express himself in a frank and manly way , an epithet which to an English ear , is strongly indicative of esteem and approbation . The petition met with no opposition , and the sheriff was about to take the question , when a voice was heard from the most crowded of the carts , proposing an amendment . All eyes were now turned on this side , where a stout , gray-headed old man , with a bold , determined look , was urging himself forward from amongst his friends , and preparing to speak . This person was the notorious Cobbett . He was received with a general murmur of disapprobation . Down with Gobbett ! No Jacobins here ! was a pretty universal cry . One of the opposition lords proposed , nevertheless , that he should he allowed a hearing . " Is Cobbett a freeholder of the county 2 " was then inquired on all sides ; " I am , " replied he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the sheriff , " you have a right to be heard , and it is my duty to keep order while you are // speaking . " Cobbett then commenced his harangue , as nearly as I recollect , in the following manner ; " I see that you do not wish to hear me , and I shall therefore be brief ; but I shall speak so plainly that every laboring man in this meeting will understand what I say , and , I hope , repeat it to his children . You are all crying out for reform of Parliament , as the only possible remedy for our political diseases . Now , who first proposed this remedy ? Why , the Radicals , who for more than twenty years past , have been working day and night to recover the rights of which they have been robbed by a haughty aristocracy . What rewards have we had for it ? Why , we have been insulted , imprisoned , some of us trampled under foot at Manchester ; others compelled to quit the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge on Long Island , in the State of New York , to avoid a prosecution from Daddy Burdett . I have now come back , and what do I see ? Why I see all the noblemen and gentlemen of this county , assembled here to promote this very reform of Parliament , which they drove me out of the kingdom for proposing . Most of them I know are Whigs , and I am willing to admit that their predecessors did some service at the time of the revolution of 1688 , and that they are not quite so bad themselves as the Tories and the fund-holders ; but ( God knows ) they are bad enough . They now declaim against corruption . Why then do they continue themselves to fatten on sinecures and pensions ? Why are they preaching up a reform in Parliament , while they insist upon keeping their own rotten boroughs , under pretext that it would not answer to give them up unless the Tories will consent to do the same ? This shameful traffic can not last much longer , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign your boroughs , or lose your estates , " etc . While he was delivering this exordium , standards were carried about among the crowd , with hand-bills pasted on them , on which Cobbett 's writings were advertised in large capitals . A low murmur of approbation now ran through the audience , and the speaker , perceiving that he had made an impression , artfully took advantage of it to recapitulate in a hasty manner , the various abuses of the administration in church and state . After this , assuming a more moderate tone , he proposed a reduction of the national debt , on the ground that it was but just that the public creditors should suffer a diminution of their own incomes , proportional to that which was sustained by all other classes in consequence of the fall in the price of grain , and the resumption of cash payments by the banks . Cobbett was followed by another of the Radical orators , who seconded the amendment in language somewhat nervous , though coarse and incorrect . Although the // measure proposed amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large majority . The meeting was then dissolved , and the more respectable Whigs returned to their homes , not a little chagrined at having been defeated by a person of Cobbett 's reputation and character . ' We look upon Cobbett as one of the remarkable men of the present time , and as affording a singular example of the extent of notoriety to which an individual may attain in England , under all possible disadvantages of birth and education by the mere effect of talent and industry ; and as showing on the other hand how completely the fruits of these valuable qualities may b* lost , for want of a small infusion of common honesty . This we take to be the real defect in the character of Cobbett . As w prose writer , he has few superiors in the language . Though familiar and popular , be *s gene ' *ally pure and correct , and at times elegnnt ; fiowir1 ? j did easy , but nevertheless nervous , pointed , and significant , and above all , thoroughly English . The great literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he produces them , together with his indefatigable activity , would have made him an invaluable coadjutor to any party with which he might have chosen to connect himself ; and would have carried him to the loftiest heights of social considoration . In defect of principle , a tolerable share of prudence and regard for consistency would have answered nearly the same purpose . It is now somewhere about thirty years since , under the name of Peter Porcupine , he first kindled his Bushlight in the benighted regions ( as he then thought them ) of Philadelphia . Down with the Jacobins ! ( the cry that is now raised against him ) was then his own watchword ; as it was about the same time that of Mr Canning , who was then just commencing his career in the same way , by the publication of a weekly paper , entitled The . flnti-Jacobin . Canning 's real talent was , perhaps , inferior to that of Cobbett ; his activity and industry probably less , *-*hey certainly ctuld not be greater ; his moral sensibility not keener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means proverbial ; but possessing , nevertheless , a competent share of these useful qualities , he rose rapidly to the first places in the government , and finally to the highest of all , while poor Cobbett , after a long life of unremitted and exemplary labor , after publishing hundreds of volumes of the best and most popular composition in the language , finds himself at sixty years of age , precisely whore he set out , // the editor of a weekly paper , without a friend and without a penny . Examples of this kind serve , as the poet Claudian says of the fall of some overgrown villain of his time , to acquit the gods , ' and show that moral distinctions are of more practical value than some are willing to admit . After starting as the advocate of social order , against revolution and Jacohinism , and at various times , in the subsequent course of his life , defending correct principles with great power and effect ( as in his letters to Lord Castlereagh , upon the grounds of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually sinking , step by step , in self-respect and public consideration ; and ha* been reduced , for some years past , to play the part of a sort of political buffoon , dealing out his paltry wit ( now on the lees ) at all parties aud persons in succession , despised and laughed at by all , from Daddy Coke* and Daddy Burdett ( to use his own phraseology ) , down to his ancient yoke-fellow , but now sworn enemy , Hunt ; but still writing on , scribble , scribble , scribble , its the Duke of Cumberland said to Gibbon , as busily and sometimes with as much power and freshness as ever , and constantly declaring himself , without reserve , the cleverest man in England . The most amusing part of Cobbett 's career , is his late attack upon the Protestant reformation . Our readers are probably aware , that he has published a series of letters on this subject , which make , when collected , two or three octavo volumes . These have succeeded wonderft*illy with all th' good Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the strength of them , pronounced Cobbett to be a fine animal . The fanatical party in France have had the work translated , and extensively circulated in that country ; and even the Spanish press has relaxed from its habitual sterility , in favor of this precious production . Nay , the Holy Father himself has condescended to patronize so pious an undertaking , and has paid ( unless the newapapers are grossly mistaken ) for fifty thousand copies out of his own pocket . Cobhett , patronized by the Pope , is a pleasant caricature . But we must take our leave of Cobbett , and proceed with our author . Baron de Sta*il enters into a somewhat de'tailed examination of the sentiments of the two parties denominated Whigs and Radicals on the question of*parliamentary reform . We have not // room to follow him in this , and the subject , though always im- portant in theory , has for some years past been but little agitat-. ed in England , and has lost a great part of its immediate interest . The well known Jeremy Bentham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to the Radical opinion . We believe that this philosopher is in fact acknowi-. edged as the leader of the sect , and as entitled to the honor , whatever it may be , of having supplied them with something like a theory . As respects the character and pretensions of this person , we have thought , that with a good deal of natural talent and acquired information , he has the misfortune to labor under a partial aberration of intellect , which has grown upon him as he advanced in life . His first publications , though not of much importance , were judicious and well writ- ' ten . He afterwards engaged in inquiries of greater extent and interest , but as he went on prosecuting them , his understanding seems to have become confused , perhaps from too intense and exclusive application to study . He found himself incapable of bringing out his own ideas in an intelligible form , and committed his manuscripts to a clear-headed Genevan , named Du .. mont , who arranged and published them in French , and to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It seems at least but natural and fair to draw this conclusion , since the numerous works which Bentham has since published are entirely of a different stamp as respects both tone and substance . They are written in a strange and incomprehensible jargon . The matter of his later writings is also nearly or quite as extravagant as the manner ; and his conduct is of a piece with both . Our readers doubtless recollect the pleasant account given by Captain Parry , in his work on the life of Lord Byron , of a visit which he made to Bentham at his residence in London , and of the would-be Solon 's race through Fleet Street and Cornhill , which he ended , if we remember rightly , at Moorfields , from an instinctive consciousness , perhaps , that he should be more at home there than anywhere else . This little circumstance , like straws that show which way the wind blows , decided our opinion on the condition of his understanding , - and explained at once how a person , who in the maturity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thoughts in his native language , should feel himself called upon in his old *ge to reform the legislation of the whole civilized // world from China to Peru , and should actually enter into correspondence with most of the sovereigns and other rulers of the day upon the subject . With these impressions respecting his character , we should of course deem it unnecessary to examine in detail his political system , had we even the necessary space at our disposal . We may remark , however , that it exhibits in many parts evi* dent symptoms of a complete incoherence of ideas in the au* thor . Thus our legislator thinks it necessary that in a perfectly free government , where all the magistrates are elective , measures should be taken for enabling each citizen to conceal his opinion on the public affairs , lest forsooth he should be called to account by-we are not informed whom . For the better effecting of this object , our modern Numa enters into a large dissertation upon the proper shape and constitution of a balloting box , and directs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be required to take an oath that he will regard every attempt to discover for which candidate he means to Vote , as an act of oppression , and will not feel himself bound to give a true answer . How poor to this the wisdom of the Lockes , the Montesquieus , and the Madisons , whom Bentham thinks it his vocation to supersede . Baron de Stahl pronounces these regulations to be de grander pauvret6s , or much ado about nothing . We should rather class them with what the Spaniards call disparates or sheer nonsense  --  the natural fruit of an unsound intellect . What do we mean by the freedom of speech and the press , if the citizen 's lips are to be hermetically sealed , and his way of thinking an impenetrable mystery ? Is it not th' precise object of a free government , to give him the opportunity , as Tacitus has it , of thinking what he pleases , and saying what he thinks ,  --  sentire quce velis , et quce sentias dicere 6 ? What would be the surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past been publicly discussing , from one end of the Union to the other , the question for whom they shall vote as President two years hence , if they were told that it was essential . to liberty that every man 's opinion should be kept a profound secret ! It is evident that Bentham 's notions are not merely trifling and unstatesmanlike , but actually incoherent , and in gross violation of the laws of plain common sense . The chief error of the partisans of parliamentary reform in England , both moderate and violent , many of whom were of course much wiser men than Jeremy Bentham , lay in attaching // too much importance to mere external forms , and attending too little to the influence of the condition of the people upon the spirit and operations of the government , in consequence of this inattention , it so happened that many of the most intelligent and sagacious persons in Great Britain , kept up a constant alarm during the last half-century , respecting the increasing influence of the crown , when in fact the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge and wealth among the middling and lower classes , was growing from day to day more and more popular . We think we hazard nothing in asserting , that from the time of Mr Dunning 's celebrated resolution , that the influence of the crown had increased , was increasing , and ought to be diminished , ' up to the late introduction of the Whigs into the administration , the political weight of the aristocracy , including the crown , has been regularly decreasing , and that of the mass of the people increasing in the same proportion , or , in other words , that the circle of citizens who take an active share in the public affairs , has been constantly enlarging . The Whigs were the virtual representatives of the popular interest , and though , as a party , regularly voted down in Parliament , their moral power was always advancing , until at length the ministry , without a formal change of persons , adopted their views , and established a system of policy , foreign and domestic , conformable to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy of England , in common with that of the Continent . Finally , upon the occurrence of the opening lately afforded by the retirement of Lord Liverpool , the last result of this change has been seen in the personal introduction of the Whigs into office , at a time when their party , as such , seemed to be extinct , and had almost ceased from a*y active opposition to the measures of government . The situation of the Whigs was similar to that of a ship beating up against a head wind , and apparently making but little way , or perhaps losing ground , but which is nevertheless carried on unconsciously by a favorable current , and finally reach*es the port without well knowing how she got there . Mr Canning , whose elevation and sudden death lately created so strong a sensation throughout the christian world , was the person marked out by circumstances to act a a sort of mediator between the two interests , and to smooth the pas*age from one system of policy to another . Accidental caus9s // had attached him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person of Pitt , its great representative and champion . On the other hand , his commanding talents and lofty spirit , while they naturally led him to sympathize with all truly liberal notions , and enabled him to estimate correctly the value of new ideas , also qualified him , when occasion required , to deviate from the routine of preceding practice , and strike out an inde -- pendent course for himself . The same traits of character which fitted him so well for a leader , probably rendered him in some degree less useful and agreeable as a mere coadjutor in the cabinet ; and from his first entrance into public life , until the death of Lord Londonderry , he seems to have played , upon the whole , a subaltern and rather uncomfortable part . That event at once fixed him in his proper sphere , and had a powerful influence in giving , with the necessary - promptitude , the new direction to the affairs of the country , which was absolutely essential to its future prosperity . A more correct and liberal economical system had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the crisis was the immediate recognition of Spanish America . Had England hesitated upon this question , the Allies would have probably taken part with Spain . America might perhaps have been recovered by that power , and Great Britain would then have sunk very rapidly into a feeble appendage to the military powers of the continent . The moment was therefore in the highest degree critical . Of the two courses that lay before the government , one was recommended by routine , and aristocratic prejudice ; the other , as we have said , was imperiously counselled by good policy and liberal feeling . The latter had been previously proposed and chiefly supported by the Whigs , and had the ministry consisted of statesmen of the ordinary stamp , like Lord Londonderry , men much under the influence of mere routine and existing connexions , the decisive blow would hardly have been struck . By an almost miraculous combination of events , it so happened that at this precise juncture , Lord Londonderry , in the vigor of life , and with the prospect of a long career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Mr Canning , whom the delay of a few weeks longer would have removed for ever from the scene of action , was summoned to replace him . His connexions with the aristocratic party gave him the necessary weight and favor with the crown , and his powerful // character , which placed him above routine and prejudice , enabled him to see the true policy of the country , although it came before him in the questionable shape of a Whig doctrine , and to act upon it with the requisite decision . There is an air of fanfaronade in the proud declaration made by this statesman in his famous speech on Portuguese affairs ,  --  that he had called a new nation into existence ; but we nevertheless regard it as in substance well founded in reference to Spanish America . That the policy adopted by England was the immediate cause that prevented , in fact , the interference of the continental powers , is generally admitted . Our proceedings had great weight in determining the course of England , and produced in this way a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrence of England , our influence alone might not have averted the danger . We mean not to say , that had the Allies actually interfered , the independence of Spanish America would have certainly been lost , but that it would doubtless have been jeoparded and necessarily contested for an indefinite period , during which our western continent would have been visited by a train of incalculable miseries , some part of which-we need not here inquire how large a onewould have fallen to our share . The cooperation of England and the United States was indispensable in order to give to this great movement in political affairs , the fortunate direction which it actually took . Each of these powers may therefore felicitate itself with justice upon having had the opportunity of rendering the most important services , at the critical moment of their national birth , to the rising republics of the South . This , we suppose , making due allowance for rhetorical exaggeration , *nd the warmth of extempore speaking , is the only meaning which we need to deduce from the aforesaid remark . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either power . It is agreeable , ' says President Rivadavia ( the most distinguished statesman whom this great struggle has yet brought into notice , and one who may well be compared with the soundest thinkers and most judicious practical politicians of any age or nation , ) in his address to the Congress of Buenos Aires , in May , 1822 , upon retiring from his place , as governor of that province ; it is agreeable to witness the frank and noble policy of His Majesty the king of Great Britain . The similarity of opinion // and feeling , which we observe in the cabinets of London and Washington , will show to Spain that she can not hope to contend single-handed with the free nations of the new world , and will perhaps introduce into her councils the moderation and wisdom , so necessary to her existence . ' Nor are the statesmen of the South in any way jealous of the influence which it naturally belongs to our country to exercise upon the political system of the continent ; This illustrious nation , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1825 , and alluding to the United States , this illustrious nation is naturally called upon to direct and lead on the march of all the free States of America . ' The unity of political system in.regard to these all-important subjects , which appears in the councils of the two great English nations on the two sides of the Atlantic , is a circumstance of happy omen , not merely for the Southern republics , but for their own mutual intercourse , which , we venture to hope , will not wear for ever the unnatural and repulsive form of fraternal hostility . The recognition of Spanish America by the British government was , however , a decidedly Whig measure , both in form and principle . It marked at once the separation of the goverrfment from the despotic alliance of the continent of Europe , and its adhesion to the liberal system , which rules without dispute throughout that of America . The policy of England being thus entirely changed , it was not unnatural that a corresponding change should occur within no very distant period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the leading Whigs , who for twenty years before had been proposing the same measures which had now been adopted by the government , should share in the honor and satisfaction of carrying them into effect ; and that the prime minister should avail himself of the first favorable occasion to introduce some of the most distinguished and unexceptionable individuals among them into the cabinet . Objections however would naturally occur to such a proceeding , and here again the powerful character of Mr Canning was one of the circumstances which were perhaps indispensable , and were certainly very efficacious in bringing about the desired result . We all know from recent experience in our own country , how tenaciously the personal sympathies and antipathies occasioned by party divisions are cherished long after the causes that created the parties have ceased to exist . Such men as Lord Chancellor // Eldon and the Duke of Wellington , who , although they had concurred in adopting the liberal measures recommended by Mr Canning , refused to serve under him for no better reason , apparently , than that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless objected still more strongly to any association with professed Whigs . Few ministers could have ventured to take a stand in opposition to the weight of their names , and to the vast influence which they were supposed to possess in the nation ; and nothing but the immense personal popularity which Mr Canning was conscious of enjoying , would have justified him in the attempt , or have rendered it successful . With a manly confidence in the correctness of his principles , and the extent of his powers , which belongs only to an intellectual and moral character of the highest order , he resolutely took his ground , and maintained every inch of it , to the utter astonishment and consternation of his adversaries , and to the signal satisfaction of the friends of liberty throughout the world . The final result was a complete recomposition of the ministry on the most liberal principles , and with a large mixture of professedly Whig elements . So complete and well-founded was the new political edifice from the moment of its construction , that the death of its great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to have affected in any way its stability or probable duration . We look upon the new administration , although siill under the direction of a nominal Tory , as in principle decidedly Whig , and we anticipate that such will be the coloring of the policy of England , under all changes in the persons of the ministers , for a long period to come . We incline to this opinion , because we consider a liberal policy as more congenial to the principles of the British constitution , as well as more suitable to the existing circumstances of the country , than the one which was pursued for thirty or forty years preceding , and has now been abandoned . The basis of the British constitution is in the main liberal , and the policy of the government had been generally such from the accession of the House of Brunswick ( which was determined by the prevalence of the Whig party ) up to the opening of our Revolution . From that period down to the close of the French Revolutionary war , the measures pursued , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute love of oppression and despotism , *-though natural perhaps , and , at times , in some // degree justifiable ,  --  were nevertheless throughout inimical to freedom . The circumstances that led to this deviation having changed , the British government has placed itself again upon its natural foundation ; and this , precisely because it is the natural one , we think is likely to be permanent . Having thus changed the direction of the policy of his country , and restored the principle of liberty to its natural ascendency in the cabinet , Mr Canning seems to have accomplished the object of his mission , and we deem it not unfortunate for his fame , and for the good of the world , that he has been withdrawn so ' early from the scene of action . When the course is given and the sails justly trimmed , a common head is able to steer the ship ; and it sometimes happens that the high qualities which are so useful and necessary in extraordi*-nary conting*nces , may be positively dangerous in transacting the common routine of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Henriade , who shine in a secondary sphere , but lose their lustre when they rise to the highest . ' Tel brille an second rang , qui s ' *clipse an premier . ' There are others , on the contrary ,  --  and Mr Canning was probably of the number ,  --  whose talents are fitted for great occasions , but who make less display in the conduct of the simple affairs of ordinary life . The ardent imagination and the bold , creative genius which enabled their possessor to invent new systems , and to grapple with questions of a grand and complicated nature , have no natural bearing upon matters of inferior interest . When a statesman , possessed of these trans** cendent qualities , flies at smaller game , he is apt to run into exaggeration , if not into error . Mr Canning 's course on the Portuguese affairs was perhaps an example of both these results . His policy in regard to this subject was from the outset extremely questionable ; and the mode , in which he treated it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave umbrage to the principal powers of the continent . Had he lived , this question might perhaps have endangered the tranquillity of Europe , and consequently of the whole christian world ; but under the more temperate and business-like management of his successors , it will probably be brought with ease to a quiet termination . In like manner , the difference about the colonial trade between this country and the British West indies , by the effect // of his flippant mode of writing and misapplied promptness and energy of action , was ripening pretty fast into a serious quarrel . This dispute too , we trust , will be speedily adjusted by the plain good sense and good temper , and , we hope we may add , liberal and amicable feeling of the present ministry . We repeat , therefore , that while we regret the premature death of Mr Canning , on account of the breach it necessarily makes in the social circle of his friends and connexions , while we experience a sentiment of gloom at the extinction of one of the most brilliant lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as respects his own glory and the interest of the christian commonwealth , he had lived long enough , and that he now sleeps well . ' He died , as it were , in the arms of victory , on the loftiest summit of social elevation that an Englishman can innocently reach . He had been made of late the instrument of great and lasting good to his country and mankind ; and had shown , throughout his career , the highest qualities , intellectual and moral . His faults will be acknowledged by the candid , to be of those that accompany an ardent and generous character , and his name will be recorded , in spite of them , among the most illustrious in modern history . We have been led imperceptibly into this digression upon the recent changes in the British Ministry , by the reflections which naturally result from the topics last treated of by M. de Sta*fl . Having already exceeded our limits , we must now conclude by recommending his work to our readers , as a judicious , well-written , and dispassionate examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . If their sentiments are at all similar to ours , the name of the author will secure to his production a high degree of attention ; and we conceive that we are bestowing sufficient commendation upon it , when we add , that those who peruse it with the expectations which that distinguished name may justly excite , will not be disappointed .
