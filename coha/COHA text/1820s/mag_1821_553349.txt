Llmerica , written by Charles Botta , translated from the Italian by George alexander Otis . Philadelphia . 1820 . HISTORY , according to the ancients , is one of the muses , and it is her duty no less than that of the others to give pleasure while she gives instruction . The mere enumeration of important events , however correct and circumstantial , is not history , nor has the annalist , the chronologist , or the antiquary any claim to be called an historian . He , who aspires to this name , must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters and motives of those who performed them , and trace their consequences ; he must arrange and connect the facts recorded by him , which are but the frag .. ments of history , in such a manner that they may illustrate each other , and clothe them in a simple and dignified style , thus rendering them one uniform and beautiful whole . He must not only dare to utter no falsehood and fearto utter no truth , butmustcatch with the eye and describe with the pen of the poet those general features and striking peculiarities , which characterise and identify the scenes of his narrative or the actors in them ; and recalling them , as it were , into existence , place them living and moving before us . Though perfectly impartial towards all persons , he is not to be indifferent to the moral qualities of actions or their influence on the happiness of men , nor to relate in one unvarying tone of apathy the triumph of justice , and that of guilt , the self-devotion of disinterested patriotism and the recklessness of ambition ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the same manner , as the poet or the orator ; and exhibit animated models of character and impressive lessons of conduct . Such or nearly such was the model of historical excellence , which ancient critics recommended and ancient writers sought to attain ; but in this department of literature , though some perhaps may think in this alone , the moderns have formed a // *July , still higher idea of perfection th*tn thi* ancients . All while the latter demanded is still required , at least in theory , and a new task is imposed . It is not enough to satisfy the critics of the present day that an historian should adhere strictly and fearlessly to the truth , should preserve the unity of his subject and the continuity of his narrative , should describe with fidelity and animation the scenes and the progress of events , display the motives and characters of his heroes , and exhibit and cherish a pure and lively moral taste ; all this may be done , and yet what is now deemed the most important duty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should pos-. *ess the excellences of the j*oet and the orator , he must add to them those of the philosophey and the political economist , he must show the pursuits , habits , ideas , and feelings of the mass of the people , their advances in civilization and refine-* ment , the state of education , morals , and manners among them , that of their laws , finances , and commerce , their improvements in the arts and sciences , and in literature ; and the progress of public opinion on political subjects , with its influence on the form and administration of government and on domestic life ; and must make us acquainted with states and communities , rather than with singular and illustrious individ* nals . To this object the intermediate chapters of Hume are entirely devoted . Much information on these subjects is undoubtedly to be gathered from the ancient historians . The perfection of their narratives enables us to form some tolerably correct idea of the state of society among them , but they do not make it their chief study to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own times . Some of these writers on the other hand attach themselves too exclusively to this object ; not that they ever give us too much knowledge on the subject , but too little of the facts from which that knowledge is deduced ; and in their fondness for generalizing defeat their own purpose , and become indefinite , where they would be comprehensive . Hence works have been given to the public under the name of histories , which contain no connected story whatever , and are at best no more than the reflections of their authors on reading history , speculations on the character of some particular people , illustrated by occasional statements of fact , and this too when the knowledge they are designed to con* vey would have been more clearly as well as more agreeably *ommunicatcd by a simple narrative . If the ancients attached // too much importance to the brilliant achievements of their great men , it is as frequent an error among us to underrate the effect of single events on the situation of the community , and the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that all periods are equally worthy of the labors of the philosophical historian , since the moral , physical , and intellectual condition of the mass of the people , in comparison with which the manoeuvres of armies , the intrigues of cabinets , and the artifices of courtiers are unworthy of regard , may be as thoroughly investigated and as completely displayed in peaceful times , as amid wars and revolutions . But this is extravagant . Great changes , especially such as are brought about by human exertion , are often the origin , and still oftener the result of great mental excitement , and therefore the characters of individuals and of nations are more powerfully affected and more perfectly developed by them , than by 4ieir ordinary , peaceful , domestic pursuits . It is true indeed that though remarkable occurrences are the common indication , they arc not the certain proof , still less the measure of the importance of any period as a subject of history ; and that the comparative interest of human actions in the eye of the historian depends less on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they excite at the moinePt , or on the number of persons engaged in them , than on their ultimate effects . Imposing the nominal duty of a penny a pound on tea was no very illustrious achievement of the British parliament , and independently of its consequences would not deserve notice ; but taken in connexion with them , it is a more important event in history than many a battle in which thousands have fallen , or many of the political intrigues by which thrones have been subverted . Yet periods of great civil commotion , when a whole people are forced into immediate and intense action , when the foundations of society are shaken , and ancient political institutions overthrown , are objects of peculiar interest ; and the events which immediately precede and prepare the way for such revolutions , and the operation of the secret canses , which ultimately produce and the consequences which follow them , are always worthy of our attention , and eminently so when they operate among ourselves . It is true that the history of the times nearest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are familiar , and rejecting // those embellishments , which may be applied , at least with impunity , to that of a remote age , does not afford so much excitement or gratification to youthful curiosity , but it is more engaging as well as more useful to such as read with reference to their own condition , and feeling a concern in the realities of life , seek to apply their knowledge to some practical purpose . Itis equally true that it is difficult for a writer to appear impartial or to be so in relating occurrences , which have an immediate and conspicuous influence on himself and those around him ; but it must be recollected on the other hand that he is more likely to be deceived and may more easily deceive others , with regard to circumstances of a distant date . Though we naturally distrust the judgment of those who pubhsh accounts of recent events , we rely most confidently on their statements of important and notorious facts . The history of the last century , including an investigation of the first origin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length convulsed so many European nations , and whose operation is far from being ended , will long be a subject of great and increasing interest . Yet our language has produced no historical work relating to any part of that century , which will be preserved as a choice specimen of literature . On this topic , if America has done nothing , England has done no more . Both have accumulated abundant materials for such works . In both the freedom of the press has afforded opportunity , an opportunity , which has not been neglected , for the publication of authentic and unauthentic documents without number ; and this circumstance renders it so much the more surprising that no writer in our language has made a successful attempt to combine these materials into a lasting monument of literary fame . There is , in our opinion , no event in the whole course of that century , which affords to the historian a more entertaining or instructive theme , or one whose effects seem likely to be more extensive and permanent , than the contest between Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , very happy , if we ought not rather to say very wise , in the choice of his subject . The American revolution is an object of permanent and increasing interest in other countries as well as our own , not only because the unexampled rapidity with which this nation has advanced in population and wealth will render the occurrences of its early history attractive to statesmen in every age , but because // it was the first of that series of revolutions , which in the close of the last and beginning of the present century have shaken the very foundations of government throughout Europe and America . Not that we would compare with it those , by which it has been followed . It was as different from them in its origin and conduct , as in its event . But it had no small influence in producing them , for while the character and motives of those who accomplished it were , as they still are , little known among foreigners , its result was conspicuous , and appeared to those , who saw no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional interest from its effects on the political ideas and feelings of men . It affords support to the theoretical principles on which republics are founded , gives the confidence of experience to those who maintain that it is practicable and useful as well as speculatively right for the citizens of a state , however extensive and populous , to exercise a direct control over their rulers , and a strong impulse to that desire of security , that restlessness under arbitrary power , which has long existed wherever the English language was spoken , and has lately found its way to the humblest and most ignorant classes on the continent of Europe ; and which , feeble , unenlightened , and misguided as it now is there , is yet destined , if we are not mistaken in the signs of the times , to alter materially the whole structure of society among them . But the historical interest of our revolution does not depend solely on the importance of its direct consequences and the extent of the political and moral changes , which it has tended at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete development of the temper , motives , and resources of a whole nation . It was not , like most wars , a contest between cabinets or armies , a mere trial of military or diplomatic skill , but the united effort of a people as individuals for the vindication of their rights . Nor was it a single burst of exasperated feeling , a short madness , one of those revolutions , in which men sometimes exhaust themselves by struggling to acquire a liberty , which they know not how to value or to maintain , and then fall back into the same condition as before ; but a sober , deliberate , calculating resistance of oppression , adapting its means to its end , and pursuing that end through the greatest sacrifices of comfort and feeling . It does not indeed excite attention by accounts of very numerous armies or remarkably bloody battles , yet we do not therefore think , as some hava // done , that it is deficient in interest ; for the passions of the contest operated directly and intensely on every man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and severed the strong .. est and tenderest ties ; circumstances , which give the clearest insight into the temper and character of the people and make the most lively impression on the feelings . It is no less true in real than in fictitious narrative , that the most engaging and pathetic scenes are those , which exhibit the efforts and suffer .. ings of individuals . It has been said that the history of the American revolution , at least before the meeting of Congress , necessarily wants unity , as it is not an account of one nation , hut of thirteeil different states , among which the attention is distracted . But it seems to us that the unity of the subject is not diminished by this variety of agents , since their exertions were all directed to the same end . The establishment of so close an union among thirteen distinct , unconnected and in some instances jealous colonies , that it has lasted much longer than the particular danger which gave rise to it , is in itself a most interesting phenomenon , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our study . The simple fact that the revolution was accomplished within the limits of a single life , so that the same persons who began , lived to complete it and enjoy its result , adds another charm to its history ; for in consequence of this , our interest in many of the individuals conspicuous at the beginning of the contest , never ceases , but is combined throughout with that which we feel in the event . Besides the freedom of debate and of the press not only excited and developed more perfectly the passions of those engaged in the controversy , but has provided better means of information than could have been obtained under any other circumstances . Add to all this , that Mr Botta may claim the authority of an almost contemporary historian , while as a foreigner he is exempted from the danger and even from the suspicion of partiality , to which contemporaries are commonly exposed . He seems well aware of the advantages peculiar to his subJect , especially of those , which tend to render his work attractive and entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endeavoring to instruct his readers by ex*imples , to present a connected and winning narrative , more than to exhibit a view of the moral , intellectual , and political // - condition of the people . He makes , indeed , some general reflections on the manners and pursuits of the colonists , but does not communicate any statistical details , and is by no means sufficiently particular in giving an account of the commerce of the colonies , and of the restraints imposed on it , restraints , which were the chief cause of complaint before the revolution , as our exemption from them has been of our sub ' sequent prosperity . This writer possesses in a remarkable degree , what Rapin deems the most essential quality of an historian , the art of telling a story , by which we mean , and so probably did the learned critic , not the art of relating a single anecdote , but that of making his whole work one continuous and complete narrative , the several parts of which , though various , are connected by natural and agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each in its place . It has been objected , but we think incorrectly , that the relation in this work of the battles , which took place in the West Indies and in Europe , is irrelevant to the American revolulion , and violates the unity of the narrative . They were con. * tests between the allies and the enemies of the United States , and had each its influence in hastening or retarding the termi-. nation of hostilities and the acknowledgment of our independence . They are described too with all due brevity and with great accuracy and spirit , and appear to us to add not a little to the interest of the story . The bloody and fruitless conflictn of those immense fleets and armies , collected and equipped at the expense of millions , by rival nations , with no other motive than their mutual desire of subjecting each other to the humiliation of defeat , form a striking contrast with the struggles of the colonists , who , destitute of wealth , of arms , of every thing but a bare subsistence , engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such important results , as will render their skirmishes , inconsiderable as they seemed at the time in comparison with the battles of the European powers , far more conspicuous in history . Our author 's sketches of the characters of individuals are in the main just , but want that discriminating minuteness , which distinguishes his descriptions of scenery and events . In many of the latter he is singularly happy . His description of Boston gives as distinct an idea of the town and its vicinity an a map ; and that of the situation and siege of Gibraltar is a c*mplete. and *lowin.g picture . He evinces much discretion // and good taste in adapting the length and particularity of difft*rent parts of his history to the interest of the subjects to which they relate , rapidly glancing over those events , which , however talked of when they happened , do not fix our attention by the importance of their consequences , or afford an opportunity for delighting his readers by beautiful and poetical description . The candor and impartiality displayed throughout this history are a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author , it may be thought less meritorious in him to possess , than it would have been disgraceful to want them . His diligence in consulting the best sources of information within his reach , and the accuracy which , in general , results from it , are still more worthy of praise and not less important . We would not be understood to say that his statements of fact are never erroneous . In his account of the battle of Breed 's hill he conveys the idea that the Americans remained there two nights ; for he says that the Americans continued to work the whole day after they took possession of the heights with unshaken constancy , and towards night had much advanced a trench , which descended towards Mystic river ; that the English then took the resolution to attack them , and that on the seventeenth of June in pursuance of this resolution the British camp was in motion between twelve and one clock . He mentions also the grateful liberality of the state , in extending every mark of kindness and protection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any children . These mistakes of fact are of little importance , and we believe that even of such as these the work contains a far smaller number than might be expected from the minuteness with which circumstances are often detailed in it , and the difficulty of obtaining correct information with regard to our history on the continent of Europe . But few as they are , it would have been convenient to the American reader , if the translator had corrected them in his notes . Mr Botta thinks himself at liberty to deviate from the exact truth in recording public speeches . For this he has the example of ancient writers , but it is not admissible according to the rules of modern criticism . An author may insert in his history any speech actually made , or an extract from it , or its substance expressed in his own words , giving his readers to un // derstand which of these he has undertaken to do , but ought not to ascribe to any individual arguments not his own . rho fol .. lowing is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will be found , in the course of this history , several discourses of a certain length . Those I have put in the mouth tthe different speakers have really been pronounced by them , and Ron those very occasions which are treated of in the work . I should , however , mention that I have sometimes made a single orator say what has been said in substance by others of the same party . Sometimes , also* but rarely , using the liberty granted in all times to historians , I have ventured to add a small number of phrases , which appeared to me to coincide perfectly with the sense of the orator , and proper to enforce his opinion : this has happened especially in the two discourses p renounced before Congress , for and against independence , by Richard Henry Lee , and John Dickinson . It will not escape attentive readers , that in some of these discourses are found predictions which time has accomplished . I affirm that these remarkable pessases belong entirely to the sue thors cited . In order that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fact , Ihave been so scrupulous as to translate them , word for word , from the original language ? p. ix . Now , in our opinion , whenever he professes to repeat the words of another ho ought to translate them , if not literally , at least fairl*r , preserving substantially the ideas and arrangement of the onginal . And we must say further , that the liberties he has taken are , in some instances , greater than this notice would load us to suppose . Many of the discourses introduced are indeed translated into italian with sufficisut fidelity , or at least not very materially altered , but some are very different from the speeches actually made , as that of Captain Harvey in answer to Wilkes ; and as to those of Leo and Dickinson , we believe them to be mere fiction , the former too an unskilful fiction , not appropriate to the individual in whose mouth it is put , and tending to misrepresent his style of oratory , rather than to illustrate it . The moral and political reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sometimes bony too much subtlety and refinement of thought The designs and intrigues of the various courts of Europe , the motives of France and Spain for aiding the American* to carry on the war , yet attempting to prevent the establishment of their inde // pendence and impede their prosperity , are accurately and fairly stated by this writer ; but in some of his remarks on the intentions and conduct of the colonists before the declaration of independence , he shows a want of acquaintance with their manners and feelings , which , however natural and pardonable it r*y be in him , is injurious to his work . He seems to admit the pretensions of some of the ministerial writers of that day , that our ancestors owed no little gratitude to the British gov eminent for being treated with less severity than the colonists of other European nations . It is certain that British subjects , whether inhabitants of England or of the colonies , were not so much exposed to the caprices of arbitrary power as the subjects of the continental sovereigns . This arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rulers , which might entitle them to lay claim to the gratitude of the people , but from the temper of the people themselves , who would not endure oppression , and understood that their rights were not a grant from the crown , but the power of the crown a grant from them . Speaking of the acquittal of Captain Preston and his soldiers , tried at Boston in 1770 , the author says , it was a thing truly remarkable , that in the midst of such a commotion , and at a moment when the effervescence of minds was so extreme , this judgment so little conformable to the wishes of the multitude , should have been pronounced . So admirable were the judicial regulations established in these countries , and so firm was the resolution of the judges to obey the law in defiance of all influence whatsoever . ' p. 162 . It would be no wonder that the acquittal of these men should be desired by the judges , since they had been nominated by governors appointed by the king ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by twelve men chosen by lot from the county in which the massacre , as it is called , took place , a fact far more honorable to the people than the statement of Botta . XVe find in the work before us repeated suggestions , that if this or that circumstance had occurred , if the stamp act had been carried into immediate execution-if the ministry had placed less reliance on the divisions of the colonists-if America had received no aid from Europe-if Burgoyne had effected a junction with Howe-if Howe had attacked the army of Congress-if the treasonable project of Arnold had succeeded-or if Admiral Rodney had remained in America the // result of the contest would have been different ; as if the inde-. pendence of the colonists were produced by a series of happy accidents , and not by their own resolution and perseverance . These suggestions , whatever dramatic effect they may give to the work , by representing the Americans to be always in imminent danger , are entirely unfounded . Either of these events or many others might have prolonged the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but no event in the ordinary course of nature , nothing short of the annihilation of their physical strength , could have reduced them to submission . Their resistance must at least have been successful , because they would not yield . We do not mean to attach too much consequence to the errors just mentioned , but there is one pervading almost the whole of the first volume , which seems to us so important in relation to the character of our ancestors , that we must ask the indulgence of our readers , while we examine it somewhat minutely . It is a total , though undoubtedly an innocent misrepresentation of the sentiments entertained by the colonists towards Great Britain before the revolution . In the very beginning of the work we find among others the following remarks : The love of the sovereign and their ancient country , which the first colonists might have retained in their new establishment , gradually diminished in the hearts of their descendants as successive generations removed them further from their original stock , and when the revolution commenced , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English colonies were , in general , but the third , fourth , and even the fifth generation from the original colonists , who had left England to establish themselves in the new regions of America . At such a distance the feelings of consanguinity became feeble or extinct ; and the remembrance of their ancestors lived more in their memories than in their hearts The greater part of the colonists had heard nothing of Great Britain , excepting that it was a distant kingdom from which their ancestors had been barbarously expelled or hunted away , as they had been forced to take refuge in the deserts and forests of America inhabited only by savage men , and prowling beasts or venomous and horrible serpents . The distance of gov - eminent diminishes its force ; either because in the absence of the splendor and magnificence of the throne , men yield obedience only to its power , unsupported by the influence of illusion and respect , or because the agents of authority in distant countries , exercising a larger discretion in the execution of the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to escape their restraints. ' - ' It follows of necessity that as the means of restraint became almost illusory in the hands of the government , there must have arisen and gradually increased in the minds of the Americans the hope , and with it the desire to shake off the yoke of English superiority . ' p. 1O -- 12 . In regard to their sentiments in 1763 , it is said , that Already those who were the most zealous for liberty , or the most ambitious , had formed in the secret of their hearts the resolution to shake off the yoke of England , whenever a favorable occasion should present . ' - ' That in the late war great numbers of the colonists had renounced the arts of peace , and assuming the sword instead of the spade , had learned the exercise of arms , inured their bodies to military fatigues , and their minds to the dancers of battle ; they had , in a word , lost all the habits of agriculture and of commerce , and acquired those of the military profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becomes doubly strong , and the yoke he feels in a condition to break , is borne with difficulty ; thus the skill recently acquired in the use of arms , become general among the Americans , rendered obedience infinitely more intolerable to them . ' - ' The greater number , however , satisfied with the ancient terms of connexion with England , were reluctant to dissolve it , provided she would abandon all idea of ulterior usurpations . Even the most intrepid in the defence of their privileges , could not endure the thought of renouncing every species of dependence on their legitimate sovereign . This project they condemned the more decidedly , as they perceived that in its execution they must not only encounter all the forces of England , by so many victories become formidable to the universe , but also must resort to the assistance of a. nation , in language , manners , and customs , so different from themselves ; of a nation they had so long been accustomed to hate , and to combat under the banners of their mother country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find the following passage . The legislative power of the parliament over the colonies was not made the subject of doubt , but denied . Adopting the opinion of those , who in the two houses had opposed the repeal of the stamp act , the patriots affirmed that all distinction between internal and external taxes was chimerical , and tI*t parliament had no right to impose the one or the other ; that it had no power to make laws to bind the colonies ; and , finally , they went so far as to maintain , that not being represented in parliament , they were exempted from every sort of dependence towards it , // 1821 . The rights which the colonists pretended to enjoy , were explained with great perspicuity , and a certain elegance of style , in pamphlet entitled , Letters frurn a Pennsylvania Farmer , to the inhabitants of the English colonies . They were received with great and universal favor : the author was John Dickenson. ' p. 145 . Speaking of the American Congress in 1774 , he says , The colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some mode or other , were to deliver their country from the perils that menaced it . The greater part believed that their ability , their prudence , and their immense infiueuace with the people , would enable them to obtain from the government the removal of the evils that oppressed them , and the reestablishment of the ancient order of things . Some others cherished the belief , that they would find means to conduct the American nation to that independence , which was the first and most ardent of their aspirations , or rather the sole object of that intense passion which stung and tormented them , night and day . ' p. 199 . And afterwards in relation to the same body . And as those who are inclined to war , generally affect the roost earnest desire of peace , congress addressed a letter to seneral Gage , praying him to put a stop to the hostile preparations , which might provoke a pacific people to have recourse to arms , and thus prevent the endeavours of the congress to restore a good understanding with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors of a civil war . ' p. 206 . And further on their adjournment . No one will deny , that this assembly knew how to appreciate the circumstances of the time , and demonstrated a rare sagacity , in leading them to cooperate in their designs . They not only found means to invigorate the opinions which then prevailed in America , but also to diffuse and propagate them surprisingly ; applauding the ardent , stimulating the torpid , and conciliating the adverse- They were lavish in protestations of loyalty to the king ; which could not fail to answer the end they proposed ,  - -  that of finding a pretext and excuse for ulterior resolutions , in case their remonstrances should prove ineffectual . With the same apt policy , they flattered the pride of the British nation , with the view of engaging it to favor their cause . They manifested equal dexterity , in fomenting the political opinions that were beginning to prevail in this century . Originating at first in England , they had been diffused , by degrees , among the neighbouring nations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 182 July , duced , and defended with a fascinating eloquence , by the most celebrated writers of that period . Accordingly , in every place and circle , the Americans , and especially the members of congress , were considered as the generous champions of these favorite principles ; for , as to the object they had in view , there no longer existed a doubt . Though it was possible , however , to excuse , and even applaud this resolution of the Americans to defend , by force of arms , the rights for which they contended , it was difficult , it iiiust be acknowl edged , to reconcile with the loyalty they so frequently professed , their insinuating writings to draw into their confederacy other subjects of the crown of England , as the Canadians , for example , who had not , or who made no pretensions to have the same rights . But , in affairs of state , utility is often mistaken for justice : and , in truth , no event could have happened more useful to the colonists than the adhesion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 221 . On the subject of the appointment of a commander in chief , he says of Putnam and Ward , both had declared themselves too openly in favor of independence ; the Congress desired indeed to procure it but withal in a propitious time . ' p. 314 ; and of Washington : It was generally thought , that he did not aim at independence , but merely desired an honorable arrangement with England . This opinion of his well corresponded with the intentions of the principal representatives , who had no objection to advancing towards independence , but were not yet prepared to discover themselves . They expected to be able so to manage affairs , that one day this great measure would become a necessity , and that Washington himself , when he should have got warm in the career , would easily allow himself to be induced , by the honor of rank , the force of things , or the voice of glory , to proceed with a firm step , even though instead of the revocation of the oppressive laws , the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 317 . Of the address of Congress to the inhabitants of Ireland in 1775 , he remarks , They were not ignorant , besides , that the Irish were , for many reasons , dissatisfied with the English government , and that , the concessions which had recently been made them , no little animosity still rankled in their minds . The Congress purposed to avail themselves of this misunderstanding , and to irritate the wounds already festering in the breast of the Irish . It would be difficult to prove this conduct strictly consistent with loyalty . But the war was *aow commenced , and the Americans // were disposed to use all means to carry it on with advantage ; and none are more sanctioned by usage , than those of feigning to desire peace , and of exciting and exasperating the minds of the enemy 's subjects , against lawful authority . To this intent , the Congress addressed a very eloquent letter to the Irish people . ' pp. 341 , 342 . After giving an account of the rejection of lord North 's conciliation act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress , relative to the resolution of adjustment of lord North : they caused them to be published , and distributedin all places . No one can observe the acrimonious style , and the new pretensions of the Americans , without perceivhuw how little they were inclined to concord . ' p* 853 . The peopie suffer themselves too often to be guided by vain fears , or by vain hopes ; and , at this epoch , the greater part of the colonists still flattered themselves with the possibility of returning , some day or other , upon honorable terms , to their ancient footing with Great Britain . It was , indeed , quite evident , to what object the Congress was tending . It was therefore manifest , that while the two parties protested their desire to meet each other , they were both exerting all their efforts to render it impossible . It was no less evident , that when in parliament the adve.r. * saries of the ministers proposed concessions and terms of arrangement , it was with reason the latter rejected them , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless , but even detrimental , because they would encourage the colonists to new demands , less admissible still . If the ministers themselves proposed , afterwards , and carried an act of conciliation , it was only a pretext to divide , and not to reunite . They were therefore in the right , when they resolved to continue the war at all hazards : but they were in the wrong , not to carry it on with sufficient means . ' pp. 858 , 359 . Having stated the departure of the royal governors from the several provinces , he proceeds as follows Thus ceased , as we have related , the royal authority in the different provinces . It was replaced , progressively , by that of the people ; that is , by the Congresses or conventions extraordinary , that were formed in each colony . But this was deemed insufficient , by those who directed the affairs of America . Their real object being independence , and the present state of things , a irregular and precarious by its very nature , leaving a way open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient cow . nexion and dependence , they desired that such a system should be established in each jyrovince as should have the appearance of // a permanent constitution , in order to satisfy the world that the Americans were capable of governing themselves by their own laws . But the chiefs of the popular party had many difficulties to surmount in the execution of this design , notwithstanding the ardor which manifested itself in all parts to second their operations . The greater number approved resistance , but were opposed to independence , or at least shuddered at the idea of openly asserting it . For this reason , those who had the supreme direction of affairs , fearful of injuring their cause by too much precipitation , resolved to proceed with extreme circumspection ; and marched to their object , always protesting that their efforts were aimed in quite another direction .

This was no longer an adhering to the defensive , but , on the contrary , a proceeding the most offensive , against a prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one of his provinces , which had in no shape demanded the succors it was pretended to offer it . This was not merely exciting peaceable and uncomplaining subjects to revolt against their lawful sovereign , but also violently occupying their country , and draggiiig them by force into sedition . Was it not to be feared , that an enterprise so audacious would discover too openly the intentions of the general Congress ; and that then , those of the colonists who combatted with sincerity to obtain the revocation of the oppressive laws , at the same time abliorring the idea of a total separation , and even desiring to resume their former relations with Great Britain , would immediately abandon a cause which would no longer be theirs ? pp. 403 , 404 . Our readers would hardly pardon us , if we should enter into a labored argument to show that the war of 1756 had not rendered any considerable portion of the colonists a military people , or that on the close of that war it did not enter into the imagination of any one among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parliament , they might seek aid horn the French ; a people whom at that time they hated and despised no less heartily than the most prejudiced and jealous of their fellow subjects in Great Britain . Nor is it necessary to occupy much time in proving , that if the Farmer 's Letteis by Dickinson explained the pretensions of the colonists correctly , as is here stated , then they made no pretension to be exempt from the control of parliament , for those letters , while they utterly deny the power of that body to impose on the colonies any taxes or duties whatever , for the purpose of revenue , do // not once call in question its right to legislate on all other subjects , and expressly and repeatedly admit its authority to prohibit or restrain any branch of trade or manufactures , and to enforce rigorously that scheme of oppression , called the colonial system . The passages above cited are in other respects not quite consistent , but on the whole they represent the colonies as desirous to shake off the British yoke long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people to war , under pretence of wishing for peace , and dragging Washington into the support of measures , which he did not anticipate nor approve . Now all this is erroneous . There never was a more loyal people than the colonists in the middl* of the eighteenth century . The distance of the throne was *o far from diminishing their respect for it , that it seemed , by rendering it inaccessible to them , to cast round it an additional majesty . They venerated and loved the name of England , familiarly applying to it the endearing appellation of home ; so that if a native ' of America , whose ancestors had resided here for many generations , expressed an intention to go home , he meant that he was going to the mother country , as they delighted to call it . The few , who had fought under the British standard in Canada , instead of being more impatient of their dependence on Great Britain , had acqu ? red a sort of personal interest in her glory , and regarded their former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel towards those , with whom we have shared the most intense feelings , and whose companions we have been in labor , suffering , and success . The Congress represented faithfully the sentiments of the people , and Washington , though originally as averse from independence as the great body of his fellow-citizens , was not more so . One probable source of these errors is the desire of Mr Botta to appear perfectly impartial , which may have induced him to admit the assertions both of the English and Americans with regard to the designs of the latter , even at the hazard of a little inconsistency . The ministerial party industriously circulated the opinion , that the colonists would not be satisfied , though all their demands should be granted , and that their secret , constant , and only aim was independence ; and this they did in order to diminish the popularity of the American cause in England , to weaken the opposition in parliament , and unite the nation in support of their incasNew Series , . TVo. 7. 24 // 186 July , ores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans . Doctor Franklin , who had the best possible means of learning the temper of all classes of men in the colonies , and who did not want sagacity to penetrate their wishes and designs , relates that lord Chatham , in August 1774 , remarked to him that an opinion prevailed in England that America aimed at setting up for itself as an independent state , and adds , 1 assured him that having more than once travelled almost from one end of the continent to the other , and kept a great variety of company , eating , drinking , and conversing with them freely , I never had heard in any conversation from any person , drtink or sober , the least expression of a wish for separation , or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America . ' In addition to this authority we refer to the addresses and petitions of the Congress in 1774 and 1775 , which contain the strongest protestations that they had no de*fre of independence , and claimed only to be restored to the enjoyment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion is cast *n their sincerity by their addresses to the inhabitants of Eng*hmd , Ireland , and Canada , for having engaged in opposition to the ministry , it was their obvious policy to win over as many as they could to their own party , to gain if possible an ascendancy in parliament , to array the nation against the ministers , and thus compel them to abandon their measures or to resign their places . With regard to lord North 's conciliation act , they must have been blind indeed to be entrapped by so gross an artifice . They claimed to be exempt from all taxes imposed for the purpose of revenue , excepting such as should he laid by their colonial assemblies , and his lordship proposed in effect that the ministry should determine the amount which each colony should pay , and that its own assembly might then pass such laws as were necessary for levying the sum , as if taxation consisted not in imposing the burden , but in apportioning it . How can the rejection of this offer be called rejecting conciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they would give up the substance ; it was pronouncing the sentence and allowing the criminals to choose the mode of execution . The invasion of Caiiada was undertaken in pursuance of open hostilities already commenced by the British ; and it is a subtlety invented *irice the plain days of our fathers to call every attack on a // declared enemy offensive , and to make defensive war consist in avoiding blows without ever attempting to strike one , according to which interpretation the only legitimate mode of defence is to stand still and be beaten , or to run away . It may be urged that the conduct of the colonists for some years before the declaration of independence , was such as necessarily tended to bring about a separation from Great Britain , and must therefore have been designed for this purpose ; or at least that they could not be so blind as not to perceive that this would be its sure result in the end . But we must recollect that few see clearly where their own interests are involved , and that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , especially when they are such as we dislike to contemplate . And besides , it may be that it was not they who were blind , but we who are presumptuous . Speculative men are too apt to ascribe every accident to some design , and to judge of the motives of others not by their actions themselves , but by the remote consequences of them , to fancy that they discern some close and necessary connexion between every great change and the occurrences which preceded it , and to flatter themselves that if they had witnessed these , they should have foreseen their result . It is easy to prophecy after the event ; but we should like to see these acute philosophers , who discern so clearly the necessary connexion of the present with the past , point out a little more confidently and precisely than they commonly undertake to do , the direct and necessary consequences of the present . Whatever may be thought of the tendency of the conduct of the colonists between 1763 and 1775 to bring about a separation from Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thought little less than a madman , who should seriously have asserted during that period that they would ever consent to renounce the British name . The tendency of the conduct of the ministry and parliament was the same , yet no such design is attributed to them . This error with regard to the sentiments existing in America at that time , seems lately to have found some countenance among ourselves . When told to seek in the early history of our country the causes of its independence , some men expect to find the desire of it springing up among the first colonists , and increasing in each successive generation . But for this they will seek in vain ; though we may undoubtedly look back // 188 July , to the settlement of the country , and further still , back to the reformation , for the origin and growth of those principles and feelings , which rendered the colonists so jealous of their rights and particularly of that of taxing themselves , that when it came at last to the alternative , they did not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them as it was ; and having made this determination , persisted in maintaining it through dangers , toils , and privations almost without example . Perhaps this error may have been encouraged also by an idea , that since the effects of our revolution have been so glorious and beneficial , it is honorable to our ancestors to assume that they anticipated those effects , and designed from the first to declare America independent in order to produce them . But no one intimately acquainted with their conduct and motives , can suppose that it adds ally thing to their just praise thus to ascribe to them the gift of prophecy . Had they foreseen this rapid and astonishing prosperity , the splendor and durability of their own fame , the advantages which the revolution would yield to themselves , and those which it would confer on their children and their country , they would have exhibited no very singular merit in embracing the alternative which they chose . After the die was cast , they endeavoured very naturally to alleviate their immediate distress by indulging what were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never entered the wildest of their dreams , that those of them , who should live longest , or their children would look round on such a scene as more than one of the chief among them now beholds . They saw directly before and all about them difficulty , peril , and distress ; and this very independence , through which they were compelled to pass in order to obtain security , was in their opinion by no means the least of the evils they had to encounter . Yet painful as the step was , they rejoiced when it was taken , because they were by that time persuaded that it was the only means of preserving their liberty , which they valued still more highly than their allegiance . There is no doubt that individuals had different opinions with regard to the time when they should renounce their allegiance , and that a great majority in congress were ready for the measure some months before all the colonies were willing to adopt it : - not that they felt the pain of the sacrifice less , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had no other alternative than independence or subjection . // Wc know not how to put any construction on the addresses and petition of Congress in 1774 , consistent with the opinion , that the members of that body then designed to separate the colonies from Great Britain , or believed that their constituents did so , without casting a stain on their character , which no success can wipe away ; for they repeat the most solemn asseverations , that they have no other intention or desire than - to be restored to the condition in which they were before the year 1763 . Were they sincere in this language , or was it , a Mr Botta fancies , a mere cloak for very different designs , cal .. culated to deceive the ministry and ensnare their fellow-citi. zens ? If it were so , then their addresses and petition were not as Chatham called them in the house of lords , models of moderation and dignity , worthy of Thucydides and equal to the productions of the master states of the world , but the paltry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with honest pride whenever they are mentioned , we ought to shut our mouths and hide our faces . The assertion , that Washington had much stronger objections to independence than his countrymen in general , rests also on English authority . In the year 1777 it was thought that it would serve the cause of parliament to circulate the opinion , that the inclinations of the American commander were at war with his duty ; and for this purpose certain letters were written and published in England in his name , expressing the strongest disapprobation of the conduct of Congress in declaring independence , the utmost despair of success , and an anxious wish to resign his office . The impression produced by these letters among the uninformed in Great Britain , seems to have outlasted the belief that they were genuine ; at least many affected to think that they represented his sentiments truly , long after being compelled to admit that they were forgeries* In the composition of his work Mr Botta avowedly attempts to revive the style of the classical age of Italian literature , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending to restore the perfection and purity of the language ; while others object that it occasions the introduction of many expres sions , which , however simple and natural they may once have been , wear at this time an appearance of quaintness and affectation . Undoubtedly in style as in manners , every appearance of study is a defect ; but it belongs to Italians to decide how far that defect exists in the work before us . A foreigner , // who derives his knowledge of their language from books , is commonly as familiar with the early Italian writers as with those of the present day , and is therefore less struck with the obsoleteness of the ancient idiom than a native of the country . It needs no nice acquaintance with Italian , however , to enable us to perceive the harmony , copiousness , and variety of Mr Botta 's style , or to authorize us to condemn his frequent use of trite and popular maxims . They may be energetic , for none but energetic expressions are likely to become proverbial , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a work as this , their energy does not compensate . It is our duty to say something of the translations , the titles of which are prefixed to this article . M. de Sevelinges takes unwarrantable liberties , frequently omitting whole sentences of the original without any other motive , that we can perceive , than to save himself the trouble of translating them . We have not , however , observed the omission of any important fact . How far this gentleman is qualified to judge of the correctness of Mr Botta 's remarks , and of the propriety of omitting any of them , even if such a privilege were allowed to a translator , may be learned from his preface , in which he undertakes to communicate the most important information , hitherto a secret , derived , as he tells us , from an actor in the scene equally respectable for his knowledge and integrity , and supported by documents of unquestionable authority . The main object of this preface is to explain minutely the attempts of the English to induce Spain to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English never made any such attempt , hut the French government , with a view to drag Spain into the war , persuaded the Spanish court to offer its mediation to Great Britain , by whom it was promptly and pertinaciously rejected . Another most important secret , never known to the world till it was published by M. de Sevelinges , in his preface , is , that in America in 1778 , the English faction of tories still existed and derived great power from the reputation of its leaders , who were , ' as he informs us , Samuel I/dams and Richard Lee . ' - ' Its intrigues constantly embarrassed the deliberations of Congress , and the greatest prudence and activity were requisite to prevent the dissolution of that body and the triumph of the partisans of England . ' We know not what to say to such effrontery as this , and shall only add , that the style of M. de Sevelinges is extremely careless and inaccurate . // Our countryman , Mr Otis , deserves the credit of being much more faithful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his text , but he is sometimes misled by the French translator . We do not mean to say that he merely translates the translation , for there are instances in which he conforms to the original , where M. de Sevelinges has departed from it ; but there are others in which he evidently translates from the French , without consulting the Italian . In speaking of the vehemence of the British minister in Holland , Sir Joseph Yorke , when he discovered that a treaty had been made between the Dutch and Americans ; Mr Otis has it , M. Yorke exploded violently at the Hague . ' Surely the origin of this phrase is not the Italian , tosto Joreke ne lev6 all ' Aja un grandissimo romore ; ' but the French , M. Yorke *clata violemrnent ? * la Haye . ' We find in this translation the following sentence , relating to the admiration with which Doctor Franklin was received in Paris ; in all places the portraits of Franklin were exhibited ; they represented him with a venerable countenance and dressed as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract attention . ' This last trait is not to be found in the Italian , but is introduced by M. de Sevelinges . It is neither honorable to Doctor Franklin , nor just to represent him as xvalking about in a singular dress , like Rousseau in his Armenian habit , for no other purpose than to attract the attention of the gazers of Paris . The following passage in the close of Mr Botta 's work is omitted by both translators . The confederations , which are formed by several powerful nations against a single one , on account of some reform that it chooses to make in the structure of its government , and which threaten not only to defeat its object , but to deprive it of freedom and independence , generally induce its rulers to renounce every thing like prudence and moderation , and to resort to the most violent and extraordinary measures , which soon exhaust the resources of the country and excite discontent among its inhabitants ; till oppressed and harassed in every form , by the officers of government , they are driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community is wasted . And besides , these violent measures so disgust the people with the whole undertaking , that , Gonfounding the abuse of a thing with the use of it , they choose rather to retreat to the point from which they set out , or even further back , than to . continue their progress towards the object originally proposed . Hence it is , that , if that object were liberty , // they afterwards rush into despotism , preferring the tyranny of one to that of many . ' vol. iv , p. 464 . We can readily imagine that the censors of the press under Napoleon would prohibit the publication of these sentiments at Paris in French , even though they permitted them to he printed there in Italian , hut no such reason exists for their omission in an American translation . This translation contains several expressions not admissible in our language , some of them apparently derived from M. de Sevelinges ; thus we find ways of fact , ' half portice , ' the fiscal , ' debonnaire , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in both translations , though not in the original , to have scaled mountains perpendicular . ' The authority of the dictionary is not sufficient to justify the use of such terms as collectitious soldiery , ' ' vortical gusts , ' and ' belluine executors of the king 's will . ' These things are mentioned in order that they may he corrected in another edition . We are duly sensible of our obligation to Mr Otis , for making this history accessible to us in our own language , not only on account of its intrinsic merit , but because it gratifies our rational curiosity to learn what sentiments are entertained towards us by those foreigners , who look on our country with a candid and even a favorable eye . We believe such men to be more numerous and more respectable in every European nation , than those who delight to dwell on our faults and follies . Perhaps the most effectual and most agreeable mode of giving our readers an idea of the translator 's style will be to make a few extracts from the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time Mr Botta 's talent for description , though we must choose not the best , but such as can be included within the limits assigned to this article . The sea fight between Paul Jones and Captain Pearson in 1779 is described with great spirit . Paul Jones , a Scotchman by birth , but engaged in the service of the United States , had established his cruise at first in the seas of Ireland , and afterwards in those of Scotland , where he was waiting for an opportunity to make some prize , or , according to his practice , to land upon some point of the coast in order to sack the country . His flotilla was composed of the Bonhomine Richard of forty guns , the Alliance of thirty-six , both American ships ; the IPallas , a French frigate of thirty-two , in the pay of Congress , with two other smaller vessels . He fell in with a British merchant // fleet , on its return from the Baltic , convoyed by captain Pearson , with the frigate Serapis , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty . Pearson had no sooner perceived Jones , than he tore down to engage him , while the merchantmen endeavored to gain the coast . The American flotilla formed to receive him . he two enemies joined battle at about seven in the evening , with great resolution , and the conflict wa:s supported on both sides with equal valor . The Serapis had the advantage of metal and manouvre ; to obviate which , Jones took the resolution to fight her closer . He advanced till the two frigates were engaged yard to yard , and their sides so near that the muzzles of their guns came in contact . In this position they continued to fight from eight in the evening till ten , with an audacity bordering on frenzy . But the artillery of the Americans was no longer capable of producing much effect . The Richard having received several heavy shot between wind and water , could now make no use whatever of her lower batteries , and two or three of her upper guns had burst , to the destruction of those who served them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be worked , and he employed them against the masts of the hostile frigate . Seeing the little impression made by chain-shot , he resorted to another mode of attack . He threw a vast quantity of grenades and fire-works on board the British ' frigate . But his own now admitted the water on all sides , and threatened every moment to go to the bottom . Some of his officers having perceived it , asked him if he would surrender ? * he answered them in a tremendous tone , and continued to push the grenades . he Serapis was already on fire in several places ; the English could , with difficulty , extinguish the flames . Finally , they caught a cartridge , which , in an instant , fired all the others with a horrible explosion . All who stood near the helm were killed , and all the cannon of that part were dismounted . Meanwhile , Pearson was not disheartened : he ordered his people to board . Paul Jones prepared himself to repulse them . he English in jumping on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of their pikes ; they made the best of their way back to their own vessel . But during this interval , the fire had communicated itself from the Serapis to the Bonhomme Richard , and both were a prey to the flames . No peril could shake these desperate men . The night was dark , the combatants could no longer see each other but by the blaze of the conflagralion , and through dense volumes of smoke , while the sea was illuminated afar . At this moment , the American frigate Alliance caine up . Amidst the confusion she discharged her broadside into the Richard , and killed a part of her remaining defenders . As soon as she discovered her mistake , she fell with augmented // fury upon the Serapis . Then the valiant Englishman , seeing a great part of his crew either killed or disabled , his artillery dismounted , his vessel dismasted , and quite enveloped in flames , surrendered . All joined to extinguish the fire , and at length it was accomplished . The efforts made to stop the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning . Out of three hundred and seventy-five men that were aboard that vessel , three hundred were killed or wounded . The English had but forty-nine killed , and their wounded amounted to no more than sixty-eight . History , perhaps , offers no example of an action more fierce , obstinate and sanguinary . During this time the Pallas had attacked the Countess of Scarborough and had captured her , not however without a stubborn resistance . After a victory so hard-earned , so deplorable , Jones wandered with his shattered vessels for some days , at the mercy of the winds , in the north sea . He finally made his way good , on the sixth of October , into the waters of the Texel. ' pp. 1 12-i 14 . The account of the battle of Cowpens between Morgan and Tarleton is also highly animated and graphic . Tarleton , after having passed with equal celerity and good fortune the rivers Ennoree and Tiger , presented himself upon the banks of the Pacolet . Morgan retreated thence forthwith , and Tarleton set himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how full of danger was become the passage of Broad rmver* in the presence of so enterprising an enemy as now hung upon his rear . He therefore thought it better to make a stand . He formed his troops in two divisions ; the first composed of militia , under the conduct of colonel Pickens , occupied the front of a wood , in view of the enemy ; the second , commanded by colonel Howard , was concealed in the wood itself , and consisted of his marksmen and old continental troops . Colonel Washington , with his cavalry , was posted behind the second division , as a reserve . Tarleton soon came up and formed in two lines ; his infantry in the centre of each , and his horse on the flanks . Every thing seemed to promise him victory . He was superior in cavalry , and his troops , both officers and soldiers , manifested an extreme ardor . The English attacked the first American line ; after a single discharge with little harm to the enemy , it fled in confusion . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more obstinate resistance . The action was engaged and supported with equal advantage . Tarleton , to decide it in his favor , pushed forward a battalion of his second line , and at the same time directed a charge of cavalry upon the right flank of the Americans . He was afraid to attack their left , supported by colonel Washington , who had already vigorously repulsed an // assault of the British light horse . The manoeuvre of Tarleton had the expected effect ; the American regulars gave way and were thrown into disorder . The English rushed on , persuaded that the day was now their own . Already Tarleton with his cavalry was in full pursuit of the routed , when colonel Washington , whose troop was still entire , fell upon the enemy with such impetuosity , that in a few moments he had restored the battle . During this interval , colonel Howard had rallied his continental troops , and led them back upon the English . Colonel Pickens had also , by prodigious efforts , re-assembled the militia and again brought them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and words re-animated the spirits of his soldiers . He profited of that moment of enthusiasm to precipitate them in one general charge upon the enemy . The shock was so tremendous that the English at first paused , then recoiled , and soon fled in confusion . The Americans pursued them with inexpressible eagerness . It was in vain that the British officers employed exhortations , prayers and threats to stay the fugitives ; the discomfiture was total . Tarleton lost , in dead , wounded and prisoners , more than eight hundred men , two pieces of cannon , the colors of the seventh regiment , all his carriages and baggage . ' pp. 249-251 . The hurricane of Barbadoes in 1780 , presents a scene of terror hardly inferior to the plague of Athens . The events we have been relating were succeeded , in the West Indies , by a sort of general truce between the two parties* 2But though the fury of men was suspended for a while , that of the elements broke out in a manner much more tremendous . It was now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the enjoyment of that unexpected tranquillity which resulted from the cessation of arms , when their shores and the seas that washed them , were assailed by so dreadful a tempest , that scarcely would there be found a similar example in the whole series of maritime records , however replete with shocking disasters and pitiable shipwrecks . If this fearful scourge fell with more or less violence upon all the islands of the West Indies , it no where raged with more destructive energy than in the flourishing island of Barbadoes . It was on the morning of the tenth that the tornado set in , and it hardly began to abate forty-eight hours after . The vessels that were moored in the port , where they considered themselves in safety , were wrenched from their anchors , launched into the open sea , and abandoned to the mercy of the tempest . Nor was the condition of the inhabitants on shore less worthy of com - passion . In the following night , the vehemence of the hurricane became yet more extreme : houses were demolished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thither , or overwhelmed by the ruins . The capital of the island was well nigh razed to a level with the ground . The mansion of the governor , the walls of which were ihree feet in thickness , was sha*en to its foundations , and every moment threatened to crumble to ruins . Thos* within had hastened to barricade the doors and windows to resist the whirlwinds ; all their efforts were of no avail . The doors were rent from their hinges , the bars and fastenings forced ; and chasms started in the very walls . The governor with his family sought refuge in the subterraneous vaults : but they were soon driven from that shelter by the torrents of water that poured like a new deluge from the sky . They issued then into the open country , and with extreme difficulty and continual perils repaired under the covert of a mound , upon which the flag-staff was erected ; but that mass being itself rocked by the excessive fury of the wind , the apprehension of being buried under the stones that were detached from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire from all habitation . Happily for them they held together ; for , without the mutual aid they lent each other , they must all inevitably have perished . After a long and toilsome march in the midst of ruins , they succeeded in gaining a battery , where they stretched themselves face downward on the ground , behind the carriages of the heaviest cannon , still a wretched and doubtful asylum , since those very carriages were continually put in motion by the impetuosity of the vortical gusts . The other houses of the city being less solid , had been prostrated before that of the governor , and their unhappy inhabitants wandered as chance directed during that merciless night , without shelter and without succor . Many perished under the ruins of their dwellings ; others were the victims of the sudden inundation ; several were suffocated in the mire . The thickness of the darkness , the lurid fire of the lightning , the continual peal of the thunder , the horrible whistling of the winds and rain , the doleful cries of the dying , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shrieks and wailings of women and children , all seemed to announce the destruction of the world . But the return of day presented to the view of the survivors a spectacle which the imagination scarcely dares to depict . This island , lately so rich , so flourishing , so covered with enchanting landscapes , appeared all of a sudden transformed into one of those polar regions where an eternal winter reigns . Not an edifice left standing ; wrecks and ruins every where ; every tree subverted ; not an animal alive ; the earth strown with their remains , intermingled with those of human beings ; the very surface of the soil appeared no longer the same . Not merely the crops that were in prospect , and those already gathered , had been devoured by the hurricane : the gar // dens , the fields , those sources of the delight and opulence of the colonists , had ceased to exist . In their p lace were found deep sand , or sterile clay ; the enclosures had disappeared ; the ditches were filled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead amounted to some thousands : thus much is known , though the precise number is not ascertained . In effect , besides those whose fallen houses became their tombs , how many were swept away by the waves of the swoln sea and by the torrents , resembling rivers , which gushed from the hills ? Much of what escaped the fury of the tempest fell a prey to the frantic violence of men . As soon as the gates of the prisons were burst , the criminals sallied forth , and joining the negroes , always prepared for nefarious deeds , they seemed to brave the wrath of heaven , and put every thing to sack and plunder . And perhaps the whites would have been all massacred , and the whole island consigned to perdition , if general Vaughan , who happened to be there at the time , had not watched over the public safety at the head of a body of regular troops . His cares were successful in saving a considerable quantity of provision , but for which resource the inhabitants would only have escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the no less horrible scourge of famine . Nor should it be passed over in silence by a sincere friend of truth and honorable deeds , that the Spanish prisoners of war , at this time considerably numerous in Barbadoes , under the conduct of Don Pedro San Jago , did every thing that could be expected of brave and generous soldiers . Far from profiting of this calamitous conjuncture to abuse their liberty , they voluntarily encountered perils of every kind to succor the unfortunate islanders , who warmly acknowledged their services . The other islands , French as well as English , were not much less devastated than Barbadoes . At Jamaica , a violent earthquake added its horrors to the rage of the tornado ; the sea rose and overflowed its bounds with such impetuosity , that the inundation extended far into the interior of the island . In consequence of the direction of the wind , the effects of the sea-flood were the most destructive in the districts of Hanover and Westmoreland . While the inhabitants of Savanna-la-Mer , a considerable village of Westmoreland , stood observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated surge broke over them , and in an instant , men , animals , habitations , every thing was carried with it into the abyss . Not a vestige remained of that unhappy town . More than three hundred persons were thus swallowed up by the waves . The most fertile fields were left overspread with a ( leep stratum of sterile sand . The most opulent families were reduced in a moment to the extreme of indigence . If the fate of those who found themselves on shore was deplorable beyond all expression , the condition ot // those who were upon the water was not less to be pitied . Some of the vessels were dashed upon shoals and breakers , others foundered in the open ocean , a few made their way good into port , but grievously battered and damaged . The tempest was not only fatal to ships under sail , it spared not even those that were at anchor in the securest havens . ' pp. 176-i 80 . But there is no more striking proof of Mr Botta 's fine taste , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his history , and the admirable simplicity with which he relates it , without weakening its effect by any attempt to point out its particular beauties , or by incumbering it with moral reflections . No ornament indeed could add to the impressive dignity of the scene . We know nothing in all history to be compared to it , and pity the man , who , with the events which led to it fresh in his memory , can read or recollect it without emotion . The army was disbanded ; but the supreme command still remained in the hands of Washington : the public mind was intent upon what he was about to do . His prudence reminded him that it was time to put a term to the desire of military glory ; his thoughts were now turned exclusively upon leaving to his country a great example of moderation . The Congress was then in session at the city of Annapolis in Maryland . Washington communicated to that body his resolution to resi*n the command , and requested to know whether it would be their pleasure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . The Congress answered that they appointed the twenty-third of December for that ceremony . When this day arrived , the hall of Congress was crowded with spectators ; the legislative and executive characters of the state , several general officers , and the consul-general of France were present . The members of Congress remained seated and covered . The spectators were standing and uncovered . The general was introduced by the secretary , and conducted to a seat near the president . After a decent interval , silence was coinmanded , and a short pause ensued . The president , general MifThin , then informed him , that the United States in Congress assembled were prepared to receive his communications . Washington rose , and with an air of inexpressible dignity , delivered the following address : " Mr President ; the great events on which my resignation depended , having at length taken place , I have now the honor of offering my sincere congratulations to Congress , and of presenting myself before them to surrender into their hands the trust committed to me , and to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Happy in the confirmation of our inde // pendence and sovereignty , and pleased with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming a respectable nation , I resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence ; a diffidence in my abilities to accomplish so arduous a task , which , however , was superseded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause , the support of the supreme power of the Union , and the patronage of heaven . The successful termination of the war has verified the most sanguine expectations ; and my gratitude for the interposition of Providence , and the assistance I have received from my countryme*n , increases with every review of the momentous contest . While I repeat my obligations to the army in general , I should do injustice to my own feelings not to acknowledge in this place , the peculiar services and distinguished merits of the gentlemen who have been attached to my person during the war . It was impossible the choice of con en ial officers to compose my family should have been more fortunate . Permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have continued in the service to the present moment , as worthy of the favorable notice and patronage of Congress . " I consider it as an indispensable duty , to close this last act of my official life by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God , and those who have the superintendence of them to his holy keeping . Having now finished the work assigned me , I retire from the great theatre of action , and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body , under whose orders I have so long acted , I here offer my commission , and take my leave of all the employments of public life .

You have conducted the great military contest with wisdom and fortitude , invariably regarding the rights of the civil power , through all disasters and changes . You have , by the love and confidence of your fellow citizens , enabled them to display their martial genius , and transmit their Came to posterity* You have persevered , until the United States , aided by a magnanimous king and nation , have been enabled , under a just Providence , to close the war in freedom , safety , and independence ; on which happy event , we sincerely join you in congratulations .

And for you , we address to him our earnest prayers that a life so beloved , may be fostered with all his care ; that your days may be happy as they have been illustrious ; and that he will finally give you that reward which this world can not give .
