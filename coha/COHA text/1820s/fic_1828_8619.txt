Oh would my arm were like mine heart . Thy foes in anguish should depart , And to the world their story tell How freemeu in their glory fell , Rather than foul oppression 's hand , Should touch their dear , their native land , Oh Poland ! dearest spot on earth , Place of the soldier 's and the statesman 's birth , When I shall cease to wish thee well . May earth in torments prove a hell . When I shall cease to curse thy foe , Or deal the death-avenging blow , May fortune , health and friends forsake , And e'en my name in horror hate .

Pon . Poniatowski  --  Grieved am I , General , that I can not say , Hope brightens on dear Poland 's way ; Our city is so wedged on every side , My troops have had a dang'rous ride : But thanks to our sabres keen and bright , And thanks to the shadows of the night , We came off safe  --  and here I stand Before the father of my land . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Thank heaven ! yet God only knows , What with rough weather and rough blows . Our wearied soldiers one by one , Seem hopeless , heartless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Is clad in deathlike woe and grief . Poni . Poniatowski  --  Cheer up , my General !

If our dear band is doomed to meet Destruction , death and fell defeat , We nobly die  --  The world must say , They trod in glory 's honored way ; They rallied round their standard-sheet , As waves round rocky bases meet . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Yes , dearest , noblest spot on earth , Land which gave me life and birth , To save thee every arm shall strive While Kosciusko breathes and lives . Our hope is leant on heaven , our friend , Our much loved country to defend , And as the patriot bends his knee , The holy seraphs hear and see , That martial warriors too are given , To cast their hopes and thoughts on heaven .

Zow . Zowbrowski  --  Zuleki  --  have you numbered well , And can you to the gen'ral tell Exactly what the train-bands be , If they resolve to die  --  or else be free . Zuleki . Zuleki  --  Last eve when midnight hour was nigh , I saw a rocket shoot on high , And as it broke , long ere its fall , An eagle well was seen by all , The arms which Poland bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called our engineer , and he Said t'was the sign of liberty ; Then to the arsenal in a trite , And forthwith to my wondering sight A rocket bro't , it shot on high , And marked an eagle in the sky . Zow . Zowbrowski  --  How ! were they friends ?  --  say men  --  Come to revive our hopes again . Zuleki . Zuleki  --  They were  --  a noble band , Scions of a well-loved land  --  They proved a troop of lancers bold , Men neither bought nor sold for gold ; One thousand in number , their sabres were bright , And shone like the gemmed-star in blackness of night . Zow . Zowbrowski  --  Thank heaven , a reinforcement brave . Our land in kindness sent to save . Zeluki . Zeluki  --  They marched in columns six feet deep , And as our cits were wrapped in sleep , An order from myself was made , That every noise should then be stayed ! So in they came , and in the west , Their wearied limbs are sunk to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor sword , nor weapon lack Zow . Zowbrowski  --  Methinks , when bold Suwarraw sees , Our troops now thick as forest trees , And knows our number now is more , By one bold thousand than before , That he some terms more manly will Give to our suffering country still . Zeluki . Zeluki  --  Well , let the bold presumptuous foe , Dare strike the ruffian 's deadly blow , He soon will find , to us is given , Comfort , and aid , and hope , from heaven . Zow . Zowbrowski  --  Come ,  --  it is time we each should go To see the troops , and each one know What our departments stand in need , For e'er to-morrow , soldiers bleed . Zeluki . Zeluki  --  Farewell ! to the General send My love  --  say , Zuleki will attend . SCENE V. Head Quarters , Field Marshal 's Tent . Kosciusko , Stanislaus , Sobieski , Poniatowski , Zuleki , Zowbrowski , and other officers seen sitting round a table , on which several maps , plans , &c.; are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our fate to try , Whether to fight , or basely fly ; You all well know our native land Is compassed by a warlike band , That they are formed by nature wild , Strangers to every thing that 's mild ; Their plan of warfare  --  take and kill , Such as might suit a savage will . Our native town is walled around With ramparts made of native ground , And , like our breasts , they nobly stand The guardian angels of our land ; A reinforcement of one thousand strong Has come to swell our little throng . Thus are we placed  --  your General wants to know Whether we strike the avenging blow , Or yield to those who come to deal Destruction to our country 's weal . Zowbrowski , thou the junior one , Begin the work that must be done ; Boldly advance what e'er you know To free your country from the foe . Zow . Zowbrowski  --  Chieftain ! my vote I boldly give , Fight while our troops do breathe or live ; My reason is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wield , Suwarrow 's wild and murderous band Will deal destruction on our land ; Our wives , our children , all will feel What ' t is to ruffian-troops to yield . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Zeluki ! next , advance and say , If you can point a better way . Zelukt . Zeluki  --  Chieftain ! like my friend , I say To fight is safety 's only way ; My reason is , like his ,  --  that we Must die , or live but to be free . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Poniatowski ! let us know What 's best to save us from the foe . Ponia . Poniatowski  --  Warrior ! like my friends before , I 'd strive till life-blood is no more ; Like them , I think the only path Of safety from the ruffian 's wrath , Is sword to sword , and man to man , To drive these villains from our land . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Sobieski ! speak and tell If these have spoke what you think well . Sob . Sobieski  --  Soldier ! they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannic sway , Which they , a rude and murderous band , Would wish to hold o'er freedom 's land ; And I approve that way , and boldly tread The road  --  e'en though it points to realms of dead . My sov'reign here has said that he Approves the motto , " Fight  --  be free "  --  And sure if we love our native land , We 'll strive to rout this ruffian band . Stan . Stanislaus  --  Yes ! Soldiers , I your prince and king , Form one in freedom 's valiant ring , And while I live , I boldly swear , Each day , each week , each coming year . While God preserves , with sword on thigh , To fight , or else to bravely die : And where breathes the wretch whose coward hand Dares not to grasp a warrior 's brand ; Where is the man who will not try To strive , to fight , or nobly die . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Warriors ! your General thanks you well , Agrees with you  --  with you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his country wave . Our force is stronger , and we 'll deal A blow to make them inward feel , That when a Freeman 's arm is raised , The God , whom nightly vigils praise , Gives it new strength , to make them know We hate the foul , offending foe . ACT II . SCENE I. Zoe and Hantona sitting in a bower of the palace garden conversing . Zoe Zoe  --  Most gracious lady ! Zoe still Will be obedient to thy will ; ' T is your command that I should tell The thoughts which make my bosom swell , I can repose the secret true , I know , my lady , well with you  --  But maiden bashfulness betrays More than my lips in language says  --  I love the guardian of our land , I love the leader of our band . Han . Hantona  --  Dear maid ! ' t is Kosciusko then , Who seems your chosen among men , From my poor breast God only knows , Did he but know your thoughts and woes , He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he Lives but to see that dear land free ; On maidens he few thoughts bestows , His all are on his country 's woes . Zoe . Zoe  --  Yes ! my lady , I must bear The passion which my heart-strings wear ; For Kosciusko is the man That Zoe wishes to bestow her hand ; But soldier like , he can not spend One hour to Zoe , comfort send . Han . Hantona  --  Maiden all your queen can do , Cheerfully shall be done for you , Kosciusko 's heart is formed of mould , Fitted to grace a soldier 's soul ;  --  But war and warlike times demands His every thought on Polish lands ; But I will seek fit time and see What Kosciusko thinks of thee . Thy youth , thy beauty and thy pelf , Make thee fit e'en for himself . Zoe . Zoe  --  Dear lady forbear ! oh should he know . Think what accumulation to my woe ; Will he not spurn the offered hand , Bold hero of our native land ? Han . Hantona  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ear , Hint thy honor , snow-white name , Match well-fitted for a soldier 's fame , Think you he will spurn thy birth , Noted by thy wealth and worth . Ah no ! you little know the flame That kindles round my soldier 's name ; One obstacle removed  --  the invading band , And Zoe takes the warrior 's hand . SCENE II . Kosciusko and Hantona , Queen of Poland , seen conversing in an apartment of the royal palace . Han . Hantona  --  Soldier ! ' t is vain for me to tell What Kosciusko knows full well , A Polish maiden , rich , of high degree , Sighs , and I fear in vain , for thee ; Her worth , her beauty , and her pelf Would make her-suit e'en envy 's self . I told her that I would betray The love which held her in its sway . Oh Kosciusko ! had you known Her then  --  and seen her color flown , Her quivering lip , and cheek of aspen hue , You would have seen the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . thy martial breast Has lulled each milder theme to rest , And never will bestow thy hand , Until you free your native land ;  --  But should your finer feelings melt , And feel for her what she has felt  --  Then Poland 's king and Poland 's queen , Tho ' poor and helpless they may seem , Will shower India 's wealth on thee , And place thee next in rank to me . Kos . Kosciusko  --  My honored sovereign ! well you know My every thought is with the foe . And ' till I see my native land Freed from rude , invading band , I never can bestow one thought On else  --  but when release is brought , I stand with boldness , and declare Zoe 's the maid I most love dear ; And tho ' my sovereign may offend , To none I other thought can send . Han . Hantona  --  Why Kosciusko , she 's the maid Whose passion I have just now said ; Her rank , her fortune , all await The man she wishes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , And never from her bower will rove . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Lady forbear ! a soldier 's mind Should be intent just now to find The road that points to honored rest , That home , whose thoughts engross his breast . When from our dear , our native lands , We drive in triumph Russian bands , Oh then purchance , in idle hour , E'en I may seek a lady 's bower . Thus much I bid thee tell , Zoe I love . I love full well ; And when our home in peace is left , Our breasts of anxious ills bereft , Tell her , the soldier then will bow , And plight with Zoe warrior 's vow . SCENE III . Zoe and Sobieskie 's wife conversing in an apartment of the Major General 's . Zoe . Zoe  --  Lady ! the queen to you has told The secret which I did unfold , And further to the soldier  --  she Declared he was beloved by me . Oh madam ! when I think of this , I bid farewell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brave , Intent his native land to save , Can on poor Zoe spend one thought , When signs of evil  --  to his country fraught With horror  --  hang around That soldier 's loved and native ground . Ah no ! and when the avowed tale , Oh sighs and woes and hapless wail , Is poured into his ear  --  he 'll shun What seemed not worthy to be won . I never loved but once , and then in vain , But Zoe ne'er will love again . Fatima . Fatima  --  Give not away to hopeless grief , I tell you that our warrior  --  chief , Loves , and loves you , all faithless one , Say not , you are not to be won . Kosciusko true , has task severe To keep him e'en from Zoe dear ; Why will you shed the silent tear , Why not from sorrow , now forbear . Zoe Zoe  --  Lady thy maxims and thy life Are fit for Sobieskie 's wife . Whatever you may counsel true , I swear to follow and to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e'en to him is Zoe dear ; But maiden modesty commands That I must wait , not sue his hand . Fatima . Fatima  --  True  --  and I promise now to you Whate'er I undertake , that will I do ; Forth to the queen , who plots with me , To give a noble friend to thee , And makes this soldier 's martial crest Find rest upon thy snowy breast . Farewell ! but hark , one word  --  This is secret e'en from my lord  --  For women alone are fit to tell The secret which with maidens dwell , Because they once have felt that fire Which burns , and burns ne'er to expire , Till fell disease destroys that breast Where hopeless passions cease to rest . Zoe . Zoe  --  Adieu ! dear lady , in heaven above Is plac 'd my trust for Zoe 's love ; Oh should the heavens auspicious be , Then hope and happiness for me . SCENE IV .

Kosciusko steps to the door , and the page and sentinel admit him . ( Kosciusko Kosciusko entering the room . ) Ladies ! a soldier begs to bow His knee , and give a soldier 's vow ; Returning from parade I came To hand in Kosciusko 's name . Han . Hantona  --  Warrior ! we give our thanks to thee , Sit down , be welcome , easy  --  free ; What news of war  --  are we to be The slaves of Russia , or else free ? Zoe . Zoe  --  Soldier ! my brave brothers dear , For whom I often drop the tear , are they in safety  --  or are they Where danger points the dreadful way . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Maiden ! a soldier 's life is made A feather , when his honor 's weighed , And , soldiers like , your kinsfolk feel Regardless like of lead and steel , When ruffian-bands presume to stand In triumph on their native land . Zoe . Zoe  --  Yes , chieftain ! I their knapsacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A soldier 's sister I forgot Awhile my maiden hapless lot . Han . Hantona  --  Wars rude alarms e'en women mould , Of martial and of warlike soul ; Oh would that being whom we love , Propitious smile from realms above , And free our dear , our native land From war , and warlike , ruffian band ; How thankful would my prayers ascend , To him , who such dear blessings send . Kos . Kosciusko  --  Yet much I fear  --  Suwarow 's band Will deal destruction on our land ; His force is treble Poland 's might , And like to the stars in the heavens at night . ' T is true a thousand warriors , young and bold , With us their banners did unfold , But e'en tho ' freemen dare to stand The guardian warriors of the land , I dread that force will bring Destruction on our land and king . But whatever valor 's self can do , Fair ladies shall be done for you . I must withdraw , my duties call Where I must turn my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thine , In yours , oh sometimes think of mine . SCENE V , Changes to the Russian Camp . Field Marshal Lieutenant General Suwarrow in Head Quarters , conversing with Ludowski , Commmandant of Artillery . Suw . Suwarro  --  Know you that when the noon-day light , Some days ago was changed to night , That some bold scouts who ventured near , Discovered what to us is dear ;  --  Returned and told one thousand men , Marched to the battlements  --  and when They entered Warsaw , save their tread , They moved like statutes of the dead . This news betokens warlike strife , How darely do they sell a freeman 's life ; To-morrow thou the artillery must drill , I think I see the signs of ill ; The foe is warlike , and the man Who leads them , fit for such a band . Where is the Adjutant General  --  where , See if his footsteps wander here ; We must be on the alert and try To make the Poles in ruins fly . Lud . Ludowski  --  Field Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcement to the foe : But never fear , they soon must yield The swords they have not strength to wield . I 'll see if the Adjutant is near , Meanwhile be not distressed or fear . ( Retires . ) Suw . Suwarro  --  Russia 's bold ensign floats on high , In triumph to the applauding sky ; My band is warlike , and their hearts Such as real valor doth impart ; But Poland 's might , tho ' small , is brave , One sentiment throughout  --  " their land to save . " Whatever can be done by men they 'll try , To reign triumphant , or as nobly die . ( Ludowski Ludowski enters )  --  Chieftain ! the Adjutant 's not here , Nor can I find him any where ; My waiter I have sent , and he Will find him . and direct to thee . Suw . Suwarro  --  Well ! well ! sit down , and now unfold The thoughts that lay in soldier 's soul . What can be done , that Russia may Triumphant march in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seige , Speak as tho ' counselling your liege . Lud . Ludowski  --  Warrior ! my mind is troubled too , I fear we know not what to do ; The opinion of the world I find Has weight upon a soldier 's mind ; The war we wage is harsh , unjust , I 'd rather much my sword would rust . Than to be drawn ' gainst honest men , I 'd rather never fight again . Suw . Suwarro  --  Why speaking as from man to man , I 'd rather mine were not in hand , For every christian scorns the deed , Where fellow-christians ' made to bleed ; And more  --  this Polish land Is guarded by a warlike band ; Their cause is righteous and I fear Their arms will make us pay most dear ; But ' t is the command of our liege lord , ' Gainst it we must not speak one word . Lud . Ludowski  --  Yes ! but by heaven above I swear , Sooner than thus my sword to wear , My bold commission I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of thine . ( Suw . Suwarro takes the commission )  --  You strike me , Sir , with much surprise , Scarce can I now believe my eyes ; What will our master say , when he Learns of this deed now done by thee ? He will not , can not think that thou Art scared  --  because thy soldier 's vow Was pledged ' gainst infidels and Turks , And there thou left thy bloody works . Lud . Ludowski  --  Yes ! tell the Emperor , that I Fear not , and care not when I die ; My hopes are laid in heaven , and when My sword is raised ' gainst Polish men , Oh may that heaven from me be shut , Nor find on earth one humble hut Farewell ! thou ever was my friend , May heaven to thee its kind aid lend ; Save when in battle ' gainst the land Of Poland  --  you head a warlike band .

The first lying on a pile of knapsacks , and the other sitting on a drum head . Pin . Pintoni  --  Know you the news ! a courier bold , These tidings to us did unfold , The other night a little band , Marched from the end of Polish land ; A thousand in number , one half said to be Well mounted on horse gallantly . Pri . Prianci  --  I did not  --  but when I went On errand to the Marshal 's tent , Without my wish the noisy tongue Of angered men in my ears rung ; I heard Suwarrow say to one  --  Poland is ruined and undone , Or hint it in plain words , and say Russia would tread in glory 's way ; Then forthwith to my wondering sight , I saw produced by candle-light , An officer 's commission , and said resign I this into those hands of thine ;  --  His back was turned to me , Which rendered it impossible his face to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know Of none who fear to meet the foe ; Suwarrow 's made of martial stuff , Courageous , bold and wondrous ruff ; The Adjutant General has been Where bloody sights were often seen , And as for he who the artillery guides , Faith , he 'd as lieve on whirlwinds ride ; You and I make up those left , And neither you nor I are of our rank bereft . Pri Prianci  --  Well ! who e'er it be I can not tell , But this I know , and know it well , That Kosciusko , though he 's brave , His native land can never save ; Our force is ten times his to one , And he is ruined and undone . As to his private fortune  --  that will be Better than when at liberty ;  --  For I have heard our Empress say Kosciusko trod in glory 's way , And so little did she wish him dead , She would not harm a hair of head ; But all she feared was his bold heart Would never with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lay dead upon his native land .

Sob . Sobieski  --  Soldier ! my voice is now to yield To Russian foes our native field ; For we have done what mortal power Could do to ward against this hour . Poni . Poniatowski  --  My voice I give , the foe has won , Our honored country is undone . The world must say , their banners wave O'er freedom 's hapless , lowly grave , But they have done what men could do  --  But when the heavens declare That freemen swords no more shall wear , We must be satisfied and yield The weapons we no more can wield .

Sobieski Sobieski and others .
