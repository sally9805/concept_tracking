txt ART . X.-T/ie Prospect before us , or Facts and Observations illustrative of the past and present Situation and future Prospects of the United States , embracing a View of the Causes of the late Bankruptcies in Boston : to which is added a Sketch of the restrictive Systems of the principal JV'ation*s of Christendom . By a Pennsylvanian . Fourth edition improved . Philadelphia , 1822 . THIs publication speaks the opinion of a school of economists , who have been active in diffusing their doctrines . Four editions of it were sold or otherwise distributed last autumn and winter , apparently with the design of aiding the attempt which was made in the last session of congress to procure a revision of the tariff , in order to the encouragement of American manufactures . The pamphlet can not be said to contain any new principle , or new argument . The topics which it treats are , on the contrary , somewhat trite ; such as the balance of trade ,  --  the drain of specie ,  --  and the futility of the *heories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we think , of facts , and as it proclaims the creed of a zealous school of economists among us , and as no pains , we understand , have been spared in circulating it , we have thought it worth while , in a brief commentary on a part of its contents , to expose what we esteem its errors . This we shall do without observing any other order of topics , than that of their occurrence in the work , and with a wish to preserve a more temperate tone than is always conspicuous in the pamphlet itself . 1 . With respect to the cause and extent of mercantile distress , our author says : - that the mercantile class is , and always has been , too numerous for the commerce of the country , is admitted on all hands ; and that the extraordinary number of bankruptcies which have taken place , not only lately , but during the whole course of the wars of the French // revolution , have arisen from the excess of their numbers , is equally clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures . Thousands of young men , who , had the cotton , woollen , iron , brass , steel1 and other manufac .. tures been properly protected , would have been devoted to them , have become merchants , and thus immoderately swelled the number of the class  --  and hence followed the ruin of so many of them . ' Now that the pursuit of commerce , like every other profitable pursuit , in every free country , has been overdone in America , is true , though by no means to a ruinous extent , upon the whole . On the contrary , the world does not furnish an example of a prosperity so great , so wide spreading , and so rapid as that , which has attended the American commerce , since the time of the French revolution . No where in the history of civilized nations has there been such an instantaneous creation of property , such a conversion of human skill and industry into value , as in the American commerce in this period . This threnody over the crowding of our commerce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reservation , that this commerce has been attended with a diffusion of prosperity , wealth , and improvement unexampled . But suppose the evil to be real , ( or as far as it is real , ) there is no propriety in ascribing it to the discouragement of manufactures . Different causes have led to the zeal with which trade has been pursued . Young men have crowded into commerce , because the rising generation in this land is ardent and enterprising ; because it is intelligent and well informed ; because it is frugal and in good credit ; because the sea , that beats our native shores , calls out the inhabitants upon it ; be .. cause the European natious , busy in the dark industry of destruction , have stood in need of our neutral flag to convey their colonial produce ; because our citizens have thus been able to turn their hardy muscles , their temperate habits , and their sagacity to a good account ; because a rapidly increasing population at home has furnished a market for a vast amount of foreign produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers fought , has left them unrestrained in the choice of their pursuits . These are some of the causes which have occasioned the press into the ranks of commerce . To nay this press is owing to the depression of manufactures1 is // purely gratuitous . Supposing it possible , that legislative pro. * visions could have made manufacturing as profitable as commercial industry , ( though some of the attractions of the latter pursuit would have been still wanting to the former , ) does our author suppose that manufactures would not have been overdone ; that there would have been no rush into that business , and none been drawn unprofitably from the plough , or the helm , to the spindle-that there would have been no bankruptcies ? Let us look at England , a country , surely , where manufactures are sufficiently encouraged . Observe the bankruptcies proclaimed in the gazettes , and see whether they are confined to merchants . We have taken up the first magazine that came to hand , and out of one hundred and forty bankruptcies in the month from November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercantile establishments , and the other sixth sevenths of every species of manufacturers . We have no doubt this proportion is constant ; and indeed who that considers the matter can doubt , that precisely the same causes which produce bankruptcy in commercial , would produce it proportionally in manufacturing pursuits ? Bankruptcies are caused by misfortune , untoward accidents of all kinds , by want of skill , want of industry , of economy , of prudence , of judgment ; by some or all of these combined . Every profitable pursuit will draw a crowd of undertakers , some of whom will be exposed to a part or the whole of these sources of failure . To ascribe the bankruptcy of merchants to their numbers merely , is to take , then , a very superficial and an incorrect view of the subject . Equally inadequate is our author 's account of the cause of the failure of many manufacturing establishments , which cause he seeks in the want of protecting duties . He tells us truly that many manufacturing establishments were broken up by the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence of the competition of foreign products . But when we look into the history of these factories , we find other causes of their destruction . Almost every newspaper a few years since , as is still the case , related the burning of some great wooden castle , under the name of a cotton factory ,  --  a vast tinder-box , miserably guarded , and situated in a village , perhaps , where nothing like a fire-engine existed . So common was this , that it was currently asserted in times of high party excitement , // that British emissaries were regularly employed to discourage our manufactures in this summary way . Again , all manufac. ' tures , to he prosecuted to great extent and with great profit , require a very complicated and perfect machinery , not to be had without a great disbursement , nor easily for that . Accordingly , the factories which were so imprudentl ) r set up at every waterfall in our country , ill provided with machinery , possessed of none of its most costly improvements , and furnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they might be able , during the total exclusion of foreign trade in time of war , or under a system of prohibitory duties , to continue in operation , must necessarily stop , under any competition . Many accordingly did stop ; and who that sees them and knows how they were furnished and how managed , but rather wonders how they got on ? Another cause of the failure of our manufactures was the want of experience . A vast accumulation of individual and traditional observation , of dexterity acquired in practice , and often of secret skill , is necessary to the successful conduct of a factory . More or less of it is necessary in every pursuit . A capitalist who knows nothing of trade , would commit a great error in buying L cargoes , chartering ships , and making voyages . We much fear , that , without any depression of manufactures , ' he would soon become bankrupt . But yet it is much easier to conduct a voyage than a factory . Good ships can be bought to your bands , cargoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to sea . But to command all the skill , ingenuity , and experience , requisite to erect and conduct a factory , is a far different affair . Hundreds were erected without a particle of either , and stand the mournful monuments of the improvidence of their undertakers . A tariff of duties , which is to secure the success of such establishments , may well be called a tariff of protecting duties . It would be a good deal cheaper for the country to let the government give these establishments , one or two hundred thousand dollars each , and beseech them not try to manufacture . The fourth great cause of the failure of manufactures is the want of capital of those who set them up . Ex nihilo nikil fit , and all the tariffs which our author praises , from that of Russia to that of Peru , would not make a manufacturing establishment profitable , were its undertakers obliged to borrow money to erect their buildings , construct // their machinery , and purchase their raw materials . Notwithstanding the low opinion which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found one sentiment in the Wealth of Nations , to which he yields assent , we pray his attention to another . Having maintained that a bank could not , consistently with its interest , advance to a trader any considerable portion of his circulating capital , Adam Smith adds , still less could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his fixed capital ; of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge , for example , employs in erecting his forge and smelting house , &amp;c . ' Now it was principally on loans of this kind , which it was neither the interest of the undertakers to solicit nor of the banks to grant , that many of the factories in this country were erected ; and the natural consequence was that bank and factory usually went over the same dam together . A generous competition existed for a while ; the factory wrought up the raw material into cotton , which the bank wrought up into bills , and a year or two put a stop to both processes . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author may exclaim hates confitentem , and tell us this want of capital is precisely the evil , and that they demand legislative provision to direct capital into the channel of manufactures . This may be done by enacting such a tariff of duties as shall make it unprofitable to employ capital in commerce , and lead its possessors either , first , to lend it to the manufacturers , or , secondly , to manufacture themselves . The first expedient we aver to be unprofitable . In any thriving state of manufacturing industry , under any tariff powerful enough to destroy importation , it would be impossible to carry on manufactures , upon a borrowed capital . No ordinary state of profits could enrich the undertaker , who should be forced to borrow his capital ; the business would fall into the hands of those who would conduct it on their own account ; the small undertakers in manufactures , like the small merchants in commerce , would bear the brunt of every fluctuation of the business ; every fall of prices would put it out of the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with individuals or banks ; and just that class of manufacturers who are now clamoring for protection , would have to clamor as loudly as ever . The second expedient is to force capitalists themselves // to embark in manufactures . Now , though this would in no degree relieve , but oppress more than ever the small under. - takers in manufactures , though there would be just as many bankruptcies on the same amount of manufacturing as there are on the present amount of commercial capital , and though any legislative provision is , indeed , merely a bounty paid the manufacturer at the expense of the consumer , yet we certainly do wish that , as fast as the country is ripe for it , capital may be employed in manufactures . Just as it will always remain our interest to import certain articles from abroad , it has become and will still more become our interest to make others at home . As fast as the American manufacturer can go on to produce the article as cheap as the foreign , so fast we would have capi* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to manufactures , and no faster . But when we go to work with these violent measures , which are to drive capital out of commercial investments and divert it into manufacturing ones , it deserves consideration that all the capital , in this country , is the growth of scarcely more than thirty yeais . Much of it is still in the hands of those , who have acquired it themselves in commercial pursuits . To engage in a system of legislation , avowedly for the purpose of driving a class of men who have grown up and grown old in commerce , into a new pursuit , is at least a very questionable policy . There is no such pressing need of hurry in the thing ; let people have a little time to breathe , and , if the business is so good as you say , depend upon it , it will he followed up . 2 . Our author next touches an old stumblinghlock , * the balance of trade . The sound doctrine is so well admitted on this subject , that it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer 's remarks , if we may venture to say so , sound like the arguments which we find against the Copernican system , in books of the early part of the seventeenth century . Our author sneers at it as a dictum of Adam Sn*iith ; but certainly there is not a respectable writer on political economy , who holds a different language , and we may challenge him to produce one , from M. Storch in Petersburg onward to the south , who does not reject the system which he maintains on this subject . Shall we continue to purchase more of foreign nations , than they are willing to purchase of us ? Shall we continue to re * See Ilume 's essay on this subject . // *eive the laces , cambrics , silks , and woollens of France at seven and a half , fifteen , and twenty-five per cent . duty , and the linens , cutlery , and woollens of Great Britain at fifteen , twenty , and twenty-five per cent. , when neither of these nations will receive in payment , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great staple of half the population of the United States ? ' But how is it possible to ask , whether we shall continue to purchase more of other nations than they purchase of us ? How can such a thing be ? A purchase is an exchange ; a quid pro quo . For every thing the British or French merchant sends us , we send him what he regards as an equivalent ; for every thing the American merchant sends to England or to France , he receives back an equivalent . Mistakes and errors of course in single cases may be made . Ships , on the outward or homeward passage , may be cast away or lost , had purchases made , and losses encountered . These , however , in a trade of a hundred millions , on each side , must balance each other , as the causes that produce them are in existence in one part of the world as well as the other , and the Arnericans* in particular , do not labor under the imputation of being the party most likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to talk of our purchasing of one nation more than that nation purchases of us . An exchange of values , considered equal , is the very definition of a purchase . But this brings us to the keystone of this system ; - if we purchase of others more than they do of us , we must pay the 6alance in specie . In this , and its supposed necessary consequences , may be traced , according to our author , the fons et origo malorum ; and the very terms of the proposition , to pay the balance in specie , ' are convertible , in his judgment , with prodigality , national extravagance , and ruin . This doctrine , though condemned by every sound writer , has been so assiduously cried up , that even judicious men have permitted themselves to be carried away with the current , and sometimes exclaim also against the drain of specie . ' Congress has once been pushed to the verge of passing a law , to prohibit the exportation of specie ; and its shipment from the country is somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were it any thing else that was sent away , it would be regarded as a proof of the demand abroad for the article ; and , placing reasonable // confidence in the skill of our merchants , we should trust them to make their own bargains , and get an equivalent for what they send* To talk of a drain of cotton , a drain of tobacco , a drain of flour , or a drain of coflee or sugar , would be of course absurd . Such a drain would he hailed by all who wished the progress of America . We should trust the shippers to get their money 's worth ; and if we saw them year after year sending out their cargoes of wheat , cotton , and tobacco , we should have little doubt that year after year an equivalent was coming back with reasonable profit . But as for the exportation of specie , it is a drain , an impoverishment , a balance against the country . The merchant doubtless gives it away to the foreigner ; he gets nothing for it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the port ; and , moreover , a certain limited quantity of it is assigned by Providence to the body politic ; to drain that , is to bleed the public to death . Now nothing surely of all this is true . There never was a merchant , unless under some particular casualty , who made a gift of a cargo of specie to his correspondent abroad . There never , excepting under accidental circumstances , was a specie dollar sent to foreign countries , for which the sender did not calculate to receive in return , what he thought more valuable than the dollar . Nor is it his own judgment that decides him here ; he exchanges his dollar for that which his neighbor , his custorners , his country will think and do think more valuable . Moreover , there is nothing peculiar in specie to make that bargain bad , of which the price is paid in silver , which would be good , if the price were paid in cotton or tobacco . Specie is procured by our traders , in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The merchant that remits specie , procures it by precisely the same process as is employed by the merchant that remits tobacco ; and he is determined by prudence which to remit . Trade , it is true , may be and often is overdone . Cotton may be exportnd to a sacrifice ; tobacco may be exported to a sacrifice ; and specie may be exported to a sacrifice ; and so may they all be exported to a profit . If ti merchant , who owed a sum of money in England , were to send a cargo of cotton to pay it , our author would credit it in the national account . The lower the price was in England , and of course the more disadvantageous the operation to the American , the more the item would figure to our credit , be // cause the more cotton would be sent . But let the merchant , binding that cotton xviii not sell to profit , prefer to send specie , which perhaps xviii , and lo , this little word has operated like a juggler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has acted prudently ,  --  specie is drained oW and the country is so much the poorer . If a merchant , owing a sum of money in England , send a cargo of flour to the Havanna , invest the proceeds profitably in sugar , order this to Russia , sell to profit , and remit favorably to London to pay his debts , this we suppose our author would allow was good business . But let the same merchant bring the price of his flour home in dollars and remit them , and though the operation may be , in proportion to its extent , as profitable , this disastrous specie comes in and makes it ruinous . Whence arises this peculiar and , we may add , calamitous property in specie ; famed as the great mediurn of trade , the great facilitator of exchanges ; but found out by these economists to ruin every exchange between nations , where it is employed ? Whence comes it into our country ? Is it not brought in the same way as tea , as sugar , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , and capital of our merchants that bring it here , as they do brandy from France , or indigo from Calcutta ? Will they ever intentionally , ever in the long run , bring more than there is a demand for ? Is the demand for specie so unlimited , that , bring as much and carry away as little as you will , the value of the article is always the same ? Will it come , when it will not yield a better profit than thing else ? Will it 0o when it will yield a better profit at any home ? and while it does stay , what mysterious value has it , that it must be kept in the country by prohibitions ,  --  that withdrawing it is to be called a drain ? It is good neither to eat , drink , nor wear . Put a dollar before the hungry man or the thirsty man , and what will he do with it ? Export it ; drain his pocket of its specie ; take his neighbor 's beef and broadcloth and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abomination ; and when he has filled his craving stomach and clothed his shivering limbs , a member of our author 's school would tell him that the balance of trade was against him ; that he had bought more of the trader , than the trader would buy of him , and that he was drained of his specie . Does the scale , on which we take the example , alter its nature ? A large majority of this people like , at the close of the day , a cup // of tea ; we like it ourselves . The gentle stimulus with which it excites the nerves , the mild companionship it seems to form of the solitary hour , the point of union which it constitutes among neighbors and friends , have elevated tea into serious importance ; and , in an age like this , when whiskey and brandy are making such inroads , any liquid that cheers but not inebriates , ' is entitled to the attention not merely of the political economist , but of the moralist and the politician . Whatever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumption . The mass of the people do say , that it soothes , cheers , and comforts them . We know that some of our manufacturers , we are sure our author will not patronise their extravagance , have also cast their eyes on the manufacture of tea ; that they talk of the poisonous weed , ' the worthless , insipid leaf , ' and would fain bring the people of these hitherto favored states , to some loathsome decoction of oak leaves or St John 's wort , which , forsooth , is as wholesome as tea . All this however is in the highest degree Hudibrastic . There is a redeeming spirit in the community that will resist the doctrine . It is in vain to commend the ingredients of the poisoned chalice to our own lips , ' filled with camomile or succory ; and the inhabitants of the United States , particularly the Yankee portion , know too well on which side their bread is buttered , to give up their coffee or their tea . They esteem them both cordials , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groweth not in the Genesee country nor yet on Sullivan 's island , but in the Celestial Empire of China ;  --  and your disciple of Confucius , being a sturdy restrictionist , will take nothing but specie in pay for his tea . The Americans , finding that specie , in its original form , can neither be eaten nor drunk , that the most you can do with it , in this case , is to melt it into a tea-pot , but that no art has ever melted it directly into tea , green or biack ,  --  having , we say , discovered these facts , have fallen into the habit of sending off some . of their dollars to the Chinese , who send them tea in return . What the Chinese do with their silver is not known . It is said that they put it in pots ( much as we do their tea , ) and bury it in the ground ; a policy which some might approve , as it must effectually prevent the specie from quitting the soil . Whatever becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to America to gather families together at the close of the day ; to awaken // the vivacity of the social party ; to stimulate the flagging ap .. petite of the invalid ; to brace the nerves of the student ; in short , to promote human happiness . An exchange has been made of so much gold and silver , which could not be consumed for the supply of one human want or the gratification of one human taste , for a healthful , cheering beverage . Every body is the better for it ; the merchant has made a good voyage , or he would not repeat it ; the consumer prefers the tea to the price he pays for it , or he would not buy it ; and more is done by the importation of it for the cause of good morals , than all that the societies for the suppression of intemperance ever accomplished . But the manufacturer tells you , how much better it would be to keep the money in the country . Why better ? And what will you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coarse cottons and even printed ones , though exceedingly useful in their way , will not serve for cordial and food , as well as clothing . To say it would be better to keep the money at home , which we send away for tea , is merely to say that America would be a more favored country , if , to its own staples , it added those of China ; and even if it did , unless we had a population so crowded , that two or three hundred children should daily be thrown into the river , it is doubtful , whether we could raise tea , cheap enough to be consumed , although it should grow on our soil , as freely as a Canada thistle . However , we grant that could tea be grown to profit in America , the country would be richer . If we united the prerogatives of all climates , we should be more prosperous than with those of one . If we could raise Champagne wine and Java coffee , and pepper , and tea , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in France and India in furnishing us these articles . But till we can raise them , the country is neither richer nor happier for keeping the money at home , and consuming succory and New England rum . We have thus spoken of the specie trade to China , because our author , though he has much to say of the drain of specie , has put a face upon the facts of the case , which we take upon us to say they do not admit . We quote a sentence , which amounts , we think , to a confession that he has not fully investigated the subject , which he treats . There is one fact connected with this subject calculated to excite surprise . Of the amount of specie exported in the two // first quarters of this year ( 1822 ) from Boston , viz. *t , 204,446 ; there is only about *6,200 stated as shipped for Great Britain , the items being as follows : Batavia *24,000 344,767 Calcutta 200,000 Dutch E. Indies 284,000 Cape de Verds 300 China 520,453 Buenos Ayres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundries 7,969 344,767 1,204,446 It is scarcely possible but that the exportation to Great Britain must have exceeded the amount stated ; and it is perfectly supposable that there must be an error in the statement . But the point must be left to the decision of the reader . ' But we must except to so compendious a way of deciding points and dealing with facts . Our author and his school first assert , that we buy of Great Britain yearly from fifteen to twenty millions ' worth snore than she buys of us , and that , to pay for this balance , the country is drained of specie . They then go to the customhouse books , to prove that the specie is exported , and finding that out of $1,200,000 , only 6,000 or **th part , goes to Great Britain , they then tells us , in the face of customhouse returns , that it is not possible more should not be sent to Great Britain , and leave the whole to the reader . But we will grant to the author , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that though this specie is not sent directly to England , it does still go , no doubt , in part to pay this aforesaid balance . It goes to China for tea , to Java for coffee , to Calcutta for indigo ; and , these being sold in Europe , and the proceeds remitted to London , thus the balance is actually liquidated by our specie , though little of it be sent directly to England . This our author does not eppear to have adverted to , or he would not have pronounced it impossible that the Boston return of specie sent to England was not erroneous , and stated that more must needs be exported ; but he would have urged it to prove that , with all its circuitous channels , our trade nevertheless was on such a footing , that we must needs pay a specie balance to the English . Though we thus put the best face on his reasoning , and save the necessity of the // unpleasant intimation , that the returns of the customhouse in this point are grossly deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hy the route , which it really takes to England , we see how unjustly our merchants are charged with pursuing a ruinous commerce with that country . The dollars shipped from America , by a judicious investment in China , and another in Europe , will perhaps have increased in value fifty per cent . by the time they are finally remitted to London , of which gain , a portion goes to pay so much more of the balance against us . ' Now this increase is a value added to American capital , by American industry , and if p*tying balances of trade , by the clear profits of our industry , be national ruin , one could never wish the country abetter fate , than to be so ruined . We are surprised that our author did not perceive what an inadequate , not to say what an incredible account he was giving of our trade . He states the excess of imports over exports for nine months of the year 1822 , to be over $17,000,000 . This he calls a balance against us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of specie exported over that imported for the twelve months ending September , 1822 , is short of $7,500,000 . Now our author must either suppose that this $ 7,500,000 pays the foreign debt of $17,000,000 , which is a pretty good business of itself , or he must suppose that a balance of $10,000,000 remains unpaid . This last he might do , were the importation of 1822 remarkably great ; but it does not seem so to have been , and , in fact , it abundantly appears from Dr Seybert 's chapter on the subject , besides that it is a matter of notoriety , that this balance has always been against us . From 1795 to 1801 , the golden age of American prosperity , there was an aggregate balance against us of ONE HUNDRED AND six MILLION 5 of dollars , making an annual average of more than $15,000,000 in the trade with Great Britain alone . From 1802 to 1804 inclusive , the annual balance of trade between the United States and Great Britain , was $17,071,253 . From 1805 up to 1811 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British produce and manufactures annually exported from Great Britain to the United States amounted to 35,441,367 dollars ; and the annual value of the domestic produce of the United States exported to Great Britain , calculated on the same average , // amounted annually to 9,124,941 dollars , leaving an annual balance of 26,316,426 dollars in favor of Great Britain. ** Since the termination of the war , this balance certainly has not been less . If our author chooses to say that this balance is paid in specie , it is very clear that it can only be by a great annual importation of that article , or a transfer of it to London , from other foreign ports . How then can this be called a drain of our specie , when it is the reexportation of an article im- ported only for the purpose of being thus reexported . So fixed is the author in the idea that it is all sent out of the country , that he calls in question the accuracy of the customhouse returns ; and he not only chooses to maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the country is drained of its circulat-. ing medium to pay it : without being moved by the enormous improbability , that the circulating coin of this country , should from 1795 up to 1801 , a period of seven years , have paid over 106,000,000 of dollars , from 1802 to 1805 , 51,0Q0,000 , and again from 1805 to 1811 , a sum of 164,000,000 millions , a quantity of silver , not much less probably than the Mexican mines yielded in the same period . The only way by which our author avoids this difficulty , is to intimate that we annually become indebted to a vast amount to the English nation . As it is not probable that the annual average of the specie export-. ed from the country exceeds $5,000,000 , and as the annual balance of trade against us since 1795 , may be safely assumed at $20,000,000 , we should be thus made to incur an annual debt of $15,000,000 , which , without reckoning interest , would amount , from 1795 to the present time , to two hundred and seventy millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which our author maintains that the balance of trade is paid by us to England . Either we have paid in silver since 1795 , $360,000,000 , or we are indebted to the Eng'ish $270,000,000 . Either conclusion seems to us a reductio ad absurdum . These absurdities may be avoided by two possibilities , either of which is fatal to our author 's supposition . One , and the true one , is that there is no balance against us , as will be presently explained ;  --  the other , that if there be a balance which we must needs pay in specie , the specie must be imported as merchandise for this very purpose . To deny to merchants the right of exporting it , would be merely to cause , Seybert 's Stati*ticm , p. *S7 , 288. // remittances to be more directly made to England from foreign ports where our merchants collect specie , and no more of it would come to this country . We say no more , meaning no more of all that had been imported for re-exportation . Our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would have it believed that , when dollars are sent out of the country , the circulating medium is reduced . The error of these antiquated views has been so often exposed , that it may seem superfluous to enlarge on them . Silver performs in society two functions , which are as unlike as the ordinary uses of a bank note and a bale of cotton . A portion of specie , a very small portion , acts an important part in society as a medium of exchange . The nature of the subject does not enable us to calculate with precision what proportion of coin is required to circulate any given amount of property , but it is certainly very small . Millions are bought and sol*l in the market without the intervention of a dollar , and the larger the scale and the more extended the mart , the less occasion there is for this medium of circulation . It is impossible to ascertain the exact percentage , which the amommt of the circulating medium bears to the amount of the property which it circulates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population , the nature of its trade , and various local circumstances . Still , considering the innumerable channels of supply for whatever is in demand , and the instantaneous rise of prices when money abounds , and their depression when it is scarce , it does not seem possible that in any way-not even of legislative interference  --  the circulating medium can be diminished beyond what the business of the community demands . Diminishing its quantity will only increase its value for the moment , and occasion an influx . Increase its quantity , and its value will fall , and it will be exported . Wholly remove it in the shape of coin , and a substitute will be found . Mr Ricardo has abundantly proved , that specie is not necessary to circulate value . Why should it be ? Nothing in the last analysis is necessary , but that which is itself to be consumed for the gratification of a want ; and unless silver plate be called a necessary , there is no form under which silver can be so regarded ; for in plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that of circulation particularly , silver is convenient and safe , but by no // means essential . Who sees a silver dollar , nowadays ? who wishes to see one ? And if it were not more economical to use silver change , than to encounter the risk of loss and the expense of the engraving of bills , we should make no use whatever of silver , as a part of the circulating medium . In this respect highly advanced societies return to the practice of highly barbarous ones . The latter make no use of coin , but exchange produce against produce ; and highly advanced societies , where property is protected by law , are content with much less cumbrous evidences of possession than silver . A little reflection , indeed , must show that the consequences of a drain , even of the circulating medium , were such a thing possible , which we are strongly disposed to doubt , though certainly an evil , could be productive of no extreme consequences . The amount of the circulating medium , as we have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to annihilate it , therefore , would , for the moment , be the annihilation of a small part of the national capital , of that part precisely which it is most easy to replace . Secondly , though the specie be exported , it is not thereby annihilated , but an equivalent in another form returns ; and it is idle to talk of the country 's being ruined , because a small part of its property has assumed a new form . Thirdly , all the essential elements of national wealth would remain  --  the fixed capital of the country- its territory-its population  --  and their industry and skill ; and nothing , that does not destroy these , can deeply injure us . But we maintain that the drain of specie does not and can not extend , beyond the moment , to the circu* lating tnedium . It must , from absolute necessity , be confined in a great measure to that other part of the gold and silver , which comes into the country by way of trade , and goes out in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus go out , will most assuredly not come in . That the specie exported must be confined to this part of the gold and silver coin is plain , because the moment it extends to the other portion , the real circulating medium , the price will begin to rise with a rapidity that will check the purchase of it , and produce an influx of more . The true circulating medium can never be exported , because it is the circulating medium . It is diffused throughout the community ,  --  every man has a portion of it ,  --  it exists no where in commercial masses , the brokers can not collect it iu // to such masses , because it would rise upon them too rapidly in the act of purchasing it . It is true a great temporary demand for specie , as for any other goods , may exist , and a scarcity of it ensue . The injurious consequences to individuals are , not that money enough does not remain to circulate the values in the community , for this , in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the price of money being raised , by the extraordinary consumption , those who have debts to pay at a certain period , that is , those who have contracted to deliver , sixty days hence , a certain quantity of money , are exposed to a loss ; and failures may be the consequence . But is there any thing peculiar in this ? Does this prove a deficiency in the circulating medium ; and one that requires violent legislative interference ,  --  duties on imports , bounties on manufactures , and a comprehensive change of our whole policy ? How does the embarrassment just mentio*ned differ from any other , arising in trade from an unexpected state of the market ? A merchant contracts to deliver flour at a fixed price , on a certain day ; the crops fail  --  the grasshoppers , miature 's active little brokers , consume all the ready standing corn ; autumn refuses to make her usual discounts ; and behold , our merchant , who depended on getting his usual accommodation from the great land bank of the soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in sixty days , and depends upon the high price of coffee , of which he has a cargo homeward bound , which he expects to sell to great profit , and with it pay his debt ; his vessel has a long passage , others arrive , the markets are glutted , his coffee is sacrificed , and he is ruined . Is there any thing in these cases , essentially different from the other , in which the contract is made for money ; or rather is it not in this torm chiefly that money contracts are discharged ? And is government to interpose , with its sovereign power , and ma&amp;e and alter tariffs , and turn industry out of its chosen and long accustomed channels , because improvident speculations have been attempted , and engagements entered into , of which the fulfilment has proved ruinous ? 3 . But our author has much to say on this last point , and has even brought the bankruptcies in Boston the last summer into his title page , with a promise of presenting a view of their causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain of specie , the // causa causarum of all inauspicious effects . It is true , that failures to the number of ninety or more took place , though not of a magnitude to entitle them to so conspicuous a notice as the author has given them , and not among those on whom this unfavorable balance fell , that is , the importing rnerchants , but among a totally different class of traders . This fact , like the one alluded to above , our author meets in the same ingenious way , viz. he calls it in doubt , or leaves it undecided . We quote his words : The other assertion , ' says he , is , that not above two or three persons extensively engaged in the importation of dry goods were among those reduced to bankruptcy . The object of this assertion is , to induce the world to believe that there was no connexion between the importation and the distress and ruin that occurred in Boston . If the assertion be true , which I can neither assent to nor deny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directly the reverse of the inference . The failures took place in consequence of the pressure on the banks produced by the drain of specie , and the drain of specie arose from excessive importation , although the importers may have escaped the general calamity . It is impossible , I repeat , to form any precise idea how far the calamity , which has visited Boston , extends . But it behoves every man in business to be wary , and to guard against entering into any engagements which he can avoid . ' We must needs pronounce this a lame and impotent conclusion . What ! is this the moral of the solemn elegy over our ruined commerce ! This the lesson to be derived from the calamity , ' the ruin , ' the tornado , ' which has visited Boston ! Nothing but to guard against entering into engagements he can avoid . ' But these reflections are aside . We meant only to examine how our author replies to the assertion , that the failures in Boston , in scarce one instance , fell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the question ; he says , the object of this assertion is to make the world believe that there was no connexion between importation and the distress and ruin which occurred in Boston . ' We know not with whom our author may confer on these points , but we protest against having any such object attributed to the mass of those who make this assertion . They maintain that it is not to the drain of specie , as a part of the circulating medium , that the failures are owing . We all know that business was overdone , and too many goods imported , and where // this is the case , a loss must b@ incurred , to the extent of the excess of the supply over the demand . This loss will fall somewhere . On whom it falls , will depend upon the stage of the business , in which the reaction begins , if it falls early , it will be on the importer , who can not sell his goods to the home trader to profit ; if at a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not get them off his hands in season to fulfil his engagements with the importer . But this is a very different thing from a deficiency in the circulating medium . There is money enough , but too many goods . Men have made bad speculations , and the remedy is not to prohibit the exportation of specie , still less to tax foreign merchandise up to prohibition , but simply , as plain , unsophisticated sense seems to have whispered to our author , to be prudent , and guard against entering into engagements . ' The circumstances , which , we assure our author , are justly stated , that the failures were confined to those traders , who stand between the importer and the consumer , and that the importers escaped the general calamity , ' ( a singular general calamity produced by an excess of importation , but which the importers escaped , ) are decisive of the real causes of the failures . In the first place , we say it was not a drain of specie that produced the distress , for in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven thousand dollars were exported to England . The failures took place chiefly in May and June , and it is wholly impossible , if the cause of the failures were a drain of specie to pay for the excessive mportations of British manufactures , that only seven thousand dollars of this specie should have gone to England . The specie that was exported went chiefly to India and China . Should our author make use of the hint we gave him , and say that the distress was produced by the high price of bills of exchange on London drawn on the strength of the cargoes , which the aforesaid specie would purchase in the east , and of which the avails would be remitted to London , we deny this statement ; for it is certainly absurd that bills should be sold on London in May , 1822 , to take advantage of remittances to grow out of exportations of specie to India , made at the same time from America . The bills for these remittances have not yet come into the market . Therefore the distress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie . None of the specie ( *xcept a mere fraction ) was drained in the branch // of trade that suffered . We go farther , and say there was no drain at all . There was not an excessive exportation of silver from Boston , while the failures took place . in the first six months of 1822 , in which the failures , we believe , exclusively occurred , there was shipped from Boston the sum of $1,204,446 , of which $1,069,453 went beyond the Cape of Good Hope . In the banks of Boston , there were , in the beginning of the year , $936,427 , and on the 22d of June $406,275 . Thus , though $1,204,446 had been exported , $530,152 only had been drawn from the banks , and supposing the banks to have curtailed their discounts to this amount , does our author suppose that a reduction of discounts , to the amount of five hundred thousand dollars , in six months , was the cause of the failures of nine-three traders to the amount , as he states , of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at least , to settle the question . Our author aflirins that the failures in Boston took place in consequence of the diminution of the circulating medium , produced by the drain of specie . Now it needs not be said that specie , as such , forms no part of the circulating medium among us , except as change of a dollar . The only way in which specie can be said to form a part of this circulating medium , is in holds a certain quantity of specie fast in the vaults of the banks , as a hostage for the redemption of the bills . It is these bills which constitute the circulating medium . Now it appears from comparing the reports of the Boston banks for January and July , 1822 , that though the quantity of specie in their possession had fallen from $936,427 to $406,275 , yet that in the same period , the period of greatest distress , the period in which , to use our author 's glowing language , the tornado burst on our devoted city , ' the notes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to $1,215,011 , a difference of $16,370 . This is the effect , on the circulating medium of the town , of the great exportation of specie , and a reduction of sixteen thousand dollars has produced failures to the amount of four millions ! It is true , that , in the period above named , the deposits at the Boston banks were considerably diminished , and the discounts of the banks reduced in consequence from . $9,867,498 // to $9,059,593 . This reduction produced , for a very short period , a comparative scarcity of money , and increased the difficulty of obtaining loans on doubtful credit . As this scarcity of money , moreover , must have had the effect of the scarcity of any other commodity in demand , it is obvious that even persons in good credit must have found it difficult to get accommodation at the banks , which could not have money to loan when worth more than its legal interest . But no such distress and embarrassment , as our author would maintain , occurred . There was no actual deficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be borrowed so readily as three months earlier or three months later , but it could be borrowed still on good credit ; and it could be obtained during the whole period thought so disastrous for merchandise of any kind , without any material sacrifice . We assert , on the authority of the most respectable merchants , that prices were not materially depressed ; that sales for cash might have been effected without any great sacrifice ; that loans to a large amount were obtained at legal interest ; and might have been obtained to any desirable amount , by any one who had security to offer , for a premium of one or two per cent . during the whole period of the greatest scarcity . The very facts in which the evil is said to have its origin , prove that it could not have existed . One of the largest shipments of specie made during the year , amounting to $400,000 , was made at the time of the greatest scarcity ; and yet our author would have us believe that money could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these premises , that the failures were the consequence , not of a want of circulating medium , but of a want of property to command it on the part of those who failed . They failed , in other words , because they were actually insolvent , and not , as the writer xvould have us believe , because they were embarrassed for the moment . We have the best authority for saying , that , except in a few of the instances and those of no great magnitude , all the individuals , whose names go to swell the alarming list , were completely insolvent , independently of any embarrassment produced by the scarcity of money . It is of course impossible to account for all these failures , without entering into the history of every single case . They // arose from a variety of causes . A general cause was overtrading . The market was filled to repletion , the profits on some branches of trade became exceedingly small , on others there was an actual loss . Those , of course , who traded on borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were ruined . Misfortune and accidental losses in some , improvidence and want of foresight in others , contributed to the same effect ; and all the causes enumerated above , to which failures in commerce may be attributed , had a share in producing those which took place in Boston the last summer . It should be remembered that very few failures had happened among the merchants of Boston for many years . The great facility of oh-. taming money , in consequence of the abundance of capital which sought an investment , even at a low rate of interest , where the credit was good , enabled those on the verge of bankruptcy , to postpone the day of failure , which , but for these circumstances , would have arrived long before . Thus nearly all the bankruptcies of several years were crowded into the space of a few weeks ; and their occurrence within that period no more proves a disastrous and ruinous scarcity of money at that time , than their not occurring in the former period proves a stagnation of business , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcies were not occasioned , though the time of the failures may have been determined , by the exportation of specie and the temporary scarcity of money ; for the individuals who failed were for the most part insolvent before the scarcity occurred , and the specie would not , of course , have been exported had it been actually wanted for the purposes of a circulating medium here , in paying the debts of those who had merchandise , stocks , real estate , or other property , to aive in exchange for it . We could not have believed that four editions of a book could have been published to prove , by the ninety failures in Boston , that the distress arose there from the exportation of specie to pay for the ruinous excess of European imports , with these three facts before the world ; first , that only seven thousand dollars were sent to England from Boston ; secondly , that the circulating medium was diminished only sixteen thousand dollars ; thirdly , that out of the ninety-three failures , scarce one was of an importer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the debts of the // United States to foreign cou*ztries , stated by our author to amount to about $60,000,000 , as appears from the following table : Government stock held by foreigners ( Sept. 1822. ) *27,856 , l52 Stock of the United States ' bank , do . ( Oct. 1822. ) 3,189,400 *31 , 045,552 These alone can be stated with precision . It now remains to estimate the other items of debt . I. Commercial debt standing previous to the present year , supposed , *15,000,000 2 . Actual difference between imports and exports of nine months for eight ports ( for 1822. ) 17,000,000 3 . Supposed difference of the remain ing ports and fourth quarter 3,000,000 4 . Stocks of individual states 2,000,000 5 . Stocks of state banks , insurance companies , &amp;c. 3,000,000 6 . Supposed loss on cotton , flour , &amp;c. 3,000,000 43*000,000 74,045,552 Deduction of losses by foreigners on consignments sacrificed at auction , &amp;c. 5,000,000 *69,045,552 This may be a few millions erroneous , but it is as likely to be above as below reality . ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that in the items 2 , 3 , 4 , there is probably an overstatement of 3 or 4,000,000 of dollars . Our author plays with his millions ; and whether out of a sum of 22,000,000 he is three or four millions out of the way , that is , a fifth or a seventh of the sum , seems to him a matter of indifference . The truth is , the amounts are imaginary . Our author might as well have put the debt of our merchants before the last year at $45,000,000 as at 15,000,000 . His system would make it as we have seen above , amount to $270,000,000 . In the three next items of // collectors , an overstatement of 3 or 4,000,000$ is confessed ; and why not say I or 8 ? In this guess work of millions , why be so parsimonious ? The amount of the excess of the specie exported over that imported is ascertained by our author from information furnished chiefly through the politeness of the secretary of the treasury , and completed by the kindness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , and Baltimore . ' This amount is stated , on page 24 , to be $8,661,109 . Here , however , notwithstanding the politeness of one secretary , and the kindness of five collectors , our author informs us in his errata , that there is an overstatement of $1,226,375 , nearly a seventh of the whole . How the error arose , or where it resides , he has not told us . The figures which he gives us are rightly cast . He tells us , that these errors do not materially affect the general conclusions , drawn from the table to which they beloi*g . ' But how can it be said that an error of $1,226,375 does not affect the conclusions to be drawn from an amount of $8,661,109 . As the excess of the amount of specie exported over that imported , which in the errata is stated to be $7,434,634 , is to be deducted in this account of the debts of the country , and as our author acknowledges an exaggeration of 3 or 4 millions on some other items , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . Five millions he deducts himself for the losses of the foreign exporter on the consignment of goods sacrificed at auction . Thus we have 16,000,000 to deduct from 43,000,000 , reducing the commercial balance to 27,000,000 , by our author 's own data . But we have more serious exceptions to take to this statement , than that of exaggeration in the amount . It is delusive in its nature . it is formed , we will not by any means say on principles , which the author knows to be false , for , though he is pretty free in his use of this uncourteous language , we do not wish to follow him in it . But it is founded on principles , which all who have within fifty years written on these subjects have proved to be erroneous , and which we think can be made to appear so to a common understanding . Our author states the excess over importation , in the three first quarters of the year 1822 , at $17,000,000 . This excess is of course obtained from the customhouse returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invoice price of our imports . // But it is plain that this is delusive in many ways . Our foreign trade is the exchange abroad of our exports against the articles we import . We pay for the latter with our exports , not at the price at which these are here estimated , but at that which they will bear abroad . This must be greater than the price at home , by the fair profit on the capital employed in the trade ; and of course a part of the return cargoes of the imports , is that profit . Our readers already perceive that our author 's $17,000,000 excess of imports over exports , must undergo the great reduction of at least interest on the capital vested in those exports , which can not be less than several millions of dollars . But a much more important reduction still remains* The excess of our imports is to pay not only the difference of the foreign and domestic price of our exports , that is , the immediate profit on the sale of the articles exported ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense tonnage in repair , to pay the wages of the shipxvrights , chandlers , riggers , and the thousand other mechanics , employed in the construction of our shipping ; and it is to pay the seamen 's wages , which form the maintenance of the wives and children of seamen . All these prodigious charges are to be deducted from the excess of our imports over our exports . If the merchant brought back a value no greater than he sent out , he would of course not only not be richer , but much poorer than he was before making the voyage . He would not only make no profit , but he would lose the interest of his capital , the wages of all those whom he employs , and the deterioration of his stock . These , however , in a good business must all be paid . And of course they must be paid by bringing back more than he carried out ; - by the excess of imports over exports . All these great sums are accordingly covered by that excess , which our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very profit of the enterprise . The excess which is so pertinaciously said to be liquidated by an exportation of specie , is the reward of thrift , the enhancement of the exports in a foreign market , and the value added to them by the industry and skill of our citizens . And these are the precious doctrines of our author and his school ! An cxeess of value imported , brought home , which has built up our American navigation and with it our American navy ; which has reared Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore , from inconsiderable ports to great capitals ; and which has // spread comfort , prosperity , and wealth through all the channels of the country , is called ruinous . But we have a few more remarks to make on this point . The customhouse balance thus applied is still more deceptive than this . A very extensive part of our industry is in the freighting business .. The outfits of the vessels that proceed from the northern parts to the south are small , their freights are ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and either come home in the shape of imports , or pay by bills of exchange for imports . The whole amount of the latter accordingly goes to swell the article of imports , and nothing offsets it in the export account . Thus all the industry , skill , and capital of the whole freighting business of the United States , go for nothing , absolutely nothing , with these warm friends of national industry . To make this matter plain to every capacity , we shall borrow a few words from the intelligent editor of the Portsmouth Journal . The great fallacy of arguments drawn from the custom returns will be apparent from considering only one branch of the trade of this town , namely , the freighting business . In the course of the last year we have had 27 ships and 12 brigs employed in this trade , several of which have made two voyages . It will , therefore be perfectly within the truth to make a calculation of forty voyages to the year . These vessels generally took with them hay and lumber sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say *100 each or *40,000 the year . They receive upon an average ? 1000 each in Europe , or *177,600 . Deducting from this sum their port charges in Europe , they brought home in salt and iron , or left behind to 1 ) e brought home by others , *l50,000 . The whole of this sum appears on the books of the customhouse- as imports , without one cent of exports to balance it . ' This is an example on a small scale . Mr. Seybert tells us , on the large scale , that the American tonnage employed in the foreign trade from 1795 to 1801 , both years included , amounted in the aggregate to 4,544,314 tons , or 649,187 tons per annum . The profits on it , if calculated at the rate of $50 per ton , for the average annual value of freight out and home on voyages of every description , must have produced for the freight alone 32,459,350 dollars per annum . The estimate for the gain of freight is a moderate allowance ; intelligent merchants have calculated it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . ' * * Seybert 's Statistics , p. 281. // There is an example which still more strikingly shows the absurdity of these balances . A well known establishment , in the state of Maine , exports annually a quantity of ice , which in our northern latitudes is produced exceedingly cheap , for which it receives in return colonial produce , it has been said , to the amount of $100,000 . But this beautiful creation of value goes for nothing in our author 's view . For nothing , did we say ? it is a balance of $100,000 against us . In short , there are some things so plain , that , however pledged or tempted to deny them , one feels awkwardly when challenged directly to the point . We would therefore ask our author , how he thinks the great accession of wealth in the country has arisen ? The houses in our cities  --  the ships in our ports  --  the expenses of our government-have surely cost something . The balance of trade has always been against us according to his notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how , in a trade ruin .. ous from the beginning , so much property has been created , distributed , consumed , or accumulated ? Let him not say that we are now living from the profits of better times . We think he can not point out more than one year , since America was a nation , when this balance has not been vastly against us according to his explanation . We shall not wholly dismiss his account of the debts of America to foreign nations , without remarking on one other item , which amounts to thirty-one millions or a half of his whole sum of sixty millions . Nearly all of it is public stock owned by foreigners , and for which of course interest is paid . The stock has been created at different periods in our country 's history , but principally to pay the expenses of the revolutionary and the late war . As our author considers the late war to have had a very happy effect on the industry of the country , he can not quarrel with the objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must allow that these thirty millions , which we owe to foreigners , were borrowed for great national ends . This consideration is enough to show how ungracious it is to throw this sum in , to swell the amount of the debts of the country , and to add it up into one mass with the balance of trade . But this is not all . This large sum is really a loan of so much capital to the United States . Having been raised for the purposes of war , its value was of course consumed in the service of our country ; and the $30,000,000 owned abroad accordingly stand in the place of and represent that amount of domestic capi // tal , which must otherwise have been destroyed without reproduction . Is it then to the disadvantage of the country that so large a portion of the funds requisite for its wars have been furnished by foreigners ? On the contrary , is it not an addition to its resources ? Besides , what has this to do with the question of excess of importation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to do by introducing it , that , because stocks are sometimes sent to Europe as remittances , therefore the debt was created for that object ? The merchant A , who sends stock to London to pay for goods , buys it first of B at home ; henceforward B will pos*ess the value given him by A for the stock , and all the profits upon that value . The interest of the stock is paid , it is true , to the foreign stockholders , but it is not therefore sent out of the country ; for B , who sold the stock to A , is receiving interest on the purchase money ; and the foreign stockholder receives , not an interest drawn from our country , but the profit on the foreign goods , in payment of which he received the stock . In short , in every case , the foreign creditor of government sent a value , at some time or other , to America , which was regarded as an equivalent by America ; and , while we pay the foreign stockholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have our profit on that equivalent which was given us for the stock ; so that it is wholly immaterial , whether our stocks be held abroad or at home . If held abroad , the interest goes ; but the profit on the value paid for them stays . Or if the value of the loans , on which the public debt is founded , be regarded as wholly consumed and destroyed , then the thirty millions owned abroad saved the destruction of that amount of domestic capital . The interest of $30,000,000 goes abroad ; but the profit of the $30,000,000 , for which this was substituted remains at home . Stock held by foreigners stands on precisely the same footing as stock held at home . in pursuing the subject in his secoRd chapter , our author treats of the high rate of bills of exchange , and regards it as another evidence that the balance of trade was totally against us . He makes no allusion to the fact , that when exchange was here at a premium of ten per cent. , dollars in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper than silver. * That it must have been so , one would have * See this suh*ject very ably stated the last winter in an essay in the Ports mouth Journal . // thought , must have struck him ; from the fact so often alluded to , that no specie was sent to England . Nor does he give any credit for the effect of this same high rate of exchange on the sales of all American produce in England ; whereas it is plain , that for exchange to be at 10 per cent . premium , is equivalent to an advance of 10 per cent . on the price of our exports in the foreign market . In fact the dark side only of every thing presents itself to his mind , and the terms of extravagance , with which that is exaggerated , are sometimes amusing . Thus , in speaking of the ill concerted speculations , in the stock of the bank of the United States , which took place last summer , he maintains that the fall of that stock from I 09* to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction almost without a precedent , except in the case of the Mississippi and South sea schemes . ' Now , without observing that in ten days more the stock had risen again to 102 , we would only expose this exaggerated comparison of a change in the price of an article of 11 per cent . in five days , to the South sea scheme . Scarce an article of extensive consumption , but varies as much , and often in consequence of the arrival of one vessel . For stock of the United States ' bank to sink in five days from 109 to 98 , is for floi.ir to sink from 6 dollars to 5,34 cents ; or coffee from thirty cents to 26*. : a considerable reduction certainly , but as much like the South sea scheme , as a cup of coffee is like the South sea . Having in the first part of his work set forth the evils of the country , viz , excessive importation , drain of specie , stagnation of industry  --  and impending ruin , he proposes his remedy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of duties on importations . This topic is so ably treated by all the writers on political economy , particularly by Say , that we forbear to ' engage in its discussion . We would only repeat a remark which we have already made , that whereas our author , by his too often repeated sneer at Smith , affects to ascribe to him alone the doctrines which he is combating , there is nevertheless not an author of repute , who does not follow Smith on this subject . 5 . Our author urges upon us the encouragement of domestic manufactures , by the example of the prohibitory tariffs of almost all the nations of Europe , and , as a strong additional inducement , tells us that Russia has changed her system three // times in six years , laying heavy duties in 1816 , whereupon her manufacturers grew rich ; repealing them in 1818 , whereupon they were ruined ; and reenacting them in 1822 , on the strength of which they ivill doubtless flourish again . And these are the examples for us to follow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst permanent policy ! It is no small argument for those , who oppose the scheme of violent congressional interference to direct the inhabitants of the country how they shall employ their capital and their industry , that from the nature of the case , and particularly in a government like ours , where political parties are liable to continual variation , the most ruinous caprice may be brought into action from session to session of congress , and the most important investments and extensive enterprises have no other security , than that a majority in congress may continue of one mind . To the prosperity of the manufacturing interests of our country we are most hearty weliwishers . America has reached a point , where they ought , and where they will be cultivated , nay , where they are cultivated in full proportion to any other branch of industry . We simply protest against the destruction of our commerce , and the imposition on the whole community of heavy taxes , first in the shape of higher prices , and then in the necessity of an excise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premature ripeness . The very reason , the only reason , which leads foreign nations to forbid the imnportation of articles of external manufacture should decide us to continue in our policy of admitting them . In all the states of Europe , exceedingly artificial and complicated systems of mutual prohibition have grown up from various causes ; such as national rivalry , financial necessities , the colonial system , and theories once believed sound , but now , as theories , universally exploded . These systems of long standing could not be overthrown , without vast sacrifices of fixed capital , which no goveminent would dare , which none perhaps would be justified in attempting . Adam Smith , notwithstanding all that has been said against him , no where recommends the general and speedy introduction of the system , which he has unanswerably defended ; but , on the contrary , has repeatedly urged that all changes should be exceedingly slow and gradual . On this ground alone the restrictive and prohibitory systems are justified ; on this ground they are justifiable in old countries , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the- only question is , what potent drug , what political eau midicinale , will lo#igest sustain the frame without producing a worse palsy than it is meant to avert . In our country , besides all the considerations in favor of the liberty of employing one 's capital and industry to one 's mind , is that very additional argument , by which the opposite system is defended in Europe . A considerable proportion of the capital of the country is commercial . Acquired in commerce , it has been continued in the same pursuit . A tonnage valued at $70,000,000 , the real estate in the seaports , which we will not undertake to put into figures , the industry of those who have been brought up to trades connected with commerce ; all these united seem really to present to us a mass of interests something too important to be sacrificed by an act of congress . To talk of encouraging manufactures by protecting duties ' is an absurdity in language , with respect to manufactures which do not yet exist in the country , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the late war . The exi4ing interest needs protection ; and we repeat , that precisely those arguments used abroad to defend their restrict ' . lye systems , may be forcibly employed here against the prostration of our commerce . To make this more clear , we will suppose that , by some peculiarity of things , America had , from the first , grown up a manufacturing people ; that we really fabricated a great portion of what we consume ; that these man ufactures had resulted in an unexampled prosperity  --  a doubling of our numbers in a ratio that amazes the world , a growth in wealth , improvement at home , respectability abroad of the most extraordinary kind ; and all this without great protection on the part of government , but by the mere facilities of our soil , and industry of our citizens . Suppose that , while things were in this state , the inhabitants of the seaboard should demand heavy duties to be laid on every article manufactured at home , for the sake of producing a demand for foreign merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of digging away sand bars , erecting lighthouses , and in every other way removing th' obstacles to navigation . Can imagination do justice to the clamor and trouble it would excite ? Would the government , that broached such a policy , ever convene again in Washington ? And yet this is fairly the case with the pretensions of on author and hi* school . // Our limits do not permit us to go into the main argument of the comparative productiveness of manufacturing and commercial industry , but we can not but correct one false impression of very general prevalence . It is said , that , by importing an article of consumption , we pay to foreign workmen and capitalists the profits on its production , whereas , if it be manufactured at home , we pay our own capital and workmen ; and that therefore in the former case the industry of foreign nations is encouraged and the wealth of foreign nations increased , and in the latter , our own . If we mistake not , there is a fallacy in this reasoning , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it is felt and condemned under many other forms . It arises from confounding the two kinds of production , that of the foreign artist , who fabricates the article , and that of the merchant who brings it home . As far as the interests of America are affected , the American merchant is the producer of what he imports . Instead of building a factory , he builds a ship ; and invests his capital , not in spindles and looms , but in an outward cargo . On his return he brings the article wanted into the market , by a process which , in its effect on the national wealth , is precisely similar to that of the domestic manufacturer . Suppose that British dry goods , instead of being costly articles in England , were productions spontaneously accumulated on a desert coast , and that the merchant was obliged merely to go and gather them up ; but that the length and danger of the voyage made the goods on their arrival as dear as they now are , in the existing state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole producer , and the only question important to the nation would be , whether the goods were worth the expense of the expedition . This is no fictitious case ; the whale fishery corresponds with it identically ; and supposing the price to be the same , it would be indifferent , as a question of national wealth , whether we bought the oil of the British , or dragged it from the deep . When the merchant therefore brings an article of English goods into the market , he has converted his capital , skill , and industry into an useful object of consumption . He , his shipmaster , ship-builder , rigger , rope-maker , duck-weaver , crew , with all their wives and children , produce and manufacture the article quoad nor , and the consumer pays for it . The price that he pays is the full price of its production to the merchant , // ship-master , &amp;c . If the domestic manufacturer produces it , the consumer pays the price to the proprietor of the factory , to the machinist , the weavers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a price paid to American capital , industry , and skill ; and even our author would probably allow that , of the two American manufacturers , we have a right to employ the cheapest and the best . But it may be asked , if it is not the American merchant who pays the foreign manufacturer , who does pay him ? He is surely paid by some one , and that to profit . To this we answer , that he pays himself , as every person in prosperous business must . Profitable trade supposes that both parties gain ; that is , that both parties get a profit on their capital , and wages for their industry . And both are enabled so to do , because a new value is produced . By this new value the producer is paid ; if he consumes it himself , he is paid in his preserved life , continued health , and increased pleasure . If lie produce more than he consume , he exchanges the surplus for something else , which he can consume , either unproductively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . In either case be pays himself . Two traders are enabled thus to pay each himself and yet not injure the other 's bargain , by the circumstance that their goods severally have acquired an additional value , by coming to a market , and being converted from a surplus into an article of demand . It is mutually profitable to them to exchange ; each has gained value by the barter . There is therefore no more propriety in saying that iN the importation of British goods we pay British industry , and employ British capital , than that the British employ American capital , and pay American labor . It is clear that the goods represent an equal amount of capital and industry in the possession of the American as of the Englishman . Supposing the purchase to have been judicious , it was equally for the interest of both . The Englishman , in the price for which he sold it , got interest on his capital and wages on his labor ; and the American will do the same : - neither , because he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ; but each , in the increase of value by exchanging articles , respectively more wanted by the other . But it will still be urged , that , although the American importer may not sacrifice any value of his own , to pay the foreign // 1823 . Encouragement of Manufactures . manufacturer , still , by trading with the foreign manufacturer , he confers on him the benefit of a demand for his fabrics , and deprives his own country of the same benefit , and that thus foreign capital and industry are encouraged at the expense of the domestic . This is so plausible a view , that many persons , by no means of the manufacturing party , assent to it ; and plead only in practice against it , that existing mercantile interests are entitled to protection . The view , however , is wholly without foundation , and it is capable , we think , of proof , that domestic capital and industry are precisely as much encouraged by importation as by manufactures . To manufacture an article instead of importing it , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for a new species of industry in the place of an old one , but never can make the accession of a particle to either , beyond the fair progress ofsociety at large . When the importer purchases a foreign fabric , he gives for it a product of American capital and industry , which is regarded as an equivalent . No matter in what form this product exists , nor what channel it may have passed through . It may be potash , or tobacco , or cotton , or dollars . The importer receives nothing in Liverpool , for which he does not pay in the produce of American capital and industry , of which , of course , the costs of the voyage make a part . Every bale of goods bought , therefore , represents its full value of American industry , labor , and skill in some form or other . No part of this value goes to pay the British artist ; because , in that case , the same thing would be twice paid for . The American consumer pays the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British consumer , who receives and consumes the tobacco , cotton , specie , or potash , which were given for the article , is the individual who in reality pays the British artisan . At any rate , as the American produce , including the expense of transportation , is an equivalent for the value of the goods for which it is exchanged , if the American merchant encourage British industry , the British manufacturer encourages American industry to precisely the same amount ; to an amount which the parties themselves judge to be the same , because they exchange the results voluntarily with each other . Accordingly , a thousand dollars invested in importations , encourages American industry , and pays the interest on Amencan capital to its full ar*iount ; and , if the business be prudently // managed , so that the importer shall keep his fixed capital unimpaired , defraying all the charges , and yielding a fair profit ( and this must be done in any business , or that business will be abandoned for a more profitable , if there be one ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country . No matter where the scene of action has been laid , in the broad plantation , the deafening stories , of a factory , or on the stormy sea . A thousand dollars can put in motion only a certain quantity of labor ; and , except where protected by a monopoly , can of itself acquire but the average profits of value possessed and invested in other ways , in the same community . We are surprised that Dr Seybert , who in every other respect has soundly stated the doctrine of the balance of trade , should here have descrted his own principles . He tells us that the balance in favor of England is actually an unfavorable balance to us , because our imports consist in manufactured articles , and that twenty millions and a half are annually consumed by America , on which we pay profit to England ; adding in a note , that the raw material is estimated to increaSe seven fold in value by being manufactured . This fact , however , does not bear on the question . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to their amount . Is the invoice of dry goods worth a thousand pounds , he gives for it a thousand pounds ' worth of products of American industry and capital ; be it gold , silver , exchange ; tobacco , or cotton , the principle is the same . The parties buy of each other . But it will be said , that by encouraging domestic manufac. * tures , we bring into operation more industry in the production of the same article , and that therefore domestic industry is more encouraged . This fact , in most manufactures , is true but the only consequence of this truth is , that , without serving any one , not even the manufacturing interest , the community is made so much the poorer . To employ more industry in producing the same result ,  --  to work four hands in order to get into the market what might otherwise be got by the labor of two , is merely destroying so much productive industry , and making the community so much the poorer . This is immediatefelt in raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is not enriched , but impoverished ; it pays more for the same thing , fewer persons of course will consume it , // and those , who consutne it , will do so at a greater sacrifice . But the producer is not benefited . It is no advantage , on the contrary , it is a disadvantage to the producer to enhance the cost of production , as this infallibly diminishes the consumption . if more industry is employed in the domestic manufacture , than in the foreign importation of the article , then more American capital and American labor are consumed for the production of the same effect . And this is an evil . It is an evil to the farmer . The manufacturers have attempted to make common cause with the farmers , and represent the latter as saying we will give you to eat , if you will give us to wear . ' But the farmer wants various kinds of clothes , and something besides clothes . He wants cloth of one manufacturer , linen of another , shoes of a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to get each as cheap as he can . It is for his interest to give as little wheat as possible for his coat , that he may have the more to spare for his shirt ; and , again , as little as possible for his shirt , that he may not be stinted in his tools . If he have to pay his neighbor , the manufacturer , four bushels of wheat for his coat , when the merchant would have furnished it for three bushels , or the value of three bushels , in proportion to the difference , he is able to furnish himself with fewer comforts ,  --  he is so much the poorer . We wonder , moreover , that this argument has not suggested to the manufacturers the immediate effect which their policy would have on the export trade of the United States . Millions of dollars of our produce are now called for by Great Britain alone , and paid for in her produce . To cut off our trade with her would be to sacrifice a considerable portion of the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our author , it is true , murmurs at the British , because they will not take our wheat . But why is he not contented that they take our tobacco and cotton ; or what would it avail us to have the right of exporting wheat , if , by prohibiting their manufactures , we refuse the only thing it is for their interest to pay ? In fact , our author 's intimations amount to this , that because we can not find a market for every thing we produce , it is not worth while to have a market for any thing . In the present state of things in this country , we hold this course of argument to be unanswerable . It is decidedly for the interest of every individual consumer in a free communi // ty , that every article of consumption be brought into the market as cheap as possible . It is therefore the interest of every consumer in America , that every article be produced in the market , in such a way , that it may he procured for the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , it is not for his interest that any manufacture he attempted , in which more capital and industry will be required , to produce the same , than would be required to produce it in the way of commerce . The capitalist , considering him as undecided whether to invest his capital in manufactures or commerce , has the same interest to invest it where the least capital will produce the greatest result . Prospectively , therefore , American capital c.an be interested to carry on no manufacture , where the cost of the imported article is less than that of the manufactured . For manufacturing capital , already in existence , we would certainly allow the claim to reasonable protection . It ought not to he forgotten , however , what a prodigious bounty - that of the restrictive system-was paid , by the commercial capital of the north , and the agricultural capital of the south , to the manufactures set up during the war ; and it is not without disgust , that , under the head of general remarks in the digest of manufactures laid before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prices since the war to be often spoken of by the owners of factories as an injustice to the manufacturer . As it is for the interest of the consumer that every thing should be cheap and abundant , instead of the complaints which we often hear , that our industry and capital can not sustain a competition with the English , we ought to perceive that , so far from being injured , we are served and assisted by it . There are writers among us , who appear to think that human happiness consists in working hard to produce ; whereas it consists in consuming . The miserable serfs , who , in the smoking and sulphurous forges , the dreary coal mines , and the stunning factories of England , are working from twelve to sixteen hours a day on wretched wages , are toiling for us . They labor to lessen the amount of American industry which it is necessary to pay for the articles imported. - Their competition ? it is a competition to put it into the power of the American farmer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby to become richer . On the general question of encouraging manufactures by // duties on imported articles , a question on which appeals have been importunately made to the popular feeling , it ought ever to be borne in mind , that it is a question immediately of capitalist against capitalist . Those who go into manufactures with large capitals will command and fix the market ; those who - engage in this business with small capitals , or none , will be in precisely the same want of encouragement then as ever . British competition may be shut out ; but the far more powerful competition of domestic capital , and all the advantages which it commands , will be called into existence . Moreover , the competition among capitalists themselves would sink the profits of the most successful manufacturing establishments to a fair average level with other employments of industry and capital , so that the only effect on the community , in this respect , would be , that so much capital would have been diverted by legislative interference from one pursuit to another ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the eligibility of the two investments , that is , in all the amount of duties imposed to produce this diversion . With regard to the effects on the population ; it may be a question harder to decide which employment of capital is most favorable to the growth and increase of a hardy , vigorous population . As advised at present , we are by no means persuaded that the commercial investment is not as favorable as the manufacturing . We think but meanly of the average morality of sailors ; but we do not know but it equals that of the inmates of factories . Besides , the ships ' crews are the smallest part of those whom commercial capital employs . Tracing into all its branches the effect of either investment on society , we believe it will be found , that those who are supported and fed by commerce , are as moral as any other part of the community . As to the numbers which are respectively fed by commerce and manufactures , we believe that great mistakes both of fact and principle exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large building or buildings are filled with men , women , and children , and a little village is formed by their dwellinghouses . A town almost grows up in a season . But this is rather an apparent than a real effect . The factory is usually built on an unfrequented spot ; and the nature of the pursuit condenses more of the labor upon the one // 224 July , point where the buildings stand . The operations of commerce are lost in her own crowds . A China ship and cargo are as costly as Waltham factory ; hut the ship is not to he distinguished among the forests of masts at the wharfs , nor can the multitude , which have in some way or other been employed in connexion with the vessel and cargo , be pointed out and enumerated , scattered as they are throughout a large city , nay , throughout a country . We think that in an open trade , and in a free country , taking one pursuit with another , from the beginning to the end , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directly and indirectly , and to about the same profit . Did our limits admit , we could in various ways make this probable . It is ably enforced by the intelligent editor of the American edition of Say 's Political Economy . In this respect , therefore , we think there is an error in fact , in supposing that manufactures employ more labor than commerce , tracing each from the beginning to the end of its operations . But the error in principle is still more apparent . It is no recommendation , but , on the contrary , an objection to a pursuit , that it employs more men , more labor for the same end ; else , all machinery , instead of enriching , would impoverish the nation . Many machines have been in* vented which do the work of hundreds , yea , of thousands of human hands . It is acknowledged that they are one great cause of the vast product of national wealth where they exist . But they have the effect to employ less labor to produce the same value ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they employ more labor to produce the same article than commerce employs to import it ; we should be glad to know , how a spinning jenny , which reduces nine tenths the amount of industry required to produce an article , can be the source of wealth ? We should be glad to know the difference between a ship and all other kinds of machinery , that makes a reduction of the amount of labor , necessary to produce an article , ruinous when effected by the employment of a ship ; and salutary when effected by the employment of double speeders and carding machines . In fact , it is the interest of every consumer , and that is synonymous with every man , that every thing which he is to consume should come into the market as cheap as possible ; and this is to be effected by producing it with as little labor and expense as possible . // When we witness the zeal , with which the cause of manufactures is pleaded , and duties on foreign importation are demanded , we can not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agricultural , the commercial , nay , the manufacturing capital and industry of the country is to be forced out of the channels , in which it has flowed so long and so prolitably , for the sake of providing a bounty ror those branches of industry , which , were they profitable , would need no bounty ? To destroy the importation of foreign manufactures would , as its first effect , be to reduce very low , if not to annihilate the market for our great southern staples . It would be to force the South Americans and the Hindoos to supply the British market with cotton , which they soon would be able to do , if the British manufacturer were unable to pay for our cotton with his fabrics . Let it not be said we should at home consume all the cotton , which we now export . On the contrary , if it be correctly maintained that in general raw materials increase seven fold in value by manufacture , we should consume only one seventh of what is sold in England . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error , which England has committed on a small one , in forbidding the importation of timber from the North of Europe . She has injured her manufactures by taking away a market from them , and she provides timber for her navy at a greater expense . But this is not the worst , that would happen to us , by building up manufactures at the expense of our commerce ; we should destroy the most flourishing manufacture now existing in America . After the little domestic manufactures , by which single families supply themselves with the necessaries of life , and small mechanics and artisans provide the most essential commodities for their villages ( which , though insignificant in any one instance , probably amount , in the aggregate to one hundred millions of annual value , throughout the United States ) next to these , and far before any of the great manufacturing establishments of cotton , of wool , of iron , or of glass , we place the manufacture of s/tips . The tonnage of America in 1810 was estimated at seventy-one millions of dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign trade . With the exception of a considerable part of the sail cloth , and an inconsiderable suni for bunting for colors , * this vast amount of value Tench Coxe 's Statement of the Arts and Manufactures of the U. S. of America , p. xix. // is produced out of the growth of our own soil , and of our own forests . On an average of all the years from 1803 to 1816 , Dr Seybert found , * that the annual amount of new tonnage in America , was 102,811 tons , exceeding that of the British empire . This gives an annual mantfacture of tonnage of five millions of dollars . This branch of manufacturing industry therefore must be , two thirds of it , sacrificed , and to promot* other manufactures . And yet this vast amount of manufacturing industry is employed and paid by commerce , only in the very first step of her operations . This annual bounty of fiVe* millions of dollars paid to the forester and woodman , to the ironfounder and smith , to the carpenter and shipwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand seamen , with their wives and children , are next to be clothed atid fed , or , in other words , more than nine millions of dollars are paid annually by commerce , in the single article of wages to seamen , at the rate of eleven dollars per month . As no account is here ttii*th* of the superior wages of captains and officers , this estimate is *juite within bounds . The subsistence of the creWs , at the rate *of twenty cents the man per day , amounts to over five miilio*s of dollars per annum . And thus , in the pay and su*te4*iance *fseamen alone , fourteen millions of dollars are annually ekpnn*d*n1 by the commerce of this country , in the wages and subsistei*c* of the laborers it employs . Combining this with the frye millions annually required to keep the Ameiictm tonnage in repair , we have nineteen millions annually disbursed by the ship manufactory to the laboring classes of the community . Here we stop , though it is , as we have said , the first stage of commercial operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare the outward cargo , or vend the retuffi cargo , each of which is put in motion by commerce , the former to the enriching of the great agricultural states , ahd the latter resultirxg in the growth of the great commercial cities . We say nothing of the service rendered to every individual , however remote or distant he may be , who is enabled by commerce to take advantage of the crowded population , the accumulated capital , and the intense competition which prevail in foreign countries ; and thus purchase me most useful and necessary articles at the cheapest rate . We say nothing of all these , but We rest on the simple preliminary fact , that the commerce of this *onntry , // in the outset of its op*ratiolI* , without reckonh* Vrofit on an *unc*e of produu* shipped for exportation , pays to the hard working industry of th' *tautry nin*treu riiilliotis of dollar* *unually . When it shall be prhved that any Or all of the manufacturing establishments of the United States do this , it may be argued with some plausibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our commerce . Meantime a moment 's reflection on this vast amount , which is paid by commerce in annual wages to those whom it employs , abundantly shows , that in commercial enterprises , comparatively speaking , there is a vast consumption of labor , and a small one of capital . To erect any manufacturing establishment , with tolerable prospects of success , a hundred or two hundred thousand dollars are wanted in the outset . There is not probably an American merchantship that floats worth forty thousand dollars , and the great mass of our navigation consists of vessels , which are built and fitted for sea , at a cost of from four to twenty thousand dollars . With this small outfit , the globe is circumnavigated , and the fertility , the cheapness of labor , the peculiar staples , the accumulated capital and improved arts of every country , are laid under contribution to enrich ours . Certainly this is the circumstance , which has caused our commerce to flourish so much beyond our manufactures . Not a want of capital , as some writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , which are required to set up manufactuiing establishments . Capital , instead of being scarce , is abundant in this country , if by capital we mean such an amount of value as enables a man to undertake and prosecute an independent business . But it is in small amounts ; like the orphan 's cup in the Iliad , 7 *S'flhI ' , r8*&amp; * , * obz * Without reflecting , that the existence of capital in small and widely diffused portions is , like the statute of distributions which is one great cause of it , not a disadvantage , but the happiest feature of our political condition ; without reflecting that our progress is so rapid , that , notwithstanding its perpetual division and distribution , capital is already gathering itself into masses , competent to the most expensive undertakings ; our manufacturing writers have hit upon the notable device of raising a capital to carry on this business ; and the burden of all their writings and addi*esses is , we wish to raise a capital large // Encouragement of Manufactures . enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every consumer in the country to pay us twenty cents on every dollar he consumes , toward raising this capital , of which we stand in need .
