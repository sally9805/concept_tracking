Lima . 1825 . THE alliance about to be established between the new American republics , by the delegates assembled at the Isthmus of Panama , may with justice be considered among the most remarkable events of political history . Confederacies between independent states , for the purpose of consulting and supporting the common interest , have existed from early times . The governments of ancient Greece had their mutual compacts , their long sustained council of Ainphictyons , and their renowned Ac1ma*an league ; some of the minor states of modern Europe have from time to time followed their example ; and we behold at this day , the colossal powers of the old world linked tog*ther to maintain their dominion , nay , to secure their safety . The influence of these confederacies has been important , in proportion to their extent and their objects , but none of them has existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so broad and just in their political bearings , or been calculated to affect so deeply and widely the destiny of future generations , as that about to be formed by the Congress of Panamk . Polybius tells us , that it was the boast of the Ach*an league , while the wise and politic Aratus was at its head , to be founded on the basis of equality and liberty , and that to this were mainly to be ascribed its strength and its increase . But every one knows what was Grecian liberty , even in the best days of Grecian prosperity . The balance , between the rights of the people , and the power of the rulers , was never well adjusted ; the laws of nations were not understood , because practised on a narrow scale ; conanwrce , that great // instrument in drawing out the principles , and settling the rules of nationM intercourse , was hardly known . In short , liberty was too often the watchword of those , who desired freedom from law rather than from tyranny ; and the cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , as sustained by an existing government , that the schemes of ambition and misrule might be raised on its ruins . These defects , and others of a collateral nature , interwoven with the very texture of political institutions denominated republican , not only in Greece , but in other countries of Europe at later periods , have presented obstacles to any well organised confederacy in governments of this kind in the old world , which would bring the combined power and wisdom of the whole , to act for the mutual and equal benefit of the parts . If we look at confederated despotisms , we find things in a still worse condition . Who has ever dreamt , that it was the aim of the present allied sovereigns of Europe , to lift a finger towards aiding the progress of the mind , or human improvement in anything , which implies freedom of thought , or scope of inquiry ? All their acts declare the contrary , and prove this alliance to be a conspiracy against the liberty , as it is an outrage upon the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delusion , and slavery ; to stop the current of public opinion , and let in upon the mind anew the Stygian waters of the dark ages ; to make men bigots in the false creed of legitimacy , and infidels to the pure faith of reason and truth , liberty and right . Let public opinion be brought to this standard , and it is wisely judged , that it can be moulded to any shape , and impelled in any direction . Teach men to forget their rights , and abandon self respect , and you have no more to do to make them fit subjects for dragging the chains of slavery . The sovereigns of Europe are allied to prop up half a dozen tottering thrones , whose gothic structure is the mockery of an enlightened age like this , and to aggrandise half a dozen crowned heads , not merely at the expense of the independence of a hundred millions of the human race , but at the immensely greater sacrifice of retarding the progress of nations in those arts of self government , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadest foundation for all the advantages to be derived from the social compact , and // which are advancing so rapidly in every part of the world , where the shackles of antiquated forms are not felt . The confederacy of Panam&amp; is formed under auspices totally different from any , which have before existed . It has no prototyl ) e in the annals either of ancient or modern story . A hemisphere of the globe has become freed from the yoke of bondage , by hard struggles and by an energy , which only the spirit of freedom could inspire . The soil , which for three centuries was made sterile by the poisoned breath of tyranny , now gives growth and vigor to six great republics , as well organised as the circumstances of each will admit , and having for their basis the genuine principles of political liberty and justice . To give stability to these institutions ; to remedy the numerous defects , which in their present stage they must necessarily possess ; to consult and advance the common interests of twenty millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coinmotion from within ; to secure peace and prosperity at home , and importance and respect abroad ; to settle on definite grounds those political maxims , which for ages unnumbered will regulate the intercourse of nations , whose infancy will soon grow into a powerful manhood ; to concert all the plans , in short , which wisdom can devise , and union execute , for increasing the strength and prosperity of every branch of the confederacy ; these are some of the points to be considered at the Congress of Panam*m . The spectacle of such a body , assembled for such a purpose , is not more novel than imposing ; its members are literally the legislators of a continent and it was a just remark of Bolivar , that this event will form a memorable era in the diplomatic history of America , and a hundred ages hence , when posterity seeks the origin of the international law of the southern republics , she will consult the records of the proceedings in the Isthmus . ' Viewed in this light , and it is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of deep interest to all parts of the American continent , and although our own government is at present widely separated from the sphere of its action , yet it must necessarily , at a future day , participate largely of the influence of its measures . In touching on this subject at present , we aim at nothing more , than to state a few historical facts , with very brief // 1826 . Alliance of the Southern Republics . remarks on the general purposes of the Congress of ' Panamit , reserving for a future occasion a discussion of its direct policy and designs , as these may be more fully developed . The project of a union between the new governments of the south , seems to have been early conceived by some of the leaders of the revolutionary contest , as a step highly important and desirable , but the first who undertook the business of carrying it into execution was Bolivar . If it succeeds , as its friends anticipate , he must be regarded the Aratus of the league . Till Peru had shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far at least as to set up a nominally independent government under San Martin , which it has since confirmed and maintained , and until Mexico had escaped from the folly and tyranny of her mock emperor Iturbide , it was obvious that any plan of confederacy between the other states could not be accomplished , with a prospect of permanency or advantage . But in 1823 , when the power of Old Spain was virtually destroyed in South America , and each republic began to stand firm on its own basis , Bolivar , as President of Colombia , formally invited the governments of Mexico , Peru , Chile , and Buenos Ayres , to send delegates to the Isthmus of Panam&amp; , or to any other place that might be agreed on , with the express design of establishing the confederacy , and proceeding in their deliberations , as the instructions and united wisdom of the parties might dictate . This invitation was promptly accepted by Mexico and Peru , and an agreement , in the nature of a treaty , was entered into by each with the plenipotentiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the confederate Congress . Chile and Buenos Ayres delayed joining the compact , for reasons not well known , nor does it appear , that they have yet determined to take a part by their representatives in the convention . The obstacles to their union are probably of a local and transient nature , which will in due time be removed , and the way be left open for them to come into the compact . In this stage of the undertaking , as it was necessary for some one government to take the lead in its further prosecution , Bolivar sent a circular to all the republics , dated at Lima , December 7 , 1824 , recapitulating what had been done , and proposing , that delegates should immediately be // sent to Panama , by those governments which had agreed to join in the confederacy , suggesting that they ought not , out of courtesy to the delinquents , to delay any longer to profit by the advantages , which it was confidently believed would be derived from such a convention . The governments of Colombia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru , and two delegates from each of these countries proceeded to the place of destination . It is presumed , also , that the republic of Guatamala will join the confederacy at the outset , and send its representatives . The preliminary steps of the Congress are indicated by Santander , Vice President of Colombia , in his reply to Bolivar 's circular . It is there proposed , that the governments of Colombia and Peru should authorise their plenipotentiaries , as soon as they arrive at Panam*i , to enter into a direct correspondence with the other republics , acquainting them that conferencas had commenced , and renewing the invitation for each to send representatives . That these same plenipotentiaries should have power to select such a place , as they should think proper , in the Isthmus of Panamh , for their preparatory conferences . And , again , that whenever delegates from Mexico , Guatamala , Colombia , and Peru , or from any three of these republics , should be convened , they should have power to install the assembly of confederate delegates , and proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is moreover stated , in the letters of the President of Mexico , and the Vice President of Colombia , that each of these governments , through their ministers plenipotentiary in Washington , had invited the government of the United States to take part in the deliberations at Panamh . Such is a very brief history of the origin of this assembly ; future events must unfold the character and extent of its doings . Meantime we hasten to a few observations on its proposed objects , as far as these can be understood , from the hitherto imperfect expositions of the parties themselves , and from the political condition and interests of the several republics . The pamphlet , whose title is prefixed to this article , and which was published at Lima within the last twelve months , affords some hints on this subject ; and although it bears marks of haste , and is crude in composition , it is on the whole drawn up with a good deal of ability , and // manifests in the writer a deep knowledge of South American politics . It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be the true story of its origin , although the testimony in the preface is no more , than the assertion of an anonymous writer . It is a point of no consequence , however , who was the author of the pamphlet , as it treats of topics in no degree affected by the authority , from which the discussion of their merits proceeds . The name of Monteagudo is sufficiently notorious in the recent history of South American affairs , particularly in Chile and Peru . He raised himself from obscurity by the force of his talents , and his address , and acted a most conspicuous part in the strange drama of San Martin 's political career . In Peru he was entrusted with almost absolute power by San Martin , but he used it for purposes , which have been condemned in the severest terms by those , who profess to be acquainted with his conduct . At all events , the people became so much exas*. perated with his proceedings , that he was compelled by their united clamors to leave the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he lived as a private citizen till last January , when he was assassinated in the streets of Lima . Here we will dismiss the supposed author of the pamphlet , and turn to the hints it contains on the Congress of Panam*t . Three great points are said to claim the devoted and united attention of all the republics , and these are independence , peace , and security . To establish independence , preserve peace , and form a system of mutual guaranties , are objects equally essential to the prosperity , and even existence , of all the new governments , and such as can only be attained , in the most effectual manner , by a Congress , in which each shall be represented , and which shall proffer reciprocal support , fix the rules of national intercourse , and reconcile national dissensions . In his circular to the republics , BoFvar describes the Congress as a body , which may act as a council to us in our distresses , as a rallying point in our common danger , as a faithful interpreter of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a mediator in all our differences . ' This summary embraces all that can be desired from a confederacy , and it only remains to inquire what are the details , and whether they are practicable . // The thing of primary and vital importance to the South American Republics is their independence , and in this each one of them has an equal concern . Without independence , in short , they could not exist , and no sacrifices can be too great , no precaution superfluous , which shall have a tendency to establish this on an unshaken foundation . Where acornmon enemy is to be feared , whose designs are equally hostile to each republic , common prudence would dictate , that the best pledge of security would be in the united wisdom , resources , and strength of the whole . The only possible mode of effecting this union , of applying these resources , is by a Congress of delegates from the respective governments , authorised to concert proper measures , and to become responsible for supplying such a portion of the means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of each , or as exigences may require . All the reasons might here be adduced in favor of a general Congress , which were so powerfully urged by Jay and Hamilton in the Federalist , when they insisted on a union of our States , as the best security against foreign invasion . If you would preserve peace , let it be seen , that you are prepared to meet , and have power to resist , an enemy . The South Americans would not seem longer to have grounds for fear , that any further attacks will be made on them by a foreign foe , yet they are doubtless wise to keep on the side of caution . The arm of Old Spain is paralysed , not more in the new world , than in the old . The brilliant victory of Ayacucho severed the last thread of her dorniniou on the western continent , and wrested from her hand forever the sceptre of power , which she first acquired by bloodshed and treachery , and which for three centuries she has wielded only as an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now collected at San Juan de Ulloa , a small island on the coast of Mexico ; at the castle of Callao , the port of Lima , under the semibarbarous Rodil ; and at Chilo* , in the southern borders of Chile . In these retreats their insignificance protects them , and from these they would soon be driven , were it possible for them to gain such accessions of strength , as to make them otherwise than insignificant . In this state of things it is manifest , that all actual danger from Old Spain has ceased , and as far as that humbled // nation is concerned , the independence of the new world is secured . But the South Americans say , and perhaps justly , that her pride is not subdued , although her physical forceis crushed , and that the spirit of revenge is stifled , not quenched , but slumbers to burst forth with increased fury , should her strength be revived . She will set up pretensions , and call them rights , and fortify them with records , decrees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pope Alexander the Sixth , making over to Ferdinand and Isabella all the western world beyond a certain line , drawn from pole to pole through such points , as his Holiness was pleased to designate . The obstinacy , that has struggled for several years in a contest , which all the world has seen must end , as it has done , in defeat and disgrace to Spain , is too blind to see the reality at first , and too inveterate to be reclaimed by reason , justice , or common prudence . It will seize the first opportunity to renew its rashness , which accident or the progress of events may throw in its way , and which shall communicate the faintest gleam of life to a lingering hope . Moreover , the Holy Alliance exhibits an aspect , which the South Americans are disposed to contemplate with much suspicion . Not that this formidable combination has anything in America , which can rightfully claim its attention , but the melancholy examples of Naples and Spain provo abundantly , that it is ready to meddle where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind hearted sovereigns , by their own professions , carried war and death into the Peninsula to make the people happy , and teach them how to manage their own affairs . Who knows how soon the same tender concern may be extended to America ? And when this fit of sympathy shall once have taken as deep hold , as it did in the cases of Naples and Spain , why should it not be expected to see the bayonets of their Imperial , Most Catholic , and Most Christian Majesties , teaching the same lessons of happiness and self government to the Mexicans and Colombians , as they have before done xAth such triumphant success to the Neapolitans and Spaniards ? The Holy Alliance exists as a whole , and in its parts , on a name , a shadow , the shadow of legitimacy , and when the people shall see what a vain , empty thing it is , the bubble will burst , the charm will be dissolved , and the airy fabric will fall . To keep the peo* // pie in ignorance , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germs of intelligence and liberty wherever they appear , are among the most essential maxims of this political compact . Nothing hut the want of adequate power , and the doubtful nature of the undertaking , would prevent these maxims being applied in America , with as much energy as in Europe . And although nothing can seriously be apprehended , it is p. udent , to say the least , that the republics of the new world should be on their guard . Then , again , there is the new empire of Brazil , bordering by a line of immense length on Colombia , Peru , and Buenos Ayres . It does not yet app*ar , in what direction this sprig from a royal stock will shoot . The names of emperor , crown , and sceptre , have no charms for American ears , and if the things , as well as the names , are to put forth the same virtues here , that they have done in the old world , it is safe to say , that American ground can not long be a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true , that Don Pedro the First has thus far shown a spirit of accommodation to circumstances , which augurs not badly . We are even told of the independence of Brazil , and a constitution , and these under an emperor ! It will puzzle a republican of the United States to understand a combination of ideas so incongruous . If Don Pedro would become a president , and declare the Brazilians independent not only of Portugal , but of all hereditary forced dominion , whether from abroad or at home , and then give them a constitution recognising an equality of rights , and liberty to choose their own mode of being governed , he might talk in earnest of the independence of Brazil . But till this be done , there never will be any permanently good understanding between that country , and the neighboring states . Jealousies will arise , aggressions be committed , and wars break out . The idle dream of Ic bitimac y will play at times in his Brazilian Majesty 's imagination , and the great champions of this phantom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be contributed indirectly , if not directly , to such an extent , as to render him a troublesome neighbor to the adjoining republics . In their relations with Brazil , these governments have a common interest , and such relations may properly be discussed by a general Congress . // Such are some of the advantages , which the cause of South American independence will derive , from a single body of delegates convened from all the states , especially in the first stages of their national existence . The next important step is to secure a permanent peace , not only in regard to their standing with foreign nations , but with each other . It is of vast moment , at the outset of their political intercourse , that such measures should be concerted , and maxims adopted , as will be mutually understood and received . By judicious arrangements of this sort , the usual causes of national differences and discord will in a bood degree be obviated , a uniformity of thinking on these subjects will gradually diffuse itself through the different parts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , each will see its real interests in their true light , and be ready to make sacrifices , where they are required from another . The governments of South America are all established on precisely the same principles , their condition has hitherto been the same , they have thrown off the same yoke of oppression , and they have before them the same difficulties to encounter in their national progress ; they speak the same language , have the same manners , domestic habits , and characteristic peculiarities . It follows , of course , that similar laws and political institutions are strictly applicable to the whole . In this respect there can be no essential difference between IMexico and Chile , Buenos Ayres and Colombia . Yet some of these governments are separated by so wide a distance from others , that the bonds of national sympathy will every day become weaker , distinctive national habits will spring up , and , as in all other nations , not cemented by any local attachments , rival interests will begin to take root , and the seeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace to be blasted . With every hope realised , the day will come , perhaps , when these evils will have a being , but this is no reason why their causes should not be timely cut off to as great a degree as possible . And since there is such an entire similarity in everything pertaining to the people of these countries , and in the principles of the governments they are constituting , it is evident , that they are in a condition to be guided by one general system , formed by a united voice . And it is moreover evident , that this same harmony of cha // racter , customs , opinion , and feeling , may be turned to the best account in promoting a universal spirit of conciliation and peace . An assembly of representatives , such as that at Panarnh , is the only body , that could frame and give authority to a system , that would be suited to this uniformity of character , condition , and interests . Peace will be , preserved , not only by such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each government , hut also by having a tribunal of weight and authority , representing the interests of all parties , to which may he referred national differences , the exposition of doubtful points in national law , the settlement of disputed rights and titles , and the interpretation of treaties . Many a long and bloody war would have been avoided in the old world , had these points been clearly defined , and understood in the same sense by the parties , before a difference of opinion , or a misapprehension , had kindled animosity , and an imaginary injury had prompted to unseasonable aggression . Lastly , a general Congress is calculated to afford the most perfect guaranty , which can be given , of the security of the several states , or of the enjoyment of their rights and privileges as md el ) endent sovereignties . As the representatives meet on reciprocal grounds , the very essence of the confederacy will he a pledge to conduct their deliberations , and form their decisions , on principles of perfect reciprocity . It is only upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and if this be removed , the union will necessarily dissolve . While such an assembly continues , therefore , in the full and active exercise of its delegated powers , the states individually can have no stronger safeguard to their rights as separate governments . A majority in the assembly will rule , hut the interests of each member of the confederacy are so nearly the interests of all the others , that a case can hardly occur , in which a majority would come to a decisi6n essentially detrimental to the minority , and not at the same time he equally so to themselves . The extraordinary circumstance already repeated , that is , the remarkable similarity of interests on all subjects , which will he brought before this body , guards its deliberations with a system of checks and balances , which leaves it no power to act , while it acts at all as a united assembly , except for the common good . This must // inevitably be the character of the assembly , unless it can be supposed , that the majority will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are yet in their infancy in the South American republics ; the laws of nations concerning this kind of intercourse are very imperfectly understood there , as well as the theory of the freedom of trade , and the rights of neutrals in time of war . Obstacles , which have proved most serious to the peace and prosperity of the old countries , will be removed , if the laws of international communication can be defined by a competent tribunal at this period , and be watched over and interpreted as occasions may hereafter require . In the administration of justice , and the general forms of internal government , the laws of Old Spain still prevail throughout Spanish America . These must gradually be reformed , and abolished , and their place supplied by others in unison with the spirit of free constitutions . Such a change must be produced slowly , hut it will be done much more surely , when promoted by the influence of a general Congress , which will collectively be acquainted with the condition and wants of the separate republics , and be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , and as will command the confidence and respect of the people . But we aimed only at a few hints on this subject , and have already transgressed our intended limits . As far as we can collect the views of the South American writers , from such of their remarks as we have seen , it may be expected , that the immediate attention of the Congress will be drawn to some or all of the following topics , as enumerated in the Gaceta de Colombia of the 27th of February , 1825. 1 . To form a solemn compact , or league , by which the states , whose representatives are present , will he hound to unite in prosecuting the war against their common enemy , Old Spain , or against any other power , which shall assist Spain in her hostile designs , or any otherwise assume the attitude of an enemy . 2 . To draw up and publish a manifesto , setting forth to the world the justice of their cause , and the relations they desire to hold with other christian powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces of the republics , to free the islands of Puerto Rico and Cuba from the yoke of Spain , and , in such case , what contingent each ou6ht to contribute for this end . 5 . To take measures for joiuin* in a prosecution of the wat at sea , and on the coasts of Spain . 6 . To ( letermine whether these measures shall also be extended to the Canary and Phillipine islands . 7 . To take into consideration the means of making effectual the declaration of the President of the United States , respecting any ulterior design of a foreign power to colonise any portion of this continent , and also the means of resisting all interference from abroad with the domestic concerns of the American governments . 8 . To settle by common en1 sent the principles of those rights of nations , which are in their nature controvertible. 9 . To determine oi what footing shall be placed tL poli* tical and conuner jal relations of those portions of our hemisphere , which have obtained , or shall obtain their independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or European power , as was for many years the case with Hayti . This is a formidable list of subjects , and enough to show , that , if they should all be discussed , the first Congress at Panamk will not have an idle session . As to the question , whether the United States ought to join in the confederacy , it can hardly be doubted , that such a step would at l ) resent be highly inexpedient . Nearly all the topics for J ) rin ) ary consideration , are such as pertain exclusiv ly to the local interests of the South American republics ; any close alliance , or active interference of the United States , would embarrass , rather than facilitate some of the most important deliberations of the Congress . Be sides , our fricodly relations with 01 ( 1 Spain render it impossible for us to paulicipate in any measures of war , or hostility , either by counsel or action , which her enemies may think themselves co1npcllcd to adopt The pledge of the Piesident of the United States may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the x'arm and universal approbation of the country , when it was *ven , may be rer*arded as clothinb it with such a character . in his messag to Congress two years ago , speaking of the European powers , President Monroe used // the following dignified and decided language . We owe it to candor , and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers , to declare , that we should consider any attempt on their pan , to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere , as dangerous to our peace and satiny . With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power , we have not interfered , and shall not interfere . Bait with the governments , who have declared their independence and maintained it , and whose independence we have , on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged , we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing theta , or controlling in any other manner their destiny , by any European power , in any other light , than as the manifestation of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans can not nnt a more hearty and decided expression of interest in their concerns , and of friendly feeling tonrds them , than is contained in this pangraph . The government of the United States has recognised the independence of all the republics , and formed with them on mutual terms the relations of sovereign and independent nations . Should the great cause of American freedom be asailed , whether at the north or the south , the people of the United States wiU be ready to take up arms , and unite with all the friends of liberty on the continent in defence of their common rights . At such a crisis there would be strong motives for a union of counsel , in a general congress of delegates collected from ever art of America . As it is contemplated , that the Congress of Psnamk shall be a permanent body , holding its seasons statedly from time to time , the day may arrive , when the local affihira of the south will be so adjusted , that there will be few national interests in those conatnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period , also , a union may with great propriety be formed . But notwithstanding we think it would be manifestly premature and impolitic , for the United States to join the confederacy at this stage of the business , yet there are many reasons why representatives from our government should be present , and take part in such discussions as efibet our immediate interests , and be prepared to express the sense of the government on all topics of general concern . Let the acts of the Congress be what they may , since they will apply to all the southern re // publics , they must ultimately affect the United States ; and it is not easy to foresee or calculate the advantages that would be gained , or the evils that would be averted , in our future national progress , by exercising a timely and salutary influence in the counsels , whose professed design is to lbrm a system of mutual intercourse and political operations , for six distinct governments on the western continent , some of them already powerful , and all possessing the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
