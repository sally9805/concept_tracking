ART . XV. - The Greek Reader , by Frederick Jacobs , Professor of the Gymnasium at Got/ia , and Editor of the .6lnthologia . From the seventh German Edition , adapted to the Translation of Buttmann 's Greek Grammar . Boston . Published by Oliver Everett . 1823 , pp. vii , and 346 . SYMPTOMS of an increasing fondness for classic learning are showing themselves in various parts of our country . An improved edition of an elementary work for the study of Greek has recently appeared in Kentucky ; and a part of the Illiad , with judicious notes chiefly selected from Heyne , has been printed at Andover , with the neatness and accuracy , which distinguish works from the press in that place . The Gollege of Middlebury , in Vermont , has recently acquired the means of pursuing philological studies with success . We have before us an Address , delivered at Middlebury by Professor Patton , who is known to the public by his translation of the Tables of ThierschAi In the Address , t the advantages of philological pursuits are explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form the habit of fixed attention and mental possession , to enlarge the capacity of the mind , and especially to produce the proportionate exercise of all the intellectual powers . From the printed catalogue of the books , which may be used by philological students at Middlebury , it appears , that they have access to the best critical works , and most valuable modern editions of . the classics ; a collection , such as till within a few years , hardly existed in any of the States . In the attempts which are making to facilitate the study of the Greek language , and place it on a better foundation , the ancient seminary at Cambridge has done what might have been expected from its character and resources . The latest edition of the Collectanea . Miajora bears sufficient testimony to the fidelity and critical accuracy of Dr Popkin , who superintended // it . If that work is to retain its place in our higher institutions , it is matter of congratulation , that the direction and responsibility of a new edition rest with a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecian literature , but also with the minutia of the accents and the niceties of verbal criticism . We take the more pleasure in acknowledging the merit of our American editor , because his labors , having for their object the silent correction of the mistakes of others , presuppose great learning and industry , and at the same time are not presented in a form to attract particular notice . It is certainly praiseworthy to improve the books , which are already in extensive use for the purposes of education ; but it is still better to make or introduce superior ones . It is therefore with no common satisfaction , that we receive from the university press of Cambridge the excellent school book of Jacobs . If the Germans can claim to have excelled all other nations in any branch of letters , they certainly may claim to have done so in those humble but all important works , which are intended to familiarize the young with the sever*r parts of knowledge . This superiority is easily accounted for . The Germans have been more assiduous than the scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary works ; and further , this kind of literary labor has been performed among them by men of high intellectual gifts and attainments . Thus the editor of the Anthology , after having employed many years of his life in restoring to the scattered flowers of Grecian poetry their original freshness , and having founded his own reputation for learning , sagacity , and industry , on a labor , which will not soon be forgotten , has thought it in no wise derogatory to spend much time and patient research , in selecting from the Grecian literature the scattered phrases and passages , which seemed to him to be of all others the best adapted for the use of persons just entering on the study of the language . Those , who are concerned in the duties of instruction , may now be relieved from the necessity of teaching the smaller work of Dalzel . The Scottish nation is not celebrated for its philologists ; and certainly Dalzel has no claims to particular esteem as a scholar . His lectures , which have been printed , are barren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreetly made , nor well illustrated ; // they convey in themselves little valuable information ; in parts they are much too difficult and obscure ; and yet they contain no sentences sufficiently simple for the beginner . The Anacreontic odes , which form a considerable part of the book , contain sentiments of the coarsest sensual tendency ; and deserve bttle commendation as poems . The Greek Reader , on the contrary , having been compiled by one of the leading scholars of the age , is prepared throughout in a pure and masterly manner ; proceeds methodically from the simplest combination of words to the common Attic style ; and is so composed , that while the rules of grammar are illustrated in easy succession , an outline is given of mythology , ancient geography , and Grecian history . It is used in almost all the good schools in Germany , and has there gained a decided expression of public opinion in its favor , as the best of the many similar works , which have been produced by the scholars of that prolific country . In regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy ; and this quality it possesses in an eminent degree . - As the notes and Lexicon are in English , it affords the means of learning Greek without the embarrassing intervention of another foreign tongue . That it contains references to the American translation of Buttmann 's Grammar , will make it the more valuable to those , who possess that work , without diminishing its utility for those , who continue to use the more ancient manuals . We hope the Greek Reader will come into immediate and extensive use and in expressing this opinion without reserve , we are influenced , not by any predilection for the Gernian systems , but by a sincere belief , that it answers its design better than any similar book . A general preference , even when it is in the main well founded , is but a poor support for an opinion . But while it would imply weakness to plead for a work , because it is of German origin , it would be quite as inconsistent with a real love for learning , to reject one for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general concern . We claim as a people to be inferior to none in liberty and public honor ; and we should be careful to rival the most enlightened nations in intelligence . Our freedom and national glory are of native growth ; the means of education and the sources of knowledge must , from our relative situation . stil // be introduced from abroad . It is , therefore , a solemn duty to search through the literary stores of all nations , and select for our use such works , as will at once impart the most knowledge , and best cherish principles in harmony with our institutions . No matter where they are to be found ; we must prove all , and adopt the best . In this spirit , the gentleman who fills the Cambridge mathematical chair , with so much credit to himself and advantage to others , has had the merit of reforming and reinvigorating the study of the mathematics among us , by drawing the materials of instruction directly from the nation , which has made the most proficiency in the exact sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for our guides in practical morals and philosophy , in history , and , as far as modern times are concerned , in forensic eloquence . But without being insensible to the transcendent merits of men like Bentley and Porson , who possessed genius , wit , and erudition in the most happy union , and have left illustrious names , and exerted a powerful influence through their works , we believe that the palm in philological pursuits belongs to the Germans . That it is so with regard to school books , ( and this is the only part of the question , which it now belongs to us to diseuss , ) is obvious from the concessions of the English themselves , who , without any scruple , are constantly profiting by The researches of the continental scholars , and acknowledging their editions of the classics to be the best , by reprinting them . We have this moment examined such English school editions of the ancient authors , as we happen to have near us , and find that three out of four are sedulously reprinted ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Professor Everett introduced Buttmann 's Greek Grammar to the American public , an English scholar was preparing Matthiae 's for the English schools. * In the last advertisements of new books in the literary mart of London , we find the most approved Latin Grammar in use in Germany announced as translated . The best London edition of Dalzel 's Collectanea Majora contains a text , reformed almost throughout after the standard German authorities , and the most useful part of the notes is taken from * The larger Grammar of Matthjac , in 2 vols . Svo. has been before the Eng . ' fish public for several years . Dr C. J. Blomfield abridged it for the use chools in 1822. // April , Schools in the State of New York . the same sources . We say this , not out of disrespect to the English . The causes of an indisputable fact are to be found in the different situation of England and the German sovereignties . Had Heyne been an Englishman , he would have been a practical statesman ; and many of his countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives of the British islands , would have found other employment in India or the colonies . But apart from this discussion , it is certain , that , since we must have elementary works , he , who enlarges the number of useful and good ones , has a claim to public gratitude , as having increased the number from which a choice may be made . Let us take the most excellent , wherever we may find them . Whether we speak of books for youth or for men , let us remember , there is but one republic of letters , and that republic should pursue but one policy , the advancement of truth and science , of free and familiar intellectual intercourse of all parts of the world with each other , a commerce of minds , limited by no restricting prejudices , and checked by no unwortby jealousies or partialities.
