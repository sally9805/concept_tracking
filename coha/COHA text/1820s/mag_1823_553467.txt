txt ART . vII. - an introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures ; by Thomas Hartwell Home , .1II.d. of St John 's College , Cambridge , Curate of the united parishes of Christ Church , . N*cwgate street , and Saint Leonard , Foster lane . Second edition . London , 1821 . WE are informed , in the preface to this work , which has already found a very considerable circulation among biblical scholars on this side of the Atlantic , that it is a selection from the labors of the most eminent biblical critics , both British and foreign , and is designed as a comprehensive manual of sacred literature . The plan of a work of this kind , one which might serve the biblical student as a general introduction to the holy scriptures , and afford those facilities , which every one would esteem desirable for solving the difficulties that might // come in his way and otherwise materially perplex his progress , was conceived by Mr Home , as it seems , at a very early period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its completion and publication in its present form . That our author found himself , in the commencement of his biblical studies , in want of a work of the kind which he has presented to the public , is not at all surprising , when it is remembered , how few books of standard merit on the subject of sacred literature , particularly on the criticism of the old testament , have made their appearance in English ; and , as the want , which he experienced , has been felt by so many others , we trust he will receive the gratitude and thanks of all true friends of a thorough knowledge of the bible , for the attempt to remedy it , which he has so perseveringly , and laboriously , and , in many respects , successfully made . The first of the four volumes , through which this work is extended , treats of the genuineness , authenticity , uncorrupted preservation , and inspiration of the holy scriptures . That the introduction should begin with discussions of this kind seems to us perfectly proper ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the student should know , whether the books , which are the objects of his attention , were written at the time assigned to them , and by the persons to whom they are ascribed , or not ; whether the facts recorded in them are worthy of credit ; whether the copies at present in use are true transcripts from the originals ; and whether they exhibit any just claims to be considered as inspired . It is true , that some of the arguments , which are made to bear upon these points , imply a previous critical acquaintance with the books themselves ; but then the difficulty only amounts to this , that the student is under the necessity of taking some things on the authority of others , with the fair expectation of soon being able , by means of his own investigations , to confirm them , if true , and to correct them , if erroneous . The first chapter , the subject of which is the necessity of a divine revelation , contains ( although we would not be understood by making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every assertion that is made in it ) a striking exhibition of the weakness and evil tendencies of the human mind , when destitute of any supernatural illumination ; and more especially of the miserable morality , if it may be called by that name , of such men as Hume and Bolingbroke , // Voltaire and Lielvetius , when compared with the pure and exalted moral precepts of the scriptures . It is calculated to leave a deep and authoritative impression , that , without the bible , we should be left , even at this late period , in the grossest ignorance and the most deplorable error , on subjects of the highest concernment . In the interesting remarks on the genuineness of the diffei'ent books of the old testament , we could only wish , that Mr Home had made the subject of the CANON of the old testament a more distinct and separate point of consideration , as it undoubtedly should have been , and had left it in a little less obscurity . It seemed to us important that the word Canon ( Kc*v ) itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been more particularly defined ; and when , on the forty eighth page of the volume under consideration , we are referred to the testimony of the Septuagint , of Philo , Josephus , Origen , Melito and others , we wish to understand precisely the bearing and the extent of their evidence , which are not altogether clear . If by the Canon Mr Home means a collection of Jewish writings e*ttant in the time of our Saviour , supposed to have been written by holy men of old , and regarded as of divine origin , the testimony of the authorities just mentioned , and of others , that Mr Home brings forward , is good and to the purpose ; but he will no doubt admit on a little reflection , that a book may be canonical and still not be genuine , may have belonged to the collection in question , and still not have been written by the person , to whom it is usually attributed . There is a distinction in the meaning of the words genuine , authentic , canonical and inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a professed introduction to the scriptures , unless we are expressly informed , that these words , in point of signification , are designedly confQunded together . We see no objection to the general train of Mr Home 's argumertt in this part of his work , which appears to be , however , as he led us to expect in his preface , a compilation from other treatises . We consider it perfectly clear , that Moses must have been himself in the main , the author of the Pentateuch ; and can not feel ourselves at liberty to detract in the least from that faith , which we have exercised from childhood , in the worth and genuineness and authenticity of the scriptures , without refu* // ing to allow any weight to the greatest possible accumulation of moral evidence . That Moses made use of certain written documents , which had been in existence previous to his time , in the composition , or , as we should rather be inclined to say , in the compilation of Genesis , and that there have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , in a number of instances interpolations , and some additions , is all clear , and we should go in the face of the plainest evidence , if we should avow a disbelief of it ; but in the view of every reflecting mind , of every person who makes any rightful pretensions to scholarship , circumstances of this kind would naturally enough be expected , certainly would not appear peculiarly strange , and would be very far , we trust , from shaking the firmness of his faith . We think it probable , that our opinions in respect to the origin of the book of Genesis may not be altogether in coincidence with those of Mr Home , from what he has to say at page sixty third , of the first volume , in regard to the controversy on the subject , which was first brought into much notice by the publication of the physician astruc , entitled , Conjectures sur les . lJltimoires originaux do nt ii paroit que . Aloyse s'cst servi pour composer le livre de la Genise. 8vo . Bruxelles , 1753 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces of no less than twelve ancient documents , from which , not only the whole book of Genesis , but likewise the earlier chapters of Exodus were compiled ; Eichhorn , on the contrary , reduces the number of them to two , distinghuishing one by the name* of the * the other by that of the * document . Mr Home ren-iirks concerning the hypothesis of Eichhorn , which is adopted by Rosenmiiller , and , in its essential features , by Jahn , that there is but one objection to $t , which , however , he apprehends to be a fatal one ; namely , the total silence of Moses , as to any documents having been consulted by him . But this objection , which appe*rs so formidable in the eyes of our author , seems to us to possess but small weight ; and as to what he afterwards observes , in regard to the refinement of Eichhorn 's speculations , we are compelled to say , that the remarks of that writer are such , although perhaps not correct in every particular , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified to detect and to estimate differences and coincidences in sty1e. * // and who , while he never wanted ability to contrive an hypothesis , rarely failed in bringing ingenious and powerful arguments in support of it . After treating of the genuineness , authenticity , &amp;c. of the old testament , Mr Home proceeds to the consideration of those points in respect to the new ; and in the latter half of the first volume , treats at great length , and with learning and ingenuity , of the inspiration of the scriptures . Such is the multiplicity of arguments made to bear upon this subject , and such the variety of considerations brought to view in connexion with it , that we are unable , consistently with our limits , to give a particular account of them , and must refer our readers to the book itself . Among other subjects which are introduced into the appendix of this volume , we find a short notice of the Apocryphal books of the old and new testament . This subject is again introduced in the fourth volume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Whatever may be thought of the Apocryphal books , considered as authority in matters of religion , and whether they be of greater or less use to people in general , the study of them is certainly a matter of no inconsiderable consequence to the professed biblical student . These books , ( we have reference now to the Apocrypha of the old testament , ) appear from the best information to have been chiefly written between the time of the captivity and the coming of Christ . We might be pardoned , therefore , in expecting to find in a work , which professedly treated of these productions , some account of the literary spirit of that period , of the connexion of the Hebrews with the Egyptians and Greeks , and of the influence of this connexion on the style and peculiarities of thought in the writings of which we are speaking . The history of that period is interesting inconsequence of its connexion with the Apocrypha , and the Apocrypha is important in consequence of the light , which it communicates to the contemporaneous history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , it will be found to be none the less important in consideration of the aid , which it in many ways affords in the interpretation of the new testament . We are unable to say , that we have found any work as yet in English , on the history of the period between the Babylonish captivity and the advent of the Meg*iah , and on the religious , philosophical , and literary spirit of // the Apocryphal writings of that time , which has in all respects met our views and wishes . The discussions in the first part of the second volume relate to the original languages of the bible , to the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts , to the editions of the old and new testaments , to the ancient and modern versions of the scriptures , to various readings , harmonies , &amp;c . The second part of this volume is wholly occupied with a subject of no little interest and importance , viz , that of interpretation . We have already had occasion to express our sentiments in respect to this subject in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we think we have ground for anticipating , both from that translation and from the discussions in the present work on the subject , that there will at length be a better understanding and more harmony in respect to the principles and rules of interpretation , and of course , as we conceive , a greater harmony in its results . We shall always welcome any thing which may have a tendency to lessen the ground of controversy between jarring sectaries , ' and to relieve that volume , which always has been and no doubt will continue to be essentially connected with human happiness , from the misconstructions and perversions of men , who are either too ignorant to see its meaning , or too much bound by the strong chains of party feelings to their own particular sect , to acknowledge it . We notice , that Mr Home at the end of his account of the various Hebrew grammars , which is published in the appendix to the second volume , feels a difficulty , such has been the number of them , in deciding , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it may be attributed to our want of information , and perhaps to an undue prejudice in favor of any production from the pen of a countryman , but we must say , if Mr Home feels a delicacy on the subject , that we are quite free in the present case from that refinement of feeling , and do not hesitate to express our opinion , that professor Stuart 's Hebrew grammar is the best which has as yet appeared in English . Wedo not mean this remark , as any reflection on our author , who had probably not received professor Stuart 's grammar , when the second edition of his work was put to press , and who will certainly do it justice at some future period . The great work of Gesenius , in German , undoubtedly stands at the head of // the six hundred publications , which are said to have appeared at various times on the subject of Hebrew grammar ; but Mr Stuart has contrived to weave into his own work what was most valuable in Gesenius , and has made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third volume of this work , which , as far as the subject matter of it is concerned , might , without any difficulty , have formed a separate publication , is occupied throughout , after first giving some account of the geography of Palestine , with what may he termed biblical antiquities or biblical arcltceology . The most perfect and thorough and . interesting work on the subject of biblical arch*ology , with which we are acquainted , is the large work of Jahn , ( whose name we have already had occasion to mention in this article , ) written in German , in five large octavo volumes . It is of course inaccessible to the generality of English readers . The abridgment in Latin , a second edition of which was published at Vienna in 1814 , under the following title , . drckeologia Biblica in Epitomen redacta a Johanne . Jahn . Editio secunda emendata : and of which a translation in English has lately been published in this country , is called by Mr Home in his appendix to the third volume , an elaborate compendium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it comes short , from the nature of the case , of the excellence of the original work , that , for extent and variety of learning , perspicuity of plan , and vividness and conciseness of statement , it is a hook which is very rarely surpassed . It is to this book , if we are not very much mistaken , that Mr Home is indebted more than to any other for the excellence of his third volume ; and we have only to say , if this be the case , that we regret not to perceive any more liberal acknowledgments of this obligation . The subject of biblical antiquities is one of prominent importance to the student in theology . If a person would be considered , as but ill prepared to enter into the full understanding and spirit of the Greek tragic poets , while perfectly ignorant of the institutions , manners , and customs of the Greeks  --  or of Horace , while equally limited in respect to his knowledge of the Romans , he must justly be considered , as being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full extent , the true meaning and spirit of the scriptures , while he // is unacquainted with the history , and arts , and occupations , and manners , and customs of the Jews . it is not , till we are possessed of such an acquaintance , till we are able in imagina-. tion to place ourselves by the banks of Jordan , or on the plains and deserts , where the Hebrew shepherds wandered , till we can summon around us the cedar-crowned hills , where warriors fought and poets loved to linger , with the circumstances of dress and manners and employments and feelings , it iS not till we have some understanding of these things , that we are in a situation to follow the story of those warriors , or to be enraptured with the song of those bards . We learn from the preface , that Mr Home 's work is to be introduced as a text-book into certain American seminaries , viz , the college it Princeton , New Jersey , and the Protestant Episcopal seminary at New Haven . At these seminaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly understood , and we have no hesitancy in saying , that the third volume of this introduction , ( the one on which we are remarking , ) will be found of essential assistance , and every way valuable . Among the multitude of subjects which naturally find their way into this volume , there are many , on which we might find it interesting and profitable to dwell , and to offer our remarks ; but if we should once give way to the temptation , we might prolong our speculations beyond the patience of our readers ; and we therefore proceed to a brief notice of the fourth volume . We have bestowed very decided commendation on Mr Home 's work , and say now that it does him credit , even wheia it is remembered that twenty years of labor have been expended upon it ; but truth obliges us to say , that in the fourth volume , especially in particular parts of it , there is a lamentable falling off . It was to this volume , which is an analysis of the old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very considerable share of interesting instruction , for the solution of many difficult questions , connected with the literary history , the grammatical structure , the style , &amp;c. of the different books , of which they are made up . On the fourth page , Mr Home assures us that nothing is more certain , than that Genesis was written , not compiled , or abridged , or altered , or sanctioned , but written by Moses . But can he have forgotten the reference which he made in the first vol* // nine to the theories of Astruc and Eichhorn , or have been ignorant of the fact , that the origin and authorship of Genesis are points , which for many years have called into exercise the controversial abilities of many eminent men on the continent of Europe ; and of course , that a mere assertion on a point of that kind , without argument and proof , must and ought to go for nothing . in our remarks on the second volume , which were necessarily concise , we took occasion to speak favorably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation ; although we at the same time recollected , that there were some things in his remarks , which under other circumstances we might have felt ourselves under the necessity of objecting to , and of controverting . We are led to make this remark in consequence of noticing the result of his principles of interpretation in the fourth volume , as far as types , the secondary or spiritual sense , &amp;c. are concerned . We observe , that he makes Adam , Abel , Enoch , Melchizedek , Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Moses , Aaron , the paschal lamb , the manna , the rock in Horeb , the mercy seat , the tabernacle , the ordinance of the red heifer , the water that issued from the rock , the brazen serpent , the cities of refuge , Joshua , Jonah in the whale 's belly , &amp;c. types of the Messiah . Now we have not the least disposition to deny the existence of types in the old testament ; but we think it is a subject ) on which a cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following remarks in the translation of Ernesti by professor Stuart , already alluded to . If it be asked , How far are we to consider the old testament as typical ? I should answer without any hesitation just so much of it is to be regarded as typical , as the new testament affirms to be so , and NO MORE . The fact , that any thing or event under the old testament dispensation , was designed to prefigure something under the new , can be known to us only by revelation ; and , of course , . ahl that is not designated by divine authority as typical , can never be made so by any authority less than that which guided the writers of the scriptures . ' p. 13 . If this rule , laid down by Mr Stuart* bad been adopted by our author , and if the passages which he refers to in the new testament had been examined with a critical and judicious eye , we apprehend that the formidable number of prefigurations to which he introduces us , would // have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high authority we should no doubt be pardoned in expecting , in an account of the prophet Isaiah , some notice of the controversy in respect to the genuineness or authorship of the twenty-six last chapters commonly attributed to him . Nor should we probably be considered as exorbitant , if , in the account of the prophet Ezekiel and his writings , we should expect some development of the principles on which an explanation might be given of the sublime , but peculiar visions to be found in them . But , while we are compelled to say , that the articles on the particular books of the old testament are not in all respects such as they should be , and are but too little in advance of what we had already learned from Dr Gray 's key , we must say at the same time , that those on the books of the new testament are of a somewhat different character , exhibit a more thorough acquaintance with the subject in hand , and will be found interesting and useful to the theological student . The cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the difference of attention which in England has been bestowed upon tJ*ie two testaments ; the new having been made the subject of learned speculations and of much critical investigation , while the old testament has been comparatively neglected . The references in the articles on the new testament to such names as Lardner , Campbell , I ( uino*l , Marsh , Michaclis , &amp;c. naturally leave the impression , however the merit of them may be estimated , that our author has not in this instance labored under the disadvantage of a want of acquaintance with the writings of men of laborious research and admirable learning . Indeed there is an intrinsic difficulty in giving a literary anci critical analysis of the books of the old testament ,  --  arising from the characteristics of the languages and the remoteness of the periods , in which they were written , from our defective acquaintance ( notwithstanding the able treatises that have been written Ofl the subject ) with biblical antiquities , from our very limited knowledge of the literature , customs , mythology , &amp;c. of the nations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  which is not found to an equal extent in a like investigation of those of the new testament . On a subject that has often been written about , almost any one may write ; on one that is plain and easy to be understood , where is the need of vigorous argumen t , and // profound investigation ? It is on subjects where there are great and intrinsit difficulties , that we expect such a writer as as Mr Home will show himself to advantage , by banishing misshapen hypotheses and substituting better ones , by discovering his acquaintance with the spirit of the age , whether more or less remote , by the suggestions , the arguments , the taste , and philosophy of a mind , powerful in itself , and instructed from the stores of ancient and modern learning . But we do not say any thing by way of complaint ; the ablest and best informed minds may somtimes fail in some of their investigations , like Leibnitz , in consequence of their ambition of universal conquest . The references to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already spoken , to such writers as Kuino*l , Koppe , Michaelis , and others , will justify us , we trust , in the remark which we are about to make , viz. that thorough-going biblical students have found it for their interest , and will continue to find it so , to consult those authors on the continent of Europe , who have written on subjects connected with the criticism of the bible . Of those writers , none have entered into that subject with more spirit and more success , as far as the mere literary part is concerned , than biblical critics of Germany . The interest , with which Mr home 's work has been received on this side of the Atlantic , is a proof , in addition to others , of the increasing zeal with which the studies , connected with the history , criticism , and interpretation of the bible , are pursued among us . We consider it a good omen , that a deep-felt interest in studies of this kind exists , and can not but hope , that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country is exerted from the pulpit , is great ; and we think that this influence will be favorable , and will have a tendency to correct the public morals , and elevate and purify the public sentiment , nearly in proportion ( other circumstances being equal ) to the intellectual endowments and acquisitions of those* who make their appearance as public religious teachers . But there is another point of view , in which the thorough study of the scriptures may be considered as important to all well-wishers to religion , and to all who take an interest in the prosperity of literature . It will encourage and keep alive among us an acquaintance with the treasures of oriental learning . The Hebrew language is inti // mately connected , both as respects the meaning of particular words and its general structure , with the Syriac , Chaldee , Arabic , Ethiopic , and Samaritan ; and we apprehend that , at the present day , a person is not in a condition to appear before the public , as a professed critic on the old testament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a respectable acquaintance with these dialects . This is the general feeling on the subject on this side of the water , and perhaps Mr Home , with all his labor and all his learning , has given too evident indications that , with respect to an acquaintance with oriental learning , he has come to the difficult task of writing an Introduclion to the Old Testament , with a less thorough preparation than might have been wished . But on this point we confess we are not in a situation to speak with certainty ; and it is quite possible , that Mr Home might have given us more decided proofs of his oriental learning , if the plan which he adopted in regard to his work had permitted , and if he could have done it without appearing to obtrude it unnecessarily upon our attention . A thorough acquaintance with the dialects which have been mentioned , not merely a slight initiation into them , seems to be necessary , not only in giving an account of the history and the merits of the translations , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical estimate of the particular books of the old testament ; since the elucidation of so many difficult passages depends on such an acquaintance , and a considerable portion of two of those books , Daniel and Ezra , is written , not in the Hebrew , but in the Chaldee . Probably the greatest defects in the translation of Isaiah by bishop Lowth , which is deservedly popular , arose either from his not possessing that thorough acquaintance with the dialects kindred to the Hebrew , which is usually pos*essed by distinguished biblical critics of the present day .
