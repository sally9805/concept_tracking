txt ART . VII. - Reporrs of Cases argued and determined in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts . By OCTAVIU* PICKERING , Counsellor at Law . Vol. 1 ; Containing the Cases from September Term , 1822 , in Berkshire , to October Term , 182*3 , in Middlesex . Boston , Wells &amp; Lilly . PP* 580 . IT is not our province to keep our readers thoroughly instructed in the laws , and make our review a substitute for a law journal . In this country the law is the only sovereign whose supremacy is acknowledged ; and as in monarchies and empires reports of the health of the king or em'peror are often made to the public , as being a matter in which all his subjects are interested , so we owe it to the public to give occasional notices of any material circumstances affecting the state and condition of this sovereign of ours . Some of our readers may possibly be of opinion , that we perform this part of our duty with an over scrupulous fidelity , and , in this legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some supererogatory labors . If it he so , and we lose sight of our proper objects by turning too often in pursuit of the law , it will be conceded to us , as some excuse , that we err on the safer side , for of all subjects that can occupy the community , none is more important , and of a more deep and lasting interest , than the character and state of our laws ; since no cause so intimately affects the dignity , prosperity , morals , and happiness // of the community , as the spirit and administration of those rules upon which the enjoyment of life , liberty , rights , and property , depend . Bitt we do not now propose to occupy our readers with the subject of codification , nor to go into any elnborate disquisition , but merely to give a very brief notice of the volume of which the title is prefixed to this arti*. cle ; to which we are induced , in a great measure , by the circumstance , that it is the first published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before speaking of our particular subject , we will , however , by way of further apology , premise a word respecting a complaint repeated very frequently of late in regard to law books . As long ago as the time of Solomon , it seems that there was no end of making many books ; ' and , some two thousand years since , the Greeks found much study to be a weariness , ' as appeal 's by their maxim that a great book is a great evil ,  --  to the reader , they meant , no doubt ,  --  and to one who must both purchase and read , the evil is doubled ; and of this sort of evils , a law book is certainly not among the least . The men of the law seem to have suffered under more than their just share of this general and ancient calamity , if we may believe their lamentations over the ratio of their number of books , to that of their clients . On this ground we hear loud calls from many quarters for codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , at some age or other , become obsolete ; or at least that some device may be hit upon to bring this overgrown science within reasonable compass ; ' and men out of the profession , though not at all surprised that every one is not , and can not be , an adept in theology , physic , natural philosophy , botany , &amp;c. yet seem to be surprised that the law can not be so abridged , simplified , and elucidated , that every boy leaving the public schools should be a good practising attorney ; and that a learned , deep read counsellor at law , should not become a rare and useless curiosity . We will not , however , enlarge upon these interesting subjects in this place , but remark merely that all which has been said upon them , by way of complaints and projects , shows no ground of objection to the publishing of reports . These exhibit an accurate and authentic history of the administration of the laws , of which it is of vital importance to the // well being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to inform themselves . A barrister , who through the medium of the reports , addresses his arguments to the whole profession , both of the present and future times , feels a much stronger motive to make himself completely master of his subject , than if the knowledge of the case which he argues were limited to the court before which it is pending , and the auditors present . A judge , who knows that his decisions , with their reasons , will be recorded and made public , and compared with each other , and tested by those of other judges and courts of former and aftertimes , and yet is ready to throw out hasty conceptions and first impressions , in crude and loose propositions , must be indifferent to his own reputation , and public opinion , as well as regardless of right and wrong , and of his obligations to parties and the public . The practice of reporting decisions , with their grounds and reasons , is indeed an insuperable harrier to the corruption of judges ; and what is of greater importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immeasurable distance from any fear of direct corruption , ) it is the strongest possible guard against negligent and inconsiderate decrees . The motives , on the part of the court ; to give able opinions , well fortified by reasons and authorities , are so much strengthened and enforced by the practice of reporting , that we may safely say that the judge , who , notwithstanding these motives , ventures to dispose of important and difficult questions , in a summary and superficial manner , must do so under the conviction that he is totally incompetent to an elaborate investigation , or from some constitutional or habitual disqualification for his place , which amounts to a moral necessity of deciding without weighing . The publication of reports , again , affords the only means of informing the community of the laws by which their conduct is to be governed , and their rights to be determined , since the combined wisdom , talents , and experience of the country , if they could be brought to act in concert , and with the greatest advantages , upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would anticipate and provide for all cases , and would not give rise to innumerable questions of interpretation ; and the multitude of contracts , which men are continually making , and which a good system of legislation takes care to leave them free to make , is incessantly giving rise to questions of // construction ; and the interpretations and constructions adopted by the courts are quite as important as the laws and contracts that give rise to them ; they are in fact a part of the law , and it is as requisite that they should be fixed and made known , as that laws should be made and published . A people that has not the means of being informed of the decisions of its courts , and the reasons and principles of those decisions , may in truth he said not to have the means of knowing the laws by which they are governed . And the practice of publishing reports of adjudged cases is the only way of establishing these constructions , and interpretations , upon a secure foundation in the reasons and principles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , recorded and recognised usages . There are the same reasons for publishing reports of adjudged cases , as for publishing laws , and no expense incurred by a government is better bestowed , or goes more directly and effectually to promote the great and fundamental purposes of civil institutions , than the encouragement given for the publication of such reports . We were accordingly surprised at the difficulty recently made in the legislature of Vermont , in voting a sum of money for this purpose , and at the very small amount , ( one hundred and fifty dollars if we recollect rightly , ) that was deemed sufficient . It is still more remarkable , that some of the states give no encouragement at all to the publication and distribution of reports of judicial decisions , and in fact have no such reports . Others depend upon the voluntary labors of such lawyers , as may be disposed to undertake reporting , from hopes of reputation , and , in some instances perhaps , of a little profit , in respect to which the most modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be not disappointed , the profits afforded in our market by a publication of this description are in general so trifling , that if the reporter obtains for his time and labor , a recompense equivalent to the wages of a common daylaborer , he owes the public a debt of gratitude for their liberal patronage . But this is a very precarious way of supplying the community with the means of knowing by what laws and rules of conduct they are governed ; and to depend upon it , is like a man 's neglecting to provide for his household , trusting that a neighbor , induced by charity or some other // motive , will supply his neglect . Such a family has the pro* pect of being ill supplied , with the chance of being starved . The office of a reporter is highly responsible and intensely laborious , and deserves a liberal compensation . It is the practice in the Massachusetts , as it is in the United States , and in many , and we believe most of the State courts , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult questions brought before them . The practice appears to be otherwise in most of the English courts , which gives the judges sometimes opportunity , and sometimes no doubt , occasion , to say , that the reporter must have mistaken the language of the court . The only objection to the practice of giving written opinions is the additional labor it costs the judges ; but the manual labor of writing out an opinion is very trifling in comparison with that of making it up , and choosing and arranging the auihorities and reasons on which it is founded ; as every lawyer experiences as often he has occasion to give a written opinion . This inconvenience does not , therefore , outweigh the reasons in favor of this practice , inasmuch as it secures a more thorough and laborious consideration of questions on the part of the court ; is an adniitional guard against crude and hasty opinions , and it checks the expression of broad and general propositions , under which indolence and inabdity are always ready to shelter themselves . Lord Ellen borough somewhere recoin mends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the court , for the purpose of ' purifying the mind from the generalities ' that had crept into the subsequent cases . These generalities ' make it very easy to decide the pending question , as they afford a great space within which to bring it , or , to use a logical term , they furnish a very comprehensive major , which being once assumed , may be easily shown to include the minor , or particular question before the court ; and the premises being conceded as a r-ov duco , the conclusion is irresistible . But very soon another case will he offered to the court , which comes literally within this generality , ' and yet too plainly requires a different decision . Accordingly this case is decided upon its particular circumstances , ' or is considered to he an exception , and then another exception follows , until at length you have nothing but exceptions , and the rule disappears . The greatest talents , // learning , diligence , and caution can not secure judges from occasionally laying down propositions in too broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Justice Jackson , is naturally drawn particularly to the case before them ; and though all that is said by them may be correct as applied to that case , yet when applied to another not then under consideration , it may , if adopted literally and in its whole extent , lead to results which the court did not anticipate , and would not have approved . ' Whatever , therefore , puts the court on its guard against uttering propositions that , lead to such results , is of great importance , and the practice of giving written Opinions , to be published as a sort of testimony in perpetnarn me moriam , is the most effectual guard for this purpose . And a reported opinion of a court ought to be written , or at least approved , by the judge to whom it is attributed , for the purpose of giving to it its just authority . And all the reasons in favor of opinions prepared in writing , by the court , and indeed , in favor of reporting opinions at all , may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge by whom the opinion is drawn up . Except in matters of practice , and the most distinct and insulated cases , in which the point decided , and the grounds and extent of the decision , can not possibly be mistaken , we always regret to see per curiam prefixed to the opinion of the court . Though the practice of giving written opinions upon all important questions abridges the labor , and still more the responsibility of the reporter , yet there is quite enough left for him to do and to be responsible for . lie must , in the first place , select the cases to be deemed of sufficient interest and importance to publish , and those in which the facts , and grounds of the decision can be definitely and satisfactorily stated ; and as he can not make this selection beforehand , he is under the necessity of taking full and minute notes of all the cases argued . In many cases brought before a court for decision , the law of the case is so blended and confounded with the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the whole case any precise definite point decided , or ground of decision . If the court assigns many distinct grounds of decision , without saying how far their opinion is determined by each , or whether any one ground is conclusive , there is nothing to report . Very often a decision turns wholly upon // a construction of facts , that are not likely ever to recur again in the same combination . It is in many instances worth while for the parties to present a question to the court , which yet is not so important and of such general interest , as to be a proper subject of a report . A reporter must of course depend upon the counsel and the court for his materials , hut it can hardly be expected that the cases brought before a State tribunal are so stated and argued by the counsel , and so fully investigated by the court , and at the same time of such importance and interest , as to make it expedient to report them all . Provided the reporter exercises his own discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting cases to report , a publication of a third , or half , or at most two thirds of the cases argued and determined , is quite as useful as to publish the whole number . To select this third or half of the cases requires a very attentive examination of them all . To make a good selection of cases , in which not any of importance are omitted , and not any that would be superfluous , are reported , and to present perspicuous and satisfactory statements of the facts and the arguments of counsel , requires not a little talent , discrimination , labor , legal science and skill ; and in all these respects Mr Pickering 's volume is , as far as our information extends , entirely satisfactory to the profession , and gives him a just title to the reputation of an able reporter . We have not noticed any case in the volume which is not worth reporting . The cases are stated with great precision and perspicuity , and we have not met with an instance in which it was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . When one reads or hears a story well told , or a statement of facts well made , nothing seen-is more easy than to tell the story or make the statement , and yet it is a thing in which few people suc** ceed . A lawyer has frequent occasion to regret the rareness , of this talent , when he finds himself obliged to grope his way to a knowledge of a case in an obscure wilderness of facts , spread over some three or four pages , without any arrangement , full of circumlocutions and repetitions , and presenting all together , not a case , but only the rude , undigested materials of one . The profession owes its thanks to a reporter who gives his cases in a succinct , lucid manner , and , at the same time , without omitting what is material ; for he saves . // them from the loss of money in purchasing a mass of surplussage , and from the loss of time in bringing together and arranging the disuncta membra of the cases . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fault sometimes to be met with in hooks of reports , where the reporter gives all the facts with sufficient minuteness , and hands over the subject to the judge , to begin where he began , and go over the whole story again ; or at least as much of it as was necessary to have been told at all . We do not menu to irnply that the excellence of a report is inversely as its length ; wherever a material circumstance is omitted the report is useless , because it is impossible to know what was decided , and it is worse than useless , because it may lead to mistakes of the law , and will be perpetually cited in all cases of any affinity to it , for it will fit one almost as well as another . Not a few cases of this description , more especially of those at nisi pri us , have been bandied at the bar , through all the successive generations of lawsuits , and may always continue to be brought into service to increase the array of authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be confuted or overruled . In all cases of doubt , as to the materiality of facts , it is safer to err , if at all , by stating , rather than by omitting them . But there is no excuse for mere repetitionr , and we have not observed any instance in which Mr Pickering needs any such excuse . One of the most difficult parts of a reporter 's labor is that of reporting the arguments of counsel . Some have doubted the expediency of giving much space to this part of a report , saying that the case and the opinion of the court present all that is decided , together with the authorities , and the grounds of the decision . In many cases , in some reports , as the Modern Reports and those of Dallas , on the contrary , the arguments of counsel are given , and the opinion of the court omitted ; the reporter tells us that such and such were the arguments of counsel on each side , and such was the decree of the court , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opinion is certainly to be preferred to the arguInents , if one only is to be given ; but it is better to report both where the question is difficult or important , and where there are both to be reported ; for cases are sometimes submitted without argument , and sometimes decided by a naked // decree , the grounds of which are not stated . The practice of reporting the arguments is of great importance in its influence upon the character of the profession , and so upon the administration of the laws in general . When all the reasons and authorities presented by the counsel , on each side of a question , are made a part of the report , it puts the court under a necessity of fortifying their decision against the reasons and authorities adduced to the contrary , and thus guaranties a diligent exanination of the subject . And then it is but just that counsel , while they are responsible for the presentment of the case , should have whatever credit they may be entitled to , on account of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In consulting an authority it is often of importance , in order to estimate its weight and bearing , to know how the question was presented to the court ; and the arguments of the counsel not unfrequently throw great light upon the judicial opinion , and serve as a key to the meaning , application , and force of the expressions used by the judges . The reason for reporting the arguments of counsel at all , also point out the proper mode of reporting them . There are not wanting instances of American cases in which the reporter favors his readers with a great deal of the declamation of the counsel , including rhetorical flourishes , flights of fancy , and appeals from the understanding to the imagination , all literally recorded with as great fidelity , as if the reporter were a sworn stenographer . This is to reduce the business of reporting to a sort of clerkship , in which the labor of the hand takes precedence of that of the mind . Arguments reported in this fashion are a double loss to the profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , in general , the argument itself , for they rarely read these interminable discourses , the conteiits of which remain , forever , a secret known only to the reporter himself . It is enough if he gives concisely and distinctly , all the positions taken by the counsel , with all the reasons and authorities by which he supports them ; and to sift these out , and present them distinctly , coneisely , and fully , is a work of great labor and difficulty , in which it requires much diligence and skill in the reporter , to be short , and at the same time satisfactory . In this part we think Mr Pickering 's reports are exceedingly well made ; no // lawyer can have consulted them without remarking the condensed , perspicuous , full , and elaborate manner , in which he has given abstracts of the arguments , throughout this volume . And we more particularly notice this part of bis reports , for the purpose of confirming and increasing the public expectation and claims , in respect to subsequent volumes , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter is most likely to begin to drowse , unless his vigilance is excited . Dean Swift 's remarks on the importance of indexes , which he illustrates by a string of ludicrous comparisons of a book and its index , to a ship and  --  the rudder , &amp;c. are gravely applicable to the case of law hooks , of which the index is by no means the least important part . A book of reports , especially , if it be any treasure at all , is to most purposes a hidden treasure , except so far as its contents are disclosed by the iadex . It is not surprising , that persons conversant with this sort of publications should sometimes be disappointed in finding some things in the reports that are not in the index , and some things in the index , that are not in the reports ; for to make a complete index , requires a clear perception of the points and bearings of the cases , great vigilance and patience in noting them all , and conciseness , precision , and perspictiity in expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Ijuished , before the abstract of it is made , lie is very likely to make it in too great haste . We have not examined Mr Pickering 's abstracts of his cases sufficiently to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all of them , but in a great number which we have examined , we have not met with instances of any that are slovenly , or obscure , or that do not satisfactorily express the points in the case ; and we observe in some instances that he is particularly careful not to indicate a broader decision than the court makes . A few of the abstracts include a perhaps , and the cases fully bear it out ; but we doubt whether it is not more secure both to courts and to those , who must adopt their decisions as authority , that the judges should limit themselves to the expression of their opinions and doubts . In regard to the subjects of decision in these reports , we do not propose to go into any particular examination of any of them . Many interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidences of patient delibeation and laborious research discoverable in the opinioxis of // the judges , reflect honor upon this tribunal , and upon the state of which it is so important an institution , and so great an ornament . There are in this volume three instances of decisions in pursuance of the opinion of a majority of the court , in Opposition to that of two of the judges in one case , and that of the Chief Justice , in the others . In the first case , a deputy sheriff had , in levying an execution , seized the goods of a Mr Campbell , who thereupon brought an action of trespass against the deputy sheriff , in which he recovered a judgment , and by virtue of the execution issued upon this judgment , the deputy sheriff had been committed to gaol , whence he was discharged by order of law ; and the judgment remained in full force and not satisfied ; and the question was whether , after this , Campbell could maintain an action of trespass de bonir asporta is against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which he had already recovercd a judgment against his deputy . Chief Justice Parkgr , and Justices Jackson , and Putnam , were of opinion that lie could not ; and so , accordingly , was the decision ; Justices Thatcher , and Wilde were of opinion that he could maintain the action . The grounds of dissent , are given by Mr Justice Wilde . The second case , in which the court were divided , relates to the construction of the clause in the bill of rights prefixed to the Constitution of Massachusetts , and of the acts of the legislature , respecting the support of religious worship . Justices Thatcher , Putnam , and Wilde , were of opinion that if a person becomes a member of ' a religious society without the limits of th' parish in which he resides , and gives proper notice of this fact , he is not liable to pay any tax for the support of public worship in the religious society of the parish where he resides ; whether the two religious societies he of time same , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice was of opinion that an inhabitant of a parish is not , in this case , exempted from such tax , unless the religious society of which lie becomes a member , is of a different denomination . Elaborate opinions are given in favor of these different constructions of the bill of rights , and the acts of the legislature . The reporter has , in some few instances , added notes of authorities relating to the subjects of decision . The time that elapses from the giving of an opinion , until the publication // of the report of it , is not long enough to give an opportunity for many new decisions in other courts relating to the points involved in the cases reported , and it can hardly be expect*. ed of a reporter to go through all the indexes , in each case , to pick up what may have been overlooked by the counsel , on each side , and by the court ; and accordingly but very few additions of this sort can be looked for . In one instance , p. 283 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Barnewall and Alderson , and subjoins-what we think might have been better omitted  --  a few remarks upon the question , whether the case in I3arnewall and Alderson , if it had been brought under the attention of the court , would have influenced their decision . The reader is prepared to follow the editor of a book of reports , that has for some time heen before the public , through a range of speculations , and arguments , as well as authorities , hut there are many reasons why a reporter , more especially an official one , should confine himself , in the original publication of decisions recently made , to a report and references . The case cited in this instance is certainly very close , in its circumstances , to that decided by the court , and is well worth citing , and the remarks are so short , and at the same time so pertinent , that we should not have thought of excepting to their insertion , but for the practice that has been adopted by other reporters in a few instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus blending things , which have very little connexion with each other ; and making it necessary for many members of the profession to purchase treatises which they may not want .
