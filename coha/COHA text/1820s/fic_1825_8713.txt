SCENE I.  --  A room in the house of Mr. Elton .  --  Mrs. Daggett , Mrs. Convers , and Mrs. Wilson enter , led in by Mary Hull . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Mary , where is Jane ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma'am , taking on bitterly . A person would think that she had lost her uncles and aunts , as well as her father and mother .  --  ( aside ) And she might as well , for any good they will do her . ( Exit . ) Mrs. Daggett . Mrs. Daggett  --  I trust it is not expected that I should take Jane upon my hands ; for I am not so well off as either of you  --  to be sure I have no children ; but then Mr. Daggett and myself have calculated to do a great deal for the " Foreign Missionary Society ; " no longer ago than this morning , we both agreed to pay the expense of one of the young Cherokees , at the school at Cornwall . There is a great work going on in the world ; and as long as we have the heart given us to help it , we can not feel it our duty to withdraw any aid for a mere worldly purpose . Mrs. Convers . Mrs. Convers  --  I have not any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ; I have ways enough to spend my money , without sending it to Owyhee or the Foreign School . My husband and I have worked hard , and saved all for our children ; and now we mean that they shall make as good a figure as any body 's children in the country . It took a great deal of money to pay the dancing-master , and the music-master ; it is quite impossible for you , Sisters , to think how much it takes to dress a family of girls genteelly . It is not now , as it used to be when we were girls : now-a-days , girls must have merino shawls , and their winter hats , and summer hats , and prunella shoes , and silk stockings ;  --  it is quite impossible to be decent without them . Besides , I do not live in the same town with Jane , and it is not natural I should feel for her . It is my decided opinion , that Jane had better be put out at once , at some place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to it ; and I should advise , too , to her changing her name  --  the child is too young to care about a name ,  --  for I should be very much mortified , to have it known in the town where I live , that my daughters had a cousin that was a hired girl . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  I desire to be thankful , that I have been kept from any such sinful courses as sending my children to a dancing-school ; no one can say , that I have not done my duty by them ; the minister 's family is not kept more strict than mine . Mrs. Convers . Mrs. Convers  --  No , I presume not ; and by all accounts , it is not more disorderly . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Well , that 's not our fault , Mrs. Convers , if we plant and water , we can not give the increase .  --  Sister Convers , I feel it to be my duty to warn you  --  you , the daughter and granddaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should own that you send your children to dancing-school , astonishes and grieves my spirit . Do you know that Mr. Carrol , in reporting the illeg. his parish , mentions that not one of the girls who attended dancing-school were among the converts ; whereas two , who had engaged to attend it , but had received a remarkable warning in a dream , were among the first and brightest ? I would as soon follow one of my children to the grave , as to see her in that broad road to destruction , which leads through a ball-room . Re-enter Mary Hull . Mary . Mary Hull  --  Have you determined , Ladies , what is to be done with Jane ? Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Ah ! I had quite forgotten the object of our meeting . Well , as I have no " dancing-masters to pay , " and have not " this morning agreed " to adopt a Cherokee , I can afford to take Jane a little while . The girl must not think of depending upon me for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I please with my own , yet I can not justify myself in " taking the children 's meat "  --  Mary . Mary Hull  --  " Throw it to the dogs " ! ! Shame , shame , upon you ! has pride turned your hearts to stone , that ye can not shelter this poor little lamb in your fold ? Ah ! you may spread your branches , like the green bay tree , but the tempest will come , and those who look for you shall not find you ; but this little frost-bitten bud shall bloom in the paradise of God forever . Mrs. Daggett . Mrs. Daggett  --  What does she mean ? Has Jane experienced religion ? Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Experienced religion !  --  No.  --  How should she ? She has not been to a meeting since her mother was first taken sick ; and no longer ago than the day after her mother 's death , when I talked to her of her corrupt state by nature , and the opposition of her heart , ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar season , to open to her the great truths of religion ; and I was faithful to her soul , and did not scruple to declare the whole counsel , ) she looked at me as if she was in a dumb stupor ; I told her the judgments of an offended God were made manifest towards her in a remarkable manner ; and then I put it to her conscience , whether if she was sure her mother had gone where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched , she should be reconciled to the character of God , and be willing herself to promote his glory , by suffering that just condemnation . She did not reply one word , or give the least sympton of a gracious understanding . But when Mrs. Harvey entered , just as I was concluding , and passed her arm around Jane , and said to her , " My child , " " God does not willingly grieve nor afflict you , " the child sobbed out , " Oh no ! Mrs. Harvey , so my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , this does not look as if Jane had a hope . Mrs. Daggett . Mrs. Daggett  --  Well , as I am going , in the afternoon , to attend a meeting in a distant part of the town , ( for no one can say that distance or weather ever keeps me from my duties ) I have no more time to waste . ( Exit . ) Mrs. Convers . Mrs. Convers  --  I am very glad , indeed , the child is going to be so well provided for . ( Exit . ) Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Mary , you may inform Jane that she may come to my house this afternoon , and stay there for the present . ( Exit . ) Mary . Mary Hull  --  ( aside ) " The hypocrites hope shall perish . " ( Exit . ) SCENE II . Jane 's chamber .  --  Jane , sitting at her work-table with her mother 's Bible before her , is meditating upon her situation . Her whole appearance is that of an Orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY . Mary . Mary Hull  --  Well Jane , your aunt Wilson has concluded to take you for the present , and says that you may come this afternoon . ( Jane bursts into tears . ) But , my dear Jane , do not be down-hearted . There has One ' taken you up who will not leave you , nor forsake you , ' ' The fires may be about you , but they will not kindle on you . '  --  Make the Bible your counsellor ; you will always find some good word there , that will be a bright light to you in the darkest night : and do not forget the daily sacrifice of prayer ; for , as the priests under the old covenant were nourished by a part of that which they offered , so , when the sacrifice of praise is sent upward by the broken and contrite heart , there is a strength cometh back upon our own souls : blessed be his name , it is what the world can not give . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend  --  your words bring comfort to my soul ; and your sympathy in my sufferings , cheers my drooping spirit . Could I practice what you teach , I should find within my breast  --  through all the sufferings and the trials of life  --  a heaven . Mary . Mary Hull  --  My dear young friend , strive with all your might to imitate the example , imbibe the spirit , and obey the commands of our blessed Master  --  and then , with the divine blessing on your efforts , you will find what it is to be truly happy .  --  But , Jane , it is time to be packing up your things . Jane . Jane Elton  --  They are all together , Mary , in that trunk ; but if I could be permitted , to take  --  some  --  of my  --  Mary . Mary Hull  --  " Mother 's clothes " you would say , I suppose , Jane . Well , I assure you , you may ; for the creditors sent word to me , that they would not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , I advise you to keep all your things out of the sight of your craving cousins . Where are your mother 's clothes , Jane ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I have packed them all into the chest , color=redPage 6 that stands in her chamber . But , Mary , do you think that I may be permitted to take this ? ( taking up the Bible . ) Mary . Mary Hull  --  Certainly , no one will dispute your right to it ; it is not like worldly goods ; we will not touch the spoils , though we were tempted by more than the " goodly Babylonish garment , the two hundred shekels of silver , and the wedge of gold " that made Achan to sin . ( Jane puts the Bible into the trunk , and locks it . ) Servant enters and delivers a note to Jane . Mary . Mary Hull  --  Jacob , you may take that trunk , and the chest you will find in Mrs. Elton 's chamber , to Mrs. Wilson 's . Servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunk . ) Mary . Mary Hull  --  What have you there , Jane ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  A note from my aunt Wilson . ( giving it to Mary . ) Mary . Mary Hull  --  ( reads ) " My dear Jane ; in packing up your things , I advise you to secure some small articles , that will never be missed : some of the spoons , table-linen , your mother 's ivory work-box , &c.; &c.;  --  As I have undertaken the charge of you for the present , it is but right you should take my advice . There is no doubt my brother 's creditors have cheated him a hundred sold the amount of these things ; for , poor man ! with all his faults , he was so generous , that any body could take him in ; besides , though these things might help to pay the expense I must be at in keeping you , they will be a mere nothing divided among so many creditors  --  the dust on the balance . "  --  Poor woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much of this vile dust , that when she is weighed , her scale will be " found wanting . " No , Jane , let us keep clean hands , and then we shall have light hearts . This foolish aunt of yours will try you like the fire , but I look to see you come out of it as gold from the furnace : keep up a good heart , my dear , it is a long lane that never turns . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE III . A mountainous part of the country . A by-road , that winds among the rocks ; an old hut seen at a distance , over the door of which is a sign with the inscription  --  " Cake and Beer for Sale . " Thunder and lightning . Enter Mr. Lloyd . and his servant Peter . Peter . Peter  --  Oh dear ! Mr. Lloyd , do n't go to see the place to-night . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  I must , Peter ; the sale takes place to-morrow , and I hope to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a pretty place ? Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  I do n't know ; and that is the very reason why I wish to see it before the time of sale . Peter . Peter  --  ( flash of lightning ) Oh dear !  --  I never did  --  in all the days of my life  --  see the clouds make so fast ; why it is n't more than fifteen minutes , since the first speck rose above the hill before us , and now there is not blue sky enough for a man to swear by :  --  the lightning will be saved the trouble of coming down to us , for if our poor legs ever carry us to the top of the hill , we can reach up and take it . ( another flash ) O-h ! ! ( springing from the ground ) I 'm sorry I said so . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Dost thou fear the lightning , Peter ? Peter . Peter  --  Oh ! yes sir ! ever since my poor brother died , I 've been afraid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he die , Peter ? I never heard of it before . Peter . Peter  --  Why , sir , three summers ago , he was killed by lightning ! Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Ah ! relate to me the particulars . Peter . Peter  --  Well sir :  --  hem  --  one Sunday afternoon there came up a heavy shower , and my brother was sitting at the garret window reading a novel  --  I do n't mean sitting in a chair by the window , but sitting right on the bottom of the window . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Yes , I understand thee Peter . Peter  --  Well sir , there came a dreadful flash of lightning , and gave him such a start , that he fell out of the window and broke his neck ! ! Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  That was shocking !  --  But , Peter , it was not the lightning but the fall that killed him . Peter . Peter  --  No sir ; but the lightning was the means of his fall  --  ( another flash ; Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm dead ! I 'm dead ! ! Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Oh no , Peter , I think not ; come , get up , and let us go on till we find a shelter . Peter . Peter  --  ( getting up ) Do n't you smell brimstone , Sir ? Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  No , no , I believe thou art unhurt . Peter . Peter  --  If I live through this shower , I 'll have a lightning-rod made for my back the first thing I do . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Peter , what is that off at a distance , a hut ? Peter . Peter  --  Yes sir , I believe it looks like an old shell of a thing ; but what is that over the door ? a sign , as sure as preaching . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Read the inscription , Peter ; I am near-sighted . Peter . Peter  --  I ca n't read very well , sir , but I will do my best :  --  " C-a-k  --  Cake  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal . " Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  " Sale " you mean , Peter ; " Cake and Beer for sale . " Peter . Peter  --  Oh , yes sir , that is what I meant . I wonder what they find here to make them of ? Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  We will go and see ; at any rate , I think we may find shelter there from the rain which I hear at a distance . Peter . Peter  --  Yes sir , any thing to hide us from this terrible lightning . ( Exeunt. )  --  ( another flash ) Peter . Peter  --  ( behind the scenes ) O  --  Oh dear !  --  dear ! ! SCENE IV . Inside of the hut . Thunder and lightning continue ; rain and hail . Four hearty looking children sit at a round table , on which stands a milk-pen containing porridge ; Tempe , their mother , is crumbling in bread . Young child in the cradle . The mountaineer sits with his legs folded under him . Tempe . Tempe  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon in your right hand , ' dolphe , and do n't eat like a pig . ( rain . ) Mountaineer . Mountaineer  --  A tough shower coming on , I guess , Tempe . Tempe . Tempe  --  ( taking the child from the cradle ) Yes , I believe so ; and we ought to be thankful that we have so good a house to shelter us from it .  --  ( flash of lightning . ) Peter . Peter  --  ( withou t ) O  --  Oh dear ! Tempe . Tempe  --  What can be the matter ! ( knocking . ) Mount . Mountaineer  --  Come in . Enter Mr. Lloyd and Peter wet . Mr. Lloyd . Robert Lloyd  --  Friend , I crave permission to remain under thy roof , till the rain subsides . Mount . Mountaineer  --  With all my heart , sir , you 're entirely welcome . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  I thank thee . ( Tempe hands a chair . ) Peter . Peter  --  Have you a lightning-rod on your house , sir ? Mount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need lightning rods up here , where the trees are so much higher than the house . Why , friend , you look scare't  --  pretty pokerish weather , to be sure , but then we do n't mind it up here . Peter . Peter  --  I 've had some wonderful ' scapes , to day , I 'll assure you , sir ; two or three times the lightning come so near me , that I could smell brimstone ; and once , sir , I thought I was dead surely , for  --  Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  My servant has been very much terrified this afternoon , and his fears magnify the circumstances . Mount . Mountaineer  --  Oh sir , we do n't mind it up here ;  --  Desdemony , do n't scatter your victuals so .  --  But last week , sir , there was the most tedious spell of weather I have seen since the week before last thanksgiving , when my wife and I went down into the lower part of Becket , to hear Deacon Hollister 's funeral sarmon.  --  Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ?  --  " I do n't see , " says he , " the use of the minister preaching up so much about hell-fire , " says he , " it is a very good doctrine , " says he , " to preach down on Connecticut river , but , " says he , " I should not think it would frighten any body in such a cold place as Becket . " ( another flash . ) Peter . Peter  --  Oh ! Mount . Mountaineer  --  A pretty smart flash , to be sure ; but , as I was saying , it is nothing to that storm we had last week .  --  Velorus , pull that hat out of the window , so the gentleman can see .  --  There , sir , just look at that big maple tree , that was blown down ; if it had come one yard nearer my house , it would have crushed it to atoms .  --  Ah , this is a nico place as you will find any where , to bring up boys ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wind roaring about them , and the thunder rattling right over their heads : why they do n't mind it any more than my wife 's spinning wheel , which , to be sure , makes a dumb noise sometimes . Mr. Lloyd . Robert Lloyd  --  Friend , thou hast a singular fancy about names ; what may be the name of that chubby little girl who is playing with her spoon ? Mount . Mountaineer  --  Yes , sir , I am a little notional about names ; that girl , sir , I call Octarg , and that lazy little dog that sits by her , is Rodolphus . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  And this baby  --  this must be Vespasian or Agricola . Mount Mountaineer  --  No , sir , no ; I met with a disappointment about that boy 's name  --  what you may call a slip between the cup and the lip  --  when he was born , the women asked me what I meant to call him ? I told them , I did not mean to be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I get my names , I buy a book of those pedlars that are going over the mountain with tin-ware and brooms , and books and pamphlets , and one notion and another ; that is , I do n't buy out and out , but we make a swap ; they take some of my wooden dishes , and let me have the vally in books ; for you must know I am a great reader , and mean all my children shall have larning too , though it is pretty tough scratching for it . Well , sir , as I was saying about this boy , I found a name just to hit my fancy  --  for I can pretty generally suit myself  --  the name was Sophronius ; but just about that time , as the deuce would have it , my wife 's father died ; and the gin'ral had been a very gin'rous man to us , and so to compliment the old gentleman , I concluded to call him Solomon Wheeler . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  There is something , my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up for thy loss . Tempe . Tempe  --  The child is not old enough to make its manners to the gentleman , but he is as much beholden to him as if he could . ( Children crowd round their mother , to see the present . ) Mount . Mountaineer  --  Brother guess it is easier getting money down country , than it is up on the hills . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Very true , friend : and I should like to know how thou eanst support thy family here . Thou dost not appear to have any farm . Mount . Mountaineer  --  No , sir , it would puzzle me , with my legs , to take care of a farm ; but then I always say , that as long as a man has his wits , he has something to work with . This is a pretty cold sappy soil up here , but we make out to raise all our sarse , and enough besides to fat a couple of pigs on ; then , sir , as you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beer , and tansy bitters  --  a nice trade for a cold stomach  --  Tempe . Tempe  --  May be the gentleman would like to take a drop , he 's been out in the shower ? Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  No , I thank thee . Mount . Mountaineer  --  There is considerable travel on the road , and people get considerable dry by the time they get up here , and we find it a good business ; and then I turn wooden bowls and dishes , and go out peddling once or twice a year ; and there is not an old wife , or a young one either for the matter of that , but I can coax them to buy a dish or two ; I take my pay in provisions or clothing ; all the cash I get , is by the beer and cake : and now , sir , though I say it , that may be should not say it , there is not a more independent man in the town of Becket than I am , though there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister 's tax , and my school tax , as reg'lar as any of them . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  I should think , that a person of thy ingenuity , would contrive some way to repair the house ; for I perecive that it is very much decayed . Mount . Mountaineer  --  Why , yes sir , I suppose I might ; but then I 'm calculating to build in the fall , and we may as well let it be till then . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  To build ! Do explain to me how that is to be done ? Mount . Mountaineer  --  Why , sir .  --  Tempe , hand me that box on the shelf :  --  there , sir , my woman and I agreed to save all the cash we could get for two years , and I should not be afraid to venture there is thirty dollars there , sir . The neighbours in these parts are very kind to a poor man ; one will draw the timber , and another will saw the boards , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own rum into the bargain . Oh , sir , it must be a poor shack that ca n't make a turn to get a house over his head . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  ( taking a bill from his pocket book )  --  There , my friend , is ten dollars ; and I wish it may be expended so as to give to thy new dwelling such conveniences , as will enable thy wife to keep it neat . It will help on the trade too ; for depend upon it , there is nothing makes a house look so inviting to a traveller , as a cleanly air . Mount . Mountaineer  --  You are the most gin'rous man , sir , that ever travelled this way ; and if I do n't remember your advice , you may say there is no such thing as gratitude upon earth . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Well , my friend , as the rain is over for the present , I must proceed on my way ;  --  farewell . Mount .  --  Tempe . A Mountaineer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit Mr. Lloyd  --  Peter following . Mount . Mountaineer  --  Tempe , if the days of miracles weren't quite entirely gone by , I should think we had " entertained angels unawares . " Tempe . Tempe  --  I think you might better say , that the angels have entertained us . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  A room at Mrs. Wilson's.  --  Mrs. Wilson and Jane present . ENTER SERVANT . Servant . Servant  --  Here is a note , Ma'am , for Mary Hull . ( Mrs. Wilson breaks the seal . ) Page 14 Serv . Servant  --  I believe it was not meant for you , Ma'am . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  I do n't mean that any one 's right , in my house , shall be prior to mine . You may leave the room , sir , and tell Mary Hull to come to me . ( Exit servant , leaving the things on the table . ) ( Reads ) " Robert Lloyd , having purchased the place of the late Mr. Elton , would be glad to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wages , and all other matters , shall be arranged to her satisfaction . He takes the liberty to send by the messenger , for Jane Elton , a work-box , dressing-glass , and a few other small articles , for which he has no use , and which , he hopes , she will do him the favor to retain , on account of the value they must have in her eyes . "  --  So , miss , you have seen fit to disobey the first order I took the trouble to give you . I should like to know how you dared to leave these things after my positive orders ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I did not understand your note , Ma'am , to contain positive orders ; and Mary and I did not think it was quite right to take the things . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Right ! pretty judges of right to be sure ! she a hired girl , and a Methodist into the bargain . I do n't know how she dares to judge over my head ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I allow no child in my house to know right from wrong ; children have no reason , and ought to be very thankful , when they fall into the hands of those who are capable of judging for them . ENTER MARY HULL . Here , Mary , is a proposal of a place for you , from that Quaker who has bought the Elton place . I suppose you call yourself your own mistress , and you can do as you like about it ; but as you are yet a young woman , Mary Hull , and this man is a Quaker , and nobody knows who , I should think it a great risk for you to live with him ; for , if nothing worse comes of it , you may be sure there is not a person in this town , that wo n't think you are trying to get him for a husband . Mary . Mary Hull  --  I shall not stand so much in my own light , as to refuse so excellent a place ; and from all I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far above my condition in life ; and , therefore , I think that no person would be silly enough to suppose I took the place from so foolish a design as you suggested ; and I shall take care that my conduct gives no occasion for reproach . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Well , it does amaze me to see how some people strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Oh , Mary , how glad I am you are going to live with such a good man ; how happy you must be ! Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Jane , you know the trouble and expense of taking you upon my hands is very great ; but it did not seem suitable that , being my brother 's daughter , you should be put out at present : you must remember , child , that I am at liberty to turn you away at any time , whereas , as you will always be in debt to me , you can never be at liberty to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to take you , but the consciousness of doing my duty and more than my duty to you , supports me under it .  --  Now as to what I expect from you :  --  in the first place , my word must be your law ; you must not hesitate to do any thing I require of you ; never think of asking a reason for what I command  --  it is very troublesome and unreasonable to do so . Visiting , you must give up entirely ; I allow my children to waste none of their time in company : meetings I shall wish you to attend when you have not work to do at home ; for I do not wish you to neglect the means of grace , though I am sensible that your heart must be changed before they can do you any good . You must help Martha do the ironing , and assist Elvira in the clear starching and other matters ; Nancy will want your aid about the beds ; Sally is but young , and requires more care than I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in instructing the young converts ; and therefore I shall look to you to take the charge of Sally ; and I expect you to take the charge of mending and making for David when he comes home ; the other boys will want now and then a stitch or two ; and , in short , Miss , you will be ready to do every thing that is wanted of you . Mary . Mary Hull  --  Yes , go on ; load her with burdens heavy and grievous to be borne , and do not touch them with one of your fingers . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Out of the room instantly , you lump of hypocrisy ! ( Exit Mary . ) Jane . Jane Elton  --  Aunt , do not mind what Mary said , she did not mean to offend you . I believe she feels for me , for she lived in our family till my  --  Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Do n't give yourself the least uneasiness , Miss ; I am not to be disturbed by a ranting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see what occasion there is for her feeling for you .  --  You have not yet answered me , Jane . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I have no answer to make , Ma'am , but that I shall do my best to content you . I am very young , and not much used to work , and I may have been too kindly dealt with ; but that is all over now ! Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Do you mean , Miss , to say , that I sha n't treat you kindly ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  No , aunt , but I meant  --  excuse me , if I meant any thing wrong . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  I did expect , Miss , to hear some thankfulness expressed . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I do , Ma'am , feel grateful , that I have a shelter over my head ; what more I have to be grateful for , time must determine . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  Well , Miss Jane , I shall expect no haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and tell the girls to be ready to go with me to the evening conference ; but you can not go , for I want you to watch with Phillis to night .  --  One thing more I have to say to you , you must not look to me for any clothing ; that cunning Mary has packed away enough to last you fifty years . ( Exit Jane . ) With all her methodism , I will trust her to feather your nest , and her own too . ( Exit . ) SCENE II . Another room .  --  Martha Wilson is attempting to paint flowers , &c.;  --  Elvira is reading a novel . Martha . Martha Wilson  --  Oh ! how I do wish I could get some one to learn me to paint , and not have mother know it !  --  Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh , delightful !  --  what a hero !  --  ENTER JANE . Martha . Martha Wilson  --  Well , Jane , What now ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  Aunt wishes you to get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elvira Wilson  --  Do n't you intend to go , Jane ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  No , my aunt requested me to stay with Phillis to night . Martha . Martha Wilson  --  I will not go to hear Deacon Barton 's everlasting prayers ; I have heard so many of them , that I know them all by heart . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh , Jane , why ca n't you go down and tell mother you ca n't find me . Just tell her , you guess I have gone down to Miss Bancker 's , to inquire if the Tracts are come ; that 's a good thought , that will quiet her ;  --  I 'll do as much for you any time . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I shall never wish you to do as much for me , Elvira . Elvira .

Jane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reasonable for you , and no more ; any thing that is true , I will tell your mother for you . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Pooh , Jane , you have brought your deaconish nonsense to a poor market . It was easy enough to get along with the truth with your mother , because she would let you have your own way on all occasions ; but I can tell you , disguises are the only wear in our camp . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I shall not use them , Elvira . I should dread their being stripped off . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh , not at all . Mother seldom takes the trouble to inquire into it ; and if she does , now and then by accident , detect it , the storm soon blows over . She has caught me in many a white lie , and black one too , and she has not been half so angry as when I have torn my gown , or lost a glove . Why , child , if you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find yourself without shield or buckler . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Ah , Elvira ! " That 's no battle , ev'ry body knows , Where one side only gives the blows . " Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  That 's true enough , Jane .  --  Well , if you will not help me off from the conference , I must go .  --  Sweet Vivaldi ! ( kissing her book , and laying it away ) must I part with thee ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  One would think you were parting with your lover . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  I am , my dear . I always fancy when I read a novel , that I am the heroine , and the hero is one of my favourites ; and then I realize it all , and it appears so natural .  --  Well , Martha , you may go and dress you , and I will come in a few minutes .

It was in the mazy dance Edward Montreville first fell in love with Selina ;  --  but then these odious  --  these hateful meetings ! I have certainly a natural antipathy to them ; you do not always have to attend them ; mother is ready enough to let you off , when there is any hard job to be done in the family ;  --  well , much as I hate work , I had rather work then go to meeting . Tell me honestly , Jane , would not you like to learn to dance , if you was not obliged to wear deep mourning , and could afford to pay for it ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I learned to dance , Elvira , during the year I spent at Mr. Evertson 's school . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  La , is it possible ? I never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elton  --  No : many things have happened to me , that you never heard me say a word about . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Now , Jane , I have hit upon a capital plan to cheat mother . There is to be a little ball to-night , after the school ; and I have promised John Woodhull to go with him to it . For once , Jane , be generous , and lend me a helping hand . In the first place , to get rid of the meeting , I am going to put a flannel round my throat , to tell my mother it is very sour , and I have a head-ache ; and then I shall go to bed ; but as soon as she is well out of the house , I shall get up and dress me , and wind that pretty wreath of yours  --  which I am sure you will lend me  --  aruond my head , and meet Woodhull just at the peer-tree at the end of the garden .

At any rate , you know , if she should not be any worse , you can sit up till 12 o'clock , and I will just tap at Phillis ' bed-room window , and you wo n't refuse , Jane , to slip bolt of the outside door for me . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I can not , Elvira , take part in any of your projects . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh , I shall have a delightful time ! ( Exit . ) ENTER MARY HULL . Mary . Mary Hull  --  Well , Jane , you look as bright as a May morning , and I have something to tell you that will make you yet brighter . Mr. Evertson has been here enquiring for Mr. Lloyd .

Mr. Lloyd was so kind , he said , and shown such an interest in his school , that he did not like to take any important step without consulting him ; and then he spoke very handsomely of some globes that Mr. Lloyd presented to the school . He said , his subscription was so much enlarged , that he must engage an assistant ; but , as he wished to purchase some maps , he must get one who could finish , at least , one hundred dollars . His sick wife and large family , he said , consumed nearly all his profits ; and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you was the person he should prefer of all others for an assistant . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Me ! Mary . Mary Hull  --  Yes , my dear child , you . I told him , you was not quite fifteen ; but he said , you knew more than most young women of twenty , and almost all the school loved and respected you . Jane . Jane Elton  --  But , Mary , where am I to get a hundred dollars ? Mary . Mary Hull  --  Mr. Lloyd , I dare say , Jane , would advance it . Jane . Jane Elton  --  No , Mary , I never can consent to that . Mary . Mary Hull  --  But why ? I understand that Mr. Lloyd spends all his money in doing good . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I dare say , Mary , that Mr. Lloyd 's means are well employed .  --  I do not eat the bread of idleness , Mary , I think I earn all my aunt gives me ; and I am not very unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell how it is , but I am used to their ways .

Mary . Mary Hull  --  ( aside ) Surely the kingdom is in this dear child 's heart . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I am sure of one thing , my dear , kind Mary , I shall never lose an opportunity of advantage , while I have such a watchful sentinel as you are , on the look-out for me . Oh ! how much have I to be grateful for ! I had no reason to expect such favour from Mr. Evertson .

It is good for me to bear this yoke in my youth . Mary . Mary Hull  --  No doubt , no doubt , my dear Jane ; but then you know if there is a way of escape opened to you , it would be but a tempting of Providence not to avail yourself of it . It is right to endure necessary evils with patience , but I know no rule that forbids your getting rid of them , if you can .  --  Now , dear Jane , I have one more plan to propose to you , and though it will cost you some pain , I think you will finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always thought that it was not for nothing Providence moved the hearts of the creditors to spare you all your dear mother 's clothes , seeing she had a good many that could not be called necessary ; nor was it a blind chance that raised you up such a friend as Mr. Lloyd in a stranger . Now , if you will consent to it , I will undertake to dispose of the articles Mr. Lloyd sent to you , and your mother 's lace and shawls , and all the little nick-nacks she left ; it shall go hard but I will raise a hundred dollars . Jane . Jane Elton  --  But , Mary , aunt Wilson will never consent to it . Mary . Mary Hull  --  The consent that is not asked , can not be refused . It is but speaking to Mr. Evertson , and he will keep our counsel , for he is not a talking body ; and when all is ready , it will be time enough , not to ask Mrs. Wilson 's leave , but to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless it be for keeping the furnace hot that purifies the gold . I would not make you discontented with your situation , but I can not bear to see your mind , as well as your body , in slavery . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Well , Mary , it would be a mark of ingratitude in me , to refuse so kind an offer ;  --  come to-morrow , then , and you may take the articles you mentioned . But I must now be excused ; for my aunt and cousins are going to the conference , and I must take care of poor Phillis . Mary .

I hope no offence , but every body knows the Squire was always a scheming , and seldom had the money ready to pay his just debts .  --  I am afraid the child tires you miss ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  No , I had rather keep him . Mrs. Win . Mrs. Winthrop  --  It lacked but six weeks of the five years I had lived at the Squire 's , when I was married to Rufus Winthrop .

Mrs. Winthrop  --  Well , ma'am , I have that must convince you ; ( taking from an old pocket book a small piece of paper ) there is the identical note , ma'am , you can satisfy yourself .

I am perfectly innocent ; and I am sure that , whatever appearances there may be against me , you can not believe me guilty  --  you do not . Mrs. Wilson . Mrs. Wilson  --  And do you think to face me down in this way ? I have evidence enough to satisfy any court of justice .

Edward . Edward Erskine  --  I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent of that , and of every other crime ; I do not wish you even to deny it . It is all a devilish contrivance of that wicked woman . Jane . Jane Elton  --  You are mistaken , Edward ; it is not a contrivance ; the circumstances are as she has told them to you .  --  No , Edward , she is right in all but the conclusion she draws from these unfortunate circumstances ;  --  perhaps a kinder judgment would not absolve me . Edward . Edward Erskine  --  A saint needs no absolution . No one shall be permitted to accuse , or suspect you ; you can surely explain these accidental circumstances , so that even your aunt , malicious  --  venomous as she is , will not dare to breathe a poisonous insinuation against you , angel as you are . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Ah , there are , and there ought to be , few believers in earth-born angels . No , Mr. Erskine , I have no explanation to make ; I have nothing but assertions of my innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reject this evidence , must believe me guilty ! ( going ) Edward .

My interest in your welfare is too well known to you , to need words to express it more fully .  --  But , dear Jane , you must inform me of your intentions with regard to your aunt . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I have very little reason to fear that my aunt will communicate , to any other person , her suspicious . She has a motive towards you , Edward , that overcomes her prudence . Edward . Edward Erskine  --  Yes , I have seen it . Jane .

I trust that in a few months something will occur , to put me beyond the reach of suspicion , and reward as well as justify your generous confidence . Edward .

Robert Lloyd  --  It is not being very unjust to him , or to any one , to think him unworthy of thee , Jane . But since these particulars would raise him so much in my opinion , why not tell them to me ? May not " one of your best friends " claim to know that , which affects so deeply your happiness ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  Why , sir , it is impossible for me to display , to you , Mr. Erskine 's generosity , in the same light in which I see it . Mr. Lloyd . Robert Lloyd  --  Dost thou mean , Jane , that the light of truth is less favourable to him , than the light of imagination ? Jane .

Edward Erskine  --  Whither now with your basket , Jane ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  On an errand of kindness , to yonder cottage . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  You are a charming girl , Jane ; always engaged in doing good .  --  Well , by the way , your friend Robert Lloyd has taken a mighty fancy to me of late ; I can not conceive what is the reason of it . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I am glad of it ; for he seems to have withdrawn his friendship from me , and you are the only person , Edward , to whom I should be resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Jane ! you need not be alarmed ; he and I should never mix , any more than oil and vinegar .

Edward Erskine  --  Oh , he is the oil , soft  --  neutralizing  --  rather tasteless ; while I , you know , have a character of my own  --  am positive  --  am  --  but perhaps it would not be quite modest for me to finish the parallel . To confess the truth to you Jane , I have always had an aversion to Quakers ;  --  they are a very hypocritical sect , depend upon it ; pretending , sly , cheating rogues . Jane . Jane Elton  --  That 's a harsh judgment , and a prejudice I think ; is not Mr. Lloyd the only Quaker you know ? Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Why  --  ye  --  yes , the only one I know much of . Jane . Jane Elton  --  And does he justify opinion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes a great while to find them out ; and even if Lloyd should be what he would seem , the exception only proves the rule . I have always disliked Quakers . I remember a story my father used to tell , when I was a child , about his being overreached , in a most ingenious , practised manner , by one of the scoundrels , as he called the whole race . It was not an affair of very great moment ; but no man likes to be out-witted in a bargain ; and my father used to say it gave him an antipathy to the very name of Quaker . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I think your father was in fault so carelessly to implant a prejudice , which , as it seems to have had very slight ground , I trust has not taken such deep root that it can not be easily eradicated . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  There is more reason in my judgment than you give me credit for .  --  If they are an upright , frank people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Quakers have no creed ;  --  and though I have no great faith in the professors of any sect , yet they ought to let you know what they do think : it is fair and above board . You may depend upon it , Jane , the Quakers are a jesuitical people . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Have you ever read any of their books ? Ed . Edward Erskine  --  I read them ! ha , ha , ha ! why my dear girl do you take me for a theologian ? No  --  I never read the books of any sect ; and Quaker books , I believe there are none . Quaker books ! ha , ha , ha ! no , no  --  I shall never addict myself to divinity , till Anne Ratcliffe writes sermons , and Tom Moore warbles hymns . Jane . Jane Elton  --  There is a book , Edward , that contains the creed of the Quakers ; a creed to which they have never presumed to add any thing , nor have they taken any thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to require the assent of man , and from which no rational man can dissent  --  that book is the Bible ! and their faith in this creed is shown by their works . My dear Edward , examine their history for their vindication . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  That I shall not , while their cause has so fair a champion . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Spare me your sarcasms Edward , and let me entreat you to look at the life of their wise and excellent Penn . See him patiently and firmly enduring persecution , and calumny , and oppression at home ; giving up his time , his fortune , his liberty , to the cause of suffering humanity , in every mode of its appeal to his benevolence . Follow him with his colony to the wilderness , and see him the only one of all the colonial leaders , ( I grieve that I can not except our fathers , the pilgrims ) the only one who treated the natives of the land with justice and mercy . Our fathers , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Indian . They affected to believe they were the children of the evil one , and hunted them like beasts of prey , calling them " worse than Scythian wolves ; " while Penn , and his peaceful people , won their confidence , their devotion , by treating them with even-handed justice , with brotherly kindness ; and they had their reward  --  they lived unharmed among them , without forts  --  without a weapon of defence . Is it not the Friends that have been foremost and most active in efforts for the abolition of slavery ? Among what people do we find more reformers of the prisons  --  guardians of the poor and the oppressed  --  most of those who " remember the forgotten , and attend to the neglected  --  who dive into the depths of dungeons , and plunge into the infection of hospitals ? " Ed . Edward Erskine  --  My dear Jane , you are almost fit to speak in meeting . All that your defence wants in justness is made up by the eloquence of your eye and your glowing cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than love , Jane . If I , and all my ancestors had gone on crusades and pilgrimages , the spirit would not have moved you to such enthusiasm in our cause , as you manifest for the broad-brimmed , straight-coated brethren of friend Lloyd . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Edward , have you yet to learn of me that I speak least of what I feel most ? Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Forgive me , dear Jane , a little jealousy : you know jealousy argues love . To confess to you the honest truth , I felt a little more ticklish than usual , this evening , on the subject of Quakerism . I had just parted with Mr. Lloyd ; and he has been earnestly recommending to me to undertake a reform in our poor-laws , by which he thinks , that we should rid ourselves of the burden of supporting many who are not necessarily dependent on us , and improve the condition of those who are . The plan seems to be good and feasible . Jane . Jane Elton  --  And what then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erskine  --  Why , he wished me to take the whole conduct of it . He preferred the plan should appear to originate with me ; that I should head a petition to the Legislature ; and , it we succeeded , that I should superintend the execution of the plan . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Still , dear Edward , I see any thing but offence in all this . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Because your eye-sight is a little dimmed by your partiality . Do you believe , Jane , that any man would be willing to transfer to another all the merit and praise of a scheme , which if it succeeds , will be a most important benefit to the community ; will be felt , and noticed , and applauded by every one ? No  --  there is some design lurking under this specious garb of disinterestedness  --  disinterestedness ! it exists only in the visions of poets , or the Utopian dreams of youth ; or , perhaps embodied in the fine person of a hero of romance . Jane . Jane Elton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is the principle , the spirit of the Christian ! Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Par exemple  --  of your aunt Wilson , and of sundry other stanch professors I could mention , who , ' If self the wavering balance shake , It 's never right adjusted . ' Jane . Jane Elton  --  Is it fair to condemn a whole class , because some of its members are faithless and disloyal ? A commander does but decimate a mutinous corps ; and you exclude the whole from your confidence , because a few are treacherous . I allow , there are few  --  very few , who are perfectly disinterested ; but every christian , in proportion to his fidelity to the teachings and example of his Master will be moved and governed by this principle .

Sarah  --  A despot time , miss Jane . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I never heard of it ; indeed , I am so much engaged in my school , that I see very few people , and hear very little news  --  even if it is as important as your law-suit . John .

Here my sons and daughters have been born to me , and here I have buried them . They died when they were but little children , and nobody remembers them but us ! Sarah . Sarah  --  Sweet little dears they were , miss Jane ! John . John  --  Hem  --  hem  --  this has not much to do with my law-suit , only that I shall want some excuse for loving the old rookery so well before I get through with my story .  --  I hired this bit of land of a man that 's been dead twenty years , and it has changed hands many a time since , but I have always been able to satisfy for the rent ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fancy the place . Lately it 's come into the hands of the two young Woodhulls , by the death of the Deacon their father . They are two hard-favoured , hard-hearted , wild young chaps , miss Jane , that think all the world was made for them , and their pleasure . Sarah . Sarah  --  Oh ! that a Deacon should be left to have such children ; as our minister says . John . John  --  If my memory serves me , it was just one week after you was here , that they were hunting up in these woods with young Squire Erskine . John , the oldest , took aim at a robin that was singing on the tree just before my door : it had built its nest there early in the summer , and it was as tame as a chicken . I begged the little innocents ' life so earnestly , that the boys laughed , but Erskine said , " Let the old fool have his way . " They said it was their land , and their bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew up to fire , but at that instant I swung my bat and frightened the bird away . They were terrible mad , and called me , and my wife too , many a name that was too bad for a decent person 's ear . Sarah . Sarah  --  Rascals they were , miss Jane ! John . John  --  They worked themselves up to a fury , and then warned me off the ground . I made no reply ; for I thought when they got over their passion , they 'd forget it . But they returned the next day with handspikes , and threatened to pull the house down on our heads , if we did not come out of it . I have had a proud spirit in my day , miss Jane , but old age and weakness have tamed it . I begged them to spare us our little dwelling , with tears in my eyes ; and my poor old woman prayed she might bring out the few goods we had  --  Sarah . Sarah  --  And that I did , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  They said they would dust our goods for us ; and so we came out and turned away our faces ; but we heard the old house , that had sheltered us so long , crumble to pieces , as you 'd crush an egg-shell in your hand ! Jane . Jane Elton  --  Can it be possible , that for so slight a cause , the Woodhulls could do you such an injury ? John . John  --  It is even so ;  --  youth is headstrong , and will not bear crossing . Jane . Jane Elton  --  But where did you find a shelter ? John . John  --  I led my wife down the other side of the mountain , to one Billy Downie 's ; I left her there , and the next day I went over to the village . to see if the law would give me justice of hose that had no mercy . I should have gone to Squire Erskine with my case , but he was a friend of the Woodhulls , and so I applied to the stranger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trial was appointed for the next Saturday . The day came ; and all the men in the village were collected at the tavern , for Erskine was to plead for the Woodhulls , and every body likes to hear his silver tongue . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Erskine , plead for the Woodhulls ! John . John  --  illeg. miss Jane ; for , as I told you , they are illeg . . My attorney was a kind of a preilleg. illeg. rkman at the law , and he made bungling work of it . But still , the plain story was as much against the Woodhulls , and the people of the village are so friendly-like to me , that it is rather my belief , I should have been righted if Erskine had not poured out such a power of words , that he seemed to take away people 's senses . He started with what he called a proverb of the law , and repeated it so many times , I think I can never forget it ; for it seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  " cujus est solum , ejus est usque ad coeum ; " which , if I rightly understood , means , that whoever owns the soil , owns all above it to the sky ; and though it stands to reason it ca n't be so , yet Erskine 's fine oration put reason quite out of the question ; and so the Justice decided that the Woodhulls had a right to do what seemed good in their own eyes with my furniture . Sarah . Sarah  --  An unjust Judge , I 'm sure , miss Jane . John . John  --  When the trial was over , Erskine and the Woodhulls invited the Justice and the company into the bar-room to treat them ; and through the open door I heard Erskine propose a bumper to those who knew how to maintain their rights . " No , " Woodhull said , " it should be to him who knew how to defend a friend . "  --  But my story is too long for you , miss Jane . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested with it . Sarah . Sarah  --  It is really an intertaining story , miss Jane ; and our minister says it would make a good track . John . John  --  Well , miss , I thought I was alone in the room , and I just let out my heart , ( as you know a body will when he is alone ) but I heart a slight noise behind me , and there was one who had not followed the multitude ; he had a clear open face , and that look  --  I ca n't justly describe it miss Jane , but pity and kindness seemed writ in every line of his face . Do you know who I mean ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  Mr. Lloyd . John . John  --  Yes , yes  --  any body that had ever seen him would guess . He beckoned to me to shut the door , and then asked , if I believed I could persuade the young men to sell some of the land , I was sure I could ; for they are wasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their will , and the land was of no use to them . And then he told me , miss Jane , that he would give me the money for the land , if I could make a bargain with the Woodhulls , and enough besides to build me a comfortable little house . I could not thank him  --  I tried , but I could not ; and so he just squeezed my hand , and said , he understood me  --  and charged me to keep it a secret where I got help ; and I have minded him till this day , but I could not keep it from you . Sarah . Sarah  --  You 'd better stop now , John , for the long walk , and the long story , have quite overdone miss Jane ; she has had the flushes this half hour . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I do not feel well  --  I will thank you for a glass of water . Sarah . Sarah  --  Oh , yes , with all my heart . ( brings her some water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you .  --  ( drinks. )  --  What reason have you to think , sir , that Erskine and the Woodhulls are intimate friends ? John . John  --  Why , did you never hear , Miss , that it was Erskine that got John Woodhull clear , when Betsy Davis sued him for a breach of promise ? I was summoned to court as a witness . It was a terrible black business ; but Erskine made it all smooth ; and after the trial was past , I overheard these chaps flattering Erskine till they made him believe he was more than mortal . At any rate , they put such a mist before his eyes , that he could not see to choose good from evil , else he never would have chosen them for his companions ; he never would have been led to spend night after night with them at the gambling club .

I think the experience of this morning will not tempt you to repeat this singular disturbance of the peace of the community . ( Exeunt . ) ACT V. SCENE I.  --  A room at Mrs. Harvey 's  --  Jane alone . Jane Jane Elton  --  If I had remained ignorant of his faults , I should have had some excuse ; I might then have hoped for assistance and blessing on my attempts to reform him . It would be presumption to trust , now , in any efforts I could make ; and what right have I , with my eyes open , to rush into a situation where my own weak virtues may be subdued by trials  --  must be assailed by temptation ? Oh ! when I heard him speak lightly of religion , how could I hope he would submit to its requisitions and restraints ? I started at the first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always known there was no immoveable basis for principle , but religion . Selfish  --  vain  --  how could I love him ! And yet his preference of me was purely disinterested  --  an orphan  --  destitute  --  almost an out-cast  --  liable to degradation  --  and he has exposed himself to all the obloquy I may suffer  --  and does he not deserve the devotion of my life ? ENTER MRS . HARVEY . Mrs. Harvey . Mrs. Harvey  --  Why , Jane ! what upon earth ails you ? Ah ! if you had gone with me , you would not have come home with such a wo-begone face .  --  Not a word ! Well  --  nothing for nothing is my rule , my dear ; and so you need not expect to hear where I have been , and what superb papers have come from New-York , for the front rooms ; and beautiful china , and chairs , and carpets , and a fine work-table , for an industrious little lady , that shall be nameless ; all quite too grand for a sullen , silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvira had been out in such a shower of gold , we should have been favoured with sweet smiles and sweet talk for one year , at least .  --  But there comes one that will make the bird sing , when it wo n't sing to any one else ; and so , my dear , to escape chilling a lover 's atmosphere , or being melted in it , I shall make my escape . ( Ex . ) ( Jane takes a book and sits reading with her back toward the door . ) ENTER EDWARD . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  looking over her shoulder ) What have we here ? ( turning to the title page ) " Fruits of Solitude ; " by " William Penn . " Curse on all Quakers and quakerism ! ( seizing the book and throwing it across the room ) wherever I go I am crossed by them . ( Jane attempts to leave the room . ) Ed . Edward Erskine  --  No , Jane , ( stepping between her and the door ) you shall not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive my violence . There is a point beyond which no rational creature can keep his temper . I have been urged to that point ; and , thank Heaven , I have not learnt that smoothfaced hypocrisy that can seem what it is not . ( Jane sinks into a chair , and bursts into tears . ) I was right ; it is by your authority , and at your instigation , that I am dogged from place to place by that impertinent fellow ; you have entered into a holy league ; but know , Miss Elton , there is a tradition in our family , that no Erskine was ever ruled by his wife ; and the sooner the lady who is destined to be mine learns not to interfere in my affairs , the more agreeable it will be to me , and the more safe for herself . Jane . Jane Elton  --  ( calmly ) If you mean that I shall understand you , you must explain yourself , for I am ignorant and innocent of any thing you may suspect me of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Jane : you know in the worst of times I have believed you ; and it was natural to be offended that you should distrust me.  --  You shall know the " head and front of my offending . " The sins that have stirred up such a missionary zeal in that body of quakerism , will weigh light in the scales of love Jane Jane Elton  --  Perhaps I hold a more impartial balance than you expect . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Then you do not love me . Jane : for love is , and ought to be , blind ; but I am willing to make the trial . No one shall say that you have not loved me , with all my youthful follies , on my head . No gentleman , no man of honourable feeling  --  no man of proper sensibility  --  would submit to the interference of a stranger  --  a man not much older than himself  --  in matters that concerned himself alone ; it is an intolerable outrage . If you are capable of a fair judgment , Jane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Elton  --  I can judge only from facts ; as yet I have heard nothing but accusations . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  I had imagined I was stating my case in a court of love , and not of law ; but I have no objection , since my judge is as sternly just as an old Roman father , to state facts .  --  I could pardon Mr. Lloyd his eagerness to make me adopt his plans of improvement in the natural and moral world : to the first he might have been led by his taste for agriculture , ( which I believe was unaffected ) and to the second he was pledged by the laws of holy quaker church . Still , none but a Quaker would have thought of meddling with the affairs of people who were strangers to him  --  however , that might be pardoned ; for , as I said before , I suppose every Quaker is bound to that officiousness by an oath , or an affirmation , for tender conscience ' sake .  --  But , my sweet judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I can not , Erskine , look propitious on your sneers against the principles of my excellent friend . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Perhaps his practice will be equally immaculate in your eyes . And now , Jane , I beseech you for once to forget that Mr. Lloyd is your excellent friend , a man who bestowed some trifling favours on your childhood , and remember the rights of one to whom you at least owe your love  --  though he would neither accept that , nor your gratitude , as a debt . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I assure you , I am ready to hear any thing and every thing impartially that you will tell me . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  I detest stoical impartiality ; I wish you to enter into my loves and my hates , without expecting a reason for them . But since you must have the reason , I will not withhold it .  --  As I told you , I submitted to a thousand vexatious , little impertinences : he is plausible and gentlemanly in his manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemptible affair between John the old basket maker and the Woodhulls , in which I used my humble professional skill to extricate my friends , who had been perhaps a little hasty in revenging the impertinence of the foolish old man . Lloyd was present at the trial before the justice : I fancied from the expression of his face that he wished my friends to be foiled , and this quickened my faculties . I succeeded in winning my cause in spite of law and equity , for they were both against me ; and this , you know , is rather flattering to one 's talents . It was an affair of no moment , and I should probably never have thought of it again , if Lloyd had not the next day made it the text upon which he preached as long a sermon as I would hear , upon the characters of the Woodhulls ; he even went so far as to presume to remonstrate with me upon my connexion with them , painted their conduct on various occasions in the blackest colours  --  said their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dangerous . I restrained myself as long as possible , and then told him that I should not submit to hear any calumnies against my friends . I told him , they were honourable young men , not governed by the fear that " holds the wretch in order . " I had never , I told him , been accustomed to submit my conduct to the revision of any one ; that he had no right , and I knew not why he presumed to assume it , to haunt me like an external conscience ; that my " genius was not rebuked by his , " neither would it be , if all the marvellous light of all his brethren was concentrated in his luminous mind . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Oh , Erskine , Erskine ! was this your return for his friendly warning ? Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Hear me through , Jane , before you condemn me . He provoked me more than I have told you . He said that I was responsible to you for my virtue ; that I betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the prey , of the vices of others . Would you have had me borne this , Jane ? Would you thank me for allowing , that he was more careful of your happiness than I am ?  --  Well , as you do not reply , I presume you have not yet decided that point .  --  We separated , my indignation raised to the highest pitch , and he cold and calm as ever . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Is this all ? Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Not half  --  I perceive that it is impossible for you to see things in the light I do . Your aunt with her everlasting cant , your methodist friend with her old-maid notions , and this precise quaker , above all , have made you so rigid  --  have so bound and stiffened every youthful indulgent feeling , that I have as little hope of a favourable judgment , as a heretic could have had in the dark ages , from his triple-crowned tyrant . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Then , ( rising ) it is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed . Edward Erskine  --  No , you shall not go ; I expect miracles from the touch of love . I think I have an advocate in your heart , that will plead for me against the whole " privileged order , " of professors  --  of every cast . Do not be shocked , my dear Jane ; do not , for your own sake , make mountains of mole-hills , when I tell you , that the young men of the village instituted a club , three or four months since , who meet once a week socially , perhaps a little oftener , when we are all about home : and  --  hem  --  and  --  we play cards ; sometimes we have played later and higher perhaps than we should if we had all been in the leading-strings of prudence  --  all been bred Quakers .  --  Our club are men of honour and spirit , high minded gentlemen ; a few disputes , misunderstandings , might arise now and then , as they will among people who do not weight every word , lest they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , till the last evening , we have , in the main , spent our time together as whole-souled fellows should , in mirth and jollity .

Edward Erskine  --  What ! you will not listen to friend Lloyd 's reproaches ; not listen to what most roused his holy indignation ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I have no wish to hear any thing further . I have heard enough to make my path plain before me.  --  I loved you , Edward ; I confessed to you that I did . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  And you do not any longer ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I can not ; the illusion has vanished .  --  Neither do you love me.  --  And now , Edward , hear me .

Jane Elton  --  No , Edward ; I have tried my power over you , and found it wanting . Broken confidence can not be restored . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Jane , you are rash ; you are giving up independence  --  protection . If you reject me , who will defend you from your aunt ? Do you forget that you are still in her power ?

It was not your protection , it was not independence I sought , it was a refuge in your affection ;  --  that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have examined mine , and you will find the tie , that bound us , is dissolved ; there can be no enduring love without sympathy ; our feelings , our pursuits , our plans , our inclinations , are all diverse . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  You are unkind , ungrateful , Jane . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I must bear that reproach as I can ; but I do not deserve it , Mr. Erskine . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Do not be implacable , Jane ; you are too young , too beautiful , to treat the follies of youth as if they were incurable ; give me a few months probation , I will do any thing you require ; abandon the club , give up my friends . Jane . Jane Elton  --  No , Mr. Erskine ; we must part now : if I loved you , I could not resist the pleadings of my heart .  --  Oh , Erskine !

I could still hope , for I know that affection is self-devoting , and may overcome all things . Edward , there is one subject , and that nearest to my heart , on which I discovered , soon after our engagement , we were at utter variance . When I first heard you trifle with the obligations of religion , and express a distrust of its truths , I felt my heart chill . I reproached myself bitterly for having looked on your insensibility on this subject as the common carelessness of a gay young man , to be expected , and forgiven , and easily cured . These few short months have taught me much ; have taught me , Erskine , not that religion is the only sure foundation of virtue  --  that I knew before  --  but they have taught me , that religion alone can produce unity of spirit ; alone can resist the cares , the disappointments , the tempests of life ; that it is the only indissoluble bond  --  for when the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt that my most sacred pleasures and hopes must be solitary .  --  You now know all , Erskine .

Jane Elton  --  You do him wrong . He has not mentioned your name to me since I left my aunt 's . I heard them , by accident , from John . Ed . Edward Erskine  --  It is , in truth , time we should part , when you can give your ear to every idle rumour . ( takes his hat . ) Jane . Jane Elton  --  ( laying her hand on his arm ) Yes , it is time that we should part ; but not in anger . Let us exchange forgiveness , Edward . ( extends her hand : Edward takes it , averts his face , and weeps . ) Ed . Edward Erskine  --  Oh , Jane ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  and think of me with kindness . Jane .

Jane Elton  --  What has he done now ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Harvey  --  There was a robbery committed on the mail-stage , last night , between here and New York ; the robbers have been detected and taken , and Wilson is among them ! Jane . Jane Elton  --  And the punishment is death !  --  My poor aunt , and Elvira ! what misery is this for them ! Mary . Mary Hull  --  For your aunt , it may be ; but as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own affairs , to think much of David 's body or soul . Jane . Jane Elton  --  I will go immediately to my aunt  --  but what has happened to Elvira ? Mary . Mary Hull  --  Why Elvira , it seems , during her visit to the west , met with an itinerant French dancing-master , who became violently enamoured of her ; and he did not sigh or hope in vain . She probably knew his vocation would be an insuperable obstacle to her seeing him at home ; and so they concerted a scheme to obviate that difficulty , by introducing him to Mrs. Wilson as a French physician , from Paris , who should volunteer his services to cure her scrofula . They succeeded in this ; and Mrs. Wilson submitted her disease to his prescription . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Is it possible , that aunt Wilson should be imposed on in this manner ? Elvira is ingenious , but she is not a match for her quick-sighted mother . Mary . Mary Hull  --  No , so it has proved in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopeful lovers , that revealed the whole truth to her . Jane . Jane Elton  --  And what has she done ? Mary . Mary Hull  --  What could she do , my dear , but turn the good-for-nothing fellow out of doors , and exhaust her wrath upon Elvira . Mrs. H. Mrs. Harvey  --  ( rising , and going to the window ) But who is that coming through our gate ? Elvira , as I live !  --  what can she be after here ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  Aunt has probably sent for me. ( going to the door ) I was just going to your mother 's . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  ( entering ) Stay a moment , Jane , I must speak with you . Come into your chamber . ( Exit  --  Jane following . ) SCENE III . Jane 's chamber .  --  Enter Jane and Elvira . Elvira .

It would have been delightful if he had only been wounded . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Elvira , you are an incurable trifler ! How is it possible , that at this time you can waste a thought upon Erskine or his duel ? Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh ! my spirits run away with me , dear Jane ; but I do feel very miserable . ( affecting to wipe the tears from her eyes ) Poor David !  --  I am wretched about him . He has disgraced us all . I suppose you have heard , too , about Lavoisier ? Every body has heard of mother 's cruelty to him and to me . Oh , Jane ! he is the sweetest creature  --  the most interesting being  --  Jane . Jane Elton  --  Elvira , I do not like to reproach you in your present affliction ; but you strangely forget all that is due to your sex , by keeping up such an intercourse with a stranger  --  by ranting in this way about a wandering dancing-master  --  a foreigner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if that was against him . Why , my dear , foreigners are much more genteel than Americans ; and besides . Lavoisier is a Count in disguise . Oh ! if you could only hear him speak French ; it is as soft as an Eolian harp . Now Jane , darling , do n't he angry with me . I am sure there never was any body so persecuted and unfortunate as I am . Nobody feels for me ! Jane . Jane Elton  --  It is impossible , Elvira , to feel for those who have no feeling for themselves . Elvira . Elvira Wilson  --  Oh , Jane ! you are very cruel ; ( whimpering I have been crying  --  ever since I received poor David 's letter  --  and it was about that I came here ; but you do not seem to have any compassion for our sorrows , and I am afraid to ask for what I came for .

I shall not mind walking to his house , though it is four miles from here ; I shall go immediately , and I shall charge him to deliver the money himself . It will be such a relief and comfort to my unfortunate brother !

Jane . Jane Elton  --  Do you know the names of the eminent lawyers in New-York ? Mr. Lloyd will be best able to inform you whom to select among them . I will go to him immediately . Mrs. W.

There is no conscience in city lawyers ; they would devour all my substance , and do me no good after all . No , no  --  I shall leave David entirely in the hands of Providence . Jane . Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son 's being cut off in the spring of life , without an effort to save him  --  without an effort to procure him a space for repentance and reformation ? Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson  --  Do not presume , Jane Elton , to instruct me in my duties . A space for repentance ! A day  --  an hour  --  a moment is as good as an eternity for the operations of the Spirit . Many , at the foot of the gallows , have repented , and have died exulting in their pardon and new-born hope . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Yes ; and there have been many who have thus repented and rejoiced , and then have been reprieved ; and have they then shown the only unquestionable proof of genuine penitence  --  a renewed spirit ? No ; they have returned to their old sins , and been tenfold worse than at first . Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson  --  I tell you , you are ignorant , child ; you are still in the bond of iniquity ; you can not spiritually discern . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of our greatest divines , of an open outrageous transgressor , than of one of a moral life . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Then there is more hope of a harvest from a hard-bound , neglected field , than from that which the owner has carefully ploughed and sowed and prepared for the sun and the rains of heaven . Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson  --  The kingdom of grace is very different from the kingdom of nature . The natural man can do nothing towards his own salvation . Every act he performs , and every prayer he offers , but provokes more and more the wrath of the Almighty .  --  Do not think my children are worse than others . No , Jane ; there are some who would not seem better , if they had not friends to keep their secrets for them . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Is there , then , nothing to be done for your unhappy son ? Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson  --  Nothing , child , nothing ; he has gone out from me , and he is not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My case is not an uncommon one ; the saints of old  --  David , and Samuel , and Eli , were afflicted as I am , with rebellious children  --  Jane . Jane Elton  --  Oh , aunt ! do not  --  do not , for your soul 's sake , indulge any longer this horrible delusion . You deceive yourself . You may deceive others ; but God is not mocked ! RE-ENTER SUKEY . Sukey . Sukey  --  Oh , dear ! ma'am , Elvira is gone ! run away with Mr. Lavoisier ! Jane Jane Elton  --  Impossible ! ! Sukey .

( Re-enter Sukey with some water , which she throws into her face . ) See , she is becoming composed already ; leave her for a little time with this domestic  --  I have much to say to thee . ( Exit with Jane . ) SCENE V. The parlour .  --  Mr. Lloyd and Jane enter . Mr. Lloyd . Robert Lloyd  --  taking her hand Jane , many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all . Nay , do not tremble , unless it be for the sin of having kept from me so long the blessed intelligence of this morning .  --  I understand it all ; ( smiling ) I am too old , too rigid , too  --  quakerish , to be a young lady 's confidant . Jane . Jane Elton  --  Oh , say not so ; you have been my benefactor , my guardian , my kindest friend ; forgive my silence  --  I feel it all  --  I have always felt it ; perhaps most , when I seemed most insensible , most reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have much to tell thee . What sayest thou to a walk to old John 's ? Jane . Jane Elton  --  I thank you , sir ; it will give me pleasure . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE VI . A dungeon .  --  David Wilson in chains . David . David Wilson  --  If I have a soul , eternity will be spent in cursing her who has ruined it ; but I do not fear the future  --  hell is a bug-bear to frighten children .  --  Religion ! what is it but a dream , a pretence ? I might have believed it , if I had seen more like Jane Elton .  --  Mother , mother ! oh , that I must call you so !  --  as I do it , I howl a curse with every breath  --  you have destroyed me ! My mind was a blank , and you put your own impressions on it . God ( if there be a God , reward you according to your deeds ! sliding of bolts heard Hark !  --  what can this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Randal , how did you get here ? Robber . Robber  --  Lose not a moment , Wilson illeg. with these damn 'd chains , and follow illeg. ( knocking ofilleg . David . David Wilson  --  But the keeper  --  Robber . Robber  --  He is on our side illeg. with us , within this hour illeg . David . David Wilson  --  Ah ! for the West-Indies ? Well , now , " my native land good night ! " and be damn 'd to you .

Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish , sir , with your consent and approbation , to become a member of your society of friends . Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  Shall my people be thy people ?  --  But do not imagine , dear Jane , that I think it of the least consequence , by what name the different members of the christian family are called . Jane . Jane Elton  --  ( smiling ) But you think it right and orderly , that the wife should take the name of the husband ? Mr. L. Robert Lloyd  --  I think it most happy , certainly . Mrs. Harvey . Mrs. Harvey  --  Dear Jane , I long to see you the happy mistress of the house in which you was born . But , ( smiling ) do not forget there are other " friends " in the world , besides Quakers .
