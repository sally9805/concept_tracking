ART . XIL-Biography of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence . By John Sanderson ; vois . I. and IL . Philadelphia . WE feel it a kind of national duty to recommend to our readers any publication , of respectable claims , which has for its end to commemorate the great events in our history . To put in the most striking and impressive form , the record of some of those great actions , which have signalized our short political career , is of itself a praiseworthy object , and we do not feel ourselves called upon to enforce the rules of literary taste on publications of this nature , which are not sent forth as specimens of literary skill . We have now before us the two first numbers or volumes of the work of Mr Sanderson on the signers of the declaration of independence . They contain five lives : - those of Hancock , Franklin , Wythe , Hopkinson , and Paine . These are preceded by an introduction , which fills about two thirds of the first volume , and is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be doubted , if by this arrangement the unity of the biographical plan , iu itself well conceived , is not unnecessarily violated . Honesty also compels us to say , notwithstanding the author 's apology in the outset , that this portion of the work is too long and too diffuse , the reasoning not very original , and the relation laboring occasionally under the vital disease of a barrenness of facts . There is also , we must be pardoned for saying , in point of mere literary execution , much false taste of every kind , in this part of the book . The arrangement of the subject is a division of the history of the colonies , into four parts . The character of the colonists , their civil institutions and political relations with England , the wars which preceded the revolution , and the immediate causes which produced it , occupy each a chapter . The first chapter includes a view of the religious , literary , and moral character of our ancestors . Some just and clear views of the opinions entertanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , are comprised in the second division , though certainly not improved by the rhetoric , in which they are conveyed . The Indian wars in New England , Virginia , and North Carolirm , of the seventeenth century , the defeat of Braddock , the capture of Louisbourg and Quebec , are described with some spirit in the third ; // and finally , in the fourth , the measures of the British Parlia .. ment of 1773 and 1774 , and the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill , introduce the declaration of independence , and close the Introduction . In the preface to this work the author alludes to an objection occurring to the plan , in the following words : By attempting to exhibit so ' numerous a combination of contemporary statesmen , engaged in the same transactions and enterprises , and in a corporate capacity , he is circumscribed in prospect , confined to a uniformity of scenery , and induced almost unavoidably into tedious and frequent repetitions . ' The justice of this remark is apparent in the progress of the work . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , &amp;c. in the introduction , we are immediately presented with another account of the same occurrences , in the life of Governor Hancock . This portion of the biography , therefore , though it could hardly be spared in its connexion , might have led the author perhaps to doubt the expediency of so long an introduction . Much is also said of Samuel Adams in this article , which , of course , must be repeated in that devoted to him . On the occasion of the anniversary of the Boston massacre , ' we find the following among the extracts from Governor Hancock 's oration , which certainly when considered as spoken in a place garrisoned by the very troops alluded to , is exceedir'gly bold and impressive . I have , from the earliest recollectiom of youth , rejoiced in the felicity of my fellow men , and have considered it as the indispensable duty of every member of society to promote , as far as in him lies , the prosperity of every individual of his species , but more especially of the community to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of the state , to use his utmost endeavors to detect and defeat every traitorous plot , which its enemies may devise for its destruction . ' Some boast of being friends to government ; I am a friend to righteous government , to a government founded upon the principles of reason and justice ; but I glory in publicly avoiving my eternal enmity to tyranny ; and here suffer me to ask what tenderness , what regard , have the rulers of Great Britain manifested in their late transactions , for the security of the persons or prop .. erty of the inhabitants of these colonies ? 3r rather , what have they omitted doing to destroy that security . They have usurped the right of ruling us , in all cases whatever , by arbitrary laws ; they have exercised this pretended right , by imposing a tax upon // us without our consent ; and , lest we should show some reluctance at parting with our property , their fleets and armies are sent to enforce their mad and tyrannical pretensions . The town of Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a British fleet , the troops of George Ill , have crossed the Atlantic , not to engage an enemy , but to assist a band of traitors in trampling on the rights and liberties of his most loyal s*ibjects those rights and liberties , which , as a father , he ought ever to regard , and , as a king , he is bound in honor to defend from violations , even at the risk of his own life . ' - ButIgladlyq*tthetheme ofdeath ,  --  I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects , which have already followed from quartering regular troops in this town ; let our misfortunes instruct posterity to guard against these evils . Standing armies are sometimes ( I would by no means say generally , much less universally ) composed of persons , who have rendered themselves unfit to live in civil society ; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Louis ; who , for the addition of one penny a day to their wages , would desert from the christian cross , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such men as these what has not a state to fear ? With such as these , usurping Ca*sar passed the Rubicon . With such as these he humbled mighty Rome , and forced the mistress of the world to own a master in a traitor . These are the men , whom sceptered robbers now employ to frustrate the designs of God , and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indiscriminately upon his creatures . ' pp. 12-17 . In the character ' of Governor Hancock too much and too frequent qualification seems to be employed in giving him the praise due to his liberality and patriotism . The writer indeed appears to entertain a just veneration for his virtues , but to think it necessary , perhaps , in point of historical accuracy , to allude pretty frequently to the various opinions entertained of Governor Hancock 's merit by his contemporaries . It is , however , too wel known how entirely censure is the tax paid for eminence , ' to need that such circumstances as the current , popular dissensions of the day should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reputation of men of worth . The various authorities of contemporaries are indeed the most valuable elements of biography in many points of fact , but when the vague opposition of party is alone in question , little necessity exists of combatting it , in the case of such men as Governor Hancock , and at this distance of time . The following are extracts from the close of this article // of the Declaration of Independence . These are but few of the many particulars I might enumerate , did the subject require a further illustration : for there are , indeed , few lives , either ancient or modern , that afford , of disinterested generosity , more frequent and illustrious examples . Charity was the common business of his life . From his private benevolence a thousand families received their daily bread ; and there is , perhaps , no individual mentioned in history , who has expended a more ample fortune in promoting the liberties of his country. - Of this element of his character , as it is perhaps the most godlike virtue of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Previous to the demise of his paternal uncle , whom I have already mentioned as his patron and benefactor , the hall of the university had been destroyed by fire . The deceased ; it was said , had expressed the intention of leaving five hundred pounds for the reparation of its library . No such appropriation was , however , made by his will ; yet the sum was paid without hesitation by his heir . The salary allowed by the constitution to the chief magistrate of the commonwealth of Massachusetts had occupied , for several years , the debates of the legislature . It was declared to be exorbitant , and was enumerated amongst the various grievances that had occasioned riot and insurrection in the state . An act for its reduction from eleven to eight hundred pounds had passed both houses of the legislature , but was negatived by the governor ; and the subject being resumed under the administration of Mr Hancock , he intercepted all farther discussion of it , by a voluntary remission of the sum . In 1775 it was proposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might procure the expulsion of the enemy , to bombard or destroy the town . The entire wealth of Mr Hancock was exposed , by the execution of this enterprise , to inevitable ruin ; and whilst he felt for the sufferings of others with a very generous compassion , he required that no regard to his personal interests should obstruct the operations of the army . ' pp. 38-40 . The life of Franklin begins the second volume , and of course must suffer from comparison with the delightful memoir of the early years of his life , by himself . It is well known that the first editions of this charming biography were retranslations from the French to the English . Nothing but the great simplicity and beauty of Franklin 's style could have preserved , under similar circumstances , a manner so attractive as that of the little portion of his autobiography originally thus published* 187 // Some curious anecdotes are added in the memoir now before us , from his works as published by his grandson , arid other sources . From these we extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17Th , lord Chatham introduced in the house of lords , his celebrated plan of conciliation , on the subject of which he had sought with Franklin frequent and public interviews . He professed great esteem for his character , and in the affairs of America , the highest deference for his advice and opinions . " I pay you these vis ; ts , " said he , " that I may rectify my judgment by yours , as men do their watches by a regulator . " On the present occasion he led him by the arm into the house of lords , which was frequented by a very numerous crowd of spectators . This distinguished familiarity of a man , who held the very highest rank amongst the English nobility , and who was not less a favorite of nature than of fortune , drew upon him a particular and favorable attention ; which , joined to the countenance and approbation he had received from many other distinguished members of the parliament , not a little inflamed the animosities which the ministerial faction had already entertained towards him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but had risen into reputation under the very efforts made to depress him . Lord Chatham having explained and supported his motion , was followed by lord Sandwich , who , in the course of a very passionate harangue , declared that this motion of Chatham 's was disgraceful to his name , and should be rejected with contempt ; that he did not believe it to be the production of any British peer ; and added , turning towards Franklin , who leaned upon the bar , " I fancy I have in my eye the person who drew it up ,  --  one of the bitterest and most mischievous enemies that this country has ever known . " Under this allusion , so severe and offensive , although it drew upon him the observation of the whole assembly , Franklin remained , as if unconscious of the application , with a composed aspect ; or to use his own expression in relating this story , " as if his countenance had been made of wood . " Lord Chatham replied , that were he the first minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call publicly to his assistance , a person so eminently acquainted with American affairs , as the gentleman alluded to , and so ungenerously reflected on ; one , " he added , " whom all Europe holds in the highest estimation for his knowledge and wisdom ; whom she ranks with her Boyles and her Newtons ; who is an honor , not to the English nation only , but to human nature . " ' pp. 91-93 . The following account of Dr Franklin 's emotions at the beginning of the civil war , with all its afflicting events , it is grateful // to record . It is obvious that , however the importance of transactions in the course of political contests , like the American war , may vary , an intense interest must be felt at their first disclosure . In this insi ance , too , the mournful and cruel inter .. est attached to the separation of the social ties of a vast community , and to the substitution of violence and bloodshed , for protection and obedience , is , by the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are told that the mercies of the winds and waves in a tempest are like those of brothers in a civil war , and it is dreadful to observe how much more fatal and remorseless are the cruelties exercised , while the parties in the contest still bear the names of ' rebellion ' and authority . ' Equal nations , fair enemies , great public rivals fight with mercy , and conquer with courtesy , but woe to the weak and helpless , when a mother country is moved to extend her parental correction to an unruly province , and chasteneth whom she loveth . It is probable , " says Dr Priestley in his memoirs , " that no man now living was better acquainted with Dr Franklin and his sentiments on all subjects of importance , than myself for several years of the American war . He took every method in his power to prevent a rupture between the colonies and the mother country . He dreaded the war , and often said that if the differences should come to an open rupture , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be favorable to America , he never doubted . The English , he used to say , may take all our great towns , but that will not give them possession of the country . By many persons Franklin was considered so callous , that the prospect of all the horrors of a civil war would not affect him . This was far from being the case . A great part of the last day that he passed in England , we spent alone together . He was looking over a number of American newspapers , directing me what to extract for the English ones ; and in reading them he was frequently not able to proceed , for the tears literally running down his * p.96 . We must close our extracts from Franklin 's life by the following two anecdotes ; the first an instance of his coolness and humor , and the last amusing from the contrast of character displayed : Among the ambassadors of other countries , then residing at Paris , he supported , in the same spirit , the dignity of his station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered // no neglect of any of the punctilios of honor and ceremony , which are observed towards each other by the ministers of independent nations . When the Russian ambassador , whose card being left at his door , had occasioned a return of the supposed civility , betrayed much alarm at the accident , Franklin , with his usual composure , observed that he perceived no cause of embarrassment " Prince Bariatinski has but to erase my name out of his book of visits received , and I will burn his card . ' p. 116 . He visited assiduously the French Academy , where he was hailed at all times with the *most respectful homage , and where he enlarged the circle of his extensive and honorable acquaintance . It was here that occurred , at a numerous and splendid meeting of this assembly , his well known rencontre with Voltaire , who , like himself , had approached the last scene of a long and eventful life , and who , from the extraordinary admiration which his writings had excited amongst his countrymen , was now received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native city , with the most lavish profu&amp;on of honors . The meeting of two men , born in regions of the globe so remote , and who in their different offices had exercised so powerful an influence upon mankind ; of men so respectable by their age , as well as by their transcendent genius , and the occupations of their lives , was viewed with sentiments of tenderness and admiration . At their meeting , they embraced each other affectionately , as ancient friends after a long absence , and were hailed by the repeated acclamations of the assembly . " It is Solon , " said some one in the crowd , " in the urms of Sophocles . " It is related that at one of these meetings , Franklin , leading by the hand his grandson , and presenting him to Voltaire , asked his benediction ; and that the latter , in placing his hands on the head of the youth , with patriarchal solemnity , pronounced aloud , in English , " God and liberty , " adding , " this is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' p. 130 . The life of George Wythe follows that of Franklin . This is a short memoir , the materials for the biography not having been found very abundant . Mr Wythe began the study of the law at the age of thirty , and was a member of the house of burgesses of Virginia in 1764 . He drew the remonstrance to the British house of commons , which followed their resolutions in introduction to the Stamp Act . He appears , however , to have opposed , in conjunction with Peyton Randolph and others , the famous resolutions of Patrick Henry , on the ground of the substance of their contents having been urged in the former memorials . In 1776 , Mr Wythe was appointed a committee // with Mr Jefferson and others , to revise the laws of the state , and prepare bills for reenacting them , with the alterations made necessary by the independence of the state . This labor was effected by Messrs Jefferson , Pendleton , and Wythe , and in 1779 , one hundred and twenty-six bills were prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive work of legislation , ' having *among its objects to abolish the law of primogeniture , to define with precision the rules by which aliens should become citizens , and citizens make themselves aliens ' to establish religious freedom on the broadest bottom , ' to emancipate all slaves , born after passing the act , ' to proportion crimes and punishments according to a scale submitted , ' to diffuse knowledge more generally by means of public schools , Wythe executed the revision of those laws , which had been enacted during the period commencing with the revolution in England , and ending with the establishment of the new government here , except the acts for regulating descents , for religious freedom , and for proportioning crimes and punishments , which were part of the labors of Mr Jefferson . ' Mr Wythe was nominated in 1777 , one of the three judges of the high court of chancery of Virginia , and on a new arrangement of that court , was appointed sole chancellor , in wl*ich situation he remained more than twenty years . His death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary instance in our country of the occurrence in real life of those horrible crimes , which turn civilization into shame , in contrast with savage barbarity . His long life of public usefulness was closed , in exhibiting an additional proof of fervent devotion to the interests of the community . Tortured on the bed of death , with agonies produced by poison , taken in some portion of his aliment , he was immersed in the study of cases , yet pending in his court ; regretting , as long as his senses *continned , the delay and consequent expense which would be incurred by the parties , should his illness prove fatal . He died in the midst of this benevolent anxiety , on the 8th of June , 1806 , in the eighty-first year of his age . In his death , Virginia mourned one of her most favoured sons ; but the cause of his sudden loss spread an *lditional gloom over the darkness of her grief . No doubt remained of his death being producced by violence , and suspicion fell upon one , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the most detestable of crimes . // By his last will he bequeaths a great part of his property irs trust to support his three freed negroes , a woman , a man , and a boy , during their lives ; after several legacies , particularly one , " of his books and philosophical apparatus , to his valued friend , Thomas Jefferson , president of the United * the remainder of his estate is devised to George Wythe Sweney , the grand .. son of his sister . Durino. the life-time of Wythe , his freed man died , and by a codicil to his will , the legacy to the freed boy is increased , with a provision , that if he should die before his full age , the bequest to him should enure to the benefit of Sweney , the residuary legatee . A few days before the death of Wythe , a second codicil is dated ; in this instrument the freed boy is mentioned as having " died this morning : " all the devises to George Wythe Sweney are revoked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other grand children of his sister , the brothers and sisters of Sweney , to be equally divided between them . The sudden death of the negro boy ; the revocation of the former devises ; the suspicions of the community , fatally confirmed by the death of Wythe himself , all tend to the conclusion , that poison was introduced amongst the provisions of the house hold . The residuary legatee of the first xviii , submitted to a public trial on the charge of poisoning his uncle and the freed boy : an acquittal by a jury has caused a veil to be dropped over the transaction revolting to humanity ; and the solemn decision of a criminal court has shown to the world , that although the lamented Wythe died by poison , yet legal certainty can not be attached to his murderer . ' pp. 177-179 . A very interesting memoir of judge Hopkinson follows the sketch of chancellor Wythe . No portion of the volumes before us has given us greater pleasure than this memoir . We wish that it may stimulate some patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkinson : or rather may stimulate the patriotic public , to call for such a republication ; the fault in these cases being , we own , unfairly laid at the door of the poor booksellers , who are willing to publish any thing which the community is willing to buy , and more perhaps can not fairly be asked of them . Among the pieces of judge Hopkinson in question , is that most specta. * tonal disquisition on white xvashing , inferior to nothing in this strain since or by Addison . The life of judge Paine concludes this number ; and will be read with spqcial interest , particularly by those in this quarter to whom his memory is still fresh . We lay before our // 193 readers the following extract of a letter of Judge Paine 's , writ*. ten at the time that Congress moved to Baltimore , in December 1776 , on the approach of the English to Philadelphia . Our public affairs have been exceedingly agitated since I wrote you last . The loss of fort Washington made way for that of fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , threw us into a most disagreeable situation . * * But to work we went  --  the associations of the city were drawn forth , and about three thousand men , with some artillery , marched . The country associations were called upon ; but there was no expectation of immediate relief from them . As the week advanced , we had repeated advices from General Washington of the unopposed approach of the enemy , headed by General Cornwallis . On Monday , we were informed that they had arrived at Brunswick , and that Washington was retreating to the west side of the Delaware . We sent many continental stores into the country , and great numbers of the people are moving . The shops have not been open since Sunday ; and there was a real apprehension that we should be routed . I need not tell you what our calculations were on the expectation of losing this city . I had called in my accounts and prepared matters for a regular retreat : but on Thursday we found the enemy had not crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went with a flag to the enemy , to exchange a prisoner , we learned that they were about six thousand strong , and were surprised to find Newark and Elizabethtown evacuated by their inhabitants ; that they knew the state of our army , which induced them to make the excursion . The enemy are in possession of a large part of New Jersey ; and the remaining part is greatly distressed by their approach . But I hope this affair will rouse them from that lethargy which occasioned this excursion . Had their militia been alert and resolute , and given General Washington the support they might have done , these events had not happened ; but carelessness and apathy have been the lords of our ascendants this last month . It is to no purpose , however , to scold . Let us carefully ascertain our past errors and amend them . Sunday , 8th congress were called this morning , on advice , that General Howe had joined General Cornwallis with a large reinforcement , and was marching to Princeton . This measure induces us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 9th ; Yesterday General Washington crossed the Delaware , and the enemy arrived at Trenton on the east side , thirty mile from this place . Close quarters for congress ! It obliges us to move ; we have resolved to go to Baltimore . ' pp. 229-232 . . Ycw Series , No 13. 25 // In the notes to this number also , is found the following sportive correspondence , which may relieve the attention from the contemplation of the more weighty discussions connected with the Declaration of Independence . In 1762 , J. Sewall , the attorney general of the province , wrote his friend Paine as follows : viz. " Brother Bob , pray be so kind as to deliver the enclosed to a Catchpole , and when you can give me an opportunity to cancel the obligation , please to command me freely ; your hearty friend , " &amp;c. - " How is the harvest in your part of the vineyard ? Which side do you take in the political controversy ? What think you of coin ? What of writs of assistance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis ? What of Thacher ? What of Coke , the cobbler ? What think you of bedlam for political madmen ? What think you of patriotsm ? What think you of disappointed ambition ? What think you of the fable of the bees ? What ? Send me your thoughts on these questions , and I will send you fifty more . " Mr Paine 's reply , six days after the date of the above . " Friend Jonathan , I have just received yours , and shall take special care of the enclosed . Your queries demand an immediate answer , in which I hope you will find a satisfactory display of the orthodoxy of my mind . To first query , I answer , that the old account is reversed , for the harvest is small and the labourers many , and there are many little foxes that spoil the vines . To second query , I reply , the right side . To the third question I say , what hungry men do of food , if they can get any , never dispute the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never was more need of them ; I shall soon apply for one to get me a help-meet . Question fifth : What of his honour the L. G. ? I answer as the son of Sirach said , all things can not be in vain , because man is not immortal-what is brighter than the sun ? yet the light thereof faileth . What of Otis ? Answer : What the virtuosi do of Lemory 's concave mirror , which burns every thing that can not be melted . What of Thacher ? Answer ; as Jacob said of his son Dan , as a serpent in the way , he biteth the horse 's heels , so that his rider falleth backward . What of Coke , the cobbler ? That he is dignified with a title which many others deserve more . What of bedlam for political madmen ? It will by no means do , being already occupied by madmen of a more sacred profession . What of patriotism ? As I do of the balance master 's art , very few have virtue enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What of disappointed ambition ? Consult your own mind , in having no reply to this question . What of the fable of the bees ? It proves that good old word , The wrath of man shall praise the Lord . Last question , What -.  - -   - -   ? It // is the recapitulation of all the others . Thus I have gone through my catechism , and according to the good rule of education , the next step is to learn it with proofs ; in which I shall hardly fail of success , if I keep to that standard . As for the fifty questions more , with which you threaten me , I beg when you execute it , you would observe a modern rule of answering them yourself as you go along . pp. 242 , 243 . We remarked above , that we thought the plan of this work good . The declaration of Independence  --  a national monument , not more lasting than brass , but as durable in its effects and associations , as the republic itself and the name of freedom ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the arts can afford . Several enterprises of the kind , fac similes of the instrument , portraits of the members of the congress , &amp;c. have lately appeared . Certainly nothing is more desirable than that these efforts should not be directed merely to a mechanical preservation of this paper , venerable as it is . The plan of adding the most interesting facts , in the lives of the signers to their names and portraits , seems to comprise every thing necessary to render this docunjient satisfactory and precious to us and posterity . Something of the same kind has also been undertaken in England , and a perfect fac simile of Magna Charta in lithography has just been executed London . But this baronial declaration of Independence , venerable and valuable as it is to Americans and Englishmen , wants the greatness of ours . Those are proud words , , JV'ulli vendendam justitiam , but they are spoken by a master ; the free , sovereign , and independent states ' was a formula to equalise the subservient and oppressed provinces with the haughty metropolitan empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous and exalted than those of Magna Charta . One , extorted by rude violence from a base and treacherous spirit , whose cowardice and weakness gave up , what he could neither understand nor value , the other uttered by virtuous and wise men , with the gravity of age and the ardor of youth . The captive prince strove only to secure his own worthless life , the American patriots were eager to expose theirs to defend what they asserted ; - they were the full of hope , miscalled forlorn . ' As one reads the Gothic characters of Magna Charta , some associations of darkefand ruder ages unite themselves , with its promises of better and freer times , while the // generous and enlightened sentiments of the Declaration of Independence , soften the anticipations of danger and suffering which attended their utterance . We observe that these two numbers of this work are well executed in a mechanical point of view . There are some errors of the press , but on the whole , both the engraving and printing are handsome and creditable .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
