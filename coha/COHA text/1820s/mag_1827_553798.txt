txt T*IERE is hardly such a thing , as a good history of m*ny of the American Colonies before the Revolution . Those , which are respectable as narratives of events , are exceedingly deficient in the most important branches of history , philosophical and political research . Before the Revolution , indeed , no good history could be written , for events had not so far unfolded themselves , as to enabje the historian to detect their bearings and relations towards the great issue of the independence of the colonies . Such a history might now be written , if all the materials could be collected ; but here again a serious difficulty arises . The best materials are in great part lost , except such as have been preserved in the office of Trade and Plantations , in London . // It is very probable that many of the most valuable may be there . In the archives of the different States may be found the remnants of the old Journals of Assembly , or , as they were commonly called , Votes and Proceedings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often dry and meagre as historical records , particularly the latter . The original orders and decrees of the government in England , and especially the correspondence with the governors of the Colonies , are materials of greater importance than all others ; yet an exceedingly small part only of the papers of this description is now to be found in this country . Till copies of them shall be obtained from England , a full and accurate colonial history can never be written . The materials in New York are as abundant , perhaps , as in any other state . yet very few remain of the kind here mentioned . The series of Dutch records , recently translated into English by Mr Vanderkemp , amounts to twentyfour manuscript folio volumes , embracing the period between the years 1638 and 1674 . The Council Minutes* ' in manuscript are comprised in twentyfive folio volumes , extending from 1683 to 1775 , with a few broken records afterwards , during the time the British held possession of the city of New York . The Journals of the Colonial Assemblies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in two large volumes , the first printed in 1764 , and the other in 1776 , embracing together the period between 1691 and 1775 , the end of the colonial government . The papers in the Secretary 's office relating to the Revolution are very full , till the close of the year 1777 . After the new government was formed , near the end of that year , George Clinton was chosen governor , and the executive papers from that time during the war have never been returned to the public archives . The Minutes of the Proceedings of the first committee of safety in New York , of the subsequent Conventions , Provincial Congress , intermediate committees of safety , and of the Convention , that formed the Constitution of the State in 1777 , are carefully copied out , and bound in ten folio volumes . These records have never been printed . When the new government went into operation , the Journals of Assembly and Senate were printed , and have thus been continued ever since . A valuable selection might be made for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s of the Convention , which formed the Constitution . All the papers above mnentioned have been collected , and are preserved with remarkable care in the Secretary 's office . The State has made liberal appropriations for this purpose , as well as for reprinting the Journal of the Assembly , during the interesting period between the years 1766 and 1776 . It only remains now to print a judicious selection // Jan. from the minutes of the early committees , provincial Congresses , and Conventions . Smith 's well known History of New York ' was first published in the year 1756 . The style is plain and the narrative perspicuous . The author in his prefitce calls it a narrative , and adds , it deserves not the name of history , though for brevity 's sake I have given it that title ; it presents only a regular thread of simple facts . ' This is a just description of its character , and the work answers fully to the author 's own opinion of it . He seldom goes aside to look for remote causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great questions , which were always agitated more or less under some form , between the mother country and the colonies , and which at last produced a separation , he seldom touches . What we now want in the way of history is , that the state of these questions , interwoven with the narrative , should be traced step by step from the very beginning , and the gradual changes in popular institutions , feelings , and habits distinctly marked , till the great crisis of the assertion of independence . When such a history shall be written , it will be seen that the principles of freedom and self government were brought hither by the first colonists , and that they never ceased to be active , and to increase in energy and effect , till they came to their result in breaking the bonds of union , or rather the chains of servitude . It will be seen , that the American Revolution began with American colonization . Smith 's History , as published by himself , reaches from the first discovery of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany twelve years ago , which professes on the title page to be accompanied with a continuation from the year 1732 , to the commencement of the year 1814 ; ' but which does not in reality come down later than 1747 . A short apology appears in the conclusion , and a promise that at some future day the chasm will be supplied in a manner worthy of the subject . ' We believe that future day ' has never come . This is the less to be *egr etted , however , since a continuation by the original author has now been brought before the public by the New York Historical Society . It is numbered as the fourth volume of the Society 's Collections . After publishing his first work , Smith , it seems , wrote a continuation of his history down to the year 1762 , which has remained in manuscript till lately , in the hands of his son , William Smith , who resides in Canada , and is one of his Majesty 's Council for that province . By this gentleman the manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in all respects worthy of the patronage of that body , and is a valnaable acquisition to the historical literature of the country . We // shall forbear any further remarks at present , as we intend to take some future opportunity to recut to this volume with a view to the celebrated Convention , which met at Albany in 1754 to devise a plan ct*union for the colonies . There are points of history connected with that event , which have a claim to more notice than any writer has yet given them . About two years ago , a volume was printed in New York , entitled , History of the State of New York , including its Aboriginal and Colonial Annals ; by John V. N. Yates , and Joseph W. Moulton . ' This purports to be the first part of the first volnine , and Mr Moulton has recently issued the second part , the title of which we have copied at the beginning of this notice . His plan is comprehensive , it being his design to comprise , within four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the era of its Canal policy . ' This second part , we suppose , completes the first volume , and it brings us down to the year 1633 , about twentyfour years after the discovery of Hudson 's river , through a region , which he calls the terra incognita ' of New York history . It certainly is dark , and not the most delightsome to the traveller ; but a cloudy morning often precedes a bright day , and it is reasonable to expect , that Mr Moulton 's future labors may afford more entertainment , if not more instruction , to his readers . We would gladly stipulate one thing with him however , which is , that , when he publishes another volume , he will bethink himself of a table of contents , an index , or some conttivance for guiding us to such parts as we may have a particular fancy to consult , without our being compelled to look through all his chapters to gain our object , and then perhaps in vain . Mr Moulton quotes authorities , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better to be in the extreme on this side than the other . He gives evidence incontestible of his industry , and of his deep research into all the parts of his subject . On the general character of his work , and the success of its execution , it would seem not proper to comment , till he has advanced further in his enterprise . He must guard against such minuteness and prolixity as will become tedious ; nobody reads a dull history . We ought not to omit to state here , that Dr Samuel Miller once contemplated writing a history of New York , and made considerable progress in collecting his materials . Other pursuits diverted his attention from this project , but the fruits of his inquiries , as far as they were pursued , he deposited in the library of the New York Historical Society , of which he was an early and active member .
