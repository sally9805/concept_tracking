txt Aur . XII. - Debate in Congress on the Bill to amend the several . dcts for imposing Duties on imports . 1824 . ON examining the speeches made upon the tariff question we find that , as far as the principle of the restrictive policy goes , the argument is given up by its friends . Under the form of ridicule ineffectually cast on several distinguished // writers upon political economy , the reasoning of those writers seems to be admitted to be irrefragable . Under the pretence of passing over their arguments as metaphysical , they are ad- ' mitted to be such as allow no reply ; since no one probably will think , that the friends of the tariff policy would neglect to refute , if possible , the doctrines of the most approved writers on political economy , and prove them to be as false as they maintain them to be impracticable . To show wore distincily , from an unexceptionable source , in what way the friends of the tariff treat the arguments of some of the most sensible authors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the speech of the Chairman of the Corn-. mittee of Manufactures . Bonaparte and the British ministry , it has been stated , wrangled for whole weeks if not months during the peace of ? 802 , ( ? ) about the quantities of goods , which the people of the two natiees might exchange with each other ; each party obstinate to the very last hi refusing to take the products of the other , unless they were permitted to he paid for in the product of the nation receiving them . Whether right or not , all this was done by statesmen ; *nd let it not be forgotten that , while doing it , they had all the tlipliysical books of the economists before their eyes ; or if not all their books , yet all their discoveries had been made before that time ; made and published by Fi*enchmen and by Britons for the good of their own dear countries , and calculated for their own latitudes . Of these discoveries the grandest is said to be , that , in order to get rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , dxink , or wear anything made or produced at home , provided it can be had cheaper from abroad , so that we see how completely opposite to these discoveries has been the practice of the two nations ; and from this , and from all their conduct before and since , it is plain , that the two countries , which produced these political economists , have always looked upon them as so many conceited enthus*msts , and have taken special care never to meddle , practically , with their books , except so far as to print and export them . In some foreign countries they have had , to be sure , an amazing run . I am not going to try my hand at disentangling their arguments . Let it be , that all their reasoning on the subject is so correctly metaphysical and s* 4eep , as not to be comprehended nor refuted . What then ? In legislating for a great country , are we to draw our information and our opinions from the deductions of theoretical writers ? Or are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , which different systems have had on the prosperity and decay of nations ? ' // This extract , coinciding as it does with the sentiments expressed in almost every speech on the same side of the question , appears to us to justify the assertion , that the friends of the tariff policy admit the argument of their opponents to be unanswerable . They cast on this argument , indeed , the reproach of being metaphysical and abstract , hut tell us they do not undertake to enter into it ,  --  they appeal to practice . Now it seems to us rather an unpromising aspect of a policy , that it begins by resisting the deductions of men , who have , with great concert of opinion and reasoning , established the principles of the science that treats of this policy . What , we may well ask , is the meaning of a practical man in the business of a tariff ? You reject the conclusions of Smith and Say , and appeal to the practice of ministers and financiers ; and you call the former theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms thus , or rather why give the name of practical , in this connexion , to the minister rather than to the writer ? The truth is , that practical is a term not well applied , on either side , to the subject . There is a propriety in the distinction of practical and theoretical , when applied to the arts of life ; a practical farmer is properly opposed to a scientific agriculturist ; a practical artist to an adept in mechanical philosophy . But what do the friends of the tariff mean , when they talk of a practical system as opposed to a theoretical , in regard to the proper national policy of enconragernent extended to different branches of industry ? What makes a statesman , in this respect , a practical man ? He has not followed any one of the pursuits , which he taxes or encourages . He has been neither a merchant , a manufacturer , nor a planter ; neither a collector of customs , nor an exciseman . Nay more , it rarely happens that he is himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical man , even in the limited sense of having devised and matured the various prohibitory or protecting duties , which he maintains in existence . These , in all the old countries of Europe , have been the growth of centuries . They have many of them been imposed to meet particular occasions ; some duties have been contrived to balance others , and they now must remain , because immense sacrifices would be made by repeab* ing them . // To administer such a system , a nobleman of strong connexions , or a political leader of transcendant talents , comes into office . Nothing would be wider from the truth , than to suppose he comes there to do what he thinks in itself right ; nothing more unjust , than to quote him in favor of a system which he continues or even enforces , because he can not alter it . Nothing is more preposterous , moreover , than to call him a practical man in reference to this business , on the score of his introducing into the legislature or presenting to the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment of the conflicting parts of such a system , from time to time , require . What information he needs , to discharge these official duties , he seeks from the tradesmen , artisans , or planters , who possess it , and the books which contain it ; what principles he acts on , he has formed from observation , reflection , and reading . In this way and no other do the writers on political economy gather their facts and form their opinions . But , in general , the business of tariffs and duties is the smallest part of the practice of these statesmen , who are strangely looked up to by American legislators . Wars , the balance of power , coalitions , ambitious projects abroad , intrigues at home , the preservation of place , jobs for friends , these are the things , which constitute the practice of statesmen , far more considerably than the administration of the great national interests . If there be any propriety in connecting the epithet practical with this subject , we should think it belonged precisely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Committee of Manufactures , in that homely way , which characterises him , intimates that Dr Smith and his school were but conceited enthusiasts . ' And yet the Doctor was a cool , sagacious man ; he devoted twenty years and more to the composition of the Wealth of Nations . The book itself proves that no minister or statesman could be better acquainted with the facts relative to every part of the public system than he ; not only in his own country , hut in almost every other . He particularly sought and received information from all , who were best able to afford it , of which an important instance is mentioned in the case of the bank of Amsterdam , in the preface to the fourth edition . Much of his life was employed in investigations , much of his high // reputation pledged on successfully treating this subject , and who can be better entitled than he , in this connexion , to the name of practical , we can not conceive . Cuique in arte sua credendum est ; nor is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a statesman , in this connexion , which would not give it far more decisively to Smith . Or take the case of Mr Ricardo , also one of these conceited enthusiasts , ' these metaphysical dreamers . He was a man , who , from being an indigent Jew , of Portuguese descent , raised himself to a princely fortune , to a seat in parliament , to respectability in the best English circles , to an equality With what that country has of most intelligent . Mr Ricardo had the reputation of being , of all men in Europe , the best versed in the really abstract subject of money ; and his opinions *in the House of Commons , on this subject , were received with proportionate respect . What is there , in such a man , to authorise the stigma of conceited enthusiasm and metaphysical abstraction ? Why is he theoretical , and lord Castle*eagh practical ? We say again , that of the two , Mr Ricardo is the practical man . A fortune of three or four millions of dollars , acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most various forms , in the stocks , in inanufactures , in landed estates ; several years passed in the legislature , in which on all questions connected with finance he was allowed to take a lead ; and finally , that peculiar stimulus to investigation , which arises from undertaking to write upon a subject , and thus commiting a high reputation to public scrutiny ; all these seem to be circumstances , which constitute Mr Ricardo a practical man in the business he treated . If he was not , we know not what the word means . If he be not better entitled to the name , than the ministers , who probably devote fewer hours than he did days to this subject ; then we confess that the essence of a practical economist is indeed a metaphysical subtlety , which we can not grasp . The name is easily claimed , but we apprehend it would exceed the ingenuity of the Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures , to define the thing in any way , which would make Mr Canning the practical , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , in his plain way , that he is not going to try to disentangle the arguments of these writers . Let it be , that all their reasoning is so correctly metaphysical // and so deep , as not to be comprehended nor refuted . ' We can infer only , from this way of speaking , that our practical statesman has never read them . We much fear , that he and many of his colleagues are in the predicament of persons , who deride what they have not given themselves the trouble to become acquainted with . If the worthy chairman will but read the Wealth of Nations , we assure him he will find it a perpetual feast . Supposing him too candid to quarrel with a book of considerable extent , because some of its views may appear to him unsound , it will be with great satisfaction that the chairman will find much of the Wealth of Nations to commend itself even to him , as sound practical wisdom . He will be agreeably disappointed to discover in it a vast fund of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of the moderate , gradual , and prudent over thespeculative and hazardous ; a preference of the home market over a foreign market . He will find , to his amazement , that the Report of General Hamilton , which he so much lauds , is in a good measure borrowed from the work of Smith , which he so much sneers at . If the chairman would give it an attentive and candid perusal , we feel sure that he would wonder at the epithets , which he has so unjustly bestowed upon him . We might say nearly as much of the work of Mr Say . Abating the chapters , which bear hard on the tariff policy , we assure the chairman of the committee , that the greater part of the work will appear to him sound and judicious ; the production of a strong and richly furnished mind . In both these works , he will find neither pomp nor obscurity of language ; no splitting of hairs , no far pursued chase after theories , unsupported by instances and facts . In Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an occasional heartiness of manner , which though rather more refined than the chairman 's own , bears the same stamp of sincerity* He will positively not find one proposition in the work , on which he can put his finger and fairly pronounce it metaphysical , in the o* ) probrious sense of that term ; not one proposition , which he can comfort himself by calling obscure or recondite ; or from which he can well turn aside , as fantastical and far fetched . If this be true , and we appeal to every candid man , ( whatever he thinks of the tariff policy , ) who has read these works , that it is true ; we would ask what propriety there is , in the // tone adopted towards these writers , in the late debate ? We would also ask , whether the doctrines of such men do not require to be fairly met and disproved , not by the compendious course of an appeal to the practice of statesmen , but by manly counter reasonings ; by showing that the doctrines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ones . Till this is done , the friends of the tariff system must be content to have it said , by fair and candid observers , that they give up the defence of their cause by argument . But we have not quite done with this topic . Not only do the chairman of the committee , and his colleagues , do great injustice to what really is contained in the writings of the political economists ; but they commit the equally gross injustice of throwing out , as a standing answer to every antitariff statement , that it is borrowed from these hooks . They first attempt to give the hooks the abovementioned character , and then think they have answered any statement by saying , it comes from the books , it is merely the ipse dixit of Adam Smith . An example will make this clear . Mr Webster , in the course of his speech , took occasion to speak of the exploded doctrine of the Balance of Trade , which he had rightly.denominated jargon and nonsense . After showing it to be so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial exchanges , in which not an allusion was made to any writer or book , he closes the topic with this appeal to practice . ' Allow me , Sir , to give an instance , tending to show how unac* countably individuals deceive themselves , and imagine themselves to be somewhat rapidly mending their condition , while they ought to be persuaded that , by that infallible standard , the balance of trade , they are on the high road to ruin . Some years ago , in better times than the present , a ship left one of the towns of New England with 7'O,000 specie dollars . She proceeded to Mocha , on the Red Sea , and there laid out these dollars in coffee , drugs , spices , &amp;c . With this new cargo she proceeded to Europe ; two thirds of it were sold in Holland for 130,000 dollars , which the ship brought back , and placed in the same Bank , from the vaults of which she had taken her original outfit . The other third was sent to the ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in specie , and 15,000 dollars in Italian merchandise . These sums together make 170,000 dollars imported , which is // We should find no great difficulty , Sir , in paying off our balances , if this were the nature of them all . ' And how does the Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures reply to this ? We feel regret in quoting him . After naming Mr Webster in the preceding paragraph , and calling him more of a philosopher than a politician , ' lie goes on to add , not a little has been said about the balance of trade , and we have been beset , throughout almost the whole of this debate , by authorities drawn from the books of the writers called modern political economists . ' Is this fair , above all in a practical man ? Mr Webster quoted no book on this subject . The principle , which he very happily illustrated , may be found , indeed , in several books . But Mr Webster did not go to them for it , did not give it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the chai*iian , if he really was desirous of treating the subject practically , confute this practical instance ; and show how , on his theory of the balance of trade , the Mocha voyage could be profitable . With respect to this pretended contrast of a praptical and theoretical policy nothing is more certain , than that it is an alternative , not between theory and practice , but between two theories . On one side it is said to be the interest of the nation to leave the direction of individual industry to individual judgment . This you object is a theory . Be it so . But when in return you say , with the chairman of the committee , that it is best for the government to direct individual industry , that government is nothing but restriction , that it is for the sake of restriction that men formed societies , and the like ; is not this a theory ? What is there more practical in this proposition , than in the first ? And which is the most rational , which looks most practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisition do not contain a doctrine more purely despotic in its tendency , than , that all government is restriction . The object of government is directly the reverse , to devise the smallest amount of restriction , by which the greatest liberty can be secured . Again , the approved writers on political economy say , that it is conducive to the national wealth that every individual consumer should buy where he can buy cheapest , and , which is the necessary consequence , sell where he can sell dearest ; that is , where he can get most necessaries and comforts for // the fruits of his labor . This is said to be mere theory . But , on the other hand , when the friends of the tariff policy tell us , it is more conducive to national wealth , that the consumer buy of a countryman , is not that theory ? Must it not be shown , that the former is a false theory , and the latter a true theory , and till this is shown , do they not , as theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the theories of political economy be not unintelligible or absurd in their terms , which we presume is not pretended , they are either true or false ; if true , they are confirmed in practice , for that is the meaning of a true theory , viz , a theory which agrees with the facts ; if false , they can be shown to be so . But so far from this being done , the advocates of the tariff policy call them metaphysical , and turn their backs on them . Still , though we complain of the way in which the argument on the principle of the tariff policy has been met , we allow very cheerfully that the appeal to the practice of those countries , which have all either prohibited or severely taxed imported manufactures , is a fair argument , and we shall do our best to answer it fairly . As it is put in the front rank of defence , by the friends of the tariff , as it is made to serve as an answer to all arguments on the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the attention due to the importance with which it is thus clothed . We observe , then , in the first place , that this argument takes for granted the very thing to be proved , and that with the widest comprehension both of premises and conclusion . It is asserted that America is in a distressed , impoverished , and declining state ; that certain foreign nations are rich and prosperous ; that their tariffs of heavy and prohibitory duties on imported goods , and the consequent encouragement of manufactures , are the cause of this prosperity ; and that , therefore , America has only to imitate these foreign nations in introducing the causes , and the effect will follow . Reduced to a series of plain propositions , the foregoing is the great argument from the practice of statesmen and the example of other nations , which has been made to serve as an answer to the best established principles of political economy . Now we consider it perfectly correct to observe , that this whole statement of facts is erroneous . We deny each proposition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of impoverishment and ruin . We deny // July that any foreign Country is prosperous compared with America . We deny that there is sufficient ground to ascribe what prosperity is enjoyed by foreign nations to the restrictive system ; and we finally deny that this system , even if productive of prosperity abroad , could be , with any certainty , depended on to produce the same effects here , considering the different circumstances of the old and of the new world . With regard to the first point , that this country is incorrectly alleged to be in a state of impoverishment and ruin , we should think it presumptuous to endeavor to add anything to the views , which are taken by Mr Webster in the commencement of his speech . We can ascribe it only to the conviction , into which an ardent mind may excite itself on any subject , that a statesman , so enlightened as Mr Clay , whose political glance is comprehensive enough to take in the whole of a country , should , on the ground of the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draw the conclusion that this country is really , at this moment , on the whole , in an abject state . We rejoice that we are able , on this point , to appeal from this his unfavorable judgment , to his own on another occasion , where he justly speaks of this happy ' this favored land ; ' and represents it , as it is , full of energy , resource , and power . Nor is that gentleman unacquainted with the distress of Europe , nor with the hollow , unsubstantial , and deceptive nature of its prosperity . On this point also we shall make but a few incidental remarks , when led to the subject , in pursuance of what we esteem the most important proposition , viz , that even if the great foreign states are prosperous , there is not sufficient ground to ascribe their prosperity to their tariffs . The aggregate condition of a nation , its general state of poor or rich , prosperous or declining , is a very complex effect , sometimes perhaps resulting from some few very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of numerous institutions , laws , and national habits . To say , because you wish to recommend a high tariff , that foreign na-* tions are prosperous , and foreign nations have high tariffs , and therefore the tariffs are the cause of the prosperity , appears to us an unstatesmanlike language . These nations , whose example in respect of the tariff is pressed upon us , have all of them many other institutions , far more prominent and marked , and really exerting a far more decisive effect on the // public condition , than any which can be rationally ascribed to laws regulating the importation of foreign goods . They have forms of hereditary monarchical , sometimes despotic government . Is not this an institution , which , traced in all its connexions and consequences , is a far more prominent institution than a commercial tariff , and therefore more entitled to be selected as the cause of the national condition , be it prosperous or adverse ? These nations , moreover , have orders of nobility , immense landed capitals and very powerful political influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have foreign insular or continental possessions . Now we are certainly not saying , that any one of these or all together , can make a nation prosperous and happy , witbcrnt vartous other things , which we have not yet named . Yet we submit it to any one , who reflects on the springs of national character , that any one of these institutions must exert a far more decisive influence on the nation 's condition , than its tariff ; and of course there is no reason for ascribing the power and prosperity of the foreign nations to an engine of comparatively insignificant force , while others so potent are in action . Why fix on the tariff of duties to account for a national condition , which unquestionably arises from the combined operation of very various causes among which the tariff , at best , can be only one ; from the institutions inherited from a remote ancestry , from geographical features , from the laws affecting the distribution and security of property , and , above all , from the state of civil freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of the tariff , in adopting a course of reasoning like this , make use of an illogical argument ; they really contradict the most unquestioned deductions not of political econoniy* for that admirable science some of them deride , but of political history and political experience . We freely confess , that it is of great importance that the most wise and most judicious laws , could they but be ascertained as such , should be enacted in the various and interesting branches of industry , even to the most insignificant details . But when this is done , it is idle to say that any one of them is the main spring of national prosperity . They do not make it , where the other and higher principles of public growth are wanting ; nor do they destroy it , where these exist . It is the more important to make this remark , // for in the zeal of defending or opposing a measure like the tariff , politicians on either side of the question , are apt to form narrow views of the true sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to assert their importance ; to ascribe to them the prosperity of which they are the real source ; and to trace to their absence , in the countries unfortunate enough to want them , the degeneracy and decline , which this want invariably prodnoes . Political independence , as contrasted with colonial subjection , or great subserviency to a powerful neighbor ; a limited government , and still more , a representative government ; the trial by jury , the freedom of the press , the equality of laws , the security of property ; these are the springs of national prosperity ; these make a nation powerful , prosperous , rich ; increase its population , multiply its resources . A nation where these abound possesses a principle of life capable of bearing up under enormous burdens , and of resisting the power of the most insi- ' dious and the most malignant political diseases . In the example of England we see , that a principle of life and power may be infused into a nation , capable of reacting against the most formidable attacks from without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , who , passing over the institution of representative government , however defective , ( and monstrously corrupt and defective it is in that country , ) passing over an equal administration of justice , a free press , the security of property , and an insular situation , will deliberately say that it is not these , which have made the nation rich and powerful , but her laws against the importation of German linen and French cloth ? We can not think it . We can not believe that any statesman in America , in that country where the omnipotence , if we may venture on the term , of free institutions has been developed in a certainty and glory never seen before in the world , could be willing deliberately to do1his country , and the blessings bestowed on it , such injustice , as to say , these are all nothing to the public happiness , till the duty on woollens is raised eight per cent . An American statesman ought to read in the history of his own country , if not in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper . He ought to see what it was , which lifted this continent of Northern America from a colony , and a province , into a mighty empire , and that too under a // system of metropolitan government , so iniquitous , that we durst not manufacture a hobnail , nor transport a felt hat from province to province . If gentlemen think a high tariff good , very good , let them say so . If certain trades languish for the want of it , nothing can be fairer than that those concerned in them should importune Congress for relief . It is natural that the representatives of those districts of the country , which will be most benefited by the exclusion of foreign fabrics , should urge and press the enactment of laws , that will promote the interest of their constituents . But we would not behold high minded politicians ready to see , in every favorite measure of local advantage , the sine qua non of national prosperity . The tone of legislation is lamentably lowered , when we ascribe to cockets and clearances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties never did and never can impart . Nay , there are causes , which , though much lower than the lofty political ones alluded to , are nevertheless more powerful in their influence on the national condition , than laws of so limited a sphere as the tariff . Dr Franklin said that England owed her predominance to her coal mines ; and Lowe , in his late work , names them among three or four other causes , ( of which the tariff is not one , ) of the prosperity of England . Certainly , it is true that geographical position , climate , fertility , and conveniences for internal navigation , are infinitely more important than any law , however broad its enactments , saving such as go to affect the tenure and security of property . The difThrence of nations is enough to show , that it must be these physical and political causes combined , which ascertain their condition . Their tariffs , as we have been abund .. antly , nay , tauntingly told , they all have ; that is , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria , have all their innumerable laws to secure to their manufacturers the supply of their respective countries . But yet how different the condition of these nations ; England alone immensely rich ; France , Russia , Austria , in various degrees poor as nat*on* poor in respect to the private fortunes of individuals . And yet all that tariffs can do has been done in them all . The French , notwithstanding the superiority of English capital and machinery , have brought their woollens to perfection ; and the linens of Silesia bear witness , that a // manuf'acture may flourish in an impoverished country , an enslaved province . If a tariff is the grand arcanum of national condition , if it be that , which , by its presence or absence makes nations prosperous or the reverse , why are not France , Austria , Russia , and England equally rich , powerful , and flourishing ; why does not the same cause , if thus energetic , produce the same effect ? In fact the proposition becomes so absurd , by being dwelt upon , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate on the tariff question , will find it hard to believe that it could have been seriously urged ; and yet nothing is more certain , than that no answer was attempted to all the general reasonings against the tariff , but this , that foreign nations , which had tariffs , were prosperous . Nay more , the converse of this extravagant position was sustained in Congress , and it was strangely asserted , that the decline and impoverishment of such aations as Spain , Portugal , and Poland , were owing to their want of a tariff of duties on foreign fabrics . To assert this is so entirely to shut one 's eyes on the spectacle of political history , and to introduce a paradox so monstrous , that it ought for a moment to be animadverted upon . We are surprised that accomplished statesmen , like Mr Clay , should find no more powerful cause of the decline of Spain , than the importation of British woollens . The expulsion of the Moors and Jews , absolute monarchy , the inquisition , the division of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers , the absorption of wealth and men by the convents and the church , the license of driving hundreds of thousands of sheep across the kingdom , are these such insignificant causes of national decline , that the importation of British cloth should be fixed on , to the exclusion of them all ? There are even commercial causes of the decline of Spain far more obvious . Uztariz , a tariff man in the main , thus speaks of the prosperity of his country . After the strictest inquiry , and a most mature consideration of the duties imposed on commodities and goods in Spain , and other kingdoms and states , I have not been able to discover in France , England , or Holland , nations that best know the value of Commerce , that they ever laid any duty upon the sale or barter of their own woven and other manufactures , either upon the first or any future sale . As then I find Spain alone groaning under this bur* // den , and it is so very oppressive , as to lay ten per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one per cents annexed to it , a duty not only chargeable on the first sale , but on every future sale of goods , I am jealous that it is one of the principal engines that contributed to the ruin of most of our manufactures and * * We should apprehend that those , who find the causes of national growth and decline in circumstances like these , would be satisfied with a duty of fourteen per cent on every transfer of property , as sufficient , without the aid of foreign importation . The same author gives us a view of the duties on silk . Duties chargeable upon every Pound of Granada Silk . Maravedis Vellon . For the Alcavala , 302 Cientos , 104 , , Tartil , 8 Arbitrio , 68 , , Torres de la Mer , 4 1-2 Geliz , 15 1-2 502 The amount of these duties is five hundred and two maravedis , which make fourteen reals , twenty six maravedis , to which are to be added the duty of the diezmo , collected on the account of the royal revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that year was ninety two maravedis , as a pound of silk was then valued at twenty seven reals vellon , before the charging of any duties . Thus , if we include the diezmo , the duties amounted to seventeen reals , sixteen maravedis vellon upon each pound , which is above sixty per cent of the value of the silk , before it goes into the loom , a load so very oppressive , and such a clog upon the culture and manufacture of silk , that every person must needs confess it ; and for his conviction , there needs only the bare mention of the fact , as it stands in that chapter ; however , I have thought proper to take notice of it in this place , though it will give a fresh mortification to recollect this lamentable piece of mismanagement , but it is with a view , that when the whole of this misfortune is fairly laid open , we may better judge of the necessity of applying a remedy. * From these statements of a highly respectable Spanish author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they choose to . find the causes of the impoverishment of Spain in her legislation on these subjects , may perceive that it was // something very different from low duties on imports , with which the Spanish manufacturer had to struggle . In fact , it is plain that the free admission of foreign goods was , in the state of inaction to which the combined operation of the causes above indicated had reduced the country , the only mode in which Spain could invest the specie of the American colonies , and the country be saved from entire ruin . Without liberty , security , industrious habits , and freedom of internal trade , there could not have been cloth enough woven at borne to cover the backs of the population ; and it was nothing but the free access of foreign goods , which enabled them to convert a part of the almost worthless specie of the Indies into the wants and comforts of life . The only good feature in the whole Spanish system was that , by moderate duties on imports , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with articles of first necessity . And yet we are told , that it was not the Inquisition , it was not the engrossing of the property of the country by the church , it was not the barrier between the kingdoms , it was not the mesta which ruined Spain , but the want of a tariff of high duties on imports . Is there an American who will believe it ? If there be one who , wearied with the iteration of it in essays , addresses , and memorials , is tempted to think it may be true , let him fancy the principle put to the test in his own country . Establish a despotic monarchy , and a nobility , reduce the population of America from ten to five millions , by a series of cruel laws , as that of Spain has been reduced from sixteen millions to eight , constitute a holy inquisition in the predominating sect , and visit the firesides arnl kiearts of the population with the terrors of the rack and the stake , lock up a third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hundreds of thousands of monkish drones , forbid the exportation of specie , and thereby do all that laws can do to annihilate its exchangeable value in foreign trade , permit the several states to collect heavy transit duties on their frontiers , and let the general government lay a tax of fourteen per cent on every sale ; when the country is thus reduced to a sheep walk , for barrenness , make it literally one , as Spain is , by sending twice a year across the kingdom a desolating horde of semibarbarous shepherds with their vast flocks ; and then enact a tariff . Will it save the country , will it raise it , // will it create capital , excite industry , awaken enterprise , se cure property ; or will it not rather cut off the last source of supply to a ruined people ? Yet this is precisely the case with Spain , and nearly so with Portugal . As for Poland , well known to be both before and after the partition , the worst ruled country in Europe , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to sin against the light of republican institutions , and good government . To forbid the wretched inhabitants of that land to exchange their corn , the only blessing which their own anarchy and foreign despotism have not wrested from them , for a supply of necessary articles of manufacture from abroad , would be to take away the only remaining alleviation of the most calamitous national existence , into which a people can be plunged . In what we have hitherto said , we have proceeded upon the admission , that in comparison with the wretchedness of America , in some foreign countries the restrictive system was really associated with a high degree of prosperity , if not of the population at large , at least of those interests , which the tariffs are designed to protect . The whole argument of the friends of the tariff assumed this of course as granted . Mr Clay exerted all the powers of his brilliant imagination , wide observation of facts , and happy power of combination and arrangement , and produced a picture , which one could not indeed contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this , though less distinctly , and with some misgiving , we apprehend , of the solidity of the ground on which he was treading , he sketched in bold lines , the resources and prosperity of England . By less able hands than his , this same contrast was less cautiously made , and we were again and again called to compassionate the prostration into which our infant manufactures fell , for want of protection on the return of peace ; the invested capital that was sacrificed , the prosperous undertaker that was ruined , the industrious laborer driven from his employment , and the resounding factory , over whose lately busy wheels , the stream now breaks with profitless clamor ; and all for want of a tariff . Now let us look at England , the paragon of protecting policy , the chancery of prohibitory laws , the metropolis of the tariff policy . We assert it as a fact , which admits no contradic .. tion , that there is not a country on earth , where the manufac // turing interests , after the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both during the war and since the peace , the manufacturing system is the acknowledged source of so much misery . On this last topic we beg leave to quote the words of Mr Southey , of whom it is enough perhaps to say , in order to guarantee his impartiality on this subject , that he is one of the principal Quarterly Reviewers . The work , which we cite , was published about 1805 . With all its boasted wealth and prosperity , England is at the mercy of the seasons . One unfavorable harvest occasions dearth ; and what the consequences of famine would be in a country , where the poor are already so numerous and wretched , is a question , which the boldest statesman dares not ask himself . When volunteer forces were raised over the kingdom , the poor were excluded ; it was not thought safe to trust them with arms . But the peasantry are and ought to be the strength of every country ; and wo to that country , when the peasantry and poor are the same ! Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ruinous wars of the present reign , and the oppressive system of taxation pursued by the late premier are among the principal . But the manufacturing system is the main cause ; it is the inevitable tendency of that system to multiply the number of the poor , and to make them vicious , diseased , and miserable . ' The same eloquent writer thus speaks in another passage of the same work ; We purchase English cloth , English muslins , English buttons , &amp;c. and admire the excellent skill with which they are fabricated , and wonder that from such a distance they can be afforded us at so low a price , and think what a happy country England is . A happy country indeed it is for the higher orders ; nowhere have the rich so many enjoyments , nowhere have the ambitious so fair a field , nowhere have the ingenious such encouragement , nowhere have the intellectual such advantages ; but to talk of English happiness is like talking of Spartan freedom ; the Helots are overlooked . In no other country can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who grows rich by the labors of the hundred . The hundred human beings like himself , as wonderfully fashioned by nature , gifted with the like capacities , and equally made for immortality , are sacrificed body and soul . Horrible as it must needs appear , the assertion is true to the very letter . They are deprived in childhood of all instruction and all enjoyment ; of the sports in which childhood instinctively indulges ; of fresh air by day , and of natural sleep by night . Their health , physical and moral , is alike de // stroyed ; they die of diseases induced by unremitting taskwork , by confinement in the impure atmosphere of crowded rooms , by the particles of metallic or vegetable dust , which they are constantly inhaling ; or they live to grow up without decency , without comfort , and without hope ; without morals , without religion , without shame , and bring forth slaves like themselves , to tread in the same path of misery . The dwellings of the laboring manufacturers are in narrow streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as in our country , Spain to exclude an insupportable sun , but crowded together , because every inch of land is of such value , that room for light and air can not be afforded them . Here in Manchester , a great proportion of the poor lodge in cellars , damp and dark , where every kind of filth is suffered to accumulate , because no exertions of domestic care can ever make such homes decent . These places are so many hotbeds of infection , and the poor in large towns are rarely or never without an infectious fever among them , a plague of their own , which leaves the habitations of the rich , like a Goshen of cleanliness and comfort , unvisited. * * * The poor must be kept miserably poor , or such a state of things could not continue ; there must be laws to regulate their wages , not by the value of their work , but by the pleasure of their masters ; laws to prevent their removal from one place to another , within the kingdom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be crowded in hot task houses by day , and herded together in damp cellars by night ; they would not toil in unwholesome employments from sunrise till sunset , whole days , and whole days and quarters , for with twelve hours ' labor the avidity of trade is not satisfied ; they would not sweat night and day , keeping u*v this laus perennis of the devil , before furnaces which are never suffered to cool , and breathing in vapors which inevitably produce disease and death ; the poor would never do these things , unless they were miserably poor , unless they were in that state of abject poverty , which precludes instruction , and by destroying all hope for the future reduces man like the brutes , to seek for nothing beyond the gratification of present wants . ' Such was a picture of real life , some eighteen or twenty years ago , in a country where manufactures are protected by a system , which is held up to us for our admiration and as our exemplar . It is of importance to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ? Our readers will bear in mind , that the decline and ruin of some branches of our manufactures , at the close of the war , were ascribed-.constantly , passionately ascribed  --  to the want of protection . Let us now see // fjJuly* how the case stood in England at the same time . Our extracts are somewhat long ; but they will reward the patience of the reader . Extractfron&amp;a Letter written by a Resident at Cose ( y , near Betston in Staffordshire . When some of our principal iron works first failed , the whole extent of the ceksequent distress was not immediately apparent . The pour manufacturers had many of them made a little money ; this with the greatest frugality did not last long ; when expended they ran in debt , wherever they could gain credit ; and when they could not be trusted any longer , they pawned or sold their furniture , article after article , till they had none to sell . When their goods were gone , they were obliged to have recourse to their parishes and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their aid , and could afford but little comparative support . The community in general ( for commercial districts are usually generous ) made great efforts to relieve their distresses . For my own part , I determined that I would fare harder , and that my children and household should do so likewise , in order to minister to their wants ; and it was my desire that none , worthy of relief , should go away from my house unrelieved . It is true the succor was but small ; and they asked for nothing but a piece of bread , and bread for some time great numbers of them received ; but I soon found that my very limited income , arising chiefly from uncertain sources , would not even furnish this scanty supply , and I was reduced to the necessity , to me a most painful one , of confining my charity within much smaller boundaries . Companies of five , or eight , or twelve manufacturers , able and willing to work , have been many times in the course of a day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut me to the heart , necessarily soliciting in vain . Multitudes went through the country , offering to work at anything , merely for a little food , not even expecting wages , and thus gained a little temporary employment and subsistence ; but still their wives and children were at home , in the greatest possible distress . Withift a small distance of my house is a large iron work , the machinery of which extends for nearly half a mile . It was a noble manufactory . I passed by it one morning , after its operations were suspended , and was exceedingly affected with the sight . A little before , it was all animation and industry , affording the honorable means of livelihood to many thousands of my fellow creatures . The silence that now pervades it spoke more eloquently and impressively to my heart , than any language could possibly do ; it was the silence of unmingled desolation . I visited a row of houses occupied by the workmen ; the doors were used to be open , inviting // the eye of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleanliness , and felicity ; little groups of healthful children were accustomed to appear about the cottages , full of merriment and joy , and the inhabitants , strong and healthy , saluted you as you went by . But the scene was lamentably changed , it produced a melancholy on my spirits , that I did not lose for a considerable period , the cottages were closed , the inhabitants could not bear to have it known that they were stripped of their little ornaments , no children played around the doors , the very plants trained up in their windows had pined and died , one man only appeared , emaciated and ghastly , a living spectre , as if the peaceful sepulchre had sent forth its inhabitants to fill with terror the abodes of the living . When I have told these poor creatures , that the parish must find them food or labor , they have replied , " Sir , they can not do esther ; " and some who have fared the best , when our manufactories were flourishing about us , have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dependent on the parish . " It is an unanswerable proof of the excellent disposition of these poor manufacturers , that although there are many thousands of them in the most distressed condition imaginable , there is very little depredation in the country . If it will aid you in your benevolent designs , I will go through any part of our neighborhood , from house to house , and give you a particular statement of the circumstances of each family . The labor will be to me a delightful remuneration ; doing good I have long found to be its own reward . I would devote any portion of my time to procure you information . Some , I believe , have really died of starvation ; and in many cases , if not the immediate , it was the primary cause . An insufficiency of wholesome nourishment , where they had been accustomed to great abundance , produced diseases , which terminated in dissolution . Even charity , sir , has left some of our districts . She has given all she had to give ; the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the grateful recollection of the channel through which it flowed , or emotions of despair lest it should never again be replenished . I could send you many individual cases that come under my personal knowledge . Not far from my house , a respectable individual , poaressed of extensive information in the iron trade , who had been a confidential foreman in a large concern , and lived in much credit , has been for some time , with a wife and eight children , destitute of a sufticiency of bread . Many poor families , distinguished for their sobriety and industry , with five , six , seven , or eight children , are in the same disastrous circumstances . I have , myself , repeatedly saved a man , his wife , and six children , from absolute starvation , who were reduced to eat the cabbage stalks , and the refuse of their little cottage garden , as the only food they could obtain . ' // Jn the month of October of the same year , 1816 , the iron manufacturers , in one district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , traversed the country begging bread and cheese , but refusing beer , lest in their intoxication they should do what they would afterwards be sorry for . ' We have no space for further details of their sufferings , but beg leave to present our readers with a view of the condition of the cotton manufacturers in England in 1818 . For this purpose we lay before them the cotton spinners ' address to the public , ' in August , 1818 . We , the Mule cotton spinners of Manchester , consider it n duty incumbent upon us to address the public , at the present juncture , to contradict the many false statements and misrepresentations , that have appeared in the public papers . We are stated in all the papers to have turned put for an advance of wages , this we admit to be in part true , but not *. i*ol*itely so . Two years ago , when our employers demanded a reduction of ten hanks , they affirmed that the state of the market imperiously called for such reduction ; but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it . We depended . Qfl. their honor , and continued to labor for more than twelve months at the reduction proposed . About ten months since , on comparing the price of cotton and yarn , we found that the markets would allow our employers to fulfil their promise ; we therefore solicited them to that purpose , and only wished to be reinstated in the same prices we worked at , previous to that reduction . Some declared they could not give it ; others they would not , but the greater part , that they would , if others did , but they should not like to be the first . Thus we continued working and soliciting for the last eight months , though the demand for yarn has been unprecedented , and the consequent rise in twist great ; they have still refused our just request ; and in order to cause a belief that trade was in a declining state , gave notice that they should only work three days in the week , which appeared so extremely ridiculous , that the yery children employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our average wages amount to thirty or forty shillings per week . It is evident that this statement was made by some individual either ignorant or interested . In 1816 , the average clear wages of the spinners in Manchester was about twenty four shillings reduction , and it is to be remarked , that spinners relieve their own sick , as well as subscribe to other casualties ; therefore , when their hours of labor , which are from five in the morning to seven in the evening , ( and // in some mills longer ) of unremitting toil , in rooms heated from seventy to ninety degrees , are taken into consideration , we believe the public will say with us , that no body of workmen receive so inadequate a compensation for their labor . The next thing we would advert to is , our employers have asserted , that if they submit to our present request , which they admit is reasonable , it would not be long before we demanded another advance of ten hanks more . Whatever some individuals may have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinners have never said or intended any such thing . And we hereby declare , " that we are willing to enter into a treaty with our employers on fair and honorable * We believe there is no species of labor so fraught with the want of natural comforts , as that the spinners have to contend with ; deprived of fresh air , and subjected to long confinement in the impure atmosphere of crowded rooms continually inhaling the particles of metallic or vegetable dust , his physical powers become debilitated , his animal strength dwindles away , and few survive the meridian of life , and the grave is often the welcome asylum of his woes . His children ! but let us draw a veil over the scene* our streets exhibit their cadaverous and decrepit forms , and any attempt to describe them would be impossible . Let it not be understood that we attach blame to our employers as applied to these calamities ; they are perhaps inseparable from the very nature of the employment , and our masters may lament but can not redress them . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of our complaints , and we are confident that both justice and humanity will decide in our favor . We solemnly declare , as fathers , as men , as loyal subjects , and well wishers to a constitution , the spirit and letter of which will not countenance anything like slavery and oppression , that we can not obtain , with the greatest possible industry , the common comforts and necessaries of life at the present low prices . To labor hard is not an easy task , but to labor hard and want is impossible . Let our masters consult their own hearts , and as the seat of justice and humanity , they will not long hesitate to grant our just request . ' We appeal to such of our readers as are conversant , even with the English newspapers , to bear us out in the assertion , that volumes of details like these might be collected . It is therefore only in the heat of argument , that propositions like the following could be advanced by such men as Mr Clay . The views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that her protecting policy is adapted alike to a state of war and of peace . Self poised , resting upon her own internal // resources , possessing a borne market , carefully cherished and guarded , she is ever prepared for any emergency . We have seen her coming out of a war of incalculable exertion , and of great duration , with her power unbroken , her means undiminisl*ed . We have seen , that almost every revolving year of peace has 3*rought along with it an increase of her manufactures , of her commerce , and , consequently , of her navigation . We have seen that , constructing her prosperity upon the solid foundation of her own protecting policy , it is unaffected by the vicissitudes of other states . What is our own condition ? Depending upon the state of foreign powers-confiding exclusively in a foreign , to the culpable neglect of a domestic , policy-our interests are affected by all their movements . Their wars , their misfortunes , are the only source of our prosperity . In their peace , and our peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , and all our interests stationary or declining . Peace brings to us none of the blessings of peace. * We confess we perceive none of the facts , by which this comparison is borne out ; nor by what possible agency a tariff of duties , either in England or America , can be depended on to prevent immense distresses on any sudden change either from peace to war , or war to peace . Such a transition must always produce vast and sudden fluctuations in the market , and against these changes what tariff can protect us ? The extracts we have already made are sufficient preparation for the remark , paradoxical as it may seem , that all the protection extended by the foreign governments held up to our imitation has not produced the prosperity of manufactures themselves , considered as one of the branches of the national industry . It might be taken as one proof of this , that , with the extraordinary growth of manufacturing industry in England , for the last half century , pauperism has kept equal pace , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height unexampled and truly appalling . It is easy to deny this to be the effect of any necessary connexion between the things , and yet those , who deny it , may safely he challenged to point out any other cause . The factories create a demand for a large quantity of manual labor of the very lowest kind . It is well known , that a few weeks are sufficient to train most of the laborers employed in spinning cotton , and the exercise of intellect in this occupation is almost nothing . Labor of this kind must be miserably paid . Mere hand labor is very little // higher in the order of things than machine labor . A living machine endued with a grain of intellect is needed ; no more . This is the kind of population , which manufactures tend directly to introduce ; and it needs not be said , that it is a wretched population at best , exposed on every fluctuation of the market to be thrown out of employment , and ill fitted for any other . But without urging this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be somewhat more prosperous in America , we still maintain that there is not a country in the world where the great manufactures , those most protected , flourish . By a flourishing manufacture , in any valuable sense of the term , we mean one that supports the working class in decent competence . In almost every branch of manufactures , in every country , the wages of labor , like the wages of sin , is death ; and we may well add with Dr South , poor wages it is that will not keep a man alive . The cloth , the cutlery , is gond , and much is made , and it sells to profit , and the proprietor of the factory flourishes and grows rich , but what becomes of the manufacturer ? Is it flourishing to weave and spin sixteen hours in the day on wages so confessedly inadequate , as to require from the overseers of the poor an additional shilling per week , for every child with which the miserable father is cursed ? The manufacture of muslin flourishes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up to their armpits in water , twelve hours in the day , and are paid with a cup of rice . The Osnaburghs of Westphalia are woven by the poor peasantry of that country , who live in cabins , to which the meanest log hut in America is a palace . Is this flourishing ? The manufacturers of iron in Russia and Sweden earn seven cents a day . Is this flourishing ? Why d*'not the friends of the tariff , who admire the foreign protecting policy , imitate it in its prominent parts ? There are in many of these countries , and have been in all , laws regulating the wages , which shall be paid to workmen in the different trades . Let them apply to Congress for a law , that the laborer shall be paid but seven or eight cents a day . This will go effectually to the case , and enable the American undertaker to meet the foreign commodity . The mere smallness of wages , moreover , is but one only of the ingredients in that system , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven cents a day in a country , where one hun* dred and twenty thousand men are serfs *n the estate of one landholder , ; where it is the proudest privilege of the hunna stock , that it can not be sold without the soil ; seven cents a day in such a country may be very tolerable wages . It will buy a man a little meal and a little lard for his food , and a piece of coarse tow or woollen cloth for his clothing , and with this he is amply provided . A few shillings a week may be very tolerable wages in a country like England , where the people , as a mass , have no voice in the government , where a great inequality of rank and power is an acknowledged and recognised part of the system , at which no one murmurs ; where the honors , the prizes of life , with some few exceptions , that prove the rule , are placed at a hopeless distance from all c*nipetition on the part of the laboring classes . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as his employer 's . He expects to dwell , not in as good a house , *enit also in none of your Manchester cellars , but in an exceeding*. ly comfortable tight tenement . On Sundays , he expects to ' wear very nearly as good a coat and hat as his rich nei*i1bory and to see his wife and daughter in a cambric or a silk . If either of his boys is at all clever , he expects to send him to the grammar scjiool in the town , or the next academy , to prepare for college and receive an educations that shall fit him for the highest places of professional respectability . The wages of the manufacturer must be calculated on this scale ; they must support , not a degraded , brutifie4 vassal , but a reflecting , aspiring man , a freeholder , a voter , a constituent of those , who make the laws and who govern the country . The English system of eking out the laborer 's wages by the contributions of the overseers of the poor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graver laborer will not seldom be a deacon and an overseer himself . The system of eating meat once or twice a week only will not do here ; our manufacturers will take no protection , which does not protect them in a hearty dinner of meat every day , with enough left cold to come handsomely upon the table the next morning at breakfast . The manufacturer here is surrounded by a different class of men , from those about him there , and he must live accordingly . He is not surrounded by an humbled tenantry , who if they possess not each an annual income of one // hundred pound , can not shoot a partridge even on a field they might own in fee simple ; and who if they be not freeholders have no votes in the election of those , who are to make the laws . Our factories will be principally filled by the daughters of very respectable farmers , who come for a few years to earn a sum . of money toward a virtuous and honorable establishment in life . The system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American community , or it will be long before our factories resemble the English . We have as good proofs as the circumstances of the case admit , that more than one cotton factory in that country unites within its walls a greater complication of human vice and suffering , than can elsewhere on earth perhaps be found ; the liberty of a prison , the leisure of a workhouse , the health of a hospital , and the chastity of a harem . This will not do here . 0*r manufacturers will have more moral as well as physical oxygen in their atmosphere . Till the friends of the - tariff policy can produce us an example of a manufacture abroad , which comes up to the American notions of the condition of those , who , doing the work of society are entitled , if not to its luxuries , at least to its comforts , we shall persist in saying that manufactures do not flourish abroad . In the next place , while we are zealously quoting the example of foreign nations in this system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as fast as circumstances admit , are changing it for a more liberal one . The proofs of this position in Mr Webster 's speech are so ample , confirmed as they have been by every subsequent arrival from Europe , that we shall not dwell on the topic . It is with pain that we see the Chairman of the Committee reasserting that no proof was found of this proposition , beyond a few detached . speeches ; and repeating what we must needs esteem the paltry suggestion , that this change of doctrines was only deceptively proclaimed in order to mislead foreign nations . We will only ask what the American public would think and say , if the chairman of an important committee of the House of Commons in England , should intimate that one of the cabinet officers of America , in the deliberate commendation of any particular policy , had no object but to deceive foreign governments into an adoption of it ? // The last remark , which we have to make on the subject of imitating the foreign policy is this , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not lie imitated ; if all that we have said to show that the system does not attain its objects abroad were groundless ; it would still remain true , that in the most important circumstance bearing upon this subject , the position of America is so different from that of Europe , that her example can not wisely be followed by us . We refer , of course , to the abundance and cheapness of land here , and to its scarcity and dearness in Europe . This point would admit a very copious illustration , but we will try to respect the patience of our readers . We would only observe that the least parallelism exists between that foreign country and ours , where the greatest has been alleged by the friends of the tariff , viz , between Russia and America . Russia is indeed vast , but that is not enough to produce a resemblance with America . By the latest authorities , the mass of the civilised population , that is , the population exclusive of Gos*. acks and Tartars , in European Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bought and sold with the soil , and less than two millions of all classes of free popu .. lation . In 1783 the number of free male persons was one million eighty four thousand four hundred and eighty six and the number of male serfs , eleven million three hundred and fifty two thousand eight hundred and forty two . It is plain that , in such a state of things , though the Russian government could add to its possessions , already sizeable , those other Wide tracts , which captain Symmes has discovered in its neighborhood , no encouragement could result to settlement , and no comparison be authorised in this respect between Russia and the United States . Our limits do not permit us to engage in anything like a discussion of the general question of the tariff policy and we shall only trespass farther on the reader 's patience , with a cursory notice of a few separate arguments . It is objected , and of course with justice , to the tariff policy , that its immediate effect is to give the domestic manufac. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the friends of the tariff reply , that this effect is only temporary , and that the speedy and final effect will be , by drawing capital into the protected manufacture , to destroy monopoly and // bring the price*down to its natural level , and a sentiment pre- . tended to amount to - this has been quoted a few hundred times from general Hamilton 's Report . The delusion , however ; is so gross , that we can scarce suppose any one should ho the victim of it himself , or impose it on another . Nothing is more true than that competition will soon destroy the monopoly , which those manufacturers possess , who are at work when the foreign article is shut out ; but will it destroy the monopoly of the American manufacturer as such ? Will not- the whole supply be engrossed by him ? But still we are told capital will flow in to the employment if profitable , and the price will come down to the natural level . No doubt , to the natural level of this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , in almost every article , be higher than the natural level in England , or France , or Russia ,  --  and for the reasons of which we have given some above . It will be as much higher , as capital is less abundant , land plentier , the style of living and place in society beiter among the American than the foreign manufacturers . In short , the country will be permanently taxed a sum amounting to all the difference of the cost of producing an article in this country and bringing it from abroad . And this , for a long time , will be considerable in most articles , and in some it will be ah*ays greater or less , unless we are hereafter to have our happy country filled up with the mournful spectacle of *n *nglish , French , or Russian peasantry . Another argument made use of by the friends of the tariff policy is , that the - manufacturing interest requires that protection , which , in the form of discriminating duties , has been extended to the shipping interest , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . This argument , however , assumes what we can never allow to be a fact , that these discriminating - duties were intended merely to secure to the navigation - of the country the supply of the demand for water carriage . As it is- the great end of the English navigation act , so it has been the true policy of our discriminating duties , to nourish the mercantile , for the sake of the naval marine . It ought to be put on no other ground , and it can be defended on no other . If there were any reasonable probability , that the naval strength of this country could be kept in a condition , required by our safety and honor , without that encouragement // of our shipping , which the discriminating duties afford , they ought not to subsist one hour . These duties are defended on precisely the same ground . as the establishment of national factories for the supply of arms , and on the principle that the public defence must be secured at any sacrifice . For ourselves , we can truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much quoted letter of Mr Jefferson to the late Mr Benjamin Austin , the sound principle ; and by no means at variance with the passages in the Notes on Virginia , which it was intended to modify or explain . Prove of any fabric that it can fairly be called a necessary , or comfort of life , for which the country is dependent on a foreign and unfriendly nation ; prove that it is essential to the honor and independence of the country , that it flourish on our soil , and we should be the first to protect it up to the prohibition of the foreign article . For all the rest , we think ' that pi*vate judgment should be the guide . We have no doubt ikit the home market is the better market ; and as little that the nation is the richer , for the greater variety of employments pursued by . its citizens . But we maintain , that these can not " be profitably introduced by legislative enactments ; that neither in the form of a tariff , nor in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enact the country into riches , faster than the natural course of industry , and the natural increase of capital can acquire them . And above all , we strenuously deny , that the country can become rich by compelling consumers , ( the great mass , ) to pay a greater amount of their labor or its fruits for the same necessary or convenience . Meantime the republic is safe . The bill as it passed is divested of many injurious provisions ; and if it had not been , had it passed as reported , the country would still be safe . It would in that case have been our opinion , that a majority of Congress , and by inference a majority of the citizens had willed an injudicious law ; a law laying a heavy tax , without any general advantage . But that would not ruin us ; nothing , while our free institutions remain , can fatally affect us . Neither foreign hostility , domestic feuds , nor legislative errors , can fatally injure us , while the representative system exists in its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , and doubtless shall . But if a law is pernicious it will soon be repealed , and though repealing a bad law does not // always undo its bad effects , nor take place without new sacrifices , yet that is a truly enviable condition of . human existence , where either errors will not be committed , or the power of correcting them is in the hands of those who suffer . The American nation is in that condition , and before it can cease to be so , many things worse than a heavy tariff must be borne ; and when it ceases to be so , the liberty of trade will not be worth saving .
