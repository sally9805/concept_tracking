PREFACE . On Tuesday , January 16 , a parcel was brought to me , without any letter or explanation . On it was written Havre . January 1st , and it bore a black seal inscribed Octavus . The parcel contained two productions of M. Victor  --  " Calas " and " Therese . " The uncommon merit of " Calas , " with which the British public is already familiar , induced me to read the new work of its ingenious author ; and I could not hesitate in deciding upon its fitness for the London Stage . On Thursday night the adaptation was begun , and finished on the Monday night following . Mr. Elliston accepted it for representation on Friday evening , Jan. 27 , and produced it on Friday , Feb. 2.  --  At the last rehearsal all were in despair , so unexampled was the celerity with which it had been urged forward ; but all seemed inspired when the hour of trial came  --  and I never saw a new piece better acted , or more enthusiastically applauded . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been paid so mysteriously , I beg to return my thanks for it ; and at the same time to ask his indulgence towards some alterations in the construction of his drama , especially in the third act . Could he witness the effect of one of these variations , through the admirable performance of Miss Kelly , he would require no apology for the liberties I have taken : nor will the other ornaments of the drama deem any particular notice of my obligations to Miss Kelly , in the slightest degree invidious to them . Indeed , they would rather anticipate me ;  --  her fellow labourers know her talent better than the public ;  --  they can observe it better . As she wrote in the pavilion , the public could not see her brushing the tears which blotted the letters as she was forming them ; and numberless similar instances of refinement , perhaps even more genuine , for being less obtrusive . But in the closing scenes of deep pathos , all could share in the agonizing interest she excited : all could feel that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan , deserted , but not despairing :  --  it was the resigned hopelessness of the pious , broken spirit ,  --  too sensitive to look back without tears to what it has lost on earth , yet too religious to falter in its hope from Heaven ! It was a picture of the most exquisite , heart drawn touches , equal in merit to the best conceptions of the best poets and painters ; and leaving the beholders only to lament that , like kindred emanations of its sister arts , the beautiful image could not be fixed for the admiration of distant times and ages , when the gifted lady , whose genius has given it soul and loveliness , shall live only in her fame . In a play which I published three or four years ago , I had occasion to bear testimony to the merits of Mr. Wallack , and I then predicted his professional success . I have now to thank him on other grounds . In taking the character which he so ably sustains in this drama , he has dispensed with a privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rejecting any part in a secondary play ; thus handsomely acknowledging the kindness which he had so recently received from my beloved native country , by his ardour in upholding the interest of one of the humblest of her sons . It would be well for the cause of virtue , if all Pastors were equal in eloquence and impressiveness to Mr. Cooper in Fontaine . Mr. Knight is one of those performers whom Authors ought especially to honor . He enters into their anxieties with enthusiasm , and never lends his talents to their productions without success . To Mr. Knight and Mr. Gattie my thanks are especially owing , not only for what they did , but for the sincere gratification which they appeared to feel on my account , more than on their own , that their exertions proved so acceptable to our patrons . Mrs. Egerton , Mrs. Harlowe , and Mr. Barnard , gave strength to characters perhaps not over affluent in opportunities for effect : and even the Magistrate ceased to be insignificant in the hands of Mr. Bromley . One word to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have honoured me already with more attention than I ever coveted : but I wish them to understand , that this , like former publications of mine , is a work planned for stage-effect exclusively , and only printed for managers and actors . It is so necessary in the productions of the modern drama to consult the peculiarities of leading performers ;  --  and not to offend the restive spirit of audiences , requiring strong excitement by means of situations almost pantomimic , and too impatient to pause for poetical beauty ;  --  that it seems almost hopeless to look to the stage as the vehicle for permanent literary distinction . An acted ( or , I might say more properly , an actable ) play , seems to derive its value from what is done , more than from what is said ;  --  but the great power of a literary work consists in what is said and the manner of saying it : He , therefore , who best knows the stage , can best tell why , in the present temper of audiences , good poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars ever give me leisure or independence , to devote myself to any literary work which I may hope to render worthy of being recollected , I shall select something in which the imagination may be less fettered than it must be by the necessities of the stage . As yet I am not vain enough to set up as a candidate for literary distinction : I know myself better : but at the same time , I am not , nor ever have been , ( notwithstanding all that has been said of a short preface to a former work , ) so unprincipled as to claim what does not belong to me ;  --  and I have only to desire . as a point of common courtesy , that if my excellent good friends should ever do me the honour to censure or quote any of the trifling remarks I have ventured to offer upon the present occasion , they will enhance the obligation by first reading them . J. H. P. London , February 11 , 1821 . Main text ACT I. Scene : Garden of the Chateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle , crosses the back of the stage . At the right of the Actors , one of the side fronts of the Chateau , and steps going up to it , embellished with vases . At the left , a little gate leading to the orchard . Near the front , a yoke-elm-tree hedge , with a garden chair . The back ground , beyond the railing , represents a beautiful landscape . Picard and Lavigne come out of the Chateau : Lavigne has empty sacks and panniers over his arms and about his person . The curtain rises to music . Lav . Lavigne ( on the steps and speaking behind the scenes . ) My Neddy can stand where he is . There 's no fear of his running away . I 'm only going into the orchard a minute with Father Picard , to get some prunes . ( Comes down to Picard , who is taking a pinch of snuff . ) Come , now , Picard , is it honest , parson 's truth , that you have been telling me ? Pic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picard 's truth ,  --  and none honester . The Countess and her son are coming home this very day . I and Miss Mariette have just got letters . Lav . Lavigne Then I 'll be off ; no matter for the prunes . The Countess and her son coming home ! They must pass the farm on their way from Lausanne to the Chateau , and if they take my old wife , Bridget , unawares , she 'll be all in such a fluster ? Pic . Picard Do n't flatter yourself . They 'll not stop at the farm . Her ladyship has pressing reasons for coming back so quick . ( mysteriously . ) Great news , Lavigne ! There 's great news , I tell you . There was a letter in my parcel for the village notary , and he 's to be here at twelve . Lav . Lavigne You do n't say so ! Why , Picard  --  bless my soul ! Picard , do you think the young Count is to  --  to  --  to wed Miss Mariette ? Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I tell you , there 's great news ! that 's all ! mark  --  Great news . Lav . Lavigne Oh ! bless my heart ! How happy I should be ! why Picard , I 'd give that beautiful crooked horned cow with the little tail  --  I 'd give the robin read breast that pecks its breakfast out of my mouth  --  I 'd give  --  I do n't know what I would'nt give to see the young Count wedded to Miss Mariette ! Yes , were it only to plague my old wife , Bridget , who 's always preaching up  --  " That affair 'll come to no good : a girl own 'd by nobody , to be made so much of at the Chateau "  --  A girl this , and a girl that !  --  What will she say now ? Ha ! ha ! Now when she knows  --  ( taking out a silver watch . ) Hey day ! ten o'clock ! It 's a long league to the farm , and my Neddy 's no Eagle ! Good day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go , I 'll see you to your Neddy . Lav Lavigne Thank ye , Picard , thank ye for both :  --  Neddy and I too . Come along . Music . Picard opens the middle gate , and goes out with Lavigne . As they are departing , chatting together , a man appears , who seems endeavouring to ascertain where he is . It is Carwin : he enters through the middle gate , which Picard has left open . Car . Carwin ( alone , tablets , in his hand ) One league from Morville  --  on the right  --  beyond the forest and the rustic bridge  --  Aye , this must be the spot ; and here the mansion of the Countess de Morville . But do those lofty walls protect my fugitive ? Therese , though you escaped me at Geneva , and for eight months have still eluded me , my lynx-eyed vigilance shall never sleep ! The orphan who has found shelter here , must be she . What though the name be different ? Her own she could not bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the young Count loves her . If this Mariette in truth should be Therese that may mar my project ! The Countess and her son at Lausanne ? Doubtless the orphan 's with them . So much the better : I can move more freely . Picard returns , and as he comes in , throws the middle gates wide open , and then comes down . Pic . Picard ( Throwing wide the middle gates . ) As it 's so late , the gates may as well stand open . ' Twill save trouble , and ( coming down ) hallo ! a stranger ! how did he get in . He must have passed behind me . Car . Carwin Good day , friend . Pic . Picard Good day  --  friend ! ( aside ) where the d  --  I did this friend of mine come from ? ( aloud ) What may be your pleasure , sir ? Who are you looking for ? Car . Carwin You belong to the chateau ? Pic . Picard I do , sir . My name is Picard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Michaelmas . Car . Carwin I am glad of it . Pic . Picard Faith , so am I. It 's a snug place . But to go back to what we were talking about  --  what do you want here , sir ? ( aside ) I do n't like that fellow 's looks . Car . Carwin I come to offer my respects to the Countess . Pic . Picard ( Taking off his hat . ) A friend of the Countess  --  I beg pardon , sir , but never having had the honour of seeing you before .  --  The Countess and her son are both from home ; but we expect them back in an hour or two , and if you walk into the house till then , Miss Mariette will receive you . Car . Carwin Miss Mariette  --  she is not with them , then ? Pic . Picard Oh no . She always stays at home . She do n't like to go into company , though she 'd make as good a figure in it as the best of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carwin ( Aside . ) Ha ! this confirms  --  ( aloud ) My good Mr. Steward , tell me  --  I have heard much of this young lady . How old is she ? Pic . Picard ( Looking at Carwin a moment . ) Why , as far as I know , about eighteen or nineteen . ( aside ) This fellow has a deal of curiosity . Car . Carwin ( Aside ) Her age to a moment ! ( aloud ) Is she handsome ? Pic . Picard ( Irritated ) Yes . ( aside ) This is very odd  --  perhaps he 's some relation . Car . Carwin Pray where does she come from ? Do you know her family ? Pic . Picard ( aside ) These are strange questions !  --  Oh ! he must be a relation  --  Now if I could find out  --  I 'll encourage him . Car . Carwin So ! The Countess has given shelter to this young girl without knowing any thing about her ? Pic . Picard Partly so , and partly not . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , for every body knows how she came here : One day , Mr. Fontaine , the pastor of our church ,  --  ( Sir , he 's as worthy a man as ever lived !  --  Well , as I was saying )  --  Mr. Fontaine came to the Countess , and told her , that a young girl , exhausted , wretched , on foot , and without a guide , had just arrived at Morville , imploring assistance to enable her to reach Lausanne ? The Countess , who is kindness itself , sent for the wanderer , and asked her what she was going there for , whether she had relations or friends at Lausanne ? The tears streamed down her beautiful cheeks , and she said she was alone in the world . She proved to be an orphan , deprived by death of her benefactress , and cast out in destitution , with no hope but that of obtaining a situation in some family at Lausanne .  --  The young stranger told her story with a grace and openness , which so interested her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her modest , gentle , affable conduct , has made the dear girl the darling of every body who knows her . Car . Carwin ( To himself . ) No doubt remains . ' T is she ! Pic . Picard Pray , sir , what is it you mean by saying , " ' T is she . " Then you know  --  Car . Carwin Accept my thanks . Your narrative  --  Pic . Picard Probably you are a relation , a friend  --  Car . Carwin No . Pic . Picard Indeed ! Sir , your curiosity , for a mere stranger , seems very extraordinary . Sir , what am I to think of it ? Car . Carwin Nothing . Pic . Picard What ! A'nt you going into the house ? Car . Carwin ( Going . ) No . Pic . Picard ( Following ) At least , you 'll leave your card , sir ? Car . Carwin No . Pic . Picard Will you call again ; Car . Carwin Perhaps . Music  --  Carwin goes cut slowly . Picard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle gate . Pic . Picard Ah , Mr. Fontaine , it does my heart good every time I see you . Fon . Fontaine Thank you , Picard . Have the kindness to tell Miss Mariette I am here , as she requested . Pic . Picard Certainly , Sir , certainly . ( aside ) " As she requested . " So ! He 's been sent for too ! ( as he goes into the Chateau . ) The notary and the parson ! these are the natural forerunners of matrimony : like black clouds before a storm Aye , aye  --  great news ! great news ! ( Exit , talking till out of sight ) Fon . Fontaine ( alone . ) Mariette seems anxious and disturbed . Her note says she must speak with me before the Countess comes  --  Hold ! She is here . Music  --  Therese enters from the Chateau , looking cautiously about ; and then runs eagerly to Fontaine . Ther . Therese Oh , my father ! Yes , you have permitted me to call you by that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Fon . Fontaine Dear girl , whence arises this agitation ? You weep ! Has some new misery befallen you ? Pour forth your sorrows freely into the bosom of your friend . Ther . Therese Ah , Sir ! Nothing remains to me in the world but your esteem ; should I lose that , my cup of affliction would o'erflow . Fon . Fontaine What have you to fear ? Can you think I am unjust ? Ther . Therese Oh , no , no , no ! My disclosures will not make you drive me from you .  --  ( hesitating . ) Count de Morville  --  ( stops , casting down her eyes . ) Fon . Fontaine Loves you . I know it : do not blush . His love does you honour , and is one among the many testimonials of your virtues . Ther . Therese I have never abused my situation . The Count should not have indulged a thought of one who came into the world only to know wretchedness , and my conscience acquits me of the remotest wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love him . Ther . Therese I never said I loved him . Fon . Fontaine Do n't he know it then ? Ther . Therese ( Embarrassed . ) I did not think he did . Fon . Fontaine Ah ! I understand  --  How does the Countess view the attachment ? Ther . Therese I could not have supposed she would ever have yielded to the wishes of her son . But here , dear sir , ( taking a letter from her bosom ) read this and judge how happy I might be ! Fon . Fontaine ( speaking as he glances over the letter ) Now am I indeed at a loss to account for your tears . Charles loves you , and deserves your love . His mother 's arms open to receive you . This very day  --  nay , within this hour  --  you are to be affianced ! Friendship , Love , Fortune , smile on you at once ! then wherefore , Mariette , wherefore should you weep ? Ther . Therese Alas ! I am more than ever to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me will hate  --  will cast me from them ! Fon . Fontaine How ? Ther . Therese I have none but you to guide and sustain me . To you let me avow the truth . Instruct me how to act . I will obey , even though my heart should break . Fon . Fontaine What is this mystery ? Ther . Therese Mariette is not my name . Fon . Fontaine ( severely ) Indeed ! Ther . Therese Doubtless you have heard of a most unfortunate young girl of Geneva , who was accused of a most dreadful crime , and  --  sentenced  --  to  --  the  --  most  --  infamous  --  of  --  punishments . Fon . Fontaine A young girl of Geneva  --  An orphan named Therese , who was some months ago sentenced  --  You are agitated  --  Heavens ! can it be ? Ther . Therese It is ! I am Therese . Fon . Fontaine You ! Ther . Therese ( falling upon her knees . ) Oh , sir , do not spurn me , I am innocent ! Fon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repentant ! Ther . Therese Listen , sir , and judge . I never deceived you concerning my birth : I know not who my parents were . In my earliest infancy I was taken by the Marchioness de Ligny , who loved me like a mother ; no child ever experienced more tenderness and affection . Her kindred became jealous : I thought not of the future . The Marchioness died  --  Her will was opened .  --  It was only out of respect for her memory that I was present at the sad ceremony .  --  How great was my astonishment , and her family 's indignation , on finding that I was left sole heiress of her wealth , with authority to bear the title of her principal estate . Oh , fatal benefactions ! Her family , noble , rich , powerful , resolved upon my ruin . I offered to give up every thing : An advocate of the name of Carwin , who volunteered to defend my rights , overcame my intention to surrender them . I submitted to his guidance , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactress ; but the wretch was bribed by my enemies . I can not tell what horrid means were resorted to  --  I was too young and inexperienced even to suspect them . The will was impeached before the tribunals , declared a forgery , and I was represented as its author . I could make no defence . I was condemned . Fon . Fontaine Great heaven ! Was there no appeal ? Ther . Therese Carwin induced me to fly in order to escape the sentence . ' T was then I first began to know him , but ' t was too late  --  the blow was struck ! What most of all surprised me in this man was , that the decree had scarcely been made public , when he audaciously offered me his hand , threatening , should I reject it , to give me up to justice Alarmed by his threats , and disgusted by his importunity , I fled from the asylum whither he had beguiled me , and bent my course towards Lausanne , having no prop but my conscience ,  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontaine ( exultingly ) Truth lives upon her lip and beams in every glance ? Come , dear unfortunate , come to a father 's arms , and let these streaming tears convince you that the Heaven you trusted ne'er leaves the good defenceless ! You must summon all your courage now  --  you must quit this roof . Ther . Therese That I foresaw . Fon . Fontaine You can not make yourself known here without great risk ; nor can you decline the Count 's hand without explaining why ; in this dilemma , flight is the only alternative . Ther . Therese But presently they will be here to affiance me  --  Fon . Fontaine This pledge is a mere form . Mark me  --  restrain your tears , strive to seem calm , and give the promise they expect . Perhaps it may not be given in vain . From this night you shall have another asylum . I have a sister who resides at the village of Preverange , about a league hence , on the Geneva road ; Meet me after evening prayers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kindness , and go myself instantly to Geneva Ther . Therese To Geneva ? Fon . Fontaine Yes , my dear , to Geneva . ' T is his first duty who inculcates virtue , to exercise it in tearing off the mask from crime . ' T is never too late for truth to lift her voice ; she often rides unseen above our heads ; but , when the firm voice calls her to appear , bursts in surpassing beauty from the cloud ! Child ! you shall yet rejoice ! A city like Geneva can always boast good men , with courage and with power to make innocence triumphant . Music . Therese seems completely overwhelmed , and crosses to the right-hand . Fontaine goes out quickly through the middle gate . A bustle is heard , and the Count , Countess , and four Servants , appear at the middle gate . The Count advances before the rest . Picard , at the same moment , comes out of the Chateau to meet them . Count , Count ( running to Therese ) Dear Mariette ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to throw herself at the feet of the Countess . Count . Count Not thus , Mariette , come to my arms ;  --  a friend 's heart  --  ere long a mother 's  --  warms to bid you welcome !  --  to Picard Is all in readiness ? Pic Picard Every thing , my Lady : and the notary will be here to the very minute . Countess . Countess Mr. Fontaine must he sent for . Pic . Picard He was here only a moment ago , my Lady ; But just as he was going out , somebody came to take him to old Father Thomas , who has been dangerously ill for the last fortnight . Countess Countess So I heard at Morville . Charles , go yourself to the poor old man 's cottage  --  Lower , and turning aside to give her purse Leave this with him , and bring Mr. Fontaine back with you . Pic . Picard aside Ah what a heart she has ! Count . Count Instantly , Madam . ( to Therese ) And must I leave you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therese Ah ! Charles , blame not these tears  --  Soon you 'll no longer see them  --  now they must flow , I can not suppress them . The Count and Countess regard Therese with surprise .  --  Picard also seems astonished . The Count kisses Therese 's hand , begs his mother not to be alarmed , and goes out agitated . Countess . Countess Get the saloon ready , Picard . Pic . Picard And the bed-rooms too , my Lady ? Countess Countess No ; We shall return to Lausanne this evening , and take Miss Mariette with us . Pic . Picard Ah ! all going ! The Countess gazes at Mariette , and appears astonished at her depression Half a word 's enough for me  --  Ha ! my brain has been wool gathering all this time  --  I had nigh forgotten  --  well thought of ! My Lady , do you know a man with black hair , piercing eyes , a pale face , and a sad , hanging look ? Such a man has been prowling round the chateau all the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger , has been questioning me in the oddest way you can imagine about Miss Mariette . Ther . Therese About me ? Countess . Countess About Mariette ? Did he tell his name ? Pic . Picard Tell ? No , no  --  he wanted to get all he could out of me , but ' t would puzzle Old Nick to get any thing out of him . Countess . Countess I ca n't imagine  --  perhaps you have some idea who it is , Mariette Ther . Therese Not the slightest  --  I do n't now a soul . Pic . Picard I 'll get the saloon ready immediately , my lady . Exit into the Chateau . Countess . Countess To the other Servants Follow , Picard ! They go out , Therese is receding , and the Countess calls her . Mariette , you are aware of the step to which my affection for Charles has induced me to consent . He builds his happiness upon you , and the rational felicity of my child has always been paramount in my mind to every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends its influence over both your lives ; and the alarms and agitations of maternal tenderness may be pardoned at such a crisis . Mariette , have you been sincere in your disclosures concerning yourself ? Have you concealed nothing ? You are an orphan , unfriended  --  there is no harm in this , if this be all . But to what wretchedness will you condemn your husband and yourself , if partial in your avowals , you still keep circumstances out of view , at the discovery of which my son may one day have cause to blush . Ther . Therese Oh , my benefactress ! Trust me  --  however mysterious my dejection may appear , hereafter you will find no cause to think that she who owes every thing to your bounty , is capable of treachery or ingratitude ! Countess . Countess Enough , Mariette , I can not doubt your truth . My heart is now relieved , and freely grants you the sacred name of daughter ! Music . Therese kneels and receives her blessing . The Countess enters the Chateau . Therese remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , and advances unperceived opposite Therese , gazing intently on her . Ther . Therese Turning , discovers Carwin . Heaven and Earth ! Carwin ! Car Carwin Aye  --  Carwin , Therese ! Ther . Therese In mercy utter not that name ! Car . Carwin Why not ? ' T is yours . Ther . Therese Oh , I am lost ! Why do you still pursue me ? Car . Carwin Go where you will , these eyes will ne'er lose sight of you . Ther . Therese What is your purpose ? Car . Carwin Why do you ask ? You know full well  --  To be your husband . Ther . Therese Oh , sir , torture not your victim ! quit , quit this place  --  Car . Carwin That I 'll do cheerfully . Follow ! Ther .

Carwin ( raising her . ) I would fain spare you  --  fear not  --  if seen I am unknown , and for the rest  --  oh , I will speak as gently as you will  --  in dove like tones that none but you can hear  --  but you must listen  --  if you dare refuse , I 'll to the chateau instantly . Ther . Therese Oh , no , no , no ! I  --  I  --  listen , Sir ! Car . Carwin With you ' t were folly longer to dissemble . I wished to become the arbiter of your fate . I am so . With a breath I can call back your fortune ; aye , and more than you yourself yet know , can prove your parentage and noble rank . Ther . Therese Powers of mercy ! can it be ? Car . Carwin We are unheard  --  unwitnesed  --  ( lower )  --  Judge how much it is your interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge myself that you shall be acknowledged as the daughter of the Marchioness de Ligny . Ther . Therese The Marchioness my mother !  --  Car . Carwin Was secretly married to the Count de Belmour : the atred of your mother 's family to the Count compelled her always to conceal her union ; your father died soon after you were born ;  --  the Marchioness  --  not daring to avow the truth  --  received you as an adopted child , and left you all her wealth . only one document exists to prove your birth ; to me it was confided . That document , with others , which concern your innocence , is in my hands : and never shall they see the light till you consent to receive me as your husband . Ther . Therese At last the truth dawns ! ' T is avarice impels you !  --  My husband ? Never ! Car .

Therese Only let this ceremony pass , and I promise not to be his wife : but oh , Sir , in pity save me from the consequences of receding thus abruptly  --  ' t is but a ceremony  --  oh ! let it pass  --  ' twill spare a terrible exposure ! Car . Carwin You have heard . I must be obeyed . Hark ! they come ! Ther . Therese Earth , hide me ! Car . Carwin Remember !

By what right come you to invade our peace ? Car . Carwin When she can hear me you shall know . Now she revives . I come to seek that girl . Count . Count Mariette ? Car . Carwin Not Mariette , but  --  Ther . Therese ( falling on her knees ) Do not proceed  --  I yield myself to you  --  dispose of my fate , of my life !  --  I 'll follow you .

Therese ' T is done , I yield me to my fate ! The Countess unfolds the writing : Charles approaches and glances over it at the same time that his mother does . Carwin smiles , looking at Therese .

In silence I have observed you : your acts , your words , have made you known unto me : you are Carwin . The Countess comes forward on the left hand-side . Car . Carwin Who should tell you my name ?

Music  --  Therese recedes towards the middle gate with Fontaine . Carwin is at the right hand corner . The Countess stands reading the parchment , and the Count expostulating with her . Therese , when near the gate , looks back , runs to the Countess , kneels , and attempts to take her hand . The Countess repels her and checks the Count . Therese bends submissively .

Beyond it , on the right hand , the main entrance to the farm-house , and , nearer the audience , on the same side , a white rail fence and gate . On the left , the pavilion spoken of in the first Act , built by the Countess for her son and herself ;  --  a little square lodge , raised considerably above the ground , newer and more tasteful than the farm-house : steps on the outside lead up to the door of it , which opens on a short gallery . A large , clear window , of the same height with the door , and full in front of the audience , gives a distinct view of the interior ; and shows two chambers , both opening into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both are perceptible to the spectators , one leading to the back of the building and the other to the side . In the distance , a court-yard , enclosed by a quick-set hedge , beyond which appears a landscape characteristic of the country . The curtain rises to Music .  --  Distant thunder , lightning , and rain heard at intervals . ' T is night throughout the act . A lighted lanthorn is suspended from the top of the shed .  --  The Lads and Lasses of the village are discovered dancing , this being the holiday referred to by Lavigne in early part of the play . A knot of farmers , grouped at a table in one corner , are smoking and carousing with Lavigne . Bridget entering from the farm-house , stops the dance . Brid . Bridget That 'll do , I say . The church clock has just struck nine ,  --  it 's getting cloudier and cloudier  --  the big drops are coming down already  --  there 's a storm on the Lake , and the wind will soon blow it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Exeunt villagers through the white gate .  --  A flash of lightning . ) Ah !

Wait a minute , and I 'll go and look out . Music . He turns to go . At the same moment a young female , clad very plainly , with a little bundle in her hand , appears at the back of the court-yard : she seems fatigued , cast down , and advances with timidity . It is Therese . Hey ! who 's that ? Lav . Lavigne ( who has gone towards her , ) Bless my soul ! is it possible ?  --  hey ! yes , ' t is she ? Wife ! ' t is she ! Brid . Bridget Hey ? Who ?

What brings you here at this time of night ? Ther . Therese To ask your hospitality . It rains , a storm threatens , and I am much fatigued . I entreat you to receive me only for the night . Brid . Bridget But where did you come from ? where are you going to all alone by yourself ? and in the night too ? Ther . Therese I came from the chateau , I am going with this letter to the house of our good Pastor 's sister , at Preverange . He was to have accompanied me himself ; but old Farmer Thomas being on his death-bed , the duties of his ministry compelled him to stay behind . One of the old farmer 's shepherds conducted me on the way , but fatigue o'erpowers me  --  I have suffered so severely ! Brid .

Refuse to take the young girl in , and in such weather ! For shame ! Come , come , Bridget , there 's no need of making yourself uglier than you really are . Does not our pastor preach every Sunday  --  " Open to whoever knocks : Give to whoever asks ? And does n't she ask ? Zounds , Bridget , do n't hold the latch in your hand , when you ought to throw the door wide open . Brid . Bridget Open ! give ? that 's easily said .

Bridget In fact Miss Mariette , the Countess is a good lady and a charitable lady ; and she 'd never have sent you adrift if you had n't done something very bad : but as you are going to the Parson 's sister , there can be no harm in your resting a bit here on the way , especially as it rains : so , do n't cry , you shall sleep here , and I 'll go and get you some supper . Ther Therese Thanks  --  many thanks  --  but I require nothing  --  nothing  --  but a little sleep . going towards a chair , she totters . Brid . Bridget ( Running to support her ) Bless me !

Bridget The Countess 's bed in the pavilion is always kept ready air 'd , and there she 'll sleep with the beautiful white curtains all round her , like a princess ! Nannette ! go in , and turn down the bed . Nannette goes up , throws open the door nearest the window , settles the room , and presently returns . Ther . Therese Friends , I thank you . Do not think I am unworthy of your kindness . Lav . Lavigne Show the young lady to her room , wife . Brid . Bridget harshly to Therese Come along , girl .

You see that window  --  there 's a desk standing there , and the Countess 's bed-chamber is next to it . Do n't make a blunder , and go into the door opposite the window , for that leads to the room where the Count sleeps when he comes with his mother . These are the only apartments in the building ; so you need n't be afraid , for the staircase-door once locked , you 'll sleep like a little pig . Lav Lavigne ( returning ) Here 's ink , letter-paper , and , a pen from the schoolmaster 's goose ,  --  as hard , ah ! as hard as some people 's hearts , Miss Brid . Bridget Give me the light .

Bridget takes the lamp , paper , &c.; and goes up first . Therese follows . They are seen in the chamber . Bridget points out the desk to Therese , puts her own light and Therese 's down upon it , and then shows the room where she is to sleep , going into it for an instant with her .  --  During this action Carwin re-appears : intently observes the position of the scene and of the room allotted to Therese : then retires .

Picard Hush ! as I was settling the things in the carriage , all at once I thought I saw a figure dart out of the forest that borders on the farm , pass behind the hedge , come on with a wolf 's trot , and prowl round the carriage  --  I was greatly astonished , as you may guess  --  but I took courage , and put my head out of the window , and just then there came a broad flash of lightning , and I recognized the damn 'd questioner posting along the fense and hurrying this way .

A shriek is heard in the pavillion , and on the instant , a terrific thunderbolt shatters down a part of the pavillion , and sets the rest on fire . Carwin precipitates himself through the window to the front of the stage in frightful confusion . Car . Carwin I escaped the thunderbolt . I 'm safe . Therese is now no more .

Delparc Whom have you got ? Lav . Lavigne Beelzebub ! The Steward saw him prowling round my house all night . Fon . Fontaine It must be Carwin . Brid . Bridget I ca n't tell who it is  --  but I 'm sure he 's a rascal . Lav . Lavigne That 's plain enough , whoever it is  --  He gave us a brace of shots before we took him .

Bridget ( following Lavigne up the stage ) Take care of yourself , husband , take care  --  You do n't know how many pistols he may have under his cloak . Lavigne goes out through the middle door , and Villagers follow him . Fon . Fontaine ( to Delparc ) Be sure , Sir , the hand of Heaven is in this . I have obtained lights unexpected , and my hopes revive : but every thing will be lost , unless you grant me perfect confidence . Delp . Delparc You have it  --  I shall rejoice to second your exertions . I have already received some important information from the Count concerning Carwin .

Fontaine They 're here . Go in  --  go in , my child . Bridget conducts Therese into the left-hand apartment . A great bustle announces Carwin , who continues to resist . Lavigne , the servants , and all the villagers , surround him , entering in a throng through the middle door , and dragging him violently to the stage . Carwin is in the greatest disorder  --  pale and agitated . Lav . Lavigne ( pulling Carwin . ) This way , Lucifer , this way  --  Come , come , no hanging back !  --  Here , Mr. Magistrate , here he is ;  --  and mind , ( to Carwin ) you grim devil , you  --  you 're to ask no questions , for nobody will have a word to say to you .

Delparc The right of protecting the public safety . You are a stranger  --  What brought you hither ? who are you ? Car . Carwin My name is Carwin : I come from the Chateau de Morville . ( pointing to Fontaine ) That gentleman can tell what brought me there :  --  I was returning to my home . Delp . Delparc For what reason did you fly ? And when you were approached , how came you to resist ? Car . Carwin I had cause to think my life in danger . Delp . Delparc You were observed this night at the farm . Car . Carwin ' T is false !  --  I took the forest path , and was n't near the farm . Delp . Delparc Have a care !  --  Two witnesses can prove it . Car . Carwin ( startled ) Who are they ? Delp . Delparc The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ironically ) The Count de Morville and his servant !  --  a noble vengeance in the lover of Therese ! and for what ? for preventing disgrace to him and his family !  --  ( Pointing to Fontaine ) That gentleman can explain .  --  He saw my conduct ; he can avouch I did no more than bound to do by honour !  --  Is it to be wondered at , that blinded by his love , and frantic at her loss , the Count should prove unjust to my pure motives , and deeming me her foe , attempt to fix on me the odium of the deed ? Delp . Delparc What deed ? Fon . Fontaine In Heaven 's name do not stop him ! ( Carwin looks at him distrustfully ) Go on , Sir ,  --  you make a brave defence !  --  But how did you know a murder had been committed in a place , which you say you did not come near ? Car . Carwin By what right do you question me ? Lav . Lavigne There 's impudence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavigne You 've got it now ! Car . Carwin ( ill temperedly ) I knew it from report . Delp . Delparc Reports in a forest ?  --  and at midnight ? Car . Carwin Were not persons sent to take me ? From them  --  Lav . Lavigne It 's a lie . Nobody said a word to him  --  that 's plain enough  --  for you see he do n't know  --  Fon . Fontaine Silence ! Lav . Lavigne I 'm dumb . Delp . Delparc ( to Fontaine ) I can not make out your object . Fon . Fontaine Command perfect silence . ( Delparc does so by gesture . ) Car . Carwin ( apart ) What trap are they concerting ?  --  no matter .  --  Fontaine takes out tablets and writes with a pencil. )  --  He writes  --  what has he in view ? Fontaine hands the tablets to Lavigne , who runs round with them to the Magistrate at the left-hand side of the stage , and having delivere them , returns to his former place . Delp . Delparc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Car . Carwin ( apart with concern ) He " understands ! " I must be on my guard . Delp . Delparc ( to Carwin ) You know then that the unfortunate Therese  --  is dead , and that she has been assassinated on this farm ? Lav . Lavigne Therese ! Fontaine motions him to be silent . Car . Carwin ( affecting assurance ) What is there strange in that ?  --  Is it a secret ?  --  Do n't every body know it ? Fon . Fontaine Enough  --  ( to Carwin ) I charge you , Sir , with this night 's murder . Car . Carwin Me ? Fon . Fontaine ( crossing to Delparc . ) I will answer for the result . All I have now to ask , Sir , is that he should be secured and shut out from all communication  --  ( taking Delparc aside ) I have a plan in view , which , my conscience tells me , will bring forth the truth . Grant me a word in private . Car . Carwin You exceed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delp . Delparc You are distinctly accused , Sir , and of course my prisoner . Let all the avenues be closed and guarded  --  and none accost this person on any pretext . Lav . Lavigne Give me charge of him . I 'll be bound he do n't get away from me . Delp . Delparc ( to Fontaine ) Now , Sir  --  Lav . Lavigne Out of the way , wife  --  I 'm Major Domo now . Villagers , servants , &c.; go out into the Count-yard , and Lavigne shuts the middle door and follows them . The Magistrate , Fontaine , Bridget , and Lavigne , retire last of all . The window shutters are closed , and the stage darkened . Car . Carwin Why , this is more and more inexplicable  --  I said nothing  --  confessed nothing  --  yet this strange person brands me on a sudden  --  Can I bear traces on my dress ?  --  Perhaps her blood ?  --  No  --  I see none !  --  Ha ! the papers !  --  some may have fallen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing out the papers )  --  One  --  two  --  three !  --  No  --  no  --  all here  --  all right  --  all right !  --  ( replacing them in his bosom )  --  Come , manly resolution be my shield !  --  I am suspected  --  nothing more ;  --  but they can have no proof , nor certainty . The Count and Steward say they saw me  --  but their assertion 's readily impeached  --  There is no other evidence  --  Therese is dead  --  and nought is left to fear , if to myself I 'm true !  --  I will be so  --  They come  --  ' T is fix 'd !  --  Firmness , and I am free ! Music .  --  The middle door is thrown open . Twelve soldiers , six on each side , with drawn swords , march down on the right and left hand : after them , six male villagers , three on each side , and next , twelve female villagers , six on each side . The characters follow . The Count makes a movement of indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the right hand , the Count , Picard , and Fontaine , next , the Magistrate in the centre , and Carwin in the left-hand corner : he affects perfect composure . The middle door is closed , and part of the subordinate characters are standing before it . Car . Carwin ( apart ) This display is meant to intimidate :  --  I expected as much . Delp . Delparc Sir , your accuser stands before you  --  you know the crime with which you are charged  --  a deep , a fiend-like murder !  --  The information which I have just received concerning you , and the circumstances of your past life , inculpates you in a manner most irresistible and most grave ! ( Carwin betrays surprise , but instantly recovers self-possession . ) To escape conviction will be impossible : but you may even yet appease the wrath of him whose image you have horribly destroyed , by a confession of your guilt . Car . Carwin A moment since ( pointing to Fontaine ) my accuser was the judge ; now the judge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest against the decency or honesty of this collusion , since the whole charge can be refuted in one word :  --  I was not here , and I defy you to the proof ! Pic . Picard I saw him here . Count . Count And I myself , with arms , pursued him to the courtyard . Car . Carwin With arms !  --  To have identified me in such darkness you must have been very near , and being so , you were most generous not to use your arms . I have already explained the motives which prompt your charge ;  --  I shall no further notice it , but by contempt and silence ! The Count springs forward indignantly  --  Fontain restrains him  --  Carwin turns to the villagers , and in the course of this speech takes the centre , and walks back to his former place . I call on all those who encircle me : Is there one among ye , who has seen me at the farm ?  --  Look at me !  --  View me well !  --  There  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people of the farm ,  --  all those of the village too ,  --  not one that ever saw me  --  no , not one !  --  And yet , because a servant , paid for lying ,  --  a lover , whose bewildered mind pursues a phantom , unite in obvious fraud , I am accused of murder , and deprived of liberty .  --  ( To Fontaine. )  --  For you , Sir , whose zeal has carried you so far beyond discretion , if this is all your mighty allegation , ' t is at once fool-hardy and absurd ;  --  and that you may learn a lesson which you stand in need of , I summon you , to answer to the laws for this atrocious calumny . Fon . Fontaine Carwin !  --  There is a judge more awful , more infallible than man ;  --  the Great Avenger , who can not be deceived !  --  This inevitable Judge needs neither proof nor witness , nor confession ;  --  he sees into the heart :  --  in silence he prepares the punishment reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deems his triumph sure , bursts on him in a miracle , and he is gone !  --  For you that dreadful moment is at hand ! Unhappy man !  --  You fly from it in vain !  --  Your conscience tells you it is come . If human means are impotent , a super-human power will rend the tomb :  --  your victim , pale and bleeding , will rise up before you , and lift the fatal knife , and shriek  --  " Behold the murderer ! "  --  You tremble , Sir  --  Car . Carwin ( endeavouring to regain composure ) ' T is with indignation then . Fon . Fontaine No , ' t is with terror !  --  Eternal Justice , which , after committing crime , man braves , but shudders at , has already struck you .  --  Invoke it ,  --  if you dare ,  --  to shield you , if you are not guilty !  --  Your victim 's corse is there  --  ( pointing to the middle door )  --  It slambers on the bier !  --  Approach it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's gory breast your hand ,  --  and call celestial vengeance on it 's accurs 'd destroyer !  --  Ha !  --  you recoil  --  you are right .  --  Could you do that , you had been innocent ! Car . Carwin ( agitated ) I 'm going , Sir . Fon . Fontaine Go , and remember  --  the Eternal sees you ! Car . Carwin ( approaching ) Well , Sir , I  --  I  --  am  --  going  --  All stand aside , leaving an open passage to the middle door . Carwin , endeavouring to conquer his alarm , advances hesitating and stopping frequently ; all eyes are bent upon him . When he is near the middle door , it opens , as if spontaneously , and Therese appears  --  in one hand holding the knife , and pointing to it with the other .  --  She comes slowly forward  --  Carwin recedes before her in agony and consternation . Lash me not , furies !  --  Lash me not to madness !  --  Hold ! hold !  --  Terrible spectre , hence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  The world shall know your innocence  --  my guilt  --  here , at your feet , I cast the damning proofs .  --  Let them appease you  --  but save ! oh , save  --  save me from vengeance !  --  shield me from despair ! Falls senseless . When he throws down the papers , they are instantly caught up by the Count , and taken to the Magistrate , who runs over them , and hands them to Fontaine . All having read , the Count rushes to Therese , who , being overcome by the madness of Carwin and her own situation , falls into her lover 's arms . Fontaine exultingly springs forward , displaying the papers . All the characters advance at the same time before the body of Carwin . Fon . Fontaine Heaven has heard our prayers !  --  Triumph my daughter !  --  Shout all for rescued innocence !  --  Shout for Therese the Countess of Belmour ! A Shout .  --  Music .  --  The Curtain Falls Back matter THE END          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
