Weimar , 1822 . THERE are few works in the English language more interesting than Johnson 's Lives of the Poets ; and in general a well written account of a great poet is nearly as delightful to read as his works . Good poetry is so rare and exquisite a product of the mind , that the few favored mortals , who are capable of affording it , have been in all ages and nations ( as is well observed by the celebrated writer just mentioned ) invested by public opinion with some of the attributes we comrnor'ly connect with the notion of divinity ; and the accounts of their lives and writings have been always studied with an interest resembling that , with which we read thE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good biography , as it is nearly as agreeable , is also perhaps quite as rare , as good poetry and many a bard , after bestowing immortality upon crowds of patriots and heroes , has fallen short of his own fame with after ages , for want of a life . As the glory of the brave perishes , unless embalmed with the tears immortal ' of some divine poet ; so the memory of the poet himself , who saved others ' names , but left his own unsung , ' if it is not seasonably bottled up in spirit by some careful biographer , fades and dies away ; and finally two or three thousand years after , there comes along a great German critic , and flatly denies in the face of his works , that any such person ever existed . Hence we have always looked upon it as a singular dispensation of Providence in favor of the fraternity of the British poets , that a writer , so well qualified in almost every respect as Dr Johnson , should have been raised up and strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; securing them all from forgetfulness , and displaying them together , like a fine collection of pictures adorned with the golden framing of his own rich and sonorous prose , for the lasting admiration *nd delight of posterity , if bards and biographers , as may well be presumed , associate together in the flowery fields of Elysium , where we are told all good writers are admitted , it is easy to conceive // that the shade of the learned Doctor must enjoy  --  to use a diplomatic phrase  --  the most distinguished consideration with the whole company of British poets , whose lives he has recorded . Unfortunately few biographers can be advantageously compared with this great writer ; and we regret to say , that the authQr now under review is far from forming an exception to this remark . It must be allowed , however , that his work , if it has no great merit , is nevertheless respectable in its way , makes but slight pretensions , has few glaring faults , and especially is brief , the best possible quality in an indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal facts in the life of Schiller , accompanied with critical remarks on his poems ; the latter division of the work being rather inferior in value to the former . As the facts mentioned in the narrative are not perhaps very generally known to the public , we shall offer , in the present article , a summary of the most important , interspersed with such observations as may be supplied by Mr Doering , or naturally suggested by the subject . Frederic Schiller was born at Marbach , a little town in Wiirtemberg , on the tenth of November 1759 . His father , John Caspar , was bred a surgeon , and served in that capacity with a regiment of Bavarian hussars in the war of the Austrian succession . At the close of this war he returned to Wiirtemberg , and was there placed as adjutant and ensign in the Prince Louis regiment . With these characters he made the campaigns of the seven years ' war , relieving at times the sufferings of his comrades by surgical aid , and occasionally supplying their spiritual wants by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a person of versatile , if not preeminent genius . After the peace of 1763 , he retired from the army with the rank of captain , and was employed by the duke of Wiirtemberg to superintend one of his estates . in this charge he acquitted himself with great success ; and he even acquired such skill in agriculture . that he afterwards published a book upon the subject , which obtained the honors of a second edition The mother of Schiller was the daughter of a baker of Rodweis , and is represented as a person of a kind and affectionate character , and of some poetical taste . Schiller was not remarked at school os a promising boy . his genius seems to have been first excited by the opportunity of frequenting the theatre , which presented itself to him when // he was about eight years old , and he then made some attempts , at poetry , and began already to plan tragedies . He continued , however , several years longer at the public school of Ludwigsburg , employed in classical and scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His inclination at this period of life was for the profession of divinity , and the wishes of his parents coincided in this respect with his own . It hap-. pened , however , that the duke of Wiirtemberg was instituting at this time a military school at Stuttgard ; and having heard a good account of young Schiller , had made up his mind to place him there as a student . His parents objected , that it was not a suitable school for theological studies ; but the duke replied , that he could easily adopt a different profession , and the parents thought it prudent to conform to his wishes . Accordingly , the future poet was admitted at the age of fourteen into this institution , where probably every thing was taught except theology , as Schiller had decided for the profession of law . The studies connected with this profession soon became odious to him , and he determined to abandon it and apply to medicine . In reality , the passion for poetry had already taken complete possession of his mind , and any employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irksome . About the time that he entered the school , he wrote an epic poem , entitled Moses , and a tragedy upon the history of Cosmo de ' Medici . These immature productions were inspired by the popularity of Klopstock and Lessing . The smaller pieces that he wrote at this period gave , we are told , but slight indications of his future merit . Meantime , he employed his leisure in literary studies . He was induced , by hearing a passage quoted from Shakspeare in a public lecture , to attempt the reading of him ; but he took very little pleasure in it , his taste not being sufficiently mature to enjoy the sublime and beautiful display of true nature exhibited in the works of our great dramatist . At a riper age he had learned to read him with different feelings , and his remarks upon the subject , in a letter written at that time , are somewhat curious : When early in life I first became acquair4ed with Shakspeare , ' he observes , I was repelled by the want of sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in scenes of the deepest tenderness ; to degrade the most pathetic parts of Hamlet , // King Lear , and Macbeth , by bringing in clowns and gravediggers ; to dilate with apparent pleasure on offensive subjects , and then to hurry on relentlessly where the heart would delight to have had him dwell . I had studied and respected h*m in short for many years , before I began to read him with a true relish . I was not capable at that time of enjoying nature at the first hand . ' In these remarks Schiller has certainly pointed out a real defect in the manner of Shakspeare ; but it is doubtful whether he has given the true reason , why he did not at first take pleasure in reading him . We apprehend in fact , that it is the merit , and not the faults , whatever they may be , of Shakspeare , which makes his writings less agreeable to an immature taste , than many others of far inferior value . The taste of childhood is indifferent to real beauty ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , it is dazzled and bewildered with a thousand illusions , and wholly unable to estimate with certainty the value of appearances in art or nature . To a lad of fifteen a stage-player is a greater hero than Washington , or even Bonaparte ; Amadis de Gaul a much more interesting work than Don Quixote ; and the Arabian Tales the highest effort of the human understanding . The mass of mankind , whose real life lies without the sphere of elevated thoughts and actions , and who have no time to study , never correct their false notions , nor acquire just ones . If they assemble in crowds to see a representation of Cato , it is not from a love of noble sentiment , expressed in lofty language ; but they go , as Pope says , to see the bag-wig , flowered gown , and elbow-chair . ' As the influence of the world has unfortunately a natural tendency to chill the heart , as well as to inform the mind , a great proportion of the smaller number of persons , whose habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling what they gain in judgment . Hence arises the rarity of the power of producing fine imitations of nature , and of valuing tbein when produced by others , or , in other words , of genius and taste , which are only different operations of the same agents , and which demand the union of experience and sensibility . The genius of Schiller soon reached the highest point of vigor , if not of maturity , that it ever attained . The Robbers , the most powerful , if not the best of his productions , was written at about the age of eighteen , while be was still at the // academy in Stuttgard . He had occasion at this time to compose a professional essay on the connexion between our physical and intellectual natures , and he published in an appendix some passages from the Robbers , then unfinished , as translations from a pretended English play , designed to illustrate the work . In 1781 the tragedy was first published ; and the next year , was represented with great success at the theatre in Manheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most attractive theatrical exhibitions , that are presented to the German public . Imitations of it in the French and English languages have met with no great success , being made indeed by inferior hands . As the publication of this tragedy was the most important event in the life of Schiller , it may not be foreign to our purpose to add a few remarks upon its character , with a view of ascertaining its principal merits and defects . The value of the Robbers lies almost wholly in the vigor and richness of the style . It is impossible not to recognize in it the work of a most powerful mind pouring out its inspirations with the careless prodigality of conscious wealth . The characters are well drawn , admitting the justice of the conception , and produce a strong effect . The language is nervous and energetic , sometimes perhaps beyond the limit of good taste ; but even in its faults of this sort we perceive at once the excess of real force , and not the counterfeit vigor of ambitious weakness . The extraordinary length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with matter in every scene , evinces the richness of the author 's resources . The manner has also the merit of entire originality . There is no painful effort to appropriate the beauties of former writers . Except the mere form of being written in dialogue , and divided into acts , the work has no resemblance whatever to any that went before it . Conscious of his power , the author disdained to be indebted to his predecessors , and drew fearlessly from the abundance of his own wealth . This is the true sign of real genius , and the Robbers , with all its faults , must be acknowledged by every correct judge as a work of this description . The great defect of this play , on the otter hand , is that the principal character is a conception wholly false and unnatural . The hero is a person endowed with the noblest qualities of // mind and heart . He is susceptible and indeed actually under the influence of the most refined and delicate affections . To represent such a person , as hurried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be natural enough ; but instead of this , he is descrilied as living for a series of years , in the constant practice of highway robbery and murder . Few judicious persons would probably hesitate to pronounce such a character impossible in nature , and as much the fiction of a wild imagination , as the ogre with an elephant 's head , in the Arabian Nights , or the beautiful sea-maid with a fish 's tail ; for whose ugly counterfeit , our thrifty townsman , Capt . Edes , lately paid so dear at Batavia . If supposed to be possible , it is still a possible monster . To represent such a being , as acting a part with ordinary men and women in the business of life , is an error of the same sort , as if an artist , in a picture of the battle of Waterloo , should place the duke of Wellington or Bonaparte astride upon a centaur . The poet of the Pleasures of Hope tells us indeed to learn how generous worth sublimes Tue robber Moor , and pleads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how easily a youthful mind lends itself to any fiction that appears in a plausible dress ; and such a heresy , though very excusable in a bard who had not then passed his teens , has not , we trust , been encouraged by this distinguished author in the maturer judgments of his lectures . How far generous worth ' would sublime ' the practice of highway robbery , if they could be supposed to exist together , is a question which we need not discuss ; as we know that the gentlemen , who exercise this profession , are unacquainted with any worth but that of a full purse , or any generosity but that of emptying it in low debauchery , as soon as possible . We shall not , of course , be understood to mean that a mixture of virtue and vice , in the same character , is unnatural . We only affirm that the virtues and vices , that are combined in fiction , should be such as consort with each other in real life . To represent the most contradictory moral qualities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much an act of mere wantonness , as it would be to describe an individual as laboring in the last stages of a loathsome disea*e , and exhibiting at the same time all the outward forms and color of perfect health . // A fault of this description in a work of art , considered merely as such , is no otherwise injurious than as it diminishes or destroys the effect of the piece , and tends at the same time to corrupt the taste of the public . But works of art have also a powerful moral influence ; and in this point of view , the consequences of exhibiting false and unnatural images , in an attractive dress , are extremely important . Moral rules are generalisations of the relations established by nature between individual beings ; and virtue consists in the regulation of our conduct , agreeably to these relations . We have also a capacity of deriving pleasure from the contemplation of these relations and the objects between which they exist ; and good taste consists in possessing this faculty uncorrupted and in a high degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and every work of art , that sins against the rules of taste , saps at the same time , in proportion to the power with which it is executed , the foundations of good conduct . Some errors of this kind are more injurious than others , and the most extravagant are the least dangerous , because the least likely to impose upon the feelings . The attempt in the play we are considering , to dress up highway robbery in the garb of heroism and sentiment , seems in the abstract too absurd to produce any practical mischief . But unfortunately there is no fiction that does not assume an appearance of plausibility under the pen of a great poet ; and we are told , that soon after the first publication of the Robbers , a number of respectable young men in Germany , were carried away by the example of the hero to such an extent , that they actually embraced his profession . Supposing this fact ( which however has been repeatedly stated ) to be doubtful , it is certain that in reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing at the absurdity of his character ; and we have seen above , the sweetest and purest poet of the day pronounce the personage to be sublime . Indeed the combination of qualities , which forms the basis of the character of Moor , is so far from offending the public taste by its incongruousness , that it not only met with astonishing success in the hands of Schiller , but has been produced again , with equal effect in our own time , by lord Byron . His Giaours , Alps , and Conrads , are all heroic and sentimental highwaymen , a little less monstrous // than Charles Moor , because the scene of their exploits is laid in less civilized countries . Such delineations are dangerous and immoral , not precisely from the probability that they will bring many persons to the state prison or the gallows , but because they confound all our notions and feelings in regard to moral distinctions , vitiate the fine natural sense of real worth and beauty , and lay the heart open without a guard to such temptations as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have intimated above , errors in taste of a similar kind , that are more pernicious , because they are less extravagant . But it is time to return from these general views to the subject immediately before us . The Robbers was commenced , as we have observed above , while Schiller was a pupil at the military school ; but before it was published he had been appointed surgeon to a regiment in the duke of Wfirtemberg 's service . The director of the theatre at Manheim , having made arrangements for bringing out his play , the author , as may easily he supposed , was anxious to assist at the representation , and applied for leave of absence from his regiment for that purpose . This favor was refused ; hut the poet 's zeal was not so easily damped . He went off privately to Manheim without permission , assisted with great delight at the representation of his play , and as soon as he returned , was put under arrest for a fortnight . Not long after , the duke positively prohibited him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated by the biographer , that his highness , who probably considered himself the best judge of poetry in his dominions , had previously sent for Schiller for the purpose of pointing out to him in a fatherly way the faults in his tragedy , and directed him not to publish any thing in future without shewing it to him , and taking his advice . The bard 's hesitation in agreeing to this proposal is supposed to have been the immediate cause of the prohibition just mentioned . The restraints that were imposed upon him by the duties of his station and the meddling interference of the duke soon became intolerable to Schiller , and he determined to quit the service and the country . He did not venture however , to apply for permission to resign his place in a regular way , thinking probably , that it would not only be refused. , but that means would be taken to prevent him from executing his intention.s . For fear of this , he determined upon a bolder step , // and took his departure privately without leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have been productive of serious consequences . It appears , however , that the government made no attempt to recover the fugitive ; and when Schiller , several years afterwards , at the height of his reputation , ventured to return for a short time to Wiirtemberg to see his family , the duke not only did not order him to be shot , as he probably might have done by the letter of the law , but graciously condescended to take no notice whatever of his presence in the country . Upon leaving Wiirtemberg , Schiller took refuge under a feigned name at the house of a friend , where he continued his poetical labors , and employed himself in writing the tragedies of the Conspiracy of Fiesco and Cabal and Love . After living in this way about a year , he repaired to Manheim , at the invitation of baron Dalberg , then and for many years afterwards director of the theatre at that place . Dalberg was a younger member of one of the wealthiest and most distinguished houses in Germany , which had lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste and talent of its principal branches . His brother , the head of the family , was at that time Elector of Mentz , and became afterwards , in the course of the late political revolutions , prince primate of the Confederation of the Rhine . Another brother distinguished himself as one of the high functionaries of the late French empire , under the title of duke of Dalberg , and is now a peer of France . The three brothers were all remarkable for their love of letters and literary men ; and indeed had all adventured themselves with great success in the field of authorship . The elector published at a very early age a work , entitled Reflections on the Universe , which went through ten editions before the author was twenty-three years old . The baron 's taste was for the drama , and he wrote himself several pieces for the theatre , which he directed . It was he who had assisted Schiller in bringing out the Robbers ; and he now received its author at Manheim with great regard and kindness . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During his residence at this place , which lasted about three years , he appears to have written but little , excepting a few small poems and a periodical work , entitled Thalia , which was published at long intervals . He was principally employed in // studying the most distinguished dramatists of other countries , and in meditating plans for new books of his own . He also assisted baron Dalberg in the management of the theatre . It will not be necessary for our present purpose to examine in detail the two tragedies just mentioned , or those which were afterwards published . We were led to notice more particularly the prominent merits and defects of the Robbers , because it forms in both these points a class by itself in the writings of its author ; while the other tragedies are all marked by the same general characteristics , and form together a second class , entirely dissimilar in all respects from the first . The two that are mentioned above , and which were written next after the Robbers , resemble it more nearly , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the poet gradually passed from one manner to another . Don Carlos , which followed Cabal and Love , exhibits the second manner as strongly as perhaps any other of the plays ; and all that succeeded it are distinguished by the same general features . Having already attempted to give some idea of the Robbers , we shall here add a few remarks upon the style of plan and execution , which was adopted by Schiller in his riper productions . The character of the Robbers was probably determined in a great degree by the circumstances of the author 's position at the time when he wrote . It is the production of a powerful mind , still in an immature state , but excited to a high and unnatural degree by a sense of supposed injustice and oppression . The love of poetry and letters was the dominant feeling with Schiller ; and this passion was thwarted by the discipline of the military school . The strictness of the rules , to which he was subject , however wholesome for general purposes , appeared to the youthful bard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited him from attaching himself to pursuits , which he considered not only as perfectly honorable , but in the highest degree ennobling and generous . This situa-* tion accounts at once for the beauties and the faults of the author 's first play . A sense of the injustice , under which he supposed himself to be laboring , vitiated his view of the general operation of society . His soul rose up in rebellion against all existing institutions . The world seemecf to him like a vast prison house , where base and sordid spirits are clothed with power , and permitted to trample with impunity upon the rights // of the wise and good . The struggles between these parties make up the action of life . Hence the highwayman , who comes out more fearlessly and publicly in opposition to the existing system , than any other person , is the boldest and most distinguished champion of the right side , and naturally presented himself to the poet 's mind , as the proper hero of a play intended to depict this gloomy scene . The villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord of the manor , a noble and wealthy proprietor , who is represented as exercising all manner of oppression , and as being hated and despised by every body ; while his brother , the highwayman , whose habitual occupation is the burning of houses and the cutting of purses and throats , is described as worthy of universal love and admiration , and as suffering a sort of martyrdom in the best of causes . With Schiller this view of society was probably a generalization of his own individual experience ; and the poem which he has founded upon it is accordingly executed with all the force and fire of true feeling . These qualities constitute the merit of the work , and ensured its success . The reputation and general favor which the author obtained from it eontributed , in connexion with the natural progress of age and experience , to change his ideas , and to reconcile him with existing institutions . Flattered and caressed by the wealthy ar&amp;d the noble , he was soon satisfied , that merit of all kinds might be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its bright as well as its dark side . We find accordingly in the later plays few if any traces of the philosophical views , that give a character to the Robbers . The poet generally confines himself to the exposition in a dramatic form of known historical facts , and chooses his heroes in the same rank of social life , which has generally been resorted to for this purpose by his predecessors . His change of circumstances appears also to have operated , but in a less favorable way , upon the style of the later plays . In the Robbers the vigor and warmth of the language is perhaps excessive ; in the others the fault is of a different kind . The style is pure and elegant , and even far from being positively langui* but , if we are not mistaken , it is somewhat less natural and nervous , than might be wished . These poems are rather dramatic dialogues than tragedies . They resemble in manner the English tragedians of the last century , much more nearly than Shakspeare. // In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , the two writers have hardly any points of resemblance . They belong to two different periods in the progress of poetry . Shakspeare has all the exuberant fulness , the fresh and joyous flow of thought and feeling , that appertain to an early literary age ; and the fetters of general principles and conventional rules hang about him very loosely . At the slightest temptation he breaks through them with perfect nonclialance , and shakes them off like dew-drops from a lion 's mane . ' Nay , he often , in the wantonness of power , seems to take delight in setting all forms at defiance , and bringing into one picture the most incongruous images in art and nature , as in the last act of Hamlet . In Schiller , on the contrary , we recognize the established empire of taste , against which genius itself in a polished age does not venture to rebel . The form predominates over the substance . There is no playing with conventional rules-no mixture of prose and verse , of tragedy and comedy in the same scene-no puns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by a tragic hero at the height of his distress . The execution is pure , chaste , and polished , and even in the Robbers only errs by a small excess in degree . Thus far all is well ; but then we miss at the same time the fresh impression of nature , and the careless ease and lightheartedness of an untamed fancy . The language is studied and elaborate , as well as elegant , and the effect upon the whole is much less delightful . Whether it be possible for any talent , however high , to produce the same impression of power , and the same degree of pleasure , with a strict observance of all the formal rules of taste , that result from witnessing the wild and graceful sports of a genius that rises above them , is perhaps a question . The talent of Schiller , great as it was , has certainly not been sufficient for this object . The difference between these two poets is as great in the substance , as in the form of their works ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stamp of the age in which he lived . Shakspeare gives us the simple and true impression of nature , as observed and felt by himself . In Schiller we generally get it at second hand , through the medium of books , and deduced from vague generalities . Shakspeare , too , is rich in the most profound and curious general observations upon every branch of moral science ; but with him they seem to be instinctive // conclusions of his own acute sense , while in Schiller , on the contrary , we trace them at once to be the common fund of the philosophical knowledge of his time ; and are rather tempted to regard even his individual characters as personifications of acknowledged general truths . In making these remarks , we are far from wishing to undervalue the merit of Schiller , which is sufficiently attested by his prodigious and continued success . indeed the general characteristics , which we have just noticed , belong to him in common with the most distinguished dramatic poets of ancient and modern times . The masters of the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discursive , as well as pure and elegant . The manner of Alfieri and Metastasio partakes of the same qualities ; and the best English tragedies of the last century are feebler examples of this model . We are inclined to think , indeed , that Schiller has upon the whole brought this form of tragedy to a higher degree of perfection , than any modern writer , with the exception , perhaps , of Corneille and Racine . We only mean to insist , that his merits and defects are entirely different from those of Shakspeare , with whom he is frequently classed by superficial critics , who also describe them both as belonging to the romantw school of poetry . It is almost needless to remark , that there is not a writer in the whole compass of literature less romantic than Shakspeare ; and it is rather difficult to conjecture for what reason he has been classed with Schiller , unless it be that they both neglect at pleasure the formal unities of time and place  --  a circumstance which , however unimportant , seems to be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true ground of distinctions among dramatic writers . We are not made acquainted with the reasons that induced Schiller to leave Manheim , where he seems to have been pleasantly situated , and very much respected . He afterwards resided successively for short periods at Leipsic , Dresden , and some other places . His poetical reputation procured him every where a very favorable reception ; and he had already become an object of curiosity to strangers ; some of whom , however , were partially scandalized at the simplicity of his appearance and manners , having formed *n idea that the author of the Robbers ought to figure , at the very least , in innstachios and hussar boots . About this time he produced the tragedy of Don Carlos , one of the most valuable of his plays , // and the one which marked decisively the adoption of his second manner . He also employed himself a good deal in historical studies , and published the first volume of a History of the Revolution of the Netherlands , a work which he never completed . The specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the public , and pointed out its author as a suitable person to succeed the celebrated Eichhorn , who had just resigned the professorship of history in the university of Jena . The friends of Schiller , particularly the poet Gmthe , made interest in his favor , and he obtained the place . Schiller had made the acquaintance of Gethe a short time before , when the latter was upon his return from his journey into Italy . He had formed the highest idea of his character and talents ; and seems upon his first introduction to have been somewhat dissatisfied with the deportment of his brother poet , who was discoursing with great life and fluency upon the objects he had lately seen , and seemed much too gay and goodhumored for the author of the Sorrows of Werther . In a letter written at this time , Schiller expresses his discontent as follows : The high idea , that I had formed of the character of Gcethe , has not been diminished by our interview ; but I doubt whether we ever become very intimate with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which I now am most sensible . Indeed our intellectual constitutions appear to be originally different his world is not mine ; our modes of thinking are radically at variance . It may be rash , however , to draw this conclusion from a single conversation . Time will show the truth . ' In fact , the kindness and friendly deportment of Gmthe towards the disappointed bard induced the latter very soon to change his opinion . Goethe , who was in high favor at the court of Weimar , presented Schiller to the grand duchess . Her highness gave him a very gracious reception , and Schiller , in the letter which describes it , seems already half disposed to forgive the gaiety of his celebrated friend Who was it , think you , ' says he to his correspondent , that procured me an introduction to the duchess ? No other than Goethe . You shake your head significantly at this ; and well you may . I have learned , however , not to judg* in future of characters hastily and from preconceived notions . Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has been led into them by others . They do not belong to his natural character . ' // The meaning of the last phrase seems to be , that the author of the Sorrows was originally as melancholy as a gentleman ought to be , but that flattery and success had corrupted him into his present good humor . The assistance rendered by Goethe in the affair of the professorship confirmed Schiller in his good opinion , and they continued ever after fast and intimate friends . In the year 1790 , soon after his establishment at Jena , Schiller espoused the Fraulein von Lengefeld , and the union appears to have been a very happy one . As an encouragement to matrimony , we add the following extracts from letters written a few months after : It is a very different thing , ' says the poet , even in summer , to live with a kind and loving wife , from what it is to be left all alone to one 's self . I now begin to enjoy in reality the beauties of nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with inspiration . '  --  and again : - What a charming life I now lead . I look about me with unaffected gaiety , sic .2 and enjoy a continual satisfaction of mind and heart . A beautiful harmony pervades my whole existence . My days pass off without the excitement of passion , and in the midst of a sweet and undisturbed serenity . I look forward to the future with confidence and cheerfulness ; and now that I have attained the object of all my wishes , I am astonished myself at my own success . Providence has smoothed all difficulties , and brought me happily to the goal . I hope every thing from the future . In a few years my intellect will reach its full maturity , he was then thirty-two and I even flatter myself , that I shall at the same time renew my youth in the constant exercise of warm feelings and an active imagination . ' These pure pleasures and sanguine hopes were unfortunately of short duration . The year after his marriage , the poet was violently attacked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his after life , and which finally brought it to a close . His illness is attributed in part to the injurious influence of the mode , which he had adopted of composition and study . He uniformly devoted the day to society , recreation , or business ; and reserved his poetical labors for the night , almost the whole of which was often employed in the cabinet . On these occasions , he kept at his side a cup of strong coffee , or a goblet of Rhenish , and recurred to them at times to recruit his strength . In the sile*ice of night he was often heard by the neighbors declaiming with great energy ; and from a house that overlooked his study , he might be seen , // striding violently up and down the room , and then seating himself to write , or renewing his inspiration from the goblet . In this manner he labored till four or five o'clock in the morning in winter , and till three in summer . He then went to bed , and slept till nine or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have destroyed his health at an early age , and finally removed him from the world while his intellect was still in full vigor and activity . We may add here , that his manner of writing was slow and laborious ; a fact , which appears at first rather singular , considering the number of hours which he appears to have devoted every day to this purpose . He never wrote rapidly ; and on some of his plays he was employed for four or five years in succession . His habits in this respect , like those of other writers , were probably in part the result of circumstances , and did not arise from any original peculiarity of intellect . They were perhaps more fortunate for his ultimate reputation , than others would have been of an opposite kind . Rapidity of composition is not incompatible with a high degree of merit , but is very rarely combined with the substantial richness and the exquisite polish , which alone can give a work a solid and lasting value . Besides , as the worth of poetry , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depends in a great degree upon its rarity , the dealers in the article would do well , for their own interest , to limit the quantity of their supplies , even supposing the quality to be the same , for fear of overstocking the market , and permanently injuring the demand . Schiller appears to have resigned his professorship , or at least to have suspended his attention to its duties , after the attack of illness above mentioned , although the fact is not precisely stated by the biographer , and was thus deprived of his ordinary means of living . The munificence of the duke of Holstein Augustenberg , and some other persons of high rank , obviated any anxiety , that he might have felt upon this head ; and enabled him to give himself the temporary repose from labor of every kind , which was necessary to his health . He continued to reside at Jena till 1799 , when he removed to Weimar , and fixed his abode there for the rest of his life . During the time that he passed at Jena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their fruits was the History of the thirty years ' War . This work , in the shape // in which it now appears , is little better than a fragment , although the narrative is brought down to the peace of Westphalia . The earlier events of the war are described with fulness and care , and in a very masterly style ; but after the death of Gi.istavus , and the assassination of Wallenstein , the historian seems to lose his interest in the subject , and the events are hurried over with too much rapidity . Had the whole been finished with equal care , the work would have been one of the most valuable of its class to be found in any language ; nor can it be read in its present state without extreme pleasure . The subject is happily chosen , and does not yield in interest to that of Thucydides . It may be remarked , however , that the author , by conceiving it more largely , might have given it a much loftier and more philosophical character . The Reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ' war formed the concluding scene ; and it is impossible for a historian to do full justice to any part of the long succession of momentous events , to which this name is attached , without giving a com* plete view of the whole . Treated in this way , the subject is perhaps the best in the whole compass of history . Embracing a period of little more than a century , it is not too vast for a single work ; and while it affords the richest variety of incidents it possesses at the same time the charm of complete unity . Tbe action commences with the promulgation of the new religion by the preaching of Luther . The vast commonwealth of Europe , through its several branches , divides itself immediately into two parties , one occupied in resisting and attempting to crush this momentous innovation , the other bent upon giving it an acknowledged and authentic character . The struggles of these parties in the fields of negotiation , and of civil and foreign war , make up the history of Europe for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until at length all the powers are involved in a great final contest of thirty years in succession , which ends with the solemn consecration of the new doctrine , as an acknowledged religion at the peace of Westphalia . It is obvious , that the high moral considerations , in which these events had their origin , give them an importance much superior to that of ordinary wars , and occasion an uncommon and very agreeable variety in the characters and incidents to be described . Priests and soldiers , kings and cardinals , monks and ladies occupy the stage by turns , and we // are not fatigued with the continual recurrence of similar events , that becomes so monstrous in most histories . In short , the subject unites , perhaps , in the highest possible degree , the materials for political and philosophical discussion and poetical description . When treated in parts , the moral interest in a great measure disappears , and tbe portion selected can hardly be made to excite more attention , than any merely political event of equal importance . The Reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cumbrous episode , that rather injures than increases the effect . The work of Robertson , who in his Charles V has taken up the commencement of this great action , and that of Schiller , who describes the close , are in this respect obnoxious to the same objection . The subject in its true form and grandeur still re** mains unattempted ; and invites the labor of some powerful and philosophical pen , competent , if any such there be , to do it justice . Schiller seems to have been more attracted by the poetical capacities of the subject , than by its political and philosophical interest ; and after proceeding in his history as far as the death of Wallenstein , he probably relinquished the idea of complet*-ing it in the same way , for the purpose of employing the materials he had collected in the form of poetry . He conceived at first the plan of an epic poem , of which Gustavus Adolphus was to have been the hero . In his letters written at this time , he remarks , that of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest degree the materials of poetical with those of political and national interest . The history of the Thirty Years ' war includes that of the Reformation , as an indispensable episode , and the history of the Reformation has the closest connexion with the principal events in the fortunes of the human race . The poet , therefore , has it in his power to introduce by a just arrangement the whole history of man in a heroic poem , of which the immediate subject should extend from the battle of Leipsic to that of Lhtzen ; and to treat it much more ag*reeably than he could in any other way . ' This plan , however , he also relinquished , and finally determined to employ his materials in writing fi tragedy upon the death of Wallenstein . He seems to have labored this play much more than any of the others , as it was seven years from // the time he formed the plan of it , till its completion . The effect , however , does not appear to be proportionately great ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the nature of the subject peculiarly interesting to a German audience , has no marked superiority over others , that were written in a much shorter time . It is probable , that the state of the author 's health at this time prevented him from laboring with his usual assiduity . The subject of Wallenstein is wrought up into three poems . The first part , entitled Wallenstein 's Camp , is a short piece in one act , and serves as a prologue to the principal play . It is a sort of comedy , exhibiting a view of the interior of a military encampment , and is executed with great power . The Two Piccolomini is a domestic tragedy , founded on the loves of Wallenstein 's daughter and the younger Piccolomini , whose father was at the same time employed by the Imperial government to assassinate their own commander in chief . Wallenstein 's Death exhibits the bloody catastrophe , which terminated the projects of this aspiring soldier . The subject is , upon the whole , a good one , though rather deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his irresolute ambition , his domestic tenderness , and his hankering after astrology , is highly dramatic . During the time of Schiller 's residence at Jena , he also projected one or two other poems , which were never written . The account of these projects , given by himself in his letters , is curious and amusing . He intended at one time to attempt an epic founded upon some action in the life of the great Frederic . The plan of founding an epic poem upon some remarkable action in the life of Frederic , ' he observes , is highly plausible ; nor would the apparent difficulty of treating events so near our own time aifright me very much . A heroic poem , written in the eighteenth century , ought to be a very different thing from one that was produced in the infancy of the world ; and this is the very reason , that makes me wish to attempt one . It ought to exhibit in a free and unconstrained way the quintessence of our manners , arts , and sciences : just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization in Greece . I also wish to invent a machinery , for I should make it a point not to deviate a hair 's breadth from the strictest formal rules of the poem . This would he the most difficult part with so recent an action passing in a very prosaic age ; but then if I can succeed in it the effect will he so much the // greater . I have all sorts of plans upon the subject , but am not yet satisfied with any . In regard to the measure , you will be rather surprised , that I have chosen the ottara nina ; this is the only kind of verse , except Jambics , that 1 can abide , and I think that the sublimity and gravity of the matter will appear to great advantage in this easy and simple dress . The sweet and graceful flow of this stanza will be charming in an epic poem . I should wish , that my countrymen might sing it as the Grecian peasants did the Iliad , and the boatmen of Venice the Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , which ought , if possible to be very simple , however numerous may be the episodes . I should however give a view of the whole life of Frederic , and his princip 1 contemporaries . For a work like this , there is no better model , than the Iliad . ' In the following extracts from his letters , he gives an account of another plan , that he had formed , of a poem , which he calls an Idyll ; but which , had it been written , could not have had much resemblance to any other production known by that title . My Land of Shadows , ' he observes , speaking of one of his published poems , is merely didactic . Had the subject been treated as poetically , as that of the Elegy , the work would have been , in some sort , a master-piece ; and I mean to make this attempt as soon as I have leisure . I intend to write an Idyll in the same way , that I did the Elegy . I am collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general to produce without the help of pathos the highest poetical effect . My Land of Shadows contains the rules for this , and I mean that the idyll shall afford an example . The immediate subject will be the marriage of Hebe and Hercules . it is impossible to go higher than this , because the poet must keep within the circle of humanity ; and the scope of the poem will be to exhibit the human nature , rising into the divine . The leading characters would be gods ; but Hercules would form a connecting link between them and men , and would give the poem an action . Such an Idyll would be in some respects the exact reverse of the higher comedy , while it would resemble it considerably in form . Both exclude pathos ; but comedy treats of real life , while the Idyll dwells wholly in the ideal . if I find this plan impracticable , and become satisfied , that ideal images do not admit of being presented in the form of actual persons , I shall then think , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me , that comedy is the highest kind of poem . But only think how delightful it must be to bring out a poetical picture free from any mortal // mixture-all light-all freedom-all power-no shadows or shackles of any kind . My head turns when I think of the possibility of realizing this plan . 1 do not quite despair of it , provided I can once fairly clear my intellect of the rubbish of reality . I shall then summon up all my energies , and set to work , though I exhaust them in the attempt . Ask me no questions . The entire scheme is still undefined , and it will take a great deal of labor and study to ascertain whether it can even be attempted . ' From the time when Schiller removed to Weimar in 1799 , until his death , which happened in 1805 , he abandoned all other studies , and devoted himself exclusively to poetry , and principally to the drama . During this period he produced in suc9ession the tragedies of Maria Stuart the Maid of Orleans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also coininenced another upon the subject of the Russian adventurer , commonly called the False Demetrius , which he left unfinished . All these plays exhibit the full maturity and vigor of the author 's powers , and met with complete success at the time of their appearance . The Maid of Orleans is generally considered the most remarkable and attractive . It would he difficult to find a historical subject better adapted for the purposes of poetry , than the life of this celebrated heroine ; and accordingly none perhaps has been attempted by more hands , or treated in a greater variety of forms . Her first appearance on any stage , as far at least as our knowledge extends , is in Shakspeare 's Henry VI ; and the open injustice , which she met with from the great dramatist , was but too true a prognostic of her future fortunes in the same line , at least for a long period . If the play be really Shakspeare 's , which is a matter of doubt , it must have been one of his earlier and immature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius in any part , and certainly none in the scenes where Joan of Arc is introduced . The poet , far from showing any sense of the poetical beauty and grandeur of her extraordinary character , either felt or affected all the vulgar prejudices in regard to it , which might have belonged at the time to the meanest common soldier in the English army ; and seems to have taken pleasure in wantonly degrading her to the lowest point of immorality . Nor is it a sufiicie*it reason for this to say , that he puts into the mouth of British officers the language , which they may really be supposed to have uttered , since he // represents the heroine , as charging herself with low and sordid vices . This manner of treating a noble character is so foreign to the free and magnanimous spirit of Shakspeare , that we prefer believing the play , at least in this part , to be really by another hand . However this may be , the unhappy heroine was reserved for still severer fortunes . Calumniated by a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was next exposed to the still more tormenting martyrdom of being eulogized by a dunce , having been selected by Chapelain , a now forgotten poet of the age of Louis XLV , as the heroine of one of those compositions in twelve or twenty-four books , which , under the name of epic poems , have in all ages demonstrated the patience of their authors , and exhausted that of every body else . Lastly , as a reward for delivering her country from a foreign enemy , and sacrificing her life in the cause , she was stretched on the rack of satire by the greatest wit that France has ever produced , and ridiculed through twenty books of a licentious poem , as she had been celebrated in twenty-four of another , which , unfortunately was but too serious . After this , however , the fatality , that had hitherto pursued her , relented . It is true , that Mr Southey 's attempt to restore her character was not very effectual ; but the treatment of the laureate was at least much more tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might with propriety employ the old Homeric consolation , that she had suffered worse before . It was finally reserved for a German to do full justice , in the most splendid manner , to this young French woman , and to give her the crown of poetical glory , which she certainly merited , if any achievement could give her a right to it . The indifference of so gallant a nation as the French to the worth of this young and beautiful heroine , is a singular fact , which has also been noticed by some of their own best writers . It seems to have extended to the circumstances of her history and personal situation ; and the place of her residence was but little known or regarded until the entry of the allied armies into France in 1814 and 1815 . The German officers and soldiers , full of the enthusiasm for her character , inspired by Schiller 's tragedy , sought out the village of Domremi , where she was born , and which lay near the road to Paris ; and the French authorit*es , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth-place // of the Maid of Orleans , have since instituted an annual celebration in her remembrance : Such honors Ilion to her hero paid , And peaceful slept the mighty Hector 's shade . ' Notwithstanding the great poetical capability of this subject , it must always be a matter of considerable difficulty for a writer , who undertakes to treat it , to determine in the first instance under what point of view the character of the heroine shall be presented , and indeed what her character really was . Her great and brilliant services to her country are unquestionable ; but it would not be easy to ascertain , as a point of history , or even as a probable conjecture , whether she was a machine in the hands of others , a mere enthusiast , or a re*i heroine , or in what degrees she united these different characters . As a subject for poetry , she must necessarily be drawn as a real heroine , strongly tinctured perhaps with enthusiasm and this seems to have been in the first instance the intention of Schiller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her character appear consistent with her education and early habits . For this or some other reason , Schiller , after writing a great part of the play upon this plan , abandoned it altogether , and determined to represent his principal personage as acting under the influence of an immediate inspiration from heaven . The following extracts are given from his letters in regard to this tragedy : I had this subject under consideration a year before I began to write , and I gave myself full time for the composition . The Maid of Orleans is indeed a subject quite unique in its kind , and may well be a favorite one with modern poets , as Iphigenia was with the Greeks . It has been accordingly attempted by bards without number , real or pretended . In treating her history , I finally concluded to give it the coloring of romance and superstition , that belongs to her age . I had projected three different plans for the composition of this tragedy ; and if 1 had leisure , I would even now execute the two others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I intended to exhibit the contrast between the reckless indifference , that prevailed at the luxurious court of the Dauphin , in regard to the British invasion , and the high resolution of the inspired heroine , in a different way from that in which it appears in the piece , as it stands , where I have represented the Da*iphin as a weak but amiable prince . I had already fiui*hed the four first acts , and it cost me a effort // 420 April , to change my system , and substitute a romantic conception of the character of Joan , for the historical one , which I had previously adopted . ' The tragedy , written upon this plan , loses of course the pretension to be a true picture of life , and becomes a mere dramatic poem . It is called by Schiller a romantic tragedy . The propriety of this appellation seems to be called in question by the biographer , whose remarks upon the subject are so very curious , and so much in the character of a German writer , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observes , has given to this poem the title of a romantic tragedy , but at that time the meaning of the word romantic had not been defined with much precision . According to our present ideas on subject of taste , it means , as is well known , an infinite ion0 ing after the absolute and infinite , an is thus opposed to the antique , which is the infinite realized in a positive shape . But the poet does not seem to have had this distinction in view ; and indeed upon this definition , the character of romantic is inseparable from all modern works of art , and belongs of course to the other tragedies of Schiller as well as to this . ' If any thing could be conceived more amusing than this definition of the term romantic , it would be the perfect simplicity and sincerity , with which the biographer presents it as the one now generally received by the learned . It would he impossible by any analysis to make such language appear more absurd , than it must to every judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally as a curiosity , and as a specimen of a style of writing very common in German , though almost unknown to the other modern languages . We have hardly any examples of it in English , with the exception , perhaps , of Mr Coleridge 's Literary Life and Friend , where the amateurs of this manner will find a choice treat . Mvs Malaprop , in the Rivals , and some of the clown 's replies to sir Andrew Aguecheek , in the Twelfth Night , are much in the same way . As to the question in hand , we conceive that Schiller was perfectly right in applying the term romantic to his tragedy of the Maid of Orleans . The word , as is well known , is derived from the common patronymic Roman , which was used , of course , by the Romans to designate their own language , and was retained for this purpos* ' in France , after the Latin language had assumed the corrupt form of the earlier // French . It probably designated at first all compositions written in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prose , in which sense it is still em .. ployed in French and English Romantic means , therefore , etymologically , nothing more than fictitious , in distinction from historical ; but as novels and romances commonly depart as much from the truth of nature in their execution , as they do from that of history in their plan , the term has been much used of late in the former sense , as well as in the latter . In giving his tragedy the title of romantic , Schiller intended to intimate , that he had purposely deviated from the truth of history and nature , in the conception of his principal character , whereas in his other plays he at least makes it his object , whether effectually or not , to conform to them . The distinction between the romantic and the classical in works of art , so much talked of at present on the continent of Europe , if it means any thing else than the difference , to which we have just alluded , between the natural arid unnatural , or in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wholly baseless , or founded on abstractions , that , when divested of the unintelligible jargon , in which they are commonly expressed , are either futile or absurd . Thus we are told by Mr Doering in the definition above quoted , that the romantic is an infinite longing after the infinite ; and then , that the antique is the infinite itself in a positive shape . Why then , of course , by the rules of algebra , the romantic is an infinite longing after the antique ; and yet the two qualities are at the same time placed in formal opposition to each pther . Again ; all modern works of art are necessarily romantic ; ' including , doubtless , those of Racine and Pope amongst others . What then becomes of the distinction between the romantic and the classical in modern works of art , which it is the precise object of the writers , who usually hold this language , to insist on ? We shall not , however , tire the reader 's patience by any farther disquisitions on so plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our narrative . The reception given to the Maid of Orleans by the public was flattering to the author in the highest degree . Among other prpofs of the general approbation , it is mentioned , that when the curtain fell at the end of the first act , during the first representation of this play upon the Leipsic stage , the building resounded with acelama // tions of Long live Frederic Schiller . ' After the play was over , the whole audience crowded into the street to see the poet , upon his coming out of the house , and forming two long lines on the sides of the way , stood with uncovered heads till he had passed through . It is pleasing to see the most potent and public testimonials of success conferred , as in this case , upon real merit . At the same time , when we remark the uncertainty and capriciousness of the first decision of the literary public , when we see , for example , such romances as those of Mr D'Arlincourt passing through seven or eight editions in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we learn that the farce , entitled Tom and Jerry , or Life in London , has been the most productive , and the School for Scandal the least so of the dramatic performances exhibited for many years upon the English stage , we are compelled to acknowledge , that such attestations of worth , however flattering at the time , are not , after all , the most certain and valuable . We have had occasion in the course of this article to mention all the works of Schiller of any magnitude , with the exception of the Ghost Seer , a romance , of which the first volume only was published . In this work , as far as one can judge of it from a short fra*ment , the author intended to employ the same means of exciting interest , which were resorted to by our countryman Brown , who may possibly have taken some hints from Schiller , as he seems to have been acquainted with German literature . Besides the works we have mentioned , Schiller contributed a great number of fugitive pieces , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cQnducted by himself and others . Many of his shorter poems made their appearance in this way , and they are amongst the most highly finished and exquisite productions of the kind to be found in any language . The singnlar variety in the subjects and tones of them shows the extraordinary versatility of the author 's genius . It would be difficult to point out a more animated serious lyric poem , than the Ode to Pleasure . The ballads , as for example , the Diver and Fridolin , are written with the most charming felicity of style . The Bell is quite an original , poem , founded on an entirely new conception , wrought up and finished with extraordinary power and beauty in a few hundred lines . If a speculating bard of the present day had hit upon such a subject , he would have rung at least a dozen changes upon it through as // many cantos . There are even two or three very pleasing specimens of the comic style , for which , however , Schiller had in general but little taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole educated portion of the German nation , and if their author had never written any thing else , would have given him a lasting rank among the greatest poets that have ever lived . One of the least attractive to us of the minor poems , is the Walk , an Elegy , which the author himself mentions , in one of his letters above quoted , as among the very best of all his productions . The versification of this piece is imitated from the antique Hexameter and Pentameter , which to our taste has but little charm for the ear , even in German , where it succeeds better than in other modern languages . The literary activity of Schiller continued undiminished up to the time of his death , which happened at Weimar , on the ninth of May 1805 , after a short illness , at the age of five and forty . Occurring in the full maturity of his intellectual powers , and when his countrymen expected so much pleasure from their farther exercise , it excited a strong sensation through the whole of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was reopened after a while by a rep-. resentation of the Maid of Orleans , accompanied by a solemn funeral ceremony in honor of the author . The anniversary of his death has been observed ever since at the same place by a repetition of his tragedy of Wallenstein . He left a widow and five children . The following particulars are given by the biographer respecting his manners , person , and character Schiller was tall and thin , though naturally of a powerful make . The activity of his mind had evidently checked the full development of his body . His face was pale , the expression of his eye mild and gentle ; his forehead high and open ; his cheeks hollow ; his chin a little projecting , and his hair reddish . His exterior was not very attractive . In walking , his looks were always bent downwards ; and he often passed his acquaintance without recognizing them , but when he perceived them , he greeted them with great kindness . In large companies , and especially at court , his manner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among a few intimate friends , he was easy , cheerful , and talkative . He took particular pleasure P a literary society , which was formed at Weimar after he went to reside there , and of which Geethe was one of the principal members . His disposition was eminently kind and friendly , and he felt for others as // warmly as for himself ; often declaring , that he had no other wish than to see every body happy and contented . He was not fond of public and noisy amusements , and frequented no places of general resort , except the theatre ; to which he was naturally much attached . He also took delight in instructing the actors . The rehearsals of the new pieces were regularly held either at his house or Gwthe 's ; and this circumstance often had a favorable influence on the talent of the players . Schiller 's notions were very high in regard to good acting , and it was rather difficult to satisfy him . After the successful representation of any of his later dramatic works , he commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which passed off very pleasantly with songs , improvisations , and all sorts of gaiety . ' Having offered in the course of this article such critical remarks as had occurred to us upon the writings of Schiller , it will not be necessary to dwell any longer upon his poetical character . It is much to his honor , that all his writings are distinguished by a pure morality , and an elevated tone of thought and feeling . In making this remark , we mean , of course , to except the Robbers , for reasons , which we have already explained at length . Though not , strictly speaking , licentious , the moral of this play is certainly exceptionable. - The rest of his works , whether in prose or verse , are uniformly fitted to encourage the noblest and most amiable sentiments . Few poets of any country , who have flourished at advanced periods in the progress of civilization , deserve this praise to the same extent . His two great contemporaries , Gcethe and Wieland , for example , are by no means so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in general , far from being absolutely vicious . In the infancy of letters and society , poetry speaks the language of the gods ; but as luxury increases , it is too apt to leave its lofty heights and to dwell in preference on frivolous or sensual subjects . The most esteemed modern poets of England and France furnish many examples of the truth of this remark . It is therefore a great happiness for a nation , when a writer like Schiller* whose talents secure him an unbounded popularity and influence , has the grace to exert them uniformly in the great cause of virtue and human happiness . No compensation in the power of subjects or sovereigns to bestow can be too great for such deserts : Qua* tibi , qua* tali reddam pro carmine doria ? ' // gree of baron , which the grand duke of Weim ar wrought out , as the biographer expresses it , au8wirkte , for Schiller , of his own mere motion , was not an extravagant reward , though intended doubtless as a high distinction .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
