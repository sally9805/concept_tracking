txt ART . 1II. - */1 Tour in Germany , and some of the Southern Provinces of the Ilustrian Empire , in the years 1820 , 1821 , 1822 . By JOHN RUSSELL , Esq . Reprinted from the Second Edinburgh Edition . Boston , 1825 . Svo . PP. 469 . AT the close of our article on the subject of Universities , in the last number of the North American Review , we expressed voi*. xxvll. - No. 61. 41 // the intention of following up the general observations , contained hi that article , with a more particular account of the course of studics , pursued in seine one of the distinguished German institutions . This purpose we now proceed to execute ; although , for the most part , speaking in general terms , we have reference to one of the universities , as the principal object of our description , in order that we may he ahie to convey as correct and as distinct an idea as possible of the nature of these institutions . Besides , the limits of our observations exclude the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various academic institutions of the several German states . The name of the University of Gdttingen has , of late , become familiar to American ears ; and , for this reason , a delineation of it , drawn from direct and authentic sources , may be acceptable to some of our readers . It is this institution , of which Napoleon observed , that it did not helong to any particular state , nor to Germany alone , but to the whole of Europe . the public funds for the maintenance and increase of the university of Gdttingen are in the hands of a board of overseers ( c'uratoriurn ) , who constitute a branch of the state government . They are the depository of the statutes and laws and make additions and alterations , whenever the academic body recommends it as expedient in the minute reports which are regularly communicated to the government . The academic body is consulted on any question respecting their own laws and their opinion is adopted and executed by the overseers . Professors and other officers are appointed on the same principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two counsellors and a secretary , who must be lawyers of great practical ability , appointed by the curatorium ; and of eighteen members , taken from the academic body , three from the theological , four from the from the medical , and eight from the philosophical faculty . In extraordinary circumstances , the number of the members is sometimes increased . The prorector or rector ( president ) presides in the senate , which he has authority to convoke . Common affairs are transacted by circular letters . The administration of justice , which extends over all the instructers , students , pastors , and other academic officers , is committed to the vigilance of deputies appointed from the body of the senate , namely , the prorector , the lour ( leans of the four faculties , and the two counsellors . If the prorector is not a lawyer , the ex-dean of the Ic al faculty // assists him . The nature and importance of the business to be trausacted determine the number of meetings held by these deputies . Common cases , as those referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in session twice a xveek , and consists of the prorector , the two counsellors , and the secretary , whose laborious task it is to keep a minute record of the proceedings of the court . The laws of the police , which , however , do riot refer to the students , are superintended by three professors , and four magistrates of the city , which contains about nine thousand inhabitants . The deans of the four faculties , namely , of divinity , law , medicine , and philosophy , ( who are annually appointed by rotation from that portion of the professors who have a seat in the senate ) preside at the examinations and public disputations , confer the academic honors on the candidates , and conduct all the concerns of their respective faculties . The charge of the prorector is semiannual , or annual , under the repeated sanction of the government . The time of his office may , however , be prolonged whenever circumstances require it . The prorector may also be dean of his faculty , if the duties of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senate , according to the established rank of the four faculties . The new prorector is appointed six weeks before he enters upon his actual duties ; but is , from the hour of his appointment , entitled to a seat in the court of justice . The complicated nature of his duties requires the quickest perception , great versatility of mind , a thorough knowledge of the world , and a sober judgment , sharpened by long experience . Intimate acquaintance with the established laws of the country , and the strictest integrity and firmness of character , are sufficient for the judge of any other tribunal ; but the qualifications necessary to render a prorector equal to the importance of his station are much more comprehensive . He regulates and superintends all the motions of the powerful engine ; without his direction , the machinery either stops , or is in disorder . One rash decision , one indiscreet expression of the prorector , may , notwithstanding the honest exertions of the senate , or even of the state-government , produce the most pernicious consequences , with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of his executive power , he pronounces sentence in questions previously discussed by the two counsellors , whose office is permanent , au ( l whose codperation in deciding law questions is of paramount // importance to him ; and , besides , he has to perform the duties of a public instructor . The - causes that render the administration of justice in the German universities one of the most difficult tasks , arise , principally , from the circumstance , that the students have been educated in different institutions and under different forms of government , from which different associations and different national prejudices are inseparable . A large majority ( generally two thirds ) of the literary population of Gdttingen , are foreigners , that is , such as do not belong to the states of Hanover , Brunswick , and Nassau . Pride of ancestry , high rank , national boast , national descent , and other like distinctions , must submit to the same laws of fair equality , which bind the middling classes . Hence frequent jealousies and a conflict of passions arise , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great number of the students also contributes to increase the difficulties . For although the government acts upon the sound principle , that academic prosperity depends rather on the industry and moral habits , than on the number of the students , yet this often exceeds fifteen hundred . If the decisions of the prorector bear the slightest mark of partiality , or if any weakness be discovered in his character , this motley community becomes unmanageable . The dignity of a magistrate and the authority of a parent must constantly combine to sanctify his authority . The law respecting matriculation requires of home students a certificate of their attainments and moral character . Foreigners are only required to exhibit their passport . Examinations for admission and divisions into classes are unknown . Recitations from text-books are very unpopular . Frederic the Great once persuaded the professor of philosophy at Halle to cause his hearers to recite from Locke 's Essay concerning Human Understanding . ' TI singular attempt produced as singular an effect . The students unanimously deserted the professor , on the ground that for such purpose they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the spirit of diligence ever active , obliges every home student to transmit a separate certificate of each course of lectures , furnished by the respective instructors , and signed by the president and secretary in the name of the senate . Farther to stimulate ambition , annual prizes are offered for the best dissertations written on difficult questions , relating to subsects within the departments of the four faculties , and also for the best sermon on a certain text . The proclamation of the victors in these intellectual games occasions the only public // solemnity celebrated by the whole university , there being neither annual commencements , nor exhibitions of any kind . Every one pursues that course of studies which be or his friends may deem best adapted to his particular purposes . The academic year is divided into two equal terms , at the close of each of which a catalogue of lectures to be delivered during the ensuing season is published . The lectures are either public ( which are gratuitous ) , or private ( for certain fees ) , or privatissima , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public lectures are given by public professors , cx officio , once or twice a week , but they have , of late , fallen almost into disuse . A regular course of private lectures is generally confined to one term , five or six being delivered in a week . Lectures , however , on the Pandects , on anatomy , ecclesiastical history , and some other subjects , are delivered two and sometimes three times a day , or are continued through more than one term . The average number of courses of lectures on all branches of science and art is one hundred , in addition to those delivered by private instructers . Most lectures are accompanied by manuals , for the double purpose of facilitating , by a general synopsis of the subject , the private studies of the hearer , and of sparing him the trouble of taking copious notes ; a practice of which the benefit is unquestionable in regard to some sciences , but problematical in regard to others . The great value of such manuals may be conceived from Mr Bancroft 's faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /lntiquity , a fair specimen of this rich department of German academic literature . Another extensive branch of lectures , also , is formed by the Encyciojpccdias of the various sciences . Encyclopredia ( b ' *o%W* *rw*dc* or *y vx*og 7wLc*mux ) originally implied the complete course or circle of a liberal education in science and art , as pursued by the young men of Greece ; namely , gymnastics , a cultivated taste for their own classics , music , arithmetic , and geometry . European writers give the name of eneyclopeedia , in the widest scientific sense , to the whole round or empire of human knowledge , arranged in systematic or alphabetic order ; whereas the Greek imuports but practical school knowledge . The literature of the former is voluminous beyond description , it having been cultivated from the beginning of the middle ages to the present day . Different fromn either of them is the encyelopcedia of the German universities ; this is an introduction imito the several arts and sciences , showing the nature of each , its extent , utility , relation // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of pursuing it , and the sources from whence the knowledge of it is to be derived . An introduction of this compass is , however , with greater propriety styled eneyclopedia and methodology . Thus we hear of separate lectures on encyclop*dias and methodologies of divinity , jurisprudence , medicine , philosophy , mathematical sciences , physical science , the fine arts , and philology . Manuals and lectures of this kind are exceedingly useful for those who are commencing a course of professional study . For the best way to learn any science , ' says Watts , is to begin with a regular system , or a short and plain scheme of that science , well drawn up into a narrow compass . ' The whole circle of knowledge , taught in a university , has been brought into a system , and is ranged in two grand divisions , namely , anthropological sciences , representing man in all his intellectual and moral faculties ; and ontoiogical sciences , embracing all external objects . Each of these extensive empircs contains four departments ; the former contains philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , mathematics , physics , natural history , and technology . Our limits prevent a specific enumeration of the subdivisions included under these several heads , but it is thus the contemplative mind of the philosopher arranges the empire of knowledge . In regard to the practical interests of life , however , the comparative value of the several sciences appears in a different light . Here the relative importance of the learned professions must he taken into consideration . And it is the object of a German university , as we have mentioned above , to furnish professional students with all the means and facilities of attaining a familiarity with those sciences , which they intend to practise in civil life , for the benefit of society and for the welfare of the state . Besides these professional studies , all the auxiliary branches of learning are placed within the student 's reach , and enable him to develepe all the faculties of his mind , whatever they be , to improve his taste for literature , to cultivate the feelings of his heart , and to polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen his body , and a consistent and unyielding discipline averts all imminent dangers , menacing destruction to the spirit of harmony and peace , without which the best constitution is useless . On the other hand , effective measures are taken to encourage mental activity and studious habits , as the best 1 ) rotectors of virtue and good morals . How far practice // ought to assist and illustrate theory , depends upon the nature of the different sciences and arts . Let practice , here , be subordinate to theory ; but let theory be as distinct and perfect as time and circumstances admit . Empirical knowledge has no rational ground , and from this cause can never find favor in institutions founded on philosophical principles . Yet experiments , which either accompany or follow a plain exposition of theories , are indispensable to the understandin6 of medical , physical , and some of the mathematical sciences . An anatomical theatre , a hospital , and other clinical institutions for the practice of medicine and surgery ; an establishment for the uractice of obstetrics ; a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &amp;c. , for the illustration of the materia medica , are necessary for medical pursuits . An observatory with the best astronomical instruments must assist and encourage the study of astronomy ; the instructor in natural philosophy and other physical sciences must have the use of an apparatus , and of a sufficient number of instruments , and collections of natural curiosities . Chemistry is to be studied in a laboratory with an extensive apparatus ; and botany can not be studied without a botanical garden . Above all , an ample library must furnish a general and liberal access to the best works of all ages and civilized nations . instruction in the fine and useful arts ought to be confined to theories and histories alone . Practical information belongs to separate academies , which are flourishing in every part of Germany . The study of languages , both ancient and modern , and of their literature , is of great moment to a university , whose aim it is to manifest the power arid energy of the mind in whatever tongue genius has spoken . Hence , Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the principal languages of Europe must be taught thoroughly . The rank of the four faculties , which is the same in all the German universities , indicates the importance , which is attached to each of them , in relation to the interest and happiness of civil society . The established order is , divinity , jurisprudence , medicine , and philosophy . The last constitutes the most numerous faculty , since it embraces all the sciences and arts , which , properly , do not belong to the three professions , and hence are counted among the auxiliary studies . In order to show the tendency , extent , and l ) resent condition of all of them , we find it necessary to give a brief account of each one separately . // 1 . Theology . The authenticity of the Scriptures , and the sacred truths of Christianity rest upon the firm basis of biblical criticism and exegesis , by the invincible force of which the Reformation obtained that splendid triumph over the abuses , which had grown for centuries upon Christendom , and restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity . The accuracy and certainty , with which German theologians have established the principles of interpretation , and their persevering industry , stimulated by an elevated spirit of research and free inquiry , have finished the work so nobly commenced by protestantism . A new period in the history of the New Testament begins with Griesbach 's laborious collations of ancient manuscripts . The historical and critical interpretation of the Old Testament has received a better direction from the skill of Rosenmueller , Gesenius , and others . Eichhorn has commenced a new era in the historical criticism of the Old Testament . Ecclesiastical history has never been treated with more conscientious accuracy than in the present age , by Schmidt , Jlencke , Vater , and Planek . Doctrinal theology , and the system of christian morals and ethics , have been illustrated with uncommon zeal and profound learning by Reinhardt , De Wette , Stacudlin , and others . An exact knowledge of theology manifests itself in the systematic order , which must prevail in the arrangement of all its parts . Nothing else but an intimate acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote so desirable an object . Philological study , therefore , must impart to the young divine , habits of discrimination , and distinctness of thought , in order to prepare him for the duties of his high vocation . Copious lectures on the Greek text of the four Gospels , and on the other parts of the New Testament , are delivered by several professors , and form , in all the German universities , a course of two years . Separate introductory lectures are besides given on the history of the Bible , and on the characters of the writers of the Old and New Testament . A course of grammatical and explanatory lectures on the Hebrew text of the historical books , the Psalms , Isaiah , Job , and other parts of the Old Testament , lasts generally two years . Those who intend to become more familiar with the spirit of the Old Testament , pursue , besides the Hebrew grammar and antiquities , the study of other Oriental languages , as the Arabic and Syriac . An encyclopmedia of theology bives the student a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their most prominent // features , and accompanied by a brief history of the different doctrines , their literature , and the modes of studying them . Ecclesiastical history , sometimes connecte ( l with the literary history of theology , is communicated to the student in a course of lectures , which is seldom completed in less than two terms . Moral theology follows next in order . Doctrinal theolo*y , which , in Germany , is designated by the name of dogmatics contains all the doctrines of the New Testament , illustrated , proved , and arranged in a system . Comparative theology shows the changes , which the doctrines of christianity have suffered under the different creeds of the established churches and religious sects . Lectures on this interesting subject are among the last which the advanced student attends . r* he study of education as a science is of prime importance to divines , since they officiate as instructers for several years subsequent to the completion of their academic course , and since the religious education of children , till their fourteenth year , is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminaries , established in most of the universities , instruct a certain number of students , during the last year of their professional course , in practical theology , and exercise them in the performance of parish duties , in composing and delivering sermons , catechizing , &amp;c. 2 . German jurisprudence is a strange mixture of the most heterogeneous materials , which render this science exceedingly complicated ; so that uncommon talents are necessary to pursue the intricacies of the labyrinth , and to comprehend the whole science , in one full view , in its application to practical life . The study of the law in England and America suffers from similar difficulties . The different form of the administration , however , and the different state of the judiciary of the two countries just named , give greater encouragement to the practical lawyer , and raise him to a more conspicuous place of honor and emolument in public life , than a German practitioner can ever expect from the great labor he has spent in the study of his profession . The publicity of the courts is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical science in England and in this country . Yet Germany , though deprived of these political advantages , has , at all times , had lawyers of breat practical ability . The number of men , however , who have devoted their lives to deep researches into the single parts of jurisprudence , especially to the study of the civil code , is by // far greater . The literature relative to subjects of the Roman civil law extends with great accuracy and minuteness over all the particulars of that department , on which numerous lectures are given in the German universities . It is partly for this purpose that Englishmen frequent Germany , since the civil law is not included in the course pursued in the English law schools . Jurisprudence embraces the law of nature , sanctioned by reason alone , and the statute law ( called positive law by the Germans ) of the legislatures and municipalities of the several German states . hence arise three legal departments ; civil law in the widest sense , public law , and the law of nations . The civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the civil relations of private persons , is founded either on the principles of the Roman law , as ratified by the Emperor Jtistinian ; or on the German common law , composed of those customs and usabes , which have , by long prescription , obtained the force of laws ; or on the acts of the legislatures of the several states , as the statute law of Prussia , Saxony , or Bavaria . Subdivisions of this large department are , 1 . Feudal law , drawn from the feudal customs of the Lombards , from the common feudal system of all Germany , and from the acts of the several German states . 2 . Ecclesiastical law , founded upon the principles of the Corpus Juris Canonici ( canon law ) , upon the statutes of the Roman Catholic church , and of the Protestant church . 3 . Still smaller branches of this department are , the law of police , administration law , military law , commercial law , maritime law . 4 . Criminal law , derived from the criminal codes of Charles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the several states . 5 . Theory of civil and criminal procedure . Public law refers to the constitution and administration of states , and contains at present the laws sanctioned by the states after the dissolution of the German empire in 1806 ; the new principles established since the origin of the German confederation ; and , finally , the public acts of the several states . The law of nations forms the third part of jurisprudence , and consists of public treaties , and other positive regulations of the powers of Europe , in their political relations . Practical jurisprudence teaches the art of making up and keeping records in cases relative to the thren departments just mentioned ; it superintends the course of civil and criminal procedure ; and teaches the manner of making a quick and profitable use of written records . Atixiliary studies of the law are // languages , history , geography , statistics , antiquities , philosophy ( principally logic ) , political science , mathematics , and forensic medicine . An encyclop*edia and methodology of jurisprudence generally precede the study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his profession , and prepare him for attendance upon lectures on the Digests or Pa ndects ( the name properly given to one of the three parts of the Corpus Juris Civilis , the book of reference of several continental nations ) , which illustrate the system of the civil law , as still in practice . This is the most important and most extensive , but , at the same time , the most troublesome part of the professional course of a lawyer . Two , sometimes three hours a day , are devoted to these lectures , which every student endeavors to attend twice during the continuance of his academic career . The Digests are generally explained by more than one professor in the same term , before crowds of hearers . Besides the abovementioned snhjects of the three legal dol ) artff*ents , separate lectures are delivered on the philosophy of the German civil law , on the history and antiquities of the civil law of the Romans , on the literary history of jurisprudence , and on the principles of legal interpretation . 3 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncertain theories , or mere empirical knowledge , has , at l ) resent , founded its laws on the sound principles of the inductive philosophy , the glorious triumph of our age . rrhe writings in all its branches are numerous and valuable . Vienna and Berlin have advanced this science to a high degree of perfection , and the medical institutions of these cities are conducted on a very liberal scale , as may be perceived from the following plan of study . The auxiliary acquirements of the medical student generally consist of a competent knowledge of classical literature , history , rural economy , mathematics , philosophy , and belles-lettres . A professional course lasts four or five years , though the law in some parts of Germany prescribes only three . An encyclop*dia and methodology of medicine guide the student in distributing his time and arranging his studies . in connexion with this , he attends lectures on botany and vegetable physiology , which do not require great preliminary attainments , as , likewise , osteology and syndesmology . The other parts of anatomy are explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and natural // history form the next stage of the course . The next important subject is physioloay , accompanied by psychology or the philosophy of the human mind , anthropology , dietetic philosophy , and mineralogy . Thus the student is well prepared for attendance upon lectures on the morbid state of the human body , aud on the nature and treatment cf diseases . Pathology , therefore , which explains the symptoms , diagnosis , and morbid characters of diseases , materia medica , morbid and comparative anatomy , and psychiatry or treatment of the diseases of the mind , become in their order the subjects of his diligent attention . After this the various modes of curing diseases are discussed in copious lectures on therapy or therapeutics , on surgery , and on obstetrics . A separate course is generally devoted to the distempers of women and children , to ophthalmology , and to the anatomy and physiology of the human eye . At the same time the study of pharmacy ( pharmacology and toxicology are , for the most part , treated separately ) , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , the systems of nosology and semiology , or semiotics , are not neglected . Lectures on the last topic teach the result of the application of anatomy , physiology , and pathology , in the practice of medicine . Private instructors superintend the various societies that are formed every term for the purpose of reviewing the most important subjects of medicine . This exercise is styled repetitorium and exarninatorium ; or disputatorium , if it be a debating society . The last part of the academic course is devoted to the practical studies of medicine and manual surgery . Establishments and hospitals , superintended by professors of the university , afford the best opportunities for the practice of clinical medicine , clinical surgery , and obstetrics . The anatomical theatres and anatomical cabinets are conducted and used on an extensive l ) lan . In regard to practical surgery , a separate course of lectures is delivered on acuergy , or the demonstration of all the surgical operations , and the description and use of surgical instrumoms . There are also separate institutions for the education of veterinary surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , osteology , rnyology , and zo6pharmacology. 4 . Philosophy , as a science , investigates and ascertains the original laws of the human mind in its full activity , and thence proceeds to the noble contemplation of our Creator , the world , and the ( lestinatiOn of man . The scope of philosophy is wisdow and truth , which determine the laws and l ) rinciples of all // other sciences . The different modes chosen by genius , for the analysis of this problem , have produced the different systems of philosophy , to which , on the other hand , a strong desire of bursting the fetters of all systems has , at different times , been opposed . This desire , if prompted by the design of extending the spacious field of inquiry , becomes skepticism ( in the good sense of that term ) ; but , if led by an uncertain impulse of the feelings , and not kept within systematic bounds , it degenerates into mysticism . Wisdom , as the fairest fruit of philosophy , transfers her knowledge into practical life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and co6perates in the advancement of humanity . The mere knowledge of the form of a philosophic system , without freedom of thought , promoting the great interests of life , is of little utility . The laudable tendency of the present German philosophy , is to confirm by the explanation of the intellectual faculties , and by the discussion of the powers of reason , the eternal truths of religion and the practice of christian virtue . This direction is owing to the great reform of Kant , who , not satisfied with the material system of Spinoza , nor with the ideal speculations of Leibnitz , much less with the empiric philosophy of Bacon and Locke , was roused by Hume s skepticism , and struck out a new light in his philosophy of pure reason , which created dissatisfaction and opposition , and called into existence all the systems now taught in Germany . Thus Fichte 's science took its origin , and soon after it , the mystical philosophy of Schelling , with its various branches ; and the sounder speculations of Jacobi , which have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of philosophy is , by no means , uniform . Erlangen and Berlin are the seats of Schelling 's doctrine ; and G6ttingen has improved the system of Kant and Jacobi , whose own original views have created original thoughts in others . The common subjects of lectures on the several branches of speculative and practical philosophy , are the encyclopeedia of the philosophical sciences , logic , the fundamental doctrines of philosophy , metaphysics , psychology or the analysis and critical demonstration of the intellectual powers of man ; the philosophy of religion , the general history of philosophy , ancient and modern ; the latest systems of German philosophy ; a system of morals and ethics , of physical , moral , and intellectual education ; finally aesthetics , a favorite term with the Germans , first introduced by Baumgarten , and now in general use , designating the philosophy of the fine arts , poetry , and do // gant prose . This is one of the most useful and most popular subjects , on which lectures are given . Politics and government , the master topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , who represent the science in thr*e different points of view ; either as the constitution and administration of states , as they should be organized , according to the principles of practical philosophy ; or as the political history of states in their former rise , progress , and decay ; or as statistics , or the description of the states , which the world has now established for the maintenance of civil society . Political science gives an account of the constitutions of the states of Europe , and the administration of their external and internal relations , in reference to the legislative and executive power . The administration of the states is founded upon a very coinplicated system of police , that requires great vigilance and constant revision . The present political system of Europe has taken a new direction since the declaration of the Holy Alliance ( in 1815 and 1816 ) , that government must be founded on Christian principles , and on the general law of nations . Many of the political publications since that period , have had a very salutary tendency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant and sincere . Whether this was its real character , or whether it was a mere pretence , will soon become manifest . From these few remarks , the nature of the academic lectures on politics and statistics may easily be determined . They are delivered regularly in each university , by several professors , who follow their own courses . Standard works on politics drawn from history , the rich source of political wisdom , are Heeren 's Reflections on the Politics of the principal Nations of Antiquity , ' and his classic History of the System of the European States . ' A course of lectures on politics comprises national economy , political economy with its history , finances , the system of police , statistics , and the diplomacy of Europe . The pure mathematics , throughout all the branches , have , on account of the preference given in Germany to the purely analytic methods , yielded brilliant results to the studious scholar . Both pure and practical mathematics afford useful and very popular subjects for lectures , a regular course of which is generally completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate lectures , are , the elements of arithmetic , and analysis of finite and infinite quantities ; differential calculus , or analysis of infinitesimals , and integral calculus ; algebra , geometry , ge* // odesy , analytic planimetry upon the principles of algebra , spherical trigonometry ; higher mechaflies ( namely , statics , hydraulics , and a&amp;onamics ) , optics , astronomy , chronology , gnomonics , civil architecture , and navigation . Besides these , separate lectures are delivered on cosmography ; on physical astronomy , also in reference to chronology , geography , and navigation ; on the theory of the motions of comets , on the theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies in elliptic orbits , and on the use of astronomical instruments ; lastly , on meteorology and the theory of the earth . It is generally confessed , that the application of physical science to the useful arts , has , in the present age , benefited life and promoted its practical interests , more than any other kind of knowledge . Besides , it wonderfully developes the mental faculties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom of the Supreme Being . For this reason , the universities supply ample opportunities for the study of this science , which is pursued by students of all professions . The subjects of lectures are , natural history in all its branches , zoology , entomology , botany , mineralogy , and the description of its various systems , called systematology ; geology and oryctology , treated separately ; natural philosophy and chemistry , accompanied by experiments ; agriculture and rural economy ; physical geography ; technology . The large cities of Germany , and of other parts of continental Europe , contain excellent academies for the study and practice of the fine arts . The lectures , therefore , delivered in universities on this subject , convey general information to a mixed audience . The favorite topics are areha ? ology , or the critical explanation and philosophy of the fine arts of antiquity , namely , architecture , statuary , sculpture , painting , etc. connected with their history ; the theory and history of the fine arts of modern Europe , and of each art separately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory and history of music . The study of history is extensively cultivated in all the universities . The history of the states of antiquity ; general history of mankind ; history of modern Europe and its colonies ; ethuography ( or the description of the physical peculiarities of the different nations of the globe ) , in connexion with geography ; the history of the middle ages ; the history of Germany ; literary history of modern Europe ; critical history of German literature , and other similar topics are common subjects on which separate lectures are delivered . // Philology , or the study of classical antiquity in all its political , civil , and scientific relations , includes a correct grammatical knowledge of the ancient languages ; hermeneutics , or the art of comprehending and interpreting the works written in these languages ; criticism , which investigates and ascertains the age , correctness , and authenticity of every author , whether entire or mutilated , the complete number of whom is ahout sixteen hundred , excluding the fathers of the church ; the principles of composition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks and Romans . The chief auxiliary branches of philology are , ancient cosmography , divided into fabulous geography , historical geography , and topography ; the general history of the nations of antiquity , connected with chronology and historical criticism ; Greek and Roman antiquities ; mythology ; history of the philosophy and other sciences of the Greeks and Romans ; critical history of the fine arts , poetry , and elegant prose of Greece and Rome ; archaeology , or a knowledge of the relics of the fine arts and monuments of Greece and Rome , in connexion with epigraphics or the knowledge of inscriptions , and numismatics or the knowledge of ancient coins ; the history of philology ; and , finally , philosophical criticism , discussing the comparative merits of classical writers . On each one of these single branches , separate lectures are given during the period of the common academic course in Germany . An encyclopa*dia of philological pursuits , of which a number of manuals have been published , serves as a proper introduction into this extensive science . Oriental philology has derived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular lectures on the grammar , literature , and history of the Hebrew , Syriac , Chaldaic , Arabic , Aramaic , and Persian languages , new elementary lectures are given on the Sanscrit tongue , formerly spoken in Hindostan . There is generally a single professorship of the Oriental dialects . In some nnwersities , however , as in Berlin and Munich , a separate chair is filled by the professor of Sanscrit literature . This study was first introduced into Germany by A. W. Schlegel , professor in the Prussian university at Bonn ; and by his younger brother , F. Schlegel , now residing at Vienna ; both of whom have for some time been publishing a journal for Sanscrit literature . The number of students who attend such lectures is small , and consists generally of those who wish to prepare themselves to become candidates for professorships of those languages . // There is a great supply of critical and historical knowledge on classic authors , which is regarded in the German schools as the basis of all solid improvement ; and justly so , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their literature . A competent portion of it is necessary for a learned theologian , very important for a systematic lawyer , indispensable for a scientific physician , and no acute philosopher ever neglects it . Its absence would be severely felt in Europe , and cause a great revolution in the whole system of every profession , and produce a violent change in the literary world ; for which there is no occasion at present , or , if the necessity of an innovation was really felt , it could not be accomplished for ages to come . Since the Latin tongue is used in the examinations and disputations of all the faculties ; and since dissertations and all other performances of the professors , candidates , and students in their relative duties , must be written in that language , every student is anxious to continue and cultivate an acquaintance with the faithful companions of his early life , by attending , during the course of his professional studies , to lectures on ( dassic writers . Such a familiarity is so much the more necessary for a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law systems of continental Europe , and the canon law , are studied in no other language than the original . A profound knowledge of Christianity , and of the sacred literature of the Jews , can be derived only from the Critical study of the original text of the Holy Bible . The scientific phraseology of the medical , physical , and other sciences , and the numerous essays thereupon , will ever remain a secret to the student who is without a knowledge of the Greek . The works of the Greek poets , commonly read and explained , are the two poems of Homer , the writings of Hesiod , Pindar , the Gnomic authors , the epigrammatists , *schylus , Sophocles , Euripides , Aristophanes , Theocritus , and Apollonius Rhodius . The study of the Greek historians , philosophers , critics , and biographers , keeps pace with the explanation of the poets . Herodotus , the father of history , often attracts a considerable number of hearers . Thucydides is a greater favorite with the professors than with the students . The conciseness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible to all but a few young men of superior talents ; and the brief severity of his judgment , however excusable in an author describing the civil war of his own country , in which he had endangered himself , voL. xxvll. - No. 61. 43 // does not please the majority , even after the profuse amplificalion of the interpreters . The attic urbanity of Xenophon has at all times been admired . rJ7he power of sound argument , and the Socratic art of reasoning called dialectic , are best learned from the writings of Plato . Competent judges have asserted , that they have derived greater benefit from the critical study of one of his Dialogues , than from a course of lectures on logic . Aristotle 's abstruse works are at present rarely expounded in academic lectures . Oratory furnishes the best means of arriving at civil and political distinction . A man , however great his genius , and however useful and thorough his knowledge may be , will never attract attention without this art . It is , indeed , not necessary that a man should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate the practice of the art ; but there has never yet been an eminent speaker , without severe study and constant application . The greatest orator that ever harangued freemen , acquired this art only hy the most unwearied and long continued efforts . The intelligent study of Demosthenes as , in every respect , the best pattern , has always led to great results . His example teaches to speak with propriety and elegance , and his speeches exhibit all the requisites of truly popular eloquence . Concise with the greatest perspicuity ; perspicuous with the greatest accuracy ; accurate with the greatest purity of language , be inst*ntIy arrests the attention , persuades by the invisible power of argument , assisted by all the graces of manner , and thundered out with flashes of genius . It is for this reason , that distinguished statesmen of every age and country , have studied his works and honored his memory . The national glory of Great Britain rests , in no small degree , on the refined taste and classical education of her politicians ; and the portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears the greatest resemblance to the spirit of Demosthenes . Among the continental neighbors of England , especially among the Germans , there are fervent admirers of Demosthenes , who read and illustrate his orations with enthusiasm . They feel the rush of his noble spirit in their closets and leeture-rooms , and pour it forth upon their youthful hearers , in whose minds it excites congenial feelings ; but it soon evaporates for want of nutriment from practical life . In a country , where this vivifying principle pervades the whole nation , and forms its very soul , the impulse imparted by the judicious study // of such an orator , would not be lost ; it would call forth genius , and guide it to excellence ; an effect , which all the books ever written upon oratory and delivery are incapable of producing . Time and circumstances , which exert a most powerful influence over every country , would raise this practice heyond mere imitation , and stamp an original character upon the eloquence grounded on this basis . All true greatness has always been the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all civilized nations is a safe criterion of genuine greatness . The orations of Lysias , and the speeches , discourses , and rhetorical essays of Isocrates , are still of value ; though they suffer by a comparison with Demosthenes , and for this reason are not apt to be overrated . The treatise of Aristotle on the Art of Poetry , and that of Longinus on Sublimity , are in high estimation with German scholars , who endeavor to discover new beauties , and carefully point them out in new commentaries . Frequent reference is made to them ; hut they seldom form a subject for separate lectures . The Lives of Plutarch , with his Moral essays , ought not to remain unknown to any youth of a liberal education . The department of Roman eloquence is also under the care of ahle professors . The most acceptable are the public and private illustrations of authors , who have some immediate relation to the four professions ; as Cicero de Legibus , in a legal point of view , for law students ; Celsus , for physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Finibus Bonorum et . Malorum , and other philosophical essays of the same writer , for students of philosophy and divinity , or more generally for a miscellaneous audience . Numerous lectures on other books of Cicero , such as his historical treatises , the treatise de Oratore , Brutus , and the Orator , convey general information to the hearers . In like manner , the two classic dramatists , Plautus and Terence , are explained with all the profuseness of philological learning . Select parts of the didactic poem of Lucretius , the Epicurean , de Rerum . JVaturd , flowing from the fulness of a poetic soul and vivid imagination , are sometimes read , but not regularly . More common are the lectures on the Satires and Epistles of Horace . Virgil 's didactic , pastoral , and epic poetry , and Livy 's hi story , are generally confined to schools . The native simplicity and elegiac sensibility of Tibullus , the Grecian imagery of Propertius , and his brilliant allusions to lost glory , are much relished. // Tacitus awakes the mind to reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perusal of his works is , therefore , productive of a good moral effect . Quintilian 's Oratory yields an abundant harvest to the assiduous Latin scholar . Pliny 's epistolary style is still attractive , notwithstanding the perfection to which this branch of literature has been carried in modern times . Some have a predilection for the historical epics of Lucan and Sums Italicus , and frequent the halls in which they are read ; others prefer the heroic poem of Valerius Flaccus on the Expedition of the Argonauts ; but few are fond of the circumstantial bombast of Claudian . The bitter sarcasm and the moral lashes of Persius and Juvenal , who , with Horace , their predecessor , have composed almost the only original part of Roman literature , are topics of frequent academic discussions . There are three or more professorships of classical literature , established in each university . The first chair is filled by the professor of poetry and eloquence , a member of the philosophical faculty , and by virtue of this , competent to officiate , in his turn , as rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orations at the public solemnities ; the number of which varies in the different universities . It is he that invites to these solemnities by Latin programs , or brief discussions on any literary si*bject , especially referring to antiquity . It is lie that addresses the students in the semiannual catalogues of lectures . It is , also , his duty to prepare Latin poems ( either in elegiac verse or in the metres of horace ) on extraordinary occasions , a class of productions containing some specimens of great merit . The same professor , assisted by two of his colleagues , conducts the philological seminary . This consists , in most of the universities , as in G6ttingen , Berlin , Jena , and Leipsic , of only nine members , who , according to the law , continue but two years as such , and then retire , to make room for the aspirants , whose number is not limited , and sometimes equals that of the actual members , and who perform precisely the same duties . The laws oblige them to attend the daily exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , under the direction of one of the professors . They perform these duties in the same succession in which they became either members or aspirants , after a previous examination in any Greek author , held in the Latin tongue by the principals of the seminary . The first member has , besides , to read , at the commencement of each term , a Latin introduc // tion of his own composition ( for everything is transacted in this tongue ) , relating to the Greek or Roman author , who is to he publicly interpreted by all the members and aspirants , for the benefit of all those who wish to partake of the advantages which the seminary offers to all . The directors distribute among themselves the supervision of the Greek and Latin de .. partments , and the discussions of the disputants and opponents . Each member and each aspirant writes , every term , one , or sometimes two dissertations , on any subject of antiquity , history , or philosophy , one copy of which is handed to the professor , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks the author either weak or mistaken . Honor and emoluments attend the members of this classic fraternity ; and the best success often crowns their exertions . They are eagerly sought for as instructers of the gymnasia ; or the university itself offers them employment as private teachers , till , through the faithful performance of these duties and literary distinctions thus acquired , public favor is secured ; which soon raises them to stations worthy of their character , talents , and attainnents . The benefits resulting to the public from such institutions are inestimable . They impart to the student a scientific knowledge of the profession he is going to practise as teacher , form his character and habits as such , by causing him to study the art of communicating his ideas in the simplest and most engaging manner , to shape and to finish the thoughts of his pupil according to his own model , and to instil into his tender mind those delicate and elevated feelings of honor , which are the best safeguard against illiberality of opinion , and against the abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , find the most powerful promoters at the universities , and are cultivated through life . Seminaries , on a larger scale , for the education of popular teachers , are conducted by distinguished divines of each state , who , for the most part , reside in the capital , and are the same persons who examine each clergyman three times before his ordination . Unless a candidate can give evidence of his ability , and of , at least , a two years ' stay in those popular institutions where religious instruction is the main object , he is not allowed to teach any branch of knowledge whatever . We can not now enter upon the particulars of these seminaries , they being beyond the limits of our present discussion . //
