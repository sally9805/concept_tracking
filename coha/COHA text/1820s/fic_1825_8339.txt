Percival , James Gates , 1795-1856 : ODE , TO BE SUNG AT THE DINNER ON THE FOURTH OF MARCH , IN HONOR OF THE ELECTION OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS , TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES from Ode 1825 WRITTEN BY J. C. PERCIVAL . To the HEROES , who dared to sever Our chains , let the bowl go round ;  --  Here they stood  --  and this hall forever We will worship as holy ground . They have wreathed their names with glory Their spirit inspires us yet ;  --  Their fame shall be bright , in story , With a light that shall never act . To the GALLANT SOULS , who perished On Bunker 's sacred hill ;  --  Let their deeds be fondly cherished ; Let us worship their memory still . Let a pillar of glory brighten The spot where their blood was shed ;  --  And the stars of freedom lighten The tomb of the sainted dead . To the NOBLE HEART , who ventured Alone on the dangerous sea ;  --  And with youthful ardour entered The ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cross the ocean , Our sons shall ne'er forget To fill , with deep devotion , One round to the good FAYETTE . To the God-like MAN , who founded The Temple our hearts adore , Whose arch , like the sky , unbounded , Shall bend over every shore ;  --  To the Sage , whose hand united In rearing the glorious shrine ; Whose setting sun is lighted Still bright , in its last decline :  --  To Him , who alike inherits The name , and the place , of his sire ;  --  Who has won the rank he merits , By a vigour that can not tire :  --  Let the hearts of New-England cherish His high , and well-earned fame ; Till a glory , that can not perish , Be gathered around his name .
