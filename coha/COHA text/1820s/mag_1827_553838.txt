txt ART . VIII. - dmerica ; or a General Survey of the Political Situation of the several Powers of the Western Continent , with Conlectures on their future Prospects . By A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES , Author of Europe , ' &amp;c . Philadelphia . H. C. Carey &amp; 1 . Lea . 1827 . THE appearance of this work has been expected with no inconsiderable degree of interest . It was generally supposed that a volume from the pen of the author of ' Europe , ' whatever other qualities it might possess , could scarcely fail of being an ingenious and elegant production , and this expectation has been amply verified in the present instance . We believe that this work will be generally considered as a valuable accession // order to appreciate its merits in this respect , to coincide in all the opinions and views which it contains . The subject , which our author has selected , independent of his other weighty claims on our attention , is sufficient to re* commend his remarks to a careful perusal . Our attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in some degree proportioned to the frequency , with which she is presented to our thoughts ; and an able and elegant treatise on her condition and prospects , may contain much that is open to dispute , and yet be hi*hly valuable to our fellow citizens , on account of the reflections which it suggests , and the feelings which it tends to cherish . The style , in which this work is written , would alone warrant us in placing it as a mere literary production in the highest rank of English classics . It is a style equally free from the meretricious ornament so prevalent in our own country ; and from the colloquial roughness which distinguishes many of the ablest British authors of the present time . It affords a striking proof that vigorous thoughts lose nothing of their power , by being embodied in harmonious language , that a style by being easy does not cease to be energetic , that a lively imagination can utter all its conceptions , without violating the purest simplicity . To our author and to Washington irving we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made in the present century to revive the Attic elegance which distinguished the best writers of the days of Addison , mingled in the case of our author with much of the energy of a more modern school . It has been the fortune of these accomplished writers to acquire a high and extensive celebrity beth at home and abroad , and we trust that the perusal of their works has not been wholly without its effect on the literary character of our country . Every candid mind must be convinced that whatever other causes may have impeded our progress in literature , a progress , which we have no disposition to exa*gerate , it has been neither a deficiency of talent , nor a total want ot ' the means of literary improvement . Both our autbor and Mr living are men born and educated in the United States , and we can not forbear to speak of the former as one of the alumni of our venerable university , and to ask whether this is not one ftct among many others , tending to place that institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been sometimes represe1*te ( l. // The motives which led to the production of this work may be learned from a perusal of the following concluding remarks . It is time , however , to conclude these reflections . Notwithstanding the disclaims I have made of Utopian dreams and baseless theories of all kinds , I am aware that some persons ( who would perhaps regret to see them realized ) will charge even the most moderate anticipations , in which I have ventured to indulge , with exaggeration . I can only say that I have advanced no conjectures , without giving what I think good reasons for them ; and that if the latter cnn be refuted , I am quite prepared to abandon the former . Other persons perhaps may doubt the expediency of holding up these favorable pictures of our own institutions , and future prospects . Why nourish in this way , they may say , a national vanity already perhaps sufficiently exalted ? If we are really a favored and prosperous nation , let us rather thank God for it , and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignity of other less fortunate communities , by empty boasting . If we occupy a high and commanding stand in the political system , let us not , by indiscreetly vaunting our strength and advantages , induce other governments to attempt to deprive us of them . In these remarks , there is some degree of force ; and I should regret to be considered , by competent judges as having passed the line of discretion in speaking of the political importance and Ibture greatness of our union . But in oider to appreciate fully the value of our liberty , it is absolutely necessary that we should , in the first place , correctly estimate the advantages for which we are indebted to it ; and in order to discharge our duties as a nation , we must know our precise position as such , in the system of which we form a part . On both these subjects there are various opinions . Some deny that our liberty has contributed at all to our progress in wealth and greatness . Others contend that we have nothing to do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my opinion , of dangerous tendency , and I have endeavored , in the course of the preceding work , to prove their incorrectness . If I have represented the government as occupying a lofty station among the leading powers of the world , it has been with a view of impressing upon the minds of our rulers and of the nation , the deep responsibility under which they act , in consequence of the immnense influence , which is necessarily attached to their position , and which they must exercise even in refusing to exercise it . If I have presented a flattering image of our present situation and future prospects , it has been for the purpose of showing more distinctly the inestimable worth of the political institutions which have made us what we are . Should one or both of these great // objects be in any way effected , I shall think myself , I will not say rewarded for the trouble of writing this work , which has been to me a pleasure , labor ipse voluptas , but fully satisfied with its success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these views , the principal part of this work is devoted to the consideration of the condition and prospects of the United States , viewed as one member of the great family of civilized and christian nations , which occupies , with some slight exceptions , the whole of Europe and America . These nations are divided into three classes . 1 . Those communities which are governed upon the despotic system . In this class are placed those of the abovementioned communities , which inhabit the continent of Europe and its dependencies . Of this class Russia is represented as the leading and ruling state , while France , Austria , Prussia , and the remaining nations of the continent , are considered as in a condition of virtual subjection to her immense military power , or to borrow our author 's happy expression , as crushed beneath the giant mass of this political colossus . ' 2 . Great Britain is represented as constituting , together with her dependencies , a second class of powers . In our author 's opinion these dependencies are destined , at no very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the connexion between them , as it is not founded on principles either of right or policy or permanent and lasting power , must be considered as accidental and transitory . Great Britain herself is described as in a state of transition from tyranny to freedom , as exhibiting the elements of despotism and liberty , in a condition of action and incessant warfare . 3 . Our author 's third class is composed of those nations , which live under free and popular governments , and comprises the republics of the Western Continent . At the head of these he places our own country , which enjoys the proud distinction of taking the lead in the great division composed of the various new nations that cover this continent , a lead , not assumed in arrogance and maintained by force , but resulting in the course of nature from priority of national existence , and secured by continual good offices done and to be done to our sister republics . ' Russia , Great Britain , and the United States are therefore , according to our author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized and christian world , and all the rest stand at present in an order secondary to one or the other of these . These are the views // laid down in our author 's first chapter , which also contains some spirited remarks respecting the comparative effect of despotic , free , and mixed governments respectively . We are prevented from quoting these remarks by their length , but shall have frequent occasion to refer to them in the course of our observations , and shall only observe , in passing , that in his picture of the situation of free and republican countries , our author has asserted respecting all the republics existing throughout America , ' ( see p. 21. ) what in our humble opinion can be truly predicated in its full extent of the United States alone . Having thus stated in his first chapter his leading opinions , our author devotes the remainder of his work to illustrating and enforcing them . We shall merely offer to our readers such cursory remarks , as have suggested themselves to us , on the perusal of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other power in Europe , but to all the powers of the European continent united , seems to be a favorite position of our author . It was maintained at some length in a former work , and is repeatedly brought forward in the present . We must beg leave now , as on a former occasion , to express a different opinion . We look in vain for proofs of this amazing preponderance . The power of Russia , great as it unquestionably is , seems to us far from sufficient to enable her to direct at will the movements of France , of Austria , or even of Prussia , still less to overcome their united forces . The memorable defeat of Napoleon in 1812 ( a defeat in which the rigors of a Russian winter had , at least , some agency ) may prove that Russia is impregnable to foreign invasion , but it proves nothing else . Who supposes that Alexander could have reached Paris in 1814 , unaided by his allies ? and who doubts that if the emperor of Russia should now attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equally certain and signal ? Indeed we can not readily conceive , how France , lately the mistress of Europe , can be considered as a mere secondary power , either to Russia , or to any other nation in the world . France contains within the compass of less than two hundred thousand square miles , upwards of thirty millions of inhabitants . Her population is perfectly homogeneous in its character , more enlightened than that of any other country , with the exception of Great Britain and the United States , and distinguished by fru*ality. industry , courage . and patriotism . // July , She is no less remarkable for her physical advantages , than for the magnitude and character of her population . The mildness of her climate enables her to devote large regions to the cultivation of the vine and olive , which would be absolutely sterile under a colder sky , and scarcely any country of equal size contains so small an extent of unproductive soil . She has already risen as if by magic from the state of extreme exhau*-tion , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 ) prosperity ; she is rapidly throwin0 off the burden of her public debt , and providing for the increase of her navy and her fortifications , with a liberality from which freer and more favored nations , might derive a useful lesson . A nation thus circumstanced has nothing to fear from the aggressions of any continental power . It is in her foreign possessions and on the ocean only , that she is vulnerable . These remarks are made simply from a regard for what seems to us to be the literal truth . We are no advocates for the late policy of the French government . The invasion of Spain was a measure , which can have excited only one feeling in the minds of all lovers of liberty or justice . The doctrine that the subject can derive no rights or immunities from any source but the liberality of the throne , that the king and not the people is the fountain of all rightful power , is one which we presume needs no comment . But we are none of those , who think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suspected of desiring what they believe . The power and resources of France are one thing ; the justice of her measures , the liberality of her rulers , and the freedom and happiness of her subjects , another . Believing , as we do , that she has nothing to fear from the force of Russia , we can not admit the correctness of our author 's assertion , at least in its full sense , that in overthrowing the Spanish constitution she acted under the influence , one might almost say under the compulsion , of that power ; nor can we allow that this triumph of bigotry and injustice over knowledge and liberty , deplorable as it was , warrants us in renouncing all expectation of any immediate improvement in the political condition of the nations of continental Europe . On the contrary , no future event seems to us more probable than the eventual progress of free principles and free institutions throughout those communities . To what degree , and in what mode , the systems of government now existing in these countries can be exchang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what abuses can be at once extirpated and what must be corrected by a more gradual process ; what degree of liberty can now be borne by nations , which have been long buried in ignorance , and how speedily they can be fitted for a higher state of political existence ; these are questions for those more immediately concerned , and not for us to settle . But the late efforts of the patriots of Spain to erect a constitutional monarchy , though frustrated by the united force of foreign arms and domestic treachery ; the establishment of a representative branch of government , and of the trial by jury in France ; the late signal defeats , experienced by the ministry of that country in their attempts to establish the law of primogeniture , and to restrain the liberty of the press ; the freedom with which political discussions have been carried on in the very centre of Europe ; and above all , the glorious struggle of the Greeks ; these and many facts of similar import constantly passing before our eyes in the European world , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge throughout Christendom can no longer be permanently arrested by any human agency ; and yon grey lines That fret the East are messengers of day . ' Great Britain is represented by our author , as we have already remarked , as in a state of transition , from a despotic to a popular government . We find , ' says he institutions existing together , which suppose the truth of directly opposite principles , and which , if they retain any real force , must lead of necessity to continual collision . A king , reigning by the grace of God , and a parliament , claiming and exercising the right of deposing him at pleasure ; an established church , with universal liberty of conscience and worship ; equality of rights , and hereditary privileges ; boundless prodigality in the public expenses , with a strict accountableness of all the agents ; with a thousand other incongruities of the same description . ' There is certainly much truth in this spirited picture , but it ought not to he forgotten that the British constitution , composed as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , be in most respects better adapted than any which can be devised , to things as they are . Nothing can be better said on this subject than the following reinark* of our author in his chapter upon South America . // In the United States , we hold nearly two millions of blacks in domestic slavery , while our senate chambers are daily echoing with our fervent protestations of zeal and affection for freedom under every color and aspect ! And reason good , for it is one thing to love liberty , and another to love desolation , slaughter , and universal uproar , which would be the consequence of a simultaneous and general emancipation of the blacks . Any ineasure , therefore , and most of all a measure so momentous as the establishment of a new constitution of government , is not necessarily politic and expedient , merely because it is favorable to libert ? , I , that is to the absence of restraint upon individuals . The absence of restraint in itself is a good thing , but the absence of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all government , and would of course afford no basis for any institutions . Restraint to a certain extent is everywhere necessary , and the degree to which it might be admitted , must be determined , as I have stated above , by considering not merely abstract notions and foreign examples , but also the state and condition of the people . The institutions which may be recommended by the former , can only be established with safety as far as they are also consistent with the latter . Any attempt to introduce others , however beautiful in theory , and however beneficial elsewhere , is dangerous . To say that it will certainly be ruinous or greatly injurious to the nation that makes it , would be going too far ; because we know that Providence often modifies the working of general causes , so as to bring good out of evil . Dangerous and imprudent such attempts certainly are , and it is the practice of men and nations , who pretend to wisdom , before they invoke the special intervention of Providence , to exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power and means , which the same Providence , operating through the general laws of nature , has placed at their disposal . pp. 190 , 191 . We do not therefore look for the establishment of a republican government in Great Britain , and it belongs not to us to say whether under present circumstances , such a measure would be desirable . The popular cause in that country has sometimes been supported in a mode far different from the calm and dignified course , which was pursued by the people of this country in the establishment of our own constitution , and by men of a far other character than those who composed the Congress of 1776 , and the Convention of 1787 . But though we expect no radical change , in any sense of the word , in the constitution of Great Britain , there is much in her presont system of government , which many of her wise and good // men are laboring , we trust not in vain , to extirpate . The change of public opinion in the Course of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a sufficient prcof of how much can be effected for the cause of truth in a country , where the press is unshackled. in the early part of the reign of George the Third , the royal authority was repeatedly exerted to invalidate acts passed by our colonial legislatures for the prevention of that traffic . We scarcely need mention in what light the slave trade is now regarded . This most signal triumph of the persevering efforts of the friends of justice and humanity , is , we confidentially believe , not destined to stand alone . It argues , we think , no very sanguine temperament , to believe that the Unitarians in Great Britain will not long he deharred from the rights of freemen , that the Catholics will soon experience at least a mitigation of their present Egyptian bondage , and that the necessity of employing seamen without paying them an adequate compensation for their services*will not always be held a sufficient justification for the most arbitrary violation of equal rights and personal liberty . The views of our author respecting the political prospects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many of our fellow citizens . It appears , ' he observes immediately at the close of those remarks in his fifth chapter , which we have quoted in another connexion , rather a doubtful point whether the establishment in Spanish America , of governments as popular as that of the United States was a measure recommended by the character and condition of the people , and of course whether these governments are likely to be equally durable and successful with ours . ' He afterwards observes , however , with great justice , that no foreigner probably possesses the information respecting the political situation of those immense regions , which would justi*r even a suggestion of the nature of the institutions that would suit them best . But though lie declines pronouncing any positive Opinion on the course pursued by the newly emancipated communities of South America , in the establishment of their respective constitutions , his chapter on this subject is highly interesting . It is written throughout with great ability , and throws much light , not only on the nature of the South American revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of the remarks on the subject of religion , we think will approve itself to every candid mind , for sound as well as // ingenious reasoning on the science of *overninent . XVe re* commend the whole of this chapter to the attentive perusal of our readers , and can not forbear extracting from it the passage relating to Bolivar , particularly on account of the excellent remarks with which it closes . We trust that they will not be without their effect in repressing that prostitution of great names , now so fashionable among political writers . The same remarks may be made upon the respective pretensions of Bolivar and Washington . The attempt to compare their is wholly premature . Bolivar is still in the midst of his career ; and although I have no disposition whatever to cherish the douhts respecting kis future conduct , which the enemies of liberty affect to entertain ; although I feel the fullest confidence that he will justify the hopes of the world , and terminate as he has commenced , the glorious mission which has been allotted to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the race is run . Long as he has labored in the cause of his countrymen , and much as he has done for them , he has one thing left to do , more difficult , if we may judge at least by its rarity , than all the rest ; and without which all the rest will go for nothing and worse than nothing . Lie has yet to show , that he knows the difference between true and false greatness , that is , between true greatness and a hoop of gold or a wooden seat covered with velvet . After subduing hostile enemies , he has yet to subdue ( if he is unfortunate enough to feel them ) the impulses of irregular ambition ; and this is the achievement which Cicero , in his splendid but unhappily wholly unmerited encomium on C*esar , declares to be the one which raises a man as it were above the level of humanity . The enemies of liberty in Europe , who judge of others by the consciousness they have of their own base and sordid sentimerits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his truncheon and descend to private life . For my part I see no reason whatever to suspect him . His whole conduct , as far as I am acquainted with it , has been patriotic and disinterested , and affords the happiest prognostics of his future course of life . When he shall have justified , as I have no doubt he will , these high expectations , we shall be able to pronounce a favorable opinion on his general character , and to class him with the few great commanders in free states , who have been at the same time heroes and friends of their country . Even then , however , before we can compare him with Washington , he must have rendered the most important services to his fellow citizens in the foundation and administration of their civil institutions , must have rescued them from monarchy , as he had redeemed them before from foreign bondage , must have held out to them the // graceful and edifying example of a private life corresponding in dignity and purity with the glory of his public career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable end . Death , says Burke , canonizes a great character , and we may add death only ; because nothing else can give us complete assurance , that the greatness we admire will be kept up without failure or fault to the last . To accomplish all this may not be so easy as Mr De Pradt , whose pen sometimes outruns his judgment , perhaps imagines . All this , however , must be done , before Bolivar can claim the honor of being a worthy and successful student in the school of Washington . Greater honor than this he need not wish , and can never under any circumstances aspire to . To place him at present above his illustrious master , is merely an idle exaggeration , and argues a very inadequate conception of the characters of both . In general the world and even his own countrymen have been somewhat too prone to raise up rivals and equals to our incomparable hero . Bonaparte was at one time the Washington of France ; Iturbide in his day was a Washington . Riego and Quiroga rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Washingtons of Spain . The name of the father of his country is too honorable a title to be lavished upon every bold adventurer , even in a cause apparently just . The world had been created nearly six thousand years , before the appearance of the first or rather the unique Washington , and it would be singular if half a dozen more should spring up like mushrooms within twenty years of his death . I would not be understood , however , to confound the name of Bolivar with those of the other pretenders to distinction , whom I have just mentioned . Should the close of his career correspond with its commencement , he will no doubt stand more nearly on a parallel with Washington , than any other character recorded in history . ' pp. 181-183 . The remarks on religion , to which we have alluded , extend from page 194 to page 203 . The following is the introductory paragraph . Without , however , pretending even to suggest an opinion as to what forms of government would be most suitable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision on this subject , it is not very difficult to perceive that there was one important element of political power , at their disposal , which did not exist at least to the same extent and in the same shape with us , which they have certainly not entirely neglected , but of which they might perhaps have taken greater advantage than they have done , in forming their institutions-I mean religion . It has been made by some an objection to the constitution of these new states , that they have adopted an established religion , and that // in some of them the exercise of any other is pi*ohibited under severe penalties . This latter clause is undoubtedly injudicious , at variance with policy as well as common humanity , and directly detrimental to the purpose which it is meant to promote . But as respects the former , instead of blaming the Spanish Americans for having done too much , I should rather be disposed to think that they had done too little ; and that the religious establishment , which they did not create , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faith , affection , and habits of the people , might have been employed , with great propriety and utility , as the mainspring and principal basis of the new political institutions . It does not belong to my purpose to state in detail what would have been in this case the modes of legislation and administration , or the names and functions of the principal magistrates . These are matters comparatively unimportant in all governments . But on this supposition , the great rule of assuming the existing state of things as the basis of the new fabric would have been observed , and at the same time an element of power been brought into action , not inferior perhaps in beneficial potenay to any other , and amply competent to keep in motion the machinery of any constitution . ' pp. 194 , 195 . Every reader in this country will agree that our author has not employed too strong terms of censure , to say the least , in speaking of the prohibition of the exercise of any but the Catholic religion , which we believe exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a clause could be introduced into the constitution of any state professing to he free , is a most strange phenomenon in political history , and is more calculated than all other circumstances put together , to excite fearful apprehensions for the future success of rational liberty in South America . The spirit which could dictate such a provision is not that which animated those sages and heroes of our own country , for whom the nations of South America profess , we doubt not sincerely , so deep a veneration . It is possible , however , that the number of Protestants in these nations may be so inconsiderable , that this prohibition , however absurd and unjustifiable , however inconsistent with the princion which these *overnments are avowedly founded , may pies b produce but little practical evil . But should the fact be otherwise , should there be a large body of citizens in the South American republics debarred by legislative enactments from exercising what has ever been considered by all reasonable men , as one of the clearest and most inalienable rights of every human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictates of his own conscience , the continuation of such tyrannical provisions must , and we hesitate not to say it ought to diminish , in no inconsiderable degree , the claims of those republics to the sympathy and respect of all free and enlightened nations . The mere establishment of a national church is a measure certainly less objectionable than that of which we have ust spoken , but differing from it more in degree than in quality . We believe that public sentiment in this country is directly at variance with our author 's opinion on this subject , that the South American nations , in adopting an established religion , have done too little rather than too much . ' We have yet to learn with what justice or consistency the tenets of a certain specified sect can be made an indispensable passport to the honors of a republican country , or how they can be rightfully supported and diffusod at the expense of Christians of other denominations . Our belief in the doctrine of the necessity of separating the church from the state is too firmly established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is ; and we can not agree with him , that such a separation does not exist in our own country . The sovereignty of church and state , says he , is united in the people . But whether ( admitting the entire correctness of this position ) this sovereignty can be exercised , in the opinion of the people of the United States , with equal propriety in both cases , is a question , upon which some light is thrown by the fact , that in the very instrument by which they established a civil government for the union , it is declared that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ' As little can we agree with our author in the remark , that our laws have hitherto wanted We advantages of a direct religious sanction . We suppose that men of every religious sect in our country assent to the correctness of the rule , that it is the religious duty of every citizen to obey all laws duly enacted by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scripture , to submit himself to every ordinance of men , for the Lord 's sake ' ; and what other sanction could be given to our laws by any church or priesthood of human establishment , we are utterly at a loss to know ; Seimus , et hoc nobis non alticis inseret Hammon . ' We are told that religion should have been made by the lawgivers of the South , the principle in forming their political // creations , in the same way that liberty was with us. ' ( p. 201 . ) We can not conceive in what way such a course could have been pursued without the *stablishinent of a national church ; but as we do not quite understand the su0gestiou , we shall hazard no farther remarks upon it . The greater part of this work is devoted , as we have before observed , to the consideration of the condition and prospects of our own country . With respect to our external policy , we cantiot perceive that our author recommends any material variation from the course hitherto pursued by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any entangling connexion with foreign nations . It is truly said that a complete abstinence from all intercourse with other countries is a plan which would be highly impolitic if practicable , and which has never been avowed or defended by any one . It must be equally considered , however , as one of the greatest benefits of our local situation , that we are almost entirely exempted from the necessity of interfering in the contentions of other states , in order to protect ourselves from unjust aggression , and that consequently such a necessity can rarely be made a pretext by ambitious and unprincipled statesmen , for engaging in war for purposes of mere aggrandizement . The balance of power , a phrase of magical efficacy elsewhere , is little else than an empty sound to us . The only instance in which the government of our country has manifested a strong interest in the internal policy of other nations , is in their conduct towards the newly formed republics of South America . What will be the nature of our connexion with those communities , it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it will not be of a kind to put our neutrality in unnecessary jeopardy . The internal policy of our country is the subject of the author 's fourth chapter . The greater part of this chapter is taken up with the consideration of the necessity of encouraging our manufactures . Our author combats , with breat ability , the opinion , that manufacturing establishments are necessarily prejudicial to morals . The truth , we conceive to be , that in manufactories , where a number of individuals of both sexes are collected together , it is difficult to preserve a medium between great regularity and gross disorder . We have little doubt that most of those establishments in this country are distinguished by the former of these qualities . // To what degree our manufactures should be protected by our imposts is a question , on which we shall not enter . That some protection should be afforded , is a principle , which we consider as settled in the minds of a great majority of our countrymen , and which has been avowed and adopted by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tariff of 1824 was opposed by Mr Webster , and many of its ablest adversaries , not on the abstract principle that manufactures should be left to themselves , but on the ground , that , admitting the reverse of this principle to be true , the bill itself was injudicious and unreasonable . Hence all questions , which can arise in Congress on the encouragement of manufactures , will , probably , be viewed as questions of more or less , and whether a tariff shall be passed or not must depend almost wholly on its details . Our author 's principal aim , in his remarks on this country , seems to be rather to present a picture of her future progress , than to describe her actual condition , or to suggest any precise course of foreign or domestic policy . We can not feel perfectly confident of the complete fulfilment of his splendid anticipations , though we assure him it is for any other reason , than because we should regret to see them verified . But we trust it argues no despair of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look on the speculations of the ablest men with some degree of diffidence . If the political events of the last twenty years have impressed any lesson on our minds , it is the truth of the utter uncertainty of all political anticipations . What will be the precise rank of our country among the nations of the earth in power and wealth we consider only a secondary question . It is enough for us , that though not the greatest , we are the happiest of nations , and that our happiness is as secure as the lot of humanity will permit , from every one but ourselves .
