txt ART . VI. - The Diplomacy of the United States ; being an . /lccount of the Foreign Relations of the Country , from the First Treaty with France , in 1778 , to the Treaty of Uhent , rn 1814 , with Great Britain . Svo. pp. 379 . Boston . Wells &amp; Lilly . 1826 . THE establishment of a new empire in the western hemisphere , by the separation of the North American colonies from Great Britain , has been justly considered as constituting a new era in the political world . The events , whether political or military , which produced that extraordinary revolution , as well as those , which led to the formation of the institutions peculiar to this new republic , together with the influence , which this revolution and these institutions have had on the civilized world , are daily becoming more and more interesting objects of inquiry . No contribution , therefore , to the political or military history of this country can fail of a favorable reception from the American public . The political transactions of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much less known than those of a military character . Movements in the field , as well as their causes , are more easily ascertained and oftener become subjects of historical research , than those m the cabinet . In the latter , greater secrecy is often required , // and this secrecy sometimes continues , long after the occasion for it has ceased . Under the old system of government , Congress held their deliberations in secret , and very little of their foreign correspondence has yet been made public . No inconsiderable part of the foreign correspondence , under the new form of government , is now before the public ; while the earlier correspondetice between the United States and foreign nations still remains in the archives of the Secretary of State . In 1818 , the national legislature ordered the journal of the general convention , together with the secret journal and foreign correspondence of Congress , from their first meeting , to the peace of 1783 , to be published , under the direction of the President of the United States , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it improper to publish . By a second order , papers of a similar description , from 1783 , to the commencement of the new government , were included . Under these orders , the journal of the convention , and the secret journals of Congress , have been published . The publication of the foreign correspondence has hitherto been delayed . The delicacy , as well as labor , of making a selection from such a voluminous mass of papers , may , perhaps , have been one of the causes of this delay . The publication of these important state papers , in connexion with the secret journals , would add greatly to the general stock of materials for American history , and would , no doubt , tend to increase the reputation of those American statesmen , who , during that period , were principally employed in foreign transactions . Many of them would probably be found of the same high character , with those state papers published by Congress , at the commencement of the Revolution , which Lord Chatham declared to equal any productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , ' a work which has been presented to the public during the present year is , we believe , the first publication of the kind relating to America . It is confined to the diplomatic part of American history ; and the author has judiciously availed himself of the various state papers which have been published , not only in this country , ' but in Europe . From these and other sources , he has drawn up a valuable summary of this important and interesting part of the history of the United States . The account of the negotiations of this country with each of the European nations is given by // itself , in a distinct chapter . The author commences the second chapter of his work with the following remarks . The means of intercourse , possessed by the confederation with foreign nations , were exceedingly limited ; of the States in Europe , most able to assist them , they had known but little except as enemies . They had , in various wars , taken an active part with the mother country against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the conquest of the French possessions in North America . Indeed , one of the principal motives of the Convention at Albany , held in 1754 , and consisting of commissioners from eight of the colonies , was to agree on a scheme of mutual protection against the encroachments of the French and Indians , at that time always allies , Their trade had also been constantly subject to the seventies and restrictions of the colonial system ; and at the period of the Revolution was confined to Great Britain , the West Indies , Africa , and Europe , south of Cape Finisterre . It is not , therefore , to be expected that they could look abroad with much confidence or hope of relief . The principal European states possessed colonies . America labored , on that account , under the peordiar disadvantage of seeking aid and encouragement from governments , whose policy it would always be , to resist the principles the confederation asserted . Revolutions were at that time not so common as they have since become . The act of the Americans was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretender in Great Britain , the only instance of rebellion , that had occurred among civilized nations in that century . The governments of Europe appeared , moreover , at this crisis , to be strong and prosperous . Monarchy was never , in appearance , more firmly established , or colonies of all descriptions , in more complete subjection . It is not likely that the American colonies , in the outset , expected assistance from abroad . The Revolutionary war , though events had been setting with a silent , but most unerring course , to that extremity since 66 , was little anticipated in 74 , the year of the first meeting of the Delegates in Philadelphia . This war finally broke out in a very unexpected manner , and spread with a rapidity equally astonishing . It is the first illustration , we have in history , of the effects of strong excitement on a people well educated and perfectly free . ' pp. 17 , 18 . The colonists did not apply to foreign alliances to assist them , in their struggle against the unconstitutional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of reconciliation had vanished . When their second humble petition to the king had teen rejected with contempt ; when , by a solemn act of Parlia // ment , they had been thrown out of the protection of the British government , when thousands of foreign mercenaries were engaged to force them to submission ; then , and not till then , did they declare themselves independent , establish governments of their own , and seek foreign alliances . They had , indeed , previously taken measures to sonnd some of the powers of Europe , on the subject of assistance , in case a separation from Great Britain should be ultimately found necessary . For this purpose a secret committee was appointed by Congress in November , 1775 , consisting of Dr Franklin , Mr Harrison , Mr Johnson , Mr Dickinson , and Mr Jay . This committee were to correspond with their friends in Europe , and other parts of the world . They had their agents in Europe , among whom was Arthur Lee in London , and Mr Dumas in holland . in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate in Congress from Connecticut , as a political and commercial agent to France , to solicit supplies of arms , ammunition , and clothing from the French court , or from whatever quarter they could be obtained . He was particularly instructed , to ascertain whether , if the colonies should be forced to form themselves into an independent state , France would probably acknowledge them as such , receive their ambassadors , enter into a treaty or alliance with them , for commerce , or defence , or both ? If so , on what principal conditions ? ' The French government had anticipated that part of Mr Deane 's mission relating to supplies , before his arrival in France . This is evident from a letter written by the French minister to the kind , as early as 1*/Iay , 1776 , which the author of the work now under notice has quoted at large . It shows the extreme caution and secrecy used by the French court , in furnishing the Americans with supplies , at that early period , and is here subjoined . Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Majesty th' writing , authorizing me to furnish a million of livres for the service of the English colonies . I add , also , the plan of an answer I propose to make to the Sieur Beaumarchais . I solicit your approbation to the two propositions . The answer to Mr de Beaumarchais will not be written in my hand , nor even that of either Lhe clerks or secretaries of my office . I shall employ for that purpose my son , whose handwriting can not be known . He is only fifteen years old , but I can answer in the most positive manner for his discretion . As it is important that this operation should not be suspected . or at least imputed to the government . I entreat // your Majesty to allow me to direct the return of the Sieur Montaudoin to Paris . The apparent pretext for that proceeding will be , to obtain from him an account of his correspondence with the Americans , though , in reality , it will be for the purpose of employing him to transmit to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit , directing him , at the same time , to take all necessary precaution , as if , indeed , the Sieur Montaudoin made the advance on their own account . On this head , I take the liberty of requesting the orders of Majesty . Having obtained them , I shall write to the Marquis de Grimaldi , inform him in detail of our proceedings , and request his co-operation , to the same extent . ' pp. 19 , 20 . This is one of those curious state papers , which the French revolution has brought to light ; and to enable the reader to understand , why the answer to Beaumarchais was of so secret a nature , as to be entrusted in the handwriting of no one , but that of the son of the minister , it is necessary to state , that , previously to the date of this letter , Beaumarchais had been secretly sent to London , to inform Arthur Lee , that the French court had determined to assist the Americans , by sending them , as a present , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunitions , and money ; and to request Mr Lee to communicate this information to Congress , and say that the same would be transmitted through the French West India Islands , in the fictitious name of Hortales &amp; Co . The answer here alluded to referred , no doubt , to this secret mission . Beaumarchais soon after returned to Paris , and this million of livres was placed in his hands , for the benefit of the Americans . Soon after Mr Deane 's arrival , he had several interviews with the French minister , or his secretary . The minister assured Mr Deane of his protection ; and informed him that their ports should be open to the Americans , and that every facility would be given to the shipment of warlike stores . With respect to American independence , he told Mr Deane , it would be impro* per for him to say anything on that subject , until it had actually taken place . Soon after his first conference , Beaumarchais was introduced to Mr Deane , recommended by Vergennes , and offered to procure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Deane , whether Beaumarchais , who was not a merchant or a man of business , would be able to fulfil his engagements , he had a second conference with Vergennes , who asstired him , that he might rely on whatever Beaumarchais // should engage , in the commercial way of supplies . In consequence of this , an arrangement was made , by Mr Deane , with this secret agent of the French government , and military supplies and clothing were furnished , to the amount of about two hundred thousand iovisdors , and were transmitted to America , in the name of a fictitious mercantile house , by the name of Ho1tales and Co. a name , which often appears , in the journals of the old Con rcss . Most of tile cannon and arms were , in fact , taken from the king*s arsenals . This secret and mysterious mode of sapply , as the author justly observes , gave rise to the claim of Beaumarchais , and rendered it very intricate . Immediately after the declaration of independence , Congress prepared a plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain ; and in September , 1776 , Dr Franklin , Mr Deane , and Mr Jefferson were appointed commissioners to France . Mr Jefferson having declined , Arthur Lee was chosen in his room . The manner in which the French court and nation received the American envoys , is thus described . Mr Lee arid Mr Deane were in Europe at the time of their appointment . In December 76 , Dr Franklin , the third commissioner , arrived in France . He was received with uncommon attention ; known already as a philosopher , the cause he represented was undoubtedly popular in that country . Indeed , the subject of liberty itself was , already , popular . It might have been only a fashion , as so many other things have been in France ; it might have arisen from the metaphysical , or rather philosophical discussions , in which the French were then so much engaged , without at all apprehending the practical effects of them . Or , perhaps , we may , with most truth , call the cause of the colonies popular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief to England . The novelty of the undertaking itself , produced an enthusiasm in France ; a war was commenced on a new continent ; the scene of action arid of interest was transferred from the old world . This had , already , happened in the former French wars , when Quebec and their other possessions fell . But , then , the European had only left his customary battle grounds to meet on a new continent with the same armies , the same animosity , and the same ambition . Europe was a party to those wars . To this she was a spectator . America was viewed with that deep interest and sympathy with which the weak are regarded in all contests ; and those , who were not inspired with the holy spirit of emancu. // pation , doubtless wished well to a cause , that was fought at such fearful odds . But the government manifested an evident reluctance to form an open alliance at this time . It naturally and prudently sought for delay . The commissioners were not publicly received ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ; and it might well be doubted , whether they could long resist the mother country , of whose power France , herself , had very recently had melancholy experience . But assistance continued to be secretly furnished ; privateers were allowed to equip and bring their prizes into French ports , commissions were issued by the American envoys ; and the cause of the Revolution still continued exceedingly popular with the people . ' pp. 22 , 23 . The negotiations of the United States with France and Spain , during the revolutionary struggle , and with Great Britain , in connexion with those powers , on the terms of peace and independence , have very properly claimed the greatest share of the author 's attention ; and this part of the work will be read with peculiar interest . In maintaining the cause of independence , American statesmen , during this period , had to encounter difficulties abroad , as well as at home ; and no one can contemplate the firmness , with which these difficulties were met and overcome by them , or their perseverance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their character . Soon after the arrival of the American envoys at Paris , a paper , signed by the king , was read to them by the secretary of Vergennes . In this paper , his Most Christian Majesty declared , among other things , that , being determined to take no advantage of the situation , in which the United States were then placed ; he thought that it was not then a proper time to form a lasting union , which , however , he very much wished ; that they should be at liberty to make their purchases , in private , securing to him an observance of treaties , which he was determined not to be the first to break ; and that to prove his good wishes , he had ordered two millions of livres to be paid them quarterly , which should be augmented , as the state of his finances would permit . The most profound secrecy , with respect to this matter , was enjoined on the commissioners . France evidently waited for events which should decide , beyond all doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans to support their independence ; and to be perfectly satisfied , that her aid , when openly afforded , would prevent th' // possibility of their reconciliation with Great Britain . This policy Was pursued by the French court , notwithstanding the advantageous offers made by the American Congress , until the capture of General Burgoyne and his army , in October , 1777 . The disasters of the campaign of 1776 induced Congress to turn their attention more seriously to the subject of obtaining foreign aid . In Dcceinber of this year , they determined to send commissioners to the courts of Vienna , Spain , and Prussia , and to the Duke of Tuscany . These conunissioners were particularly instructed to assure the courts , to which they were sent , that , notwithstanding the insidious suggestions of the British court , the people of the United States were not disposed to submit to the sovereignty of the British crown ; and of their determination , at all events , to maintain their independence . To induce France in particular to take an open part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and the West Indies should be confined to French and American vessels , and to divide the cod fishery with France , in case Great Britain , by their joint efforts , should be excluded from any share in it . If these offers should be insufficient to produce a declaration of war , on the part of France , the commissioners were directed to yield to the king of France all the British West India islands , that might be reduced by his arms ; and to stipulate , that the United States would furnish two millions of dollars in provisions , an ( l six frigates , in the expeditions for their reduction . To Spain they offered their assistance , in obtaining possession of the town and harbor of Pensacola , on condition that the citizens of the LTnited States should base the free navigation of the Mississippi , and the use of the harbor of Pensacola . These new offers , however , produced no change in the policy of the two courts . The news of the surrender of Burgoyne and his army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a new state of things , both in Great Britain and France . The British Parliament was then in session ; but the minister was not prepared to meet so unexpected and important an event , and immediately proposed an adjournment to the twentieth of Jarmary ; which took place on the eleventh of December . In the debates on this motion , in which the ministry were attacked with great severity , Lord North declared , that one object of the adjournment was , to prepare a plan of reconciliation with the Colonies ; and he gave notice , that after the recess , he should submit to the consideration of the House cer // tam concessions , which might serve as the basis of a treaty , and he trusted , that their endeavors would prove effectual in bringing about a permanent peace , and a lasting union between the two countries . The proceedings of parliament were soon known in France , and on the sixteenth the French king declared to the American envoys his determination to accede to their propositions . Before the completion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . On this subject , the king himself addies*ed a letter to his Catholic majesty , bea.ing date the eighth of January , 1778 . This letter the author has very prol ) erly inserted . It distiuctly discloses the policy of the two courts , as well as the real motives , which ultimately induced the king of France openly to join the Americans . pp. 297 , 298* " England , our common and inveterate enemy , has been engaged for three years in a war with her colonies . We have agreed not to take a part in it , and , considering both l ) arties as English , we have made the commerce of our state free to whoever should find his advantage in it . La this way America has provided herself with those arms and munitions , of which she was in want . I do not speak of the aid we have given that country in money and other articles , the whole having been done in the ordinary course of commerce . England has shown some vexation at this circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later revenge herseW This was the situation of the business the last November . The destruction of Burgoyne and the embarrassments of howe have changed the face of things . America is triumphant ; England is cast down . But her vast marine is still entire , and having abandoned the idea of conquering the colonies , she has resolved to form an alliance with them . All parties in England are agreed in this particular . Lord North has himself announced a plan of pacification . It does not much signify to us , whether he or any other minister is in place ; actuated by different motives , they will still unite against us . It is very important to prevent the reunion of the colonies with the mother country . " ' The author has only given what he considers the substance of the conclusion of this letter . The original is more explicit as to the motives of the king , in accepting the proposals of the Americans , and is as follows . This being understood , and our causes of complaint against England notorious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council , and particularly of M. d'Ossuna , and having consulted upon the propositions , which the insurgents make , that it was just // 101 Diplomacy of the United States . and necessary to treat with them , to prevent their reunion with the mother country ; ( pour emp*cher leur reunion a la m&amp;ropole ) . ' Spain , however , refused to join France in treating with the Americans . Although desirous of reducing the power of Great Britain , by the separation of her North American colonies , she was unwilling to become a party in a war for this object , without some security for the future safety of her own possessiotis , adjoining the newly formed American States . France , thereibre , concluded a treaty of commerce , and an eventual treaty of alliance , with the United States , without the concurrence of Spain . By a secret tirticle , however , his Catholic Majesty had a right to accede to both treaties whenever he thought proper . The connexion formed hetxx-een France and America being oflicially announced to the British government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accede to the treaties , she offered her mediation between France and Great Britain . This was readily accepted by his Most Christian Majesty , and was listened to , on the part of his Britannic Majesty , and a correspondence on the subject between the British and Spanish courts took place for several months ; and was finally ended in June 1779 , when Spain joined France in the contest . This was done in consequence of a convention between the two courts in April preceding , which was a secret compact , and , it is believed , has never yet been made public . It was , probably , a renewal of the old family compact , and no doubt contained a stipulation , on the part of France , to assist Spain in securing to her the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi , as well as her fornter possessions , east of that river . Should negotiations for peace be the consequence of the offered mediation , both France and Spain determined that the United States should he a party . To meet this event , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions to the minister created much division in Congress . The members were divided on the subjects of the fisheries , the navigation of the Mississippi , and the Northwestern boundaries . They were , at first , not more unammotis in the selection of a minister . In two successive ballots the votes were equally divided between Mr Adams and Mr Jay . The subject being postponed , Mr Jay was afterward appointed minister to Spain , and Mr Adams to treat of peace . Pending this mediation , Great Britain secretly attempted to effect a separate peace , with the United States , as well as with // France . For this purpose , Mr Hartley wes sent to Paris to sound Dr Franklin , and Mr Forth to confer with Vergennes . The former , after a long coa'respondence , made several preliminary prol ) ositions to Di ' Franklin ; one of which was , that America should be released and unengaged from all treaties with foreign powers ; ' and he told Dr Franklin , that the convention formed between America and France was the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fo*th proposed to France , in case she would abandon America , that she might retaiu her conquests in the West Indies ; and promised not only to relil ) quish the right of an English con imiss ry at Dunkirk , hut to allow her great advantages in the East indies . The offers thus sej ) arately and secretly made , were rejected by Di ' Franklin and XTergennes . The negotiations of Mr Jay with the court of Madrid , were attended with peculiar difficulties and embarrassments , and required all the patience and perseverance of that distinguished patriot and statesman . Aware of the wishes of Spain to regain the possessions she had lost in America during the last war , Congress instructed Mr Jay to guaranty the Floridas to his Catholic Majesty , in case he would accede to the treaties ; and also to obtain loans and subsidies . Soon after his arrival at Madrid , Mr Jay was explicitly informed , that the king of Spain would not join in these treaties ; and that he was much displeased with his Most Christian Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister pressed the Spanish court on this subject , and particularly with regard to the navigation of the Mississippi , he was told , that his Catholic Majesty had determined to exclude all foreigners from entering the Gulf of Mexico from the North , and that he would enter into no treaty with the United States , until some definitive arrangement should be made relative to the navigation of the Mississippi . The embarrassments of Mr Jay were greatly increased , and his situation rendered extremely delicate , by the refusal of the Spanish court to furnish him with any money , even to pay the bills , which Congress had drawn upon him , unless upon the condition of a relinquishment of the claim of the United States to the navigation of the Mississippi . This condition the American minister refused to comply with . In consequence of the success of the enemy , at the South in 1780 , Congress were induced to recede from insisting on the free navigation of the Mississippi , and a free port below latitude 310 , in case Spain would secure to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that latitude . A proposition , agreeable to these in stenetions. was submitted to the Spanish court , hut was rejected and the negotiations remained in this state until June 1782 , when they were transferred to Paris , and blended with the subjects of a *ene1nl J ) eace , between all the belligerents . In 1780 the war be an to affect most of the European powers . Towards the close of that year , the empress of Russia , anti the emperor of Germany , offered their mediation for a general peace in Europe . This mediation was accepted at once by England , and eventually by France , Spain , and the United States . A general congress was proposed to settle the terms . Before commencing negotiations , however , France and Spain insisted upon an explicit answer from the court of London to the question , whether an American plenipotentiary would be admit ted at this con*ress . The king of Great Britain , in June 1781 , in his answer , declared , that he would not , in any manner whatever , admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rebel subjects ; and , therefore , would not agree to the admission of any person , at the proposed congress , on their part ; that he would not consent to any meas mire , which might limit or suspend the right which every sovereign had to employ the means in his power , to put an end to a rebellion in his dominions ; and that the mediation of the imperial courts must be limited to peace between the belligerents in Europe , and not extend to a particular peace with the revolted Americans . This answer put an end to all further proceedings under this mediation . While it was pending , the instructions prepared for the American minister , under the Spanish mediation , were revised by Congress ; and at the instance of the French minister , a clause was inserted , declaring , that the American negotiators were ultimately to be governed by the advice and opinion of the king of France or his minister . ' All the states did not assent to this extraordinary and humiliating clause . The states of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes against it , and Pennsylvania was divided . At the same time , Dr Franklin , Mr Jay , Mr Laurens , and Mr Jefferson were joined with Mr Adams , in the commission . The pride of Great Britain would not yet permit her to treat with her rebel subjects , as she still called them , under the mediation or interference of any foreign power . The arms of the allies , however , were able to effect in America , what neither the imperial courts , nor the house of Bourbon , // could accomplish in Europe . The capture of Lord Cornwallis anti his army , in October of the same year , convinced the British nation , that America could not be subdued by force , and led to a change of administration , and pacific overtures , on the part of the court of London . The author has presented a view of the circumstances , which led to these overtures , as well as the negotiations which followed ; anti has , also , given the reasons why the American ministers concluded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a very able and satisfactory vindication of their conduct , in thus departing from their instructions . We can not do better , than to give this vindication in the words of the author . This direct deviation from positive instructions , this apparent ingratitude and perfidy to a faithful and valuable ally , is susceptible of a full and ready explanation . Early in 8* , it was foreseen that England was not the only country , that would present obstacles to a peace , safe and satisfactory to the United States . America , now independent , found herself compelled to resist Spain , claiming territory on the one hand , and France seeking an exclusive possession of the fisheries on the other . She had succeeded to the rights , the advantageous position , and a portion of the commerce of the mother country in the new world ; and undoubtedly Fraiice and Spain were well aware , that the United States would become dan erous neighbors on the laud , and troublesome competitors on the ocean . The American colonies had always been so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition of Great Britain . But France and Spain did not anticipate , that America would either claim , or be able to maintain , all the former rights of the colonies . They entered into the negotiation of S2 with the intention and expectation of extorting from England , to the injury of the United States , some portion of her territory , and a part of one of her most valuable privileges . Both those countries had a heavy balance to settle with Great Britain in the new world ; and they remembered , with bitterness and mortification , the provisions of the two treaties of Utrecht and Paris. * On the side of France , America had much to fear . She was disposed to curtail her fishing rights and privileges , to maintain Spain in her pretensions respecting boundaries , and to aid England in exacting a compensation for the loyalists . A letter written by M. de Marbois , secretary of the French legation , from Philadelphia , dated March 13th , 82 , intercepted and decyphered at the time , if it did not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French court , strengthened , at least , the suspicions before entertained . M. de Marbois advised M. de Vergennes to cause to be intimated to the American ministers , " his surprise that the Newfoundland fisheries have been included in the additional instructions . That the United States set forth pretensions therein , without payin9 ' re'i*ard to the king 's French rights , and without considering the impossibility they are under of making conquests , and of keeping what belongs to Great Britain . It will be better to have it declared at an early period to the Americans , that their pretensions to the fisheries of the great Bank are not founded , and that his Majesty does not mean to support them . " These extracts , taken in connex*on with the obvious policy of the French court , could leave few doubts concerning its designs . ' pp. 182-185 . The boundaries , the fisheries , and the case of the loyalists , were subjects of the greatest difficulty , in the settlement of the terms of peace between Great Britain and her former colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to meet the British ministers , but to counteract the views and claims of France and Spain . Negotiations with Spain were resumed by Mr Jay in the summer of 1782 , at Paris , with Count de Aranda . In their first conference , in the presence of Dr Franklin , the Spanish minister referred to the old topic of western limits , and asked , What are the boundaries of the United States ? Mr Jay replied , that the Mississippi , from its source to latitude 31* , was their western boundary , and from latitude *3L* east , by the line between Georgia and the Floridas . Tue Spanish minister protested against the right of the United States to extend to the Mississippi . He declared , that the western country had never belonged or claimed to belong to the ancient colonies ; that previous to the war of 1755 , it belonged to France , and after its cession to Great Britain , it remained a distinct part of her dominions , until , by the conquest of west Florida and certain posts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then drew a line , as a boundary , on Mitchell 's map of North America , beginning at a lake near the confines of Georgia , and east of Flint river , to the confluence of the Kanaway with the Ohio , and thence round the western shores of lakes Erie and Huron , then round lake Michigan to Superior . This map he sent to Mr Jay , and it was , by him , soon after shown to Vergennes , in company with Dr Franklin . The latter pointed out to the French minister this line , as claim VOL . XXIV. - NO. *4. 14 // ed by Spain , declaring it to be an extravagant and improper one , and insisting on the right of the United States to extend to the Mississippi . Vergennes said very little in reply to these remarks ; but Mr Rayneval , his principal secretary , who was present , denied the right of the United States to extend so far west . The Spanish minister afterwards requested the American corn nissioners to designate some line , east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , they refused , deciarin6 , that they could never cede to Spain any part of the country east of that river . Mr Rayneval soon after requested an interview with Mr Jay , relative to limits with Spain . Iu this interview , he declared explicitly , that the United States had no claim to lands west of the Alleghany mountains , as settled by the British proclamation of October , 1763 ; that Spain had no claims beyond her late conquests , , and could not , in strictness , go beyond the Natchez ; but , as the future might bring forth new circumstances , ' he proposed an eventual arrangement of limits between the United States and Spain . He suggested , thereibre , that a line should commence at the western angle of the Gulf of Mexico , which formed the section between the Floridas , and run thence to Fort Toulouse , and thence by various rivers to the Cumberland , and down that river to the Ohio . The lands north of the Ohio , Mr Rayneval did not consider as belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fate must be regulated by the court of London . ' These ideas of Rayneval were , no doubt , those of the French court , and satisfied the American envoys , that the object of France was , by the eventual arrangement of limits proposed by Rayneval , to leave that vast tract of country north of the Ohio , a subject of negotiation between Great Brilain and France alone . The intercepted letter of Marbois fully expla ned the views of the French court as to the fisheries , and in addition to this , Rayneval hinted to Dr Franklin and Mr Jay , that they should limit their claims to the coast fishery . To Mr Adams , who joined Dr Franklin and Mr Jay at Paris , about the twentieth of October , Vergennes expressed an opinion in favor of making some compensation to the loyalists . Under these circumstances , the American negotiators came to the resolution of proceeding without consulting the court of France . The British minister at first insisted on the Ohio as the western limits , and that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the progress of the // negotiation , however , the subject of compensation to the loyalists created the greatest , and , at one time , an almost insuperable obstacle to a favorable result . As an ultimatum , the American commissioners finally proposed a stipulation , that Congress should recommend to the States a restoration of their property ; but they candidly told the British minister , that , on account of the public feelings in America against this class of people , the recommendation xvould not probably be complied with by the States . This proposition was at last accepted , and the treaty signed on the thirtieth of November . Although the French court could not openly complain of the advantages secured to their allies by this treaty , yet the answer of Vergennes to the note of Dr Fraaklin , enclosing a copy of it , evinced great dissatisfaction , and was expressed in severe and bitter language . France and Spain had not at this time settled the terms of peace with Great Btitain . Serious difficulties had arisen to prevent this ; and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibraltar was not the least . Having failed to obtain this fortress by force , Spain was determined to have it by negotiation ; and her minister was instructed not to make peace without it . The aid of France was particularly solicited , and the Spanish court offered to France her part of St Domingo for Gibraltar . Mr Rayneval was intrusted with this important negotiation at London . A majority of the British cabinet , after much debate , agreed to yield up Gibraltar to Spain , on two conditions ; first , The restitution of all the conquests inadeby Spain , namely , Minorca , West Florida , and the Bahama Ish rids ; secondly , The cession of Porto Rico , or the restitution of Dominique , and the cession of Guadaloupe , by France . The French king was willing to restore Dominique , to cede Guadaloupe , and take the Spanish part of St Domingo ; but the king of Spain hesitated about restoring West Florida . The king of England , however , at last put an end to this negotiation , by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With respect to territory , the ultimatum of the British cabinet was , the cession of both the Floridas , together with Minorca , and to receive back the Bahamas . This was finally accepted by the Spanish minister , though contrary to his instructions . The advantages secured to the United States by the treaty of peace , were probably greater than those obtained by France or Spain . For these they were indebted to the abilities and // tJan. firmness of their ministers . It was foreseen by the American negotiators , that great difficulties would arise in the final adjustment of so many claims as must occur between Great Britain and the powers confederated against her , and that even among the confederates themselves there might be interfering interests . France , Spain , and Holland had important interests to settle , not only in America , but in Europe , the East and West Indies , and , indeed , in every part of the world ; and each would naturally endeavor to obtain the most advantageous terms for itself . Soon after the treaty of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Great Britain , and also between them and Spain ; the origin and nature of which are accurately stated in the work before us . While negotiations relative to these disputes were pending , a most extraordinary revolution took place in France ; a revolution , which produced new and more important causes of complaint on the part of the United States against England and Spain ; and involved this country in new and almost inextricable difficulties with France . The length to which this article has been extended , must prevent us from tracing the author through the intricate and protracted negotiations in which this country was involved with foreign nations , in consequence of this unexampled state of things in Europe . We must content ourselves with referring to the work itself . The author has stated them with accuracy and fidelity ; and the remarks with which he has accompanied this statement , are made with impartiality and candor . These negotiations embraced important questions of national law , relating to neutral rights , deeply affecting the commercial interests of the United States . During this mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century , the United States received great injuries from Great Britain and France . While the former was determined that the Americans should not directly or indirectly afford assistance to her ancient rival , the rulers of France , by whatever name they were called , were resolved , that the United States should join in the war against England . Each accused the American government of partiality to her rival ; and it required all the wisdom and prudence of President Washington to prevent the United States from being at an early period involved in the war , which so long desolated Europe . The first minister from the French republic , in 1793 , was // instructed to form a family compact with the Americans , and to induce them to make common cause with France ; and in 1807 , the imperial Bonaparte , when solicited to relax his celebrated decrees , in favor of the United States , not only refused , but declared , that the Americans should be compelled to take the position and character either of allies or enemies . This declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests , Bonaparte determined that the United States should unite in enforcing his continental system . The origin and object of this celebrated system , and its effects on the commerce of the Unitcd States , are explained in this work ; and the power and views of Bonaparte , at this period of his career , are well described . The mind is impressed with a singular sensation , in beholding a great conqueror , just reposing from one of his most signal victories , in the capital of the sovereign , whose army he had rather destroyed than defeated , issuing decrees , that embraced , in their desolating effects , almost every sea of the civilized world . The power of Napoleon Bonaparte was scarcely bounded by any river on the continent of Europe . In gaining his great victories , in adding state after state to his dominions , in placin* brother after brother upon the thrones of the old nations , whose dynasties he had thrown down , he seems to have been fulfilling his proper part ,  --  to have been accomplishing the destinies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wherever he marched , he carried a force with him sufficient to effect his purposes . This was the legitimate exercise of the vast power , with which he was intrusted , by Providence , for objects which it is not yet altogether in the reach of man to comprehend . But when he extended his ambition to the ocean ; when he undertook to overwhelm whole countries , by maritime decrees , we perceive that he has left the orbit , in which it was his destiny to move ; and we feel , that the unity of his theatrical character is destroyed . pp. 120 , 121 . France was powerful by land , England by sea ; and in their unexampled struggle for preeminence , particularly on the ocean , both were guilty of unparalleled volations of maritime rights , and both vindicated their proceedings on the principles of retaliation . That the United States , for these violations of their rights , had legitimate causes of war against both , there can be little doubt ; and the only question was , whether , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politic , or necessary for them to select either for their enemy . The various measures , which at last induced the United States to make a selection , together with the negotiations , which ended in the treaty of Ghent , are // stated by the author with his usual ability and fairness , and this statement concludes the volume . This work evinces throughout much industry and research , and will be found a valuable addition to American history . It may be perused with special profit by those , who would be instructed in that portion of the history of the country , relating to its intercourse and connexions with foreign powers .
