txt ART . XIII .. - Report of the Board of Directors of Internal Improvements of the State of Massachusetts , on the Practicability and Expediency of a Rail Road from Boston to the Hudson River , and from Bostou to Providence , sub- . mitted to the General Court , January 16 , 1829 . To which are annexed the Reports of the Engineers , containing the Results of their Surveys , and Estimates of the Cost of constructing a Rail Road on each of the Routes selected . With Plans and Profiles of the Routes . HAViNG devoted a portion of our last number to an examination of the Reports upon the Baltimore and Ohio rail road , we should not at present have called the attention of our readers to the documents named at the head of this article , had not the subject become one of peculiar interest , at this moment , from the position in which it has been placed by the legislature of Massachusetts . Engineers have been engaged during the two lest seasons , under the superintendence of different commissions appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough surveys of the country between Boston and Albany , and also between Boston and Providence ; the routes which offer the greatest advantages for rail roads in those two directions have been selected ; a species of rail road , to be formed principally of materials found in abundance along the several routes , and ' which will combine the advantages of solidity and durability with those of cheapness and simplicity of construction , has been particularly described , and the cost of construction carefully estimated . Inquiries have also been made , to determine the amount of business to be accommodated , and other facts necessary for forning an estimate of the degree of benefit to be expected from these works . The results of these investigations are submitted in the Reports which form the subject of this notice , to the legislature , with a strong recommendation that the construction of rail roads upon both routes should be undertaken at the cost of the state . The legislature , instead of acting definitively upon the question thus submitted to them , at their late session passed resolutions declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these works by the funds of the state , and recommending the subject to the people for their consideration , and to the next legislature , as deserving a thorough examination , and // an early decision . The difficulty of forming a satisfactory judgment on a subject involving so many details , in so short a period as was allowed after the publication of these Reports , and the magnitude and tiovelty of the undertaking , afforded strong reasons for deferring a final decision upon the question presented to the legislature , and for . appealing to the sense of the public at large upon it . In this state of things , the people of Massachusetts are loudly called upon to examine into the merits of this question , that they may make such a decision upon it as will be creditable to their intelligence , as well as consistent with their . own best interests . Feeling the obligation of citizens thus called upon to form an opinion on this subject , we have carefully looked over these Reports , and made such an examination of the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present our views of the improvements here recommended . The distance from Boston to Albany , by the most favorable of , the routes surveyed , is found to be one hundred and ninetyeight miles ; that by the roads now most travelled being about one hundred and sixty-five . This route is on a line so nearly level as to admit of being travelled throughout by locomotive power alone , without the aid of any description of stationary power , in surmounting the elevations to be passed . By the adoption of stationary powers , on inclined planes , in surmounting some of the steeper declivities , it is supposed the distance might be reduced to something less than a hundred and ninety miles , without any considerable increase of the elevation to be passed . The distance by the most level of the Providence routes , from tide waters on Front Street in Boston , to the neighborhood of deep navigable waters , at Fox Point , in the southerly part of Providence , is forty-three miles and forty-eight chains . This is about two miles farther than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part of the inclination on this route need *exceed thirty feet in a mile , and that no aid of stationary powers'will be required . The route which is recommended for the Albany road , passes through the towns of Newton , Framingharn , Westborough , Worcester , Brookfield , and Palmer , to Springfield ; and thence , through Westfield , Chester , Pittsfield , Canaan , Chitham , and Castleton , to Greenbush , on the Hudson river , Opposite to the city of Albany . On this line the estimates of cost are made , but it is supposed that occasioiial des . // viations from it may be advantageously made on the final laying out of the road . In proceeding westwardly from Boston on this route , the line of the road , when formed on the principles assumed in the estimate , will have an ascending inclination for ninety miles and a half , a descending inclina-. tion for ninety-four miles and a half , and it will be level for thirteen miles . On forty-nine miles of the ascending part of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , the inclination exceeds the rate of twenty-six feet to a mile ; and on these portions of the road , varying in their rate of inclination from twenty-six to eighty feet per mile , it is computed that the resistance or acceleration of the motion of the load by its gravity , will be greater than the resistance from friction . On the other hundred miles of the road , the inclination will be so slight , that the gravity of the load will act advantageously in aiding its motion in descending , in the same degree that it will act disadvantageously in ascending . The travelling on these parts of the road , therefore , will be nearly as easy ; and - accomplished by about the same exertion of travelling power , as it would be if it were level . On the fortynine miles of ascending road , an additional travelling power will be necessary , proportioned to the degree of inclination . On the forty-nine miles of descending road , no exertion will be required to move the load forward , but precautions will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed , that on all parts of the road constructed in the manner described , except those which make up the fortynine miles of steep inclination , an average load for a single horse , travelling twenty miles per day , will be sixteen thousand pounds , or eight tons of two thousand pounds each , exclusive of the weight of the wagons ; and that , on the steepest parts , an additional horse will be necessary for conveying the same load , travelling ten miles a day in an ascending direction , and returning the same distance . It is further computed that the cost of transportation for heavy articles , exclusive of tolls , will not exceed a cent a mile per ton . The particulars of this estimate are stated in the report . Admitting the assumed cost of labor to be correct , of which *very one conversant with such subjects can judge , and admitting also the correctness of the statements which are found in works of acknowledged authority , of the ordinary performance of horses on rail roads which have been for some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particularly described , there can be no doubt of the accuracy of this estimate . It being once ascertained what degree of lo cornotive power is necessary for the conveyance of loads of a given weight on a level rail road , or on a road of a given inclination , it is easy to calculate the power which will be necessary on a road of similar construction , having any specified rates of inclination . In this estimate , there appears to be an ample allowance for the increased power which will be required in consequence of the departure from a level line . In the above estimate of the cost of transportation , it is assumed that the road will be made without the application of stationary powers to surmount any of the declivities in the route . The Report , however , recommends , that before the road is finally laid out , further examinations and calculations shall be made , with a view of determining whether it may not be expedient to adopt a system of stationary powers , on indined planes , for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Such an investigation ought unquestionably to be made , and a careful estimate of the comparative cost and value of the two niodes of construction . After the proper surveys and inquiries shall have been completed , it will be easy to make such a comparison as will leave little doubt which of the methods of passing these declivities should be preferred . Should it prove on inquiry , that there is a sufficient supply of water to afford a permanent moving power on most of the elevations , there can be little doubt that it will be found expedient to appropriate this power , which can be obtained at an extremely low cost , to this purpose . The principal facts necessary for this inquiry , which have not yet been ascertained , are , the saving which may be made in the distance , by admitting of steep inclinations instead of those never exceeding eighty feet in a mile ; the cost of constructing inclined planes , with the necessary machinery ; the cost of the stationary power , whether it be water or animal power ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machinery ; and the comparative length of time required to pass , in the two modes . On most of the rail roads of any considerable magnitude in England , stationary steam-engines are used for the purpose of moving the loads over the steep elevations . They are also adopted on the rail road connected with the Hudson and Delaware canal , leading to the Lackawaxen coal mines in // Pennsylvania . But this species of power would not he at all adapted to the ' convenience of the irregular travelling , on a public road like that here proposed . Besides this objection to the use of steam power for this purpose , it is evident that it would have no advantage over horse power , in a part of the country where the cost of fuel for the supply of the engines would exceed that of keeping a sufficient number of horses or oxen , to perform the same amount of labor . On the Stockton and Darlington railway , which is the longest in existence now completed , the loads are moved principally by locomotive and stationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining locomotive engines in England , near the coal mines , and where , consequently , the expense for fuel is low , is greater than that of keeping the number of horses , in this country , which will exert the same degree of pQwer , provided the horses travel at a slow pace . But if the pace of the horse is accelerated , his power is diminished in a much greater ratio than his speed is increased . With steam power , acting on a locomotive engine , it is otherwise . The same power which will move twenty tons a given distance per hour , will move ten tons double that distance in an hour ; so that the effect produced is the same in a rapid as in a slow rate of motion . For rapid travelling , therefore , locomotive engines may be cheaper than animal power . But they are applicable only to the conveyance of loads of many tons ' weight , and are therefore not suited to the purpose of moving stage-coaches . Indeed the resistance to the motion of a carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of horse power , even at the low degree of exertion which he is capable of when travelling at a very rapid rate , is a matter of small consideration , compared with the cost of travelling in any of the ordinary modes . The power of a single horse is sufficient for drawing a stage*coach as fully loaded , and at as rapid a speed , as the passengers will desire . For other purposes than the conveyance of passengers , a rapid rate of travelling is not , in general , of any great advantage . It is not probable , therefore , that locomotive engines will , for the present , be found advantageous in this country . But if by the use of horse power on a rail road , the cost of transportation can be reduced as low as a cent a mile for the conveyance of a ton ; if a single horse , travelling at a slow and natural pace , can draw a load of eight tons , exclusive of the weight of the wagons , and a stage-coach loaded with // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nine or ten miles an hour ; it is evident that such a rail road , passing through a rich and populous country , must be of immense benefit , and that it will not only afford a great facility to business , but will produce a great increase of business and of profits . The Report goes into a variety of investigations , for the purpose of showing the amount of business which will be thus accommodated . The data for this calculation are derived from a great number of scattered sources ; and many of them are too uncertain to be very fully relied on . The results are stated with a good deal of reserve , and the aggregate of the estimate appears to be moderate . In this estimate , the business that is expected to pass the whole road , between Boston and Albany , is not relied on for more than a fifth part of the whole income . This amount is supposed to be about a third more than the present amount of business between the two places . A material increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the cost of transportation , as from the greater expedition and certainty of the conveyance , and from the continuance of an advantageous trade throngli a great part of the winter , when the present outlet of the trade of Albany is closed . These are certainly substantial grounds for anticipating a great increase of business , and the introduction of a much more extensive direct trade than is now carried on , in place of that which at present centres in the city of New York . The extent of this increase must of course be in a great measure a matter of conjecture . it could not be considered an extravagant supposition to place the amount much higher than the estimate in the Report . Some persons have expressed a belief , that if the rail road were built , the trade between Boston and Albany would still be carried on by water , because this conveyance would be cheaper than that by the rail road . Those who have adopted this opinion , must have taken it up without due examination . It will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which pay at the lowest rates , between Boston and Albany , is three dollars and seventy-five cents a ton , * but that , for the purpose of filling up a vessel , which would otherwise sail with part of a cargo , certain articles , particularly flour and mackerel , which are the most considerable articles of transport between the two cities , are often taken at two // dollars and fifty cents a ton . We have the authority of the largest importer of flour from Albany for the two last seasons for saying ; that he has never paid less than twenty-five cents a barrel for the freight of flour , that he often pays thirtyseven and a half cents , and that he thinks the average price paid by him about thirty-one cents . Those who ship but tran*. siently , and in smaller quantities , of course generally pay more . The gentleman above quoted , and others competent to judge , are of opinion that the business could not be carried on at so low a uniform rate of freight as the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the cost of water conveyance , the insurance , at an average of three fourths of one per cent . on the value of the article . This would be , on a ton of flour , from thirty to sixty cents ; on most other articles more than this amount , and on the cheapest of manufactured goods , which will form a large part of the transport , more than the above rates of freight . In these facts we place entire confidence , and therefore can not doubt that a rail road , constructed in the manner proposed , will command the whole transport hetween Albany and Boston , provided the tolls are placed as low as is recommended in the Report , namely , a dollar a ton for the whole passage . Higher tolls might be charged on the more costly articles . The distinction proposed to be made in the rate of tolls , on articles carried through the whole line , and on those which are carried to or from the interior of the country , will be entirely reasonable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of the road . It will be reasonable that the compensation for the use of the road , should be in proportion to the benefit afforded by it . It is on this principle that bulky articles , of small value in proportion to their weight , are usually charged at low rates of toll , on rail roads and canals , in comparison with more costly articles . Where the transportation on the rail road comes in competition with water conveyance , as between Albany and Boston , the tolls must be low , or there will be no inducement to prefer the rail road . Where the only competition is with the conveyance by land , on common roads , much higher rates of toll may be demanded for the use of the rail road , and still the benefit will be far beyond the price paid . However great may be esteemed the benefits anticipated from the facility which this improvement will afford , to the com // munication betv*een Boston and Albany , and to a direct trade between the manufacturing towns of the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation of the intermediate country must be regarded as the leading motive for undertaking this great work . The cost of transporting merchandise and produce any considerable distance by land , in the ordinary method , is so great , compared with that of water conveyance , that this disadvantage a lone is sufficient to make trade , and every branch of industry , languid and unprofitable , compared with the same degree of industry and skill , exerted in parts of the country where , nature has , furnished a cheaper mode of intercourse . Every one , in estimating the bounties which nature has conferred on different states and countries , has been accustomed to regard the possession of extensive navigable rivers as among the most en*viable advantages , on account of the fadlity which they afford to intercourse and trade . The late improvements of steam navigation have given these natural channels of intercourse a new value , so that they have become the great highways not only for trade but for personal intercourse . The introduction of steam-boats , with luxurious accommodations , travelling with a rapidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson and Connecticut rivers , has given to the parts of country bordering on those waters , more decided advantages over other parts of the country , than they before possessed , and drawn to those routes much of the business which was formerly carried ion ' by land transportatiop , ' in other directions , But a very large tract of country , including the whop of the *ntral ' and western parts of Massachusetts , and a large portion of several of the neighboring states , is , rerpot* , from either of these channels . To these part* &amp;f'tbe ' coi*zhfr* it is important to afford some stibstitute for the advantages of navigation , which their situation does not permit thetn to possess . The rail road will furnish them that substitute . It will afford a method of communication in some respects superior to any inland navigation . It will not be so cheap as sloop navigation , ' but it will be more safe and more free from interruption . It will probably not admit of the conveyance of passengers quite so rapidly as steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of their being carried more safely , and at a cheaper rate , unless in ' cases where by the latter great numbers are carried . The cost of locomotive  |p9*er  in the // fast travelling steam-boats is very great . Th* power of the engines used in these boats is nearly equal to a horse power for each of the average number of passengers . On the rail road the power required will be but that of a single horse , when travelling at a very rapid rate , for a large coach-load of passengeta . The cost of conveying merchandise will not be greater , independently of tolls , than that of the same conveyance on a canal , and the tolls may be less , in the same proportion as the cost of the work is less . It has sometimes been erroneously inferred from the fact stated by elementary writers , that a boat may he moved on a canal at the slow rate of two miles an hour , by one third of the power required to move the same weight on a rail road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be two thirds less than by the latter . This is a great mistake . ' A horse does not in fact draw three times the amount on a canal , which he usually draws on a rail road . Two horses are usually employed in drawing a boat with a load of about thirty tons ' ; and what is more material , two men are required , be*des the person who drives the horses , to conduct the boat . The slow pace at which they necessarily ' move ; limits the progress of the men , ' as W*ll " was of the horses , to about twenty *xiile* ' a dn* , ' unless they travel through the night , in which ease two Sets of men are necessary . The daily cost of two horses at fifty cents , two men at one dollar each , and a b6y at fifty cents , is three dollars mid fifty cents for the conveyance of thirty tons twenty miles , or six hundred tons one mile ; ' On the rail road , two horses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hours , and two other horses to be driven the same distance on the same day , by the same driver , with one man at one dollar , will cost . three dollars for conveying sixteen tons forty miles ; which is equal to six hun .. dred and forty tons , one mile . The allowance for the expense of ht*rses must be increased on the steep parts of the road , but the expense for the conductor is the same . In the above estimate a horse is supposed to draw fifteen tons on a canal , or what is equal to three hundred tons drawn one mile daily . Heavier loads are no doubt often drawn by a single horse , but we believe that this is fully equal to the average load . Taking together , therefore , the cost of locomotive power , and the necessary attendance of men , that which is required for tran*por*ation on a rail road is lower than what is required on a canal . // Transportation by a good rail road , therefore , must be as cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over canal transportation in its greater rapidity even in the conveyance of merchandise , and this advantage is of much greater moment in the conveyance of persons . It gives to rail roads a value for the conveyance of passetigers only , nearly equal to that which they have from the conveyance of property . They have the still further advantage of being less liable than canals to interruption . Canals are necessarily closed by frost four or five months in a. year ; and they are liable to interruption by droughts , and by the failure of their banks . Rail roads are not interrupted by frost , nor by a light snow . In some seasons they will be interrupted by deep snows , but the interruption will be much shorter than that to which canals and rivers are always liable . They may be interrupted by other accidents , hut the injuries to which they are liable are not likely to be so extensive , or to require so long a time in the repair , as those to which canals are subject . By opening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of business through a tract , of country two hundred miles in extent , filled with an industrious population , who rely in part on foreign products for their subsistence , and on the exportation of the products of their industry for their means of wealth , there can be no doubt that a new vigor would be given to the public industry , and a new value to the resources of the state . The population of the five western counties is t*bout two hundred thousand souls . Nearly the whole of this population would pass over some part of the rail road , on their way to the best markets for the sale of their products , and for the purchase of their supplies from abroad . An equal number of people , inhabiting the borders of Connecticut river in New Hampshire and Vermont , and the parts of Connecticut adjoining this state , would derive a similar benefit from this rail road . To these should be added the inhabitants . of that part of the state of New York through which the route passes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found that the number of inhabitants who would be more or less accommodated by this rail road , is equal to more than half the population of the whole tract of country which depends for the transport of its produce and supplies on the New York canals , including the whole of the northern and western parts of New York , and the western parts of Vermont . // The Directors , in their Report , estimate the cost of the rail road at a sum which may be procured on the credit of the state at an interest of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars per annum , and the annual cost of superintendence and repairs at fifty thousand dollars more . In their estimate of the income which may be expected from the use of the road , in the present state of the population and wealth of the country , they endeavor only to show that the business will be amply sufficient to produce this sum at very low rates of toll . They argue that if , in the present state of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the annual charges , including the interest on the cost , the additional income , arising from the increase of population and business which may be reasonably anticipated , may be relied upon as a fund for paying off the debt at no remote period ; after which , the whole income of the road will remain as a perpetual revenue to the state , to be appropriated to further improvements , or in such other manner as the legislature may direct . The whole burden and risk to which the state will subject its treasury , by undertaking the work , will be , the payment of the interest on such part of the debt as shall be incnrred before the road begins to afford an income , and the hazard that the income may fall short of the amc*unt estimated . Against this hazard , is to be set off the chance that the income may exceed the estimate , and the whole unincumbered income of the road , after the debt shall have been paid off . But this is not all . Another view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will result from this improvement , in the increase of business ; and the ' increased value of property in the state . The precise amount and value of these benefits can not be estimated ; but we agree fully in the opinion intimated in the Report , that , independently of the other advantages , from the increased facility of transacting business , the immediate increase of the value of real estate in the Commonwealth would be more than equal to the whole cost of the road . If these anticipations are well founded , there are twice the inducements which are necessary for this undertaking . The cost will be twice repaid , once in refunding that cost in the direct income of the road , and once in other pecuniary benefits which the citizens of the Commonwealth will derive from it . We have remarked that the Directors in their report attempt to show only that the annual income of the western road // in the present state of population will be equal to the annual charges , including the interest on the cost : This estimate appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they anticipate will be derived from the conveyance of passengers , and one fifth from the bu*iness between Boston and Albany , of which we have already spoken . The residue must be derived from the business of the intermediate places , and of all those parts of the country which will be in any degree accommodated by *t . The population to whom this road will *tfford the best access to a large market , in the whole or in part , can not be numbered at less than five hundred thousand . Of the income which may be derived from the business of such a population , some conjecture may be formed , by comparing this business with that done on the New York canals . The Erie and Champlain canals measure about four hundred and thirty miles in length , and their cost was ten millions of dollars . The amount of tolls received en them , the last season , was eight hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars , and the preceding year eight hundred and fifty-nine thousand dollars . It appears from the last report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1st of April to the 19th of December , a period of eight months and fifteen days , and that this was the longest period of navigation , which has occurred in any season . In this period of a little more than two thirds of a year , these canals have afforded an ilicome which would be sufficient in four years to pay the whole cost of a rail road from Boston to Albany . We know that some persons have adopted the belief , that the people of New England have nothing to transport on a rail road or canal , and that on this account the work here proposed will bear no comparison is its advantages , with the great canals of the state of New York . They appear to forget that the people of the interior of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , and Connecticut , live as well , and in their mode *f living consume as much ( and we might , perhaps safely say much more ) of foreign merchandise , and products of the seaboard , as the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals . To enable them to pay for the articles thus imported , they must carry something abroad , of . the produce of their home industry . These exports , it is true , do not consist of two or three great staples , like the wheat and flour of New Ye*k , and they are perhaps in general not so // bulky , in proportion to their value as the present products of the northern and western parts of the state of New York , which . are in a larger proportion the fruits of agriculture . Many products of the interior , however , which are of great weight and bulk in proportion to their value , will be transport*. ed on the rail road , such as wood , timber , charcoal , and lime . Besides these articles , there are now transported a great va*iety of coarse manufactures of wood and other materials , pork , butter , cheese , and live stock . There are now annually brought to Brighton for the supply of the market of Boston and of the neighboring towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep , and twenty-two thousand swine , weighing twenty thousand tons ; . a large proportion of which are brought from the west . These might undoubtedly be brought most economically , either dead or alive , upon the rail road . With the present means of transportation , the produce of the interior , carried abroad for sale , must be sufficient in amount and value to pay for the supplies brought from abroad for the consumption of the inhabitants . It is well known , that the people of the interior of Massachusetts and other New England states are accustomed to use for their subsistence , not only all the foreign productions which are in common use by the inhabitants of the western parts of the state of New York , but several other articles from abroad which the inhabitants of that part of the country produce* for themselves . Among these articles - are flour , salt , and plaster . Singular as it would have seemed a few years ago , a very large proportion of the farmers of these states depend in part for the subsistence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distant states . Salt is obtained by them from abroad exclusively , but the people of the western part of New York procure their whole supply of this article , as well as of flour , at home . The inportation of these articles adds very materially to the amount of transportation , and a greater quantity of articles must be exported to pay for these imports . From these facts , and from what is well known of the habits of living among the inhabitants of the interior of New England , it may be confidently inferred that they require a greater amount of transportation , for the sup* ply of their families , than the same number of inhabitants in the parts of the country through which the New York canals pass . We have already spoken of the comparative amount of // population accommodated by the two improvements . It is a low estimate to compute the number of those who will transport their supplies and produce upon the Western rail road , at half those who depend on the New York canals . The average distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed half the average on the canals . If , therefore , we suppose that half the quantity of merchandise transported on the canals , will be transported on the rail road , and that the average distance of the transportation will be half , the amount of tolls , if charged at the same rates , will be one quarter , or two hundred and ten thousand dollars per annum . This ; it should be remembered , does not include the estinfate for pas .. sengers , as the amount of tolls for passengers on the canals is inconsiderable . To this mode of calculation it may be objected , that in the estimate of the population accommodated by nleans of the canals , we do not include the inhabitants of Ohio and the Canadas , who live beyond the terminations of the canals , and *ecelve a part of their supplies through them . To this we reply , that the proportion of merchandise which will be carried through the whole course of the rail road , for the supply of inhabitants not included in the number supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than that which is carried through the whole course of the Erie canal to Buffalo , and through Lake Champlain to Canada . The whole amount of property received at , and transported from Buffalo on the canal , in 1827 ; was short of twenty thousand tons ; and in 1828 , the amount was still less . The amount conveyed to and from Canada , through the Champlain canal , is not known , but it is undoubtedly less , with the addition of the amount belonging to persons residing west of Buffalo , than the amount which will be transported to and from Albany , over the whole course of the rail road . if , therefore , we are correct in our premises , that the population of the interior of the New England states requires as great an amount of transportation ( including the supplies of flour , salt , plaster , and raw materials for manufactures , and the new exports of wood , marble , lime , and other heavy articles which the rail road will enable them to make , ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York , our conclusion can not be denied , that , at the same rates of toll , this transportation will afford an annual income of more than two // hundred thousand:dollars , independently of that which will be derived from the conveyance of passengers . - The estimate in the report of the Directors , is but little more than half this amount . Their estimate , it will be observed , is made at the low rates of a half cent and a cent a ton per mile , whereas 1IW canal tolls arc nearly all at the rate : of : three cents a mile for the transportation upward , and . t.hetgreater par1* aL the rate of lines deleted // of persons will travel on a given route , in a very different state of things from any which has yet existed . The number here assumed is apparently a moderate estimate . At any rate there can be no hazard in considering it as certain for the present purpose ; for if the number should fall short of this estimate , the toll on the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving them to anyother mode of conveyance . There are some other parts of the Report of the Directors , on which we intended to have made some remarks ; but this article is already drawn out to too great a length . The Reports of the engineers show that their investigations have been thoroughly , carefully , and scientifically made , and the results are very clearly and satisfactorily stated . These Reports contain a vast deal of topographical information , which will be useful for other purposes than those for which the surveys were specially made . The inquiries and calculations for the estimates appear to have been very elaborate , and we believe they are made on principles which entitle them to the strongest confidence . The care with which all the reports are elucidated by maps and plates is deserving of commendation . These are so complete as to render every part of the Reports perfectly intelligible .
