txt ART X.-dcademies of drts ; a Discourse delivered on Thursday , . Miay 3 , 1827 , in the Chapel of Columbia College , before the JV'ational . /Icademy of Design on its First . /lnniversary . By SAMUEL F. B. MORSE , Presi-. dent of the Academy . New York . G. &amp; C. Carvill. 8vo , pp. 60. 1827 . WE hope the name which this Society has assumed , may be found hereafter more appropriate than it appears now . A . N'ational Academy may be understood to mean a public instita-. tion , founded and supported by the nation , or a private association of the first artists of a country . This Academy is of neither of these kinds . It is simply a society of artists in the city of New York , organized for the purposes of exhibition and instruction . As such it is a respectable and praiseworthy beginning ; and as we heartily wish success to such an undertaking , we regret the more that they have made so great a mistake in the selection of their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a claim of distinction which , we must say , is out of proportion to their merits . Nor do we think it is quite time for them to adopt the initials of their institution as a standing title . The N. A. would do very well in the catalogue of their own exhibitions , to distinguish the works of its members , but we find it affixed to their names in that of a private collection , given in a note to this discourse . This , though a trifle , seems to us very ill judged . The practice has been // tolerated only in Societies , which have established some reputation ; and even in those cases , it is a vanity of which their members begin to be ashamed . What would be thought if Mr Stuart should choose to call himself National Portrait Painter , or Mr Aliston should take the style of National Historical Painter , and write accordingly after their names , N. P. P. and N. H. P. ? Yet they would but he claiming the rank which others yield to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of those , who have dignifled themselves with it , as it is injudicious in its application to the best . It is unjust , moreover , to the reputation of the country . A foreigner could not be much blamed for judging of the state of the arts in America by the National Academy established in the first city of the Union . Nor could he be expected to examine very carefully by what right such a name is borne by this Society . Yet the Academicians could not be willing , that their works should be thought by strangers among the highest efforts of American art . They have given themselves a name , which means , in the common use of language , the great institution of the United States for the arts of design . What may happen hereafter in this particular , we pretend not to foretell ; but at present this new Academy comes somewhat short of deserving such a title . Mr Morse 's Discourse is short and appropriate to the occasion . It consists of a very brief sketch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , with remarks , chiefly contained in the notes , on the state and prospects of the arts in this country . We can not agree with the author in all these remarks . Some of them seem tinctured with a degree of dissatisfaction and jealousy , for which we think there is no occasion . He complains bitterly of the practice of buying old pictures , as tending to the neglect of living merit ; insists on the inexpediency of any but professed artists intermedling with the government or direction of academies ; and deplores the hard fate of the American artist , who , after cultivating his art in foreign countries , returns to find his own so far behind him in taste , that he is doomed to starve in unmerited neglect . This is all unreasonable and mischievous . We call upon facts to bear witness for us , when we say , that our artists suffer neither from the neglect nor the interference of others . Not // one of them , who could maintain any reputation in Europe ( we mean well earned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a very promising young man ) , has lost it by a return to America . There is no undeserved preference for the works of old or foreign painters , and no want of patronage for those of our own . We do not pretend to know all the artists of the country , but we take such an interest in the arts , that we think we have heard of all the good ones ; and , as far as our information extends , we say , that they have nothing to complain of . The source of the mistake and disappointment of others is this ; our artists do but begin their education in Europe ; they are sent there as soon as they discover the first symptoms of genius , and before it is well ascertained whether it is worth while for them to go . There they seem at first to be making prodigious advances ( for in art , it is not the premier but the dernier pas qui coute ) , and , either from impatience or necessity , they hasten home to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they underrate the taste of the country , as it is natural enough they should , having left it before their own was formed . Besides , it is so much easier to learn to judge rightly than to paint well , that even with less opportunity , our judgment may at least have kept pace with the progress of their skill . A taste for the fine arts is but of recent , and has , therefore , been of very rapid growth among us. it is quite as likely , therefore , that the young artist , while learning his elements by a short stay in Europe , should fall behind , as surpass the taste of his countrymen ; and it is equally natural , that ifthere be any interval of separation between them he will consider himself most in advance . But let him be assured , that his works are not tried here by a judgment formed only on what has been seen in America . That judgment is founded chiefly on the opinion of those , who have had opportunities of observation , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have travelled in Europe to see and study the great works of art , has been rapidly increasing , and is now large . Our taste in these things is not of national origin . We have hitherto learned , and must long be content to learn , from older countries . A very few years , therefore , are sufficient to do away the difference between the taste or Europe and America . We have , in fact , made more progress in years , than other nations have in centuries , simply by adopting the fruits of their labors . It is very idle , then , for // any one to think , that by a few years ' residence in Europe he can so get the start of us , that his merit can not be understood here . It would be much more likely , that , led away by our admiration of foreign models , we should neglect the original beauties of the home-taught pupil of nature . We could give Mr Morse , in vindication of our taste , some illustrious examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patiently abroad , undazzled by their first success , and not content with the admiration of the ignorant , and who have not been disappointed or neglected on their return . Greater wealth , and more splendid distinctions , would have rewarded them in Europe , but nowhere could they have been more honored or valued than they are here . Nowhere could their works have been more eagerly sought at honorable prices . If these examples are too rare to encourage the desponding , let them at least believe , that in their profession , as well as in others , industry and perseverance will prevail ; let*them believe this , until they can find some examples of neglected merit to authorize their complaints . We have heard of starving and heart-broken genius in other countries , but there never was such a thing in this . The most liberal encouragement is offered to every hope of excellence , and that very liberality has , in many cases , by taking away the sting of necessity , destroyed the promise it would have fostered . No artist can expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek them , if he is entitled to them , in the great capitals of Europe . We can not make him a prince , or even a knight , nor endow him with ' personalnobility , ' like those , whom Mr Morse mentions as examples of European munificence . But we can offer him all the country has to give ; repfatation , respect , and competency . If these will not satisfy him , he must take Mr Morse 's advice , and not return . The American artist , ' says he , may go abroad , but he must not return . ' Before his foreign acquirements can be appreciated , he must go back to the point from which he started , take the public by the hand , and lead them on to the eminence he has attained . He may go abroad , and adorn other countries with his works , and the history of his own , with an imperishable name ; but if he returns , it will be at the peril of his happiness and his life ! Does any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifies it ? We never heard of any who pined and died after this manner . // We should give a different advice to the young artist ; we should counsel him , if he has the means , to go and faithfully study his art where it is most successfully practised ; and not to be in haste to return for fear he should grow too wise to be understood . Let him not only study but practise in Europe . Merely drawing in an academy , and copying a few masterpieces , will not enable him to return with credit and success . Hundreds of students do these things , and do them well , who are never heard of as artists . He must labor long and hard , with the best means of improvement around him , if he hopes for distinction in his own country . And then he may return without fear of injustice . But one thing we repeat to him , and let him not forget it ; no attainments which are not sufficient to support and raise him into notice in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere student of foreign academies will not at once be hailed as a master on his return . If he were , it would more clearly prove that deficiency of taste of which Mr Morse complains , than even the neglect of real merit . Something in the same spirit , Mr Morse deprecates the intervention of any but professed artists in the management of academies . We doubt whether he is right in this . We are inclined to look on this exclusion , as one cause of those bad effects , which he admits to have proceeded from ill-constituted academies. it tends to the formation of a school ; which is little else than a system of errors and deviations from that imitation of general nature , which can not be too exact even for ideal beauty ; there is but one nature , and there can be but one true way of painting . Artists may differ , indeed , in their choice of *uT'jects and circumstances ; but independently of these , their peculiar manners are chiefly their peculiar defects . Yet it is exceedingly difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a favorite system of art . In the same scene , one painter will see nothing but light and shade , while to another it will seem full of color . Fuseli , no doubt , thought he was painting naturally , when he imitated humanity so abominably ; and his students , if they had been confined to his instructions , would have learned to see in nature the contortions and extravagances of their master 's imagination . But the fact , that the defects of great masters are apt to mislead learners , is as obviously true in painting , as in everything else . And it can hardly he doubted , that , if academies exercise any // influence , those under the sole direction of artists will be more likely to sanction and perpetuate their errors , than those which admit in their government connoisseurs , who may be , at least ; more impartial judges of nature than her professed imitators . But even if this he not so , the exclusion is impolitic . Artists can not establish themselves in defiance of that portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works ; nor hold themselves entirely independent of those , who support their exhibitions , and buy thQir pictures . It is essential to their success , that they should inspire others with a love of ' their art , and diffuse as widely as possible the taste necessary to enjoy it . These associations are highly useftil in this way , if they are freely opened to all who are desirous of promoting their objects . But if the direction of them is , by the jealousy of artists , confined to their own number , others will soon be weary of their share in establishments , where taxation and representation are so little united . Where a taste for the arts is already widely diffused , such a system may have some advantages , but where the taste is to be created , a more liberal course would be more expedient . In this , as in other particulars , the difference . of the two countries seems to have been overlooked when the Royal Academy is proposed as the proper model of such institutions in America , There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improperly with the peculiar province of the artists , and they might often be useful as mediators or umpires between contending parties . They would be the defence of the meritorious against any of their brethren , who might otherwise pervert the power and influence of the academy to selfish or party purposes . That such differences and oppression may exist in theseinstitutions , is well enough proved by their history , particularly by that of the same Royal Academy , whose example is thought to sanction this exclusive system . There has been but very lately a revolt in this institution , which withdrew much talent from its exhibitions . What has been the result , we do not know , but it may be presumed to have been unfortunate for the seceders , however just might have been their complaints . Such occurrences might often be prevented by the , intervention of disinterested directors ; and when they happen , they lead to consequences much worse , than an occasional deviation from correct taste , even if that were to be feared from the admission of such mediators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other professions . But in this he confounds associations for the mere regulation of practice , with institutions for the promotion and improvement of art . Besides , the fine arts are things that we can live without , while unhappily law and physic are necessary evils6 The arts , to flourish , or even to exist , must be made agreeable to others besides artists . Others must be taught to love and to judge of them , before they will afford a subsistence to those , who practise them ; whereas , it requires no combination between doctor and patient to induce the latter to be sick ; nor do clients quarrel and go to law because they love to hear the eloquence of their advocates . If the infirmities of mind and body , which support these two learned professions , needed encouragement by the establishment of academies for their developement , no doubt the practitioners would be too lib ' . eral to engross to themselves all their advantages . The clerical profession is a more analogous case ; for its necessity , though great , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where their power and influence were not secured by the strong arm of authority , called into their associations the pious and sober-minded of the laity . As to the purchase of old paintings , which is another subject of long and vehement complaint in the Notes to this Discourse , ' we must again differ from the author . No disease , ' he says , has infected infant art so inveterate , , and so retarding to the progress of taste , as this . ' Many quotations are added to show the little chance there is of any genuine old pictures being procured now , and the bad effects of collecting them , even if they could be obtained . Mr Morse does indeed , among his censures , introduce this cautious salvo ; that he would not by any means altogether condemn the collecting of pictures by the old masters ; ' but he clearly thinks it much better to employ living artists , and even without much regard to their merit . To this effect he cites twice with great applause , from Opie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever were uttered , namely , that he who employs the humblest artist in the humblest way of his art , contrihutes more to the advancement of national genius , than he who imports a thousand cItefs-d'a*uvres , the produce of a foreign land . ' The correctness of this assertion , ' adds Mr Morse , is abundantly proved by the practice of those noblemen and others , who stand first among the encouragers of art in England . ' The examples // given of this practice , are the purchase by three noblemen of Aliston 's Uriel and Jacob 's Dream , and of Leslie 's Saul and the Witch of Endor ; which , instead of being humble works of humble artists , are , two of them at least , among the finest pictures of modern times , and by artists who stand at the very head of their profession . When such pictures are neglected , because they are not old , or foreign , Mr Morse may well be indignant ; but it is a very different question , whether it is expedient to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so . If good American paintings were left unsold , because others of less merit were bought , or for any other cause , we would join heartily in censuring such illiberality . But the fact is not so . The real want in America is not so much of good patrons , as of good painters ; and we doubt very much whether Mr Morse could tell us of a single good , not comparatively but absolutely good artist in the country , who does not , or might not by industry , receive a compensation for his labors in full proportion to that gained by other professions . We know of no good pictures left unsold . And if it is supposed , that we ought here to be content with a less de*ree of merit , and buy pictures which could not be sold elsewhere , we think it is a great mistake . Why should we do so ? It would improve neither the taste of the public , nor the skill of the artists , but degrade the one , and retard the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humblest way of his art , ' is encouraging national genius , just as much as paying an honest pains-taking tinker for spoiling his work , is encouraging national ingenuity . If the artists could do better elsewhere , they would not stay here for the pleasure of complaining ; if they could not , they have no cause to complain . As to the genuineness of the imported pictures , we should not differ much from Mr Morse in his final results , though we think they depend but very slightly upon his long and grievous preamble of frauds and impostures . For he admits , after all , that there are many good pictures of old masters in the country , obtained in Europe from genuine sources , and that a fine picture still finds its way occasionally across the water , and is added to the collections of professed dealers . This is the true state of the case , and we put as little faith as he does in the undoubted originals , which are sent here by hundreds to be sold by auction . But Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he has not very well examin // ed the causes . When he speaks in person , indeed , it is chiefly of his apprehensions of what may happen ; but we think his fears are quite unfounded . Let him look at the horrible lamentations and prophesyings of Barry , Opie , Shee , and Hoare , which he has quoted , and then consider that , so far from having become the receptacle of trash and counterfeits , England is hardly surpassed by any country in her treasures of ancient art . We are not much alarmed by the stories told in the notes of Mr Astley , and the officer of more wealth than judg-. meat , that paid a fortune to a London dealer for a gallery of the works of the most reputed masters ; ' nor do we in the least believe the episode , contained in the same extract , of a starving English painter , who was taken up by a modern-antique factory at Amsterdam , and accidentally found by them to be such a genius , that they were obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was employed on pictures in his own manner , to be kept on hand for a future period . Such wholesale imposture can not be carried on here ; and as to the little misnomers that actually take place , they are not of consequence enough to make it worth while for any one to disturb his own tranquillity , or the innocent complacency of the purchasers . The course of this business in our own city has been this . We have , in the first place , a few small collections of good , . and , we believe , genuine , old paintings . Many of these were procured in Europe at a time , when such acquisitions were more easy than they are now . A few years ago we had two or three importations , and among them some good pictures ( whether originals or not is of less consequence ) , which were bought at prices , probably not greater than they were intrinsically worth . The modern English paintings sold about as well as those which were called old . Both kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great regard to their names . Perhaps there were some mistakes made in that particular ; but not more than there would have been in buying as many works of our own artists . Since that time , there has been a flood of trash sent here for sale , too miserable to deceive any one ; and it has been sold for prices as miserable , or carried away to a better market . All this time the works of our own artists have been taken up at their fair value ; while , on the other hand , several fine old paintings , well authenticated as the works of masters , have , for want of pur // chasers here , been sent to England for sale . We know of but one native production of great merit being lost to the country , because its value was not understood . The loss of these really fine pictures we regret , more than we should , that a whole generation of half-taught pretenders should be- starved into some more useful employment . Some of our remarks may seem harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts . We would by no means be illiberal to our own artists , who give any promise of excellence ; but there is no propriety in encouraging them in false taste or mediocrity . We would hold high the standard of taste ; as high as it is in any place . We would not have the arts degraded even in favor of the artists . And so far are we from approving of anything , which is said to discourage the importation of old and foreign paintings , that we wish still greater facilities were afforded for it . If the old masters were , as we believe , better than the painters of our day , their works should be the models on which to form the public taste ; and we would have as many of them as possible . And the same may be said of the modern paintings of foreign countries , so far as they are better than our own . We are not prepared to see the American system , as it is called , extended to literature or the arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Painting and sculpture are not among the necessaries of life . Much as they improve and adorn society , a taste for them is not eve , n the necessary accompaniment of a high degree of civilization . That from the earliest recorded time , and in almost every nation , rude or refined , it should have been the occupation of a portion of the community to imitate the forms and colors of nature , shows some native propensity in the human mind favorable to the cultivation of these arts* But whether they shall flourish or decay by the intellectual and moral improvement of society , depends , as far as we know , on no fixed law of our nature . They are powerful means of such improvement , and not the necessary consequences of it . A taste for them must not be expected to grow without care and cultivation . And undoubtedly the best means of promoting such a taste , is the exhibition of those works , which show of how much these arts are capable . The better the specimens we see of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage their progress ; and the greater interest we shall feel in the labors of our own artists . // The love of the arts is , moreover , greatly dependent on remote associations . No man can be thoroughly imbued with it , in our times , who has not seen the wonders they have wrought in times past . For ourselves , at least , we confess , that we should feel comparatively little enthusiasm for sculpture and painting , if we had seen none but their modern productions . They would lose much of the poetical influence which they exert over our minds . We attribute this , not so much to their inferiority in modern times , as to their associations with the history of the past . All painting and sculpture remind us , in some way , of those older works of which we can never think without delight . If Claude , Salvator , and Poussin were forgotten , landscape painting would he much degraded from the high place it now holds ; and even historical composition owes much of its elevation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple in its forms and uniform in color , and architecture , the principles of which seem so little founded on nature , depend for their interest on the wonderful works , that have come down to us from a . yet more remote period . Without these secondary attractions , we fear that the fine arts would languish and die in these busy and practical days . We have lost many of those sources of excitement , which produced the masterpieces we admire and imitate . Nothing but the contests of the arena could have called out such counterparts of nature as the Fighting and Dying Gladiators , or clothed in such perfect human forms the ideal beauty of the Apollo and . Antinous . It was not merely the opportunity of seeing the naked figure in all its variety of action ; though that enabled the ancients , ignorant as they probably were of anatomy , to attain in their statues a correctness , which all the science of the moderns has failed to reach ; but it was their perfect enthusiasm for athletic exercises , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture the wonder and despair of succeeding ages . So to the enthusiasm of a pompous religion , which no longer exercises its dominion over the imagination , we owe the masterpieces of historical composition in painting . Inanimate nature is still unchanged ; and therefore landscape painting has failed less than any other , except portrait , which is the natural growth of busy and selfish society . But even landscape painting requires for voi , .. xiv*-wo. 58. 28 // its perfection , like descriptive poetry , a secluded and contemplative life , which becomes every day more rare and difficult . We can not , therefore , join Mr Morse in his confident anticipations of the triumph of American artists over the most transcendent efforts of European genius , ancient or modern .. That our country will equal the contemporaneous works of others , we are well inclined to believe ; though we can not but see , in our peculiar situation , peculiar disadvantages . But we can hardly hope that the masterpieces of ancient art are ever to be surpassed here or in Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less favorable to the highest efforts of the imagination . We live in an age of utility . Everything which tends directly to improve the phys ical condition of man , and develope his reasoning and active powers , is cultivated with zeal and success . The most stubhorn obstacles of nature are yielding to new and tremendous enginery . What were her impassable barriers , have become highways ; and the fabled works of the giants are surpassed by the power of knowledge . Education is sent abroad into all classes of men , to make them feel their strength and use their reason . All this renders the world populous , prosperous , and happy ; but it is at the expense of much that we love , and much that elevates and refines the feelings . In this cultivation of the reason , the imagination loses its power . Eloquence , poetry , painting , and sculpture , do not belong to such an age ; they are already declining , and they must give way before the progress of popular education , science , and the useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work about which the world is now occupied , is accomplished , a new school of art of proportionate grandeur , may arise ; but we fear that its best days are past . We can not but rejoice at this progress of society ; still we must wish , that the good it brings might be purchased without so great a sacrifice . We would not withhold the light of knowledge , for fear it should dissipate the most poetical phantoms of the imagination ; but we may be allowed to look back on their old haunts , laid open to the vulgar day , with some feelings of regret . This influence of the age may be doubted , because the disposition to encourage the arts seems still to remain unimpaired in the public . But its earliest effects must not be looked for there ; the mind of the artist is its first victim . It chills his enthusiasm , and discourages him from attempting , what per .. // haps he might still perform . He works under the fear of a cold-blooded judgment , which represses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders . To what else can it be attributed , that the princely prices which the works of the old schools still command , have not brought into competition with them modern productions of equal merit ? When sums are paid for single and small pictures , which would be an independence to an artist , why is there not in all Europe , nay , why has there not been for more than a hundred years past , a single one whom we can place on a level with the old masters ? The decay of eloquence is , perhaps , an even more striking example . Argument is almost all the oratory of our times . Premeditated appeals to feeling and passion have lost their power . Even the most popular assemblies must be convinced before they can be moved . We have grown cautious and suspicious , and are apt to distrust the orator , when he would win us to his side by any exhibition of emotion . We take pride in subduing our feelings to our reason . Every public speaker must feel this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a cold sort of argumentation . Accidental opportunities for great excitement still occur , but no one can now rely for success on the susceptibility of his audience . It is the same with poetry ; it has almost ceased to be produced , and its popularity has sensibly declined , even in our short da*r . The last that has held any dominion over the public mind , owed much of its interest to the personal character of its author , with which all his works were colored . The practical and historical details of the Scotch novels have already eclipsed it . There are , however , other causes , which have had their influence in degrading modern art . While the whole costz.tme of the actual world has become less adapted to the arts , dramatic acting has been carried almost to perfection . The stage has been made so fascinating by its wonderful exhibitions of talent , that artists have either voluntarily chosen their models from it , or have by habit insensibly lost the power of distinguishing between true nature and these brilliant imitations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in France and Italy , where it has sunk the art of painting into a gaudy puerility and affectation , of which we hardly know how to express our contempt . This cause has probably operated in fact less on English art , because the*people are not so much attached and habituated to the theatre , as the French . But the English schools // of tragedy and acting , seem to us so much more natural than the French , that the fault is not so striking there , when it exists . That it is a fatal fault , is obvious ; for it is copying a caricature instead of the original . Even the best acting can never be a true transcript of nature . The character and sentiments of the drama are poetical and exaggerated . It is in that , as in painting , necessary to color heyond nature to resemble her ; and when that exaggerated copy is made the model for another , the departure from the original becomes too wide for the imagination to reconcile . It has been said , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same with their historical painting ; they aim to show , not how their characters would look and act , but how they should be repr*sent*s . That the Italians , surrounded by the masterpieces of the arts , which their own country has produced , should have followed in the same course , shows how difficult it is to resist the influence of the actual state of society ; and that it degrades the mind of the artist , long before it quite corrupts the public taste , is proved by the fact , that the old Italian school is as much as ever admired , even in those countries where modern art is in the most deplorable state of degeneracy . If these views are correct , there is more in them to stimulate than to discourage artists . They exhibit no insurmountable obstacles to their progress . The peculiar difficulties that beset them , are in themselves , and therefore within their control . They live in an age unpropitious to the developement of that high enthusiasm , which produces the greatest works of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , but in themselves , if they are underlings . ' Great minds may resist even the pressure of the age ; nay , to resist it , requires only a steady pursuit of acknowledged principles . If the artist will not be seduced by examples , which he can not approve ; if he will disregard the fashion of the day and the practice of his contemporaries ; if he will confine himself to his profession , and so avoid the seductions of society , which would lead him away from the contemplation of nature , he may still redeem the reputation of his age and country , and place himself on as high an eminence , as he could have reached , if he had lived in the most favorable period . That this can be done , we think is about to be shown ; as much talent and enthusiasm as can be brought to the work have now been employed , in our own community , in one noble effort , for years of patient and persevering labor . // That it should fail is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these degenerate days , is a question of deep interest to all among us who love the arts . We pretend not to guess how far this work is to rival those , which have been so long the standards of excellence ; but of all the productions of art in the present age , we have no fear in predicting , that the greatest is behind and not far off . The subject on which our artists most need to be admonished , is the cultivation of the mind . Their great deficiency is a want of vigorous and poetical conception . The mechanical process of drawing and coloring is often well done , but the mind seems not to contribute its share to the work . It is owing to this , that so many have failed to redeem the promise of their youth . From the number who have made good beginnings without instruction , it has been thought , that there was a peculiar talent for the arts in the Americans ; but most of these were but examples of that mechanical ingenuity , which certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to convince the artist of this deficiency of mind ; but let him place a landscape , for example , of almost any of the living painters'by the side of one , of the old masters . He may find the drawing , coloring , and perspective as good , and per .. haps better ; but the difference between them is , that one is the work of the hand only , the other of the imagination ; one shows , perhaps even with less skill in the execution , and often in spite of injury and decay , a fine creation of the mind ; the other is a dull copy of what happened to be before the artist , or a composition of commonplace and unmeaning objects . The parts of one seem selected to fill the canvass with pictures que forms and colors , those of the other chosen for the ideas and feelings they are adapted to convey . The difference is like that between poetry , and mere musical verse . It is natural that as excellence in composition declines , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now paid to execution in painting , seems to us to have acted also as a cause in degrading the art . Success in that is comparatively so easy , and satisfies so many minds , that the attention of the artist is drawn from the more laborious task of invention . The common course of study too , gives an undue importance to mere skill of hand . It is all that can be taught by a master , and those who study under distinguished artists , are apt to be content with what they learn of them . This is one bad // effect , which we may attribute to all academies . They can but teach the form and manner of the art , and they attach so much importance to them , and reward excellence in them with so much distinction , that the student forgets there is anything else to be acquired . The facilities for such acquisitions have become very great , but these will not make an artist . The fine arts are works of the imagination , and the skill of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating to others , those thoughts and feelings , which distinguish the artist from the artisan . The mere picture-maker is not above any other nice workman . Even in branches of the art which seem bardly to admit of much invention or exercise of mind , their power is still enough to make all the difference between good and bad . No uncultivated man , whatever be his manual dexterity , can paint a good portrait , or even make a good likeness . The mind of the artist shines out even through his copy of another 's features . Great artists have sometimes begun their labors without intellectual cultivation , but they have never produced their great works until they had overcome the disadvantage . Their paintings were not the results of knack , or of mere practice , but of study , observation , and reflection . Claude began to paint late , without education , and in the lowest rank of life ; but we read afterwards of his habit of walking in the fields , not merely to observe , but to explain philosophically to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has preserved in his landscapes . Leonardo passed months in studying his unfinished picture of the Supper , without touching it . While we speak thus cautiously about the present claims of our artists , we would by no means be thought indifferent to their success . We should be sorry , if anything we have said should in the least abate the liberality of the public towards them . They must be supported and encouraged now , or we can expect no improvement from them . All we mean in the way of caution is , that this encouragement be governed by discretion ; and that it be understood as a stimulus to future efforts , and not the reward of present excellence . We have endeavored to repress what seems to us a repining disposition , founded on an overestimate of their actual claims ; but we would not be understood to say , that their rewards are beyond their merits . We have felt the more urged to the remarks we have made , because we thought that complaints like // those contained in this Discourse , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr Morse , at the head of an institution which must exert a considerable influence on those within its immediate neighborhood , might have , if uncontradicted , a most discouraging effect on the younger artists* And we confess , too , that , as part of the public , we feel aggrieved at what we consider the injustice as well as the in* expediency of some of the remarks . Even since we begaE this article , we have seen new proofs , that the American artist has no cause to complain of a want of patronage , in the liberal prices paid in Boston for several works of a favorite artist of Philadelphia immediately on their arrival . Still we would urge on the public the necessity of a liberal and untiring encouragement of the arts . They are eminently useful to the community . They are an ornament at home and an honor abroad . They elevate and refine the national character , and may even in turn protect the country that has fostered them . They have saved cities from fire and pillage , and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greece owes to her ancient arts , more than to any other cause , her still cherished hopes of independence . The strength of her citadel lies more in its architecture , than in its fortifications ; and her lost gods have done better for her , than her generals . But we hope it is superfluous to reason about the usefulness of the fine arts . We all feel and acknowledge the importance of a literature of our own , and the good influence of the arts is no less certain . Their effect on the reputation of a country is extensive , because they speak a common language equally intelligible to all nations . And though much more circumscribed in their operation than letters , they act more immediately on the character of a people . Painting , sculpture , and architecture are addressed to the whole mass of society ; and being presented directly to the senses , the ideas which they are capable of conveying , lose nothing of their power in the transmission ; while written language , at the best , can but excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions resembling those of the author . Literature operates on the few who seek its power , while the arts mingle their influences with the objects and pursuits of daily life . But as sources of pleasure , which , instead of degrading , elevate the mind , they make large demands on our gratitude and care . They occupy , in this way , a place so necessary to // be filled , that the nation , which can exist without them , must be , as the philosopher said of the man of solitude , much above or much below the common standard of humanity .
