DEDICATION . TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE BAR . This effusion of the imagination is dedicated , as a trifling tribute of gratitude for the numerous favours conferred on the Authoress ; who has ascertained , by occular demonstration , that , in the United States at least , a Benevolent Lawyer is not a phenomenon . Those Gentlemen of that honourable profession , whose friendship for her has withstood all the changes of her varying fortune , will , she trusts , receive it , as the only acknowledgment she can ever hope to make them , for disinterested services rendered her under a pressure of misfortune . Should they , in her fictitious characters , recognize a similarity to past events , they will receive a pleasure which only a truly benevolent heart can feel . That some among them will enjoy that pleasure , is the sincere wish of their ever grateful . Humble Servant , M. CLARKE . PROLOGUE . Enters reading a play-bill , ( laughs , ) ha ! ha ! ha ! A benevolent Lawyer ! the lady is mad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a Lawyer to plead , and not to be paid , Would be so outree , it would ruin the trade Well really I think I must go to this play , To hear what the author is able to say In favour of Gentlemen 's hearts , of the Bar , With whom every writer of plays is at war . I 've yet got some cash takes out his money and looks at it , yes , a dollar I 'll spare , And go from curiosity only , I swear . These lawyers are really strange creatures , I vow , They quibble , and squabble , I can not tell how ; Turn white into black , and we think it all true ; Then face to the right , and turn black into blue , They throw out their squibs in the opponents face , And talk very loud the other side to disgrace ; They make all their speeches so devilish long , The jury ca n't tell the right from the wrong ; Then laugh at their client , if the cause he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's cost ; While the poor empty client is striped of his store , And swears he will seek out for Justice no more . But yet without Lawyers no man would be safe ; They keep in good order the thief and the knave .

A Public Walk . Enter Mr. Freeman and Mr. Cancel . Mr. Can . Mr. Cancel And so , neighbour Freeman , your opinion of the law is , that your ward can become eminent in the profession , acquire wealth and fame yet preserve his feelings and integrity unvitiated Ha , ha , ha ! Why you might as well think to put a handsome young wench before a looking glass and expect her not to admire her face and figure more than her mind . Principles , quotha , ha , ha , ha ! interest , boy ; mind the main chance ; that 's what I tell Frank Freeman ; and faith he is a shrewd fellow . He will never pay interest for principle . No , no ; my ward is a sharp , money-making lad , and will shine at the bar : No drawbacks of conscience , fine feelings , or philanthrophy , will ever impede his progress through the world . Money , money , is the object that attracts his attention . Oh ! he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , well , let him unenvied enjoy his wealth ; but if my Charles can aid the oppressed widow , and protect the injured orphan 's rights , my intentions in placing him at the Bar will be fully realized . I can give him a competence , and in my opinion , an inordinate portion of wealth is only a heavy weight of care . Can . Mr. Cancel Then heaven send me a large portion ; I never thought care was a pleasure before . Ay , ay , that 's the reason your wits and authors are such a happy set of mortals ; their spirits are not depressed by a nover load of wealth ; ha , ha ha ! good ! wit and money would be too much ; so they generally contrive to keep the wit and get rid of the money . True . Mr. Trueman Ha , ha , ha ! why neighbour Cancel , your purse can not be very heavy , as your wit is so keen . Can . Mr. Cancel You are mistaken there , neighbour Trueman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five and four make nine , nine and three make twelve , and ten times twelve make one hundred and twenty thousand dollars cash , all safe in bank stock , besides bonds , mortgages , houses and lands . No , no , neighbour , mine is solid wit , heavy as real estate , parchments , and bank securities can make it ; none of your keen , hungry wit , that cuts as it goes , like a painter 's diamond on glass . ( Aside . ) Oh ! Lord , I ca n't forget the old trade , but I must sink the shop . True . Mr. Trueman ( aside . ) I am glad he owns he is rich . He can not now refuse to assist poor Mrs. Campbell . Ill-fated Maria ; blest with every gift of heaven , beauty , mind , soul and sentiment ; affections ardent and sincere ; honour and integrity ; why are you then doomed to constant misfortunes ? ( Cancel catches the last word , misfortunes . ) Can . Mr. Cancel Ay , ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to keep out of her company , she shall never enter my doors again ; I have not met her these twenty years . True . Mr. Trueman Then you ought instantly to fly to her . Think of her poor children ; perhaps homeless and wanting bread ! How dreadful ! Indeed , neighbour , you ought instantly to take her and her children home to your plentiful abode ; consider they are your own flesh and blood . ( Very animated and feeling . ) Can . Mr. Cancel ( frightened ) If I do , damn me ; ( spitefully , ) Oh ! Lord , Oh ! Lord , take home misfortune and her brood ; why a house three miles in circumference would not contain them . True . Mr. Trueman ( perceiving his error . ) You mistake her , sir ; sorrow has reduced her vanity , but her pride is I think greater than ever ; but that indicates a superior mind ; such never sink under afflictions , but generally contrive to rise superior to them . Come , come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her children , until her husband returns . Can . Mr. Cancel ( aside , trembling . ) Egad , he 's as mad as a March-hare ; I must humour him till I can make my escape ; ( looking towards the door . ) Why yes , neighbour , it 's all true enough vat you say . Glass will hold if there is putty enough round it , if the putty is not too dry ; but who the devil was fool enough to marry that ugly jade ? ( All this time he is trying to make his escape ; as he walks Trueman follows him . True . Mr. Trueman Ugly ! why she is beauty and nature personified ; she is every thing man can desire in woman , except rather careless of what she possesses ; that is her only fault . Can . Mr. Cancel Mad , stark mad ! How shall I escape ? Oh ! if he should bite me ! But I will humour him , ( aside . ) Why , ay , neighbour Trueman , Miss Fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard her . True . Mr. Trueman Miss who did you say ? Can . Mr. Cancel Why this beautiful Miss Fortune you speak of . True . Mr. Trueman ( aside . ) He is mad , that 's certain ; poor old gentleman , how I pity him . Looks kindly at him ; he keeps back , trying to get out ; Mr. Trueman following him , keeps him in misery . ) Enter Gripe , with a green bag . Gripe . Gripe Sharvant , gentlemen ; vat is it o'clock ? True . Mr. Trueman Past one . Can . Mr. Cancel I am half past twelve . ( Asids to Gripe , ) I am right ; do nt mind what he says ; his head is rather deranged ; talks quite wild ; I wish I could get away . True . Mr. Trueman ( aside to Gripe . ) O , dear Mr. Gripe , I fear our friend , Mr. Cancel , is a little deranged in his ideas ; rather flighty ; I wish you could get him home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out unobserved . ) Gripe . Gripe Why he shays you are sthark mad , and wishes to get away from you . True . Mr. Trueman Ay , ay , it is natural to judge others by ourselves , but I assure you he talks very much at random , says his ward shall sacrifice principle to interest , calls his neice , Mrs. Campbell , an ugly jade , declares misfortune is a beautiful woman ; and says I know not what about glass and putty . Gripe . Gripe Natural enough all dish ; as he hates Maria for her poverty , and ish by trade a houseglazier , glash and putty are familiar to him ; put I should not wonder if he would go mad , as his conshience must be very troublesome to him ven he dinks of Maria Campbell . Poor thing , I musht hasten to her relief . True . Mr. Trueman Why what now , any new misfortune , are her children sick , or herself ? Gripe . Gripe O , no , all ish perfect health , nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musht shupply , and I shall have a rich return ven the ship Wenus arrives ; ninety per chent. interehst , properly secured ; none put the landlord can get a sixpench ; sho I musht keep the rent clear ; I am going to pay it now ; goet tay . ( Exit . ) True . Mr. Trueman ( solus . ) Mercy defend me ! ninety per sent interest for money . Poor Harry Campbell he may plough the ocean , but this harpy will reap the harvest How can I assist her ? She is as independent as she is poor . What a burthen she must have on her mind ! Pride , poverty , and ninety per cent . interest ! My neck bends at the idea . Enter Sam Old-school , drest in the plain old fashion . True . Mr. Trueman Where now , Samuel ? Sam . Sam Old-school To market , sir , this is the day to get every thing dog cheap . O , I understand how to manage farmers ; never take a servant behind me to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you every market-day by that ; it is a good thing to have a faithful servant like me to manage money properly ; why young master Charles , and my Scrapegrace , cost you more money than all the family at home . Ah ! it is a fine thing to have a managing servant that does not waste your property . True . Mr. Trueman Hark ye ! Samuel , how much do you save for me in the week , say you ? Sam . Sam Old-school ( pompously . ) O , laws , sir , I cant tell you that ; a great deal , I dares say ; a matter of six dollars a week . Ah ! it is a fine thing to have a good servant like me , to take care of things . True . Mr. Trueman Hem , Samuel , come here , my old boy ( Samuel runs to a distance . ) Sam . Sam Old-school Old boy ! Why , Lord , sir , you might a well call me the devil . True . Mr. Trueman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jest . Sam . Sam Old-school ( softened , laughs and coughs ) . Well , well , sir , there is no harm in a jest ; I love a good joke myself , but it is so long since we were boys , that I had forgot how the name sounded . I am , let me see , fifty and ten make sixty , and , no , no , sixty and ten are seventy : ' t is sixty years since your good father saved me from going to the poor-house , buried my dear mother at his own expence , and sent me to school . Ah ! he was the truth of a good man . No frolics , no flights , like ( looks significantly at him , laughs , ) True . Mr. Trueman Why , you old sinner , what did I do more than sow my wild oats . ( Pauses . ) Ah ! poor Maria Dudly ; there 's the rub Sam ; ( emphatically , ) but I would have married her had she have waited till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man by introducing her into the family in his life time , and the five hundred pounds I gave her got her a husband better calculated to make her happy than I was then . You know I settled five thousand pounds on the child if it lived , or to revert to the mother at its death ; but I often wish I knew where they were , although during the life of my dear Caroline , not a thought derogatory to the duty I owed her ever entered my mind ; yet since her death , I often wish to learn what became of Maria Dudly 's daughter , and when my long fits of the gout confine me to the house , I feel rather disagreeable ; for nature and conscience will be heard , and felt too , Sam . Sam . Sam Old-school I think I did better that let my wild oats die , and married old Phoebe , the housekeeper What did it matter if she was thirty years older than me ? Why she only had the more experience , and died the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her wealth . Why , lord , sir , she had a matter of a thousand dollars in bank ; all of which I have saved for Dick , and put more to its for I never spend my money , nor Dick shant neither , while I live ; but fegs the market will be over before I get there . ( going . ) True . Mr. Trueman Stay , Sam , I want to talk to you . Do you know Mrs. Campbell , the poor lady in our neighbourhood , with the two pretty children ? ( Sam looks at his master rather sternly . ) Sam . Sam Old-school Yes ; what of her ? True . Mr. Trueman Why , Samuel , I was thinking , ( hesitates , ) I was thinking , that as you are such a marketer , you might just as well lay out these odd six dollars you save out of my money for her , as she do nt seem to be too rich . Sam . Sam Old-school Mercy , mercy ! what do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , springing . Remember I have one foot in the grave , and when I die with age you may tremble with fear . Oh , Lord , sir , why you are sixty three years old come next Christmas . You were in petticoats when my blessed old master took me to wait on you , and indeed I cant think of having any thing to do in this business . Go to market yourself for that purpose . ( Exit in a rage . ) True . Mr. Trueman ( solus . ) He is mad too . Egad the name of Maria Campbell deranges every bodies ideas . Oh , here comes my rattle headed ward Charlotte Friendly , happy as youth , health , fortune , a generous heart , and good spirits can make her , though egad I believe Charles has given her heart a bit of a twinge . Enter Charlotte Friendly . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly How do , Guardy ? Why you look as fresh as an Otaheita rose , and were it not for those icy pendants round your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but where is Charles ? why I have not seen him for seven ages . True . Mr. Trueman At his office : study , study , girl , that is the way to acquire fame , fortune and dignity . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Oh , hang dignity , I hate it , why it is as stiff and as formal as Miss Mactab in the Poor Gentleman , and as for Fame , why it is but a " sunbeam on water that plays ; " so who would waste the precious hours of youth to acquire what in a moment may vanish ; and as for the ugly blind jade Fortune I do nt believe Charles cares the waving of a feather for her frowns or smiles . His soul is too noble to be influenced by the paltry desire of gain . It is your commands confines him to old Coke , Blackstone , and half a hundred of these ugly formal quizes . Oh , dear Guardy , I hope Charles wont be compelled to wear one of these huge curly wigs when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trueman Why Gipsey , what need you care what he wears ? Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Nay , Guardy , it is of no consequence to me , only he will look so ridiculous in one , that I am sure I shall almost die with laughing at him , in defiance of Madame Dignity and dame Fortune too ; so do nt be angry with me , for ha , ha , ha , I really cant help laughing at the idea , ( laughs . ) Oh , Lord , come Guardy , for there is my beau Frank Freeman , and I love to make a puppy follow me . ( Takes Trueman by the arm , and exeuent . ) Scene Scene changes to Cherles ' study ; he sits reading ; Dick copying letters . Charles . Charles Trueman ( lays down the book . ) Hang the law , what a dull , dry study it is ; I wonder why dad did not place me in a counting-house ; methinks a merchant , whose mind extends to every quarter of the habitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand channels , giving the means of subsistence to as many of his fellow men , is a much more respectable character , than a Lawyer , whose feelings are circumscribed to mean self-love , and whose ideas extend no farther than the courts of justice . What use can such a being ever be of to society ? Dick . Dick Old-school Nay , sir , permit me to controvert that opinion . Charles . Charles Trueman Well , proceed , I love to catch a new idea , and those that proceed from your brains , must be original ; so lay there Coke . while Old School commands my attention , and now , Dick , proceed ; convince me I am wrong , reconcile me to the profession , and I will pay your taylor 's bill at New Year . Dick . Dick Old-school Agreed , and now to the case , ( takes an attitude for speaking . ) First , law was founded on the principles of moral rectitude , with the view of preserving to every individual his property from depredation , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injury : and lastly , the dearer part of man , his reputation , from the malice of envy or the shafts of obliquy ; and can the study of a science , which secures to society its dearest privileges , be called a mere money-making art ? Can the man who voluntarily stands forth in defence of the injured and oppressed , be merely actuated by self-love ? Candour reprobates the suggestion : and I , Richard Oldschool , pronounce the law the most honourable of all professions . How say you , Gentlemen of the Jury ? ( to the audience . ) Are you convinced ? Shall not my client , old dame Jurisprudence , obtain a verdict in her favour ? ( bows to the audience . ) Charles . Charles Trueman Why your theory of the character of a Lawyer is natural , and in some points correct , but Dick what say you to those practitioners of your favourite science , who , for the paltry consideration of five or ten dollars , will boldly stand forward in defence of fraud , deception and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money , exercise the noble power of rethoric against defenceless women against that sex nature formed us to defend ? Dick . Dick Old-school Why that they are like all excrescences. and ought to be lopt off from honourable society . Charles . Charles Trueman Yet you admit there are such branches in the honourable fraternity . This convinces me it is a mere money making art , or such contemptible reptiles would not gain admission to the Bar of Justice . Dick . Dick Old-school But consider , sir , the depravity of a few of its members ought not to implicate the whole body , nor draw down contempt on the science itself , which is our only bulwark against the scorpions and drones of society . Where would truth , honour , ingenuity , or industry , find safety from fraud , imposition , and calumny , were it not for the wholesome and equitable laws that guard them . and punish the perpetrators of crime ? ' Pon my soul , sir , I think an honest Lawyer the most useful character in society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are of the same opinion . ( Knocking without . ) Oh , here comes visitors , to interrupt my eloquence . Enter Trueman and Charlotte Friendly . True . Mr. Trueman Well , boys , good morning to you ; here has this wild girl brought me , to inquire , as she says , whether all Lawyer 's heads are cased in wigs in the courts . ( While the old man is speaking Charles and Charlotte are exchanging civilities . ) Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Ah ! do , Charles , pray tell me , do all you barristers wear black gowns and huge wigs ? If so , you must look like a parcel of conjurors . Charles . Charles Trueman And why , Charlotte , do you make the inquiry ? You surely do nt expect to become a Lawyer . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly No , Charles , it was mere curiosity , for I thought how ridiculous your face would appear peeping out from under such a huge bunch of white wool . Charles . Charles Trueman And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of a man 's head , than four or five rows of lace or muslin quilled round a lady 's neck , or four rows round the bottom of her dress ? Trust me , Charlotte , the ladies trimmings of the present day , are really as absurd as the full bottom of a Counsellor 's wig appears to you ; for simplicity should ever be the handmaid of beauty , which is most admirable when least adorned . True . Mr. Trueman Your observations , Charles , brings to my mind a strange mistake I made the other day , on meeting Mrs. G. in the street ; her face was so obscured with ruffles , that I passed her without knowing her , as I could not distinguish her features for the lace that rose in a phalanx around her face , and she was quite offended at my deficiency in politeness . Dick . Dick Old-school Nay , sir , if the ladies will plant batteries of lace and muslin round their faces and figures , how can they expect old gentleman , or indeed young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I declare , a lady in full dress now , reminds me of my mother 's clothes-basket , after she had been ironing . Charles . Charles Trueman Why , Charlotte , it is the present fashion that compels many of our gents to wear spectacles , for fear they might make love to their sisters , instead of other ladies . Charlotte . Charlotte Friendly Ha , ha , ha , very well gentlemen ; I protest I will tell all you say in every circle I visit ; so look out , Charles , and prepare for self-defence . Enter Frank Freeman , bows . Frank . Frank Freeman From what , charming Miss Friendly , must Charles stand on the defensive ; the love darting beams of your heavenly eyes ? Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Oh , no , from them he is defended by lace and muslin ; so I can gaze on him safely . Frank . Frank Freeman Nay , aim not at the conquest of a philosopher like Charles , whose heart the cold precepts of reason has petrified to adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , no such ambition , at present I can find butterflies enough to divert me . Frank . Frank Freeman A stoic like Charles here , can please none but himself . Charles . Charles Trueman Freeman , for the sake of common sense . desist from this folly . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Are you going to the ball to night . Charles ? Charles . Charles Trueman I have not determined ; do you go ? Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly I believe so . Frank . Frank Freeman Permit me to have the honour of being your partner , Miss Friendly , to night , and I will be as punctual as your shadow . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly And as unsubstantial , Frank ; I never make promises , for fear I should break them ; come Guardy , I have fifty visits to pay this morning . True . Mr. Trueman Mercy on the girl ! it is one o'clock now , and at three we dine ; you will never get through the half of them . Char . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles aside , laying her hand on his shoulder . ) You will come to night , man of marble , will you not ? Charles . Charles Trueman When you command , what man dares disobey ? I will attend you . Char . Friend . Charlotte Friendly Come Guardy . ( Takes his arm . Exuent Charlotte Trueman and Frank . ) Charles . Charles Trueman Charming woman ! her beauty is her least attraction , but that , when united to soul , sense , sentiment , sensibility , and a noble mind , renders her an object too dazzelling bright for men to look upon with aught but mental adoration . Blest , blest , will be the man who shall be honoured by becoming her protector for life . ( Sighs . ) Ah ! Charles , glance not at such an event , for you can never hope to be the favoured mortal . ( Exit , musing . ) Dick , Dick Old-school ( solus . ) There goes as very a Romeo as ever penned a sonnet to a lady 's eye brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a purling stream . It is droll faith ; here 's my poor master and Miss Friendly dying in love with each other , and both are tongue-tied ; she wont speak first , and for his soul he dare not ! Ha , ha , ha , thank heaven I have no such false delicacy about me ; no , no , I am in love , and out again , ten times in a week , with every pretty girl I meet ; aye , and tell them so too ; oh the dear little souls ; with their roguish curls and smiling faces ; now they set a man 's heart on fire ; now for a promenade in the park to admire them . ' T is woman , lovely woman , sooths the heart , With softest rapture , words can not impart . ( Exit , brushing up his hair . ) ACT II .  --  SCENE I. A parlour in Cancel 's house . Enter Mrs. Love rule and Cancel . Mrs. Loverule in a rage . Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule Peace man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! say you , and happy ! the wretched child of infamy and shame , thus to tower above me ! her whom I hate , for her father 's sake , with deadly rancour ! This is indeed too much for human patience ! Who and what is her husband ? Can . Mr. Cancel A man of respectable family ; commands an East Indiaman out of this port . Mrs. Love . Mrs. Loverule Is he rich ? Can . Mr. Cancel No , but in a fair way to acquire wealth and fame ; happiness is already his , for he adores his wife ; his sister resides with and respects her ; their friendship is inviolate ; her children love and obey her . Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule Hold man ! utter not the discordant sound ! it grates upon my car , and will drive me to distraction ! Happiness , fleeting , illusive phantom ! long have I pursued you , but in vain ; for the instant I think you in my grasp , when every end is attained , you elude my embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach your airy retreat . Heigh ho , ( sighs . ) Misery , misery , lurking misery , envy , and despair ! despair , black as hell , are the inmates of my aching bosom ! The dawn of day awakes me from a pillow strewed with thorns , to reflection , bitter reflection ! and the retrospections wring my soul with agony ! Oh ! ( sobs hysterically , ) when will the sleep of death close these wearied eyes and ease my tortured brain ! Yet Maria can sleep ; yes , for she is innocent and a mother ; her children 's smiles are her opiates , and a doating husband 's arms her pillow ; his affections , her shield from every danger ; not founded on fading beauty 's power , but the charm that never dies , truth , innocence , and integrity . Oh ! George . ( Wildly . ) Can . Mr. Cancel Say on , and I will hear thee . Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule Was it not my commands that Maria should receive no education , but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it I find her thus ? Was it for this I enriched you , to cherish a viper , who , in her father 's image , lives to sting me ? Can . Mr. Cancel Nay , sister , the fault was not mine ; I assure you I never gave her any education , but my ward , Frank Freeman , secretly instructed her , and my wife , who you know was a kind hearted soul , united with him in her improvement ; and their friendship contributed to place her in the situation she now holds ; for Harry Campbell was Frank 's school-mate and companion , though several years his senior . Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule Knows she you are her Uncle ? Can . Mr. Cancel No . Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule ' T is well . Can . Mr. Cancel I am glad you are pleased at last . ( Aside . ) Thank heaven ! I hope the storm will blow over ; I wish I could escape from her ; what a fury she is ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Loverule ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria must not drink thus sweetly of the cup of pleasure , least it cloy and pall upon her appetite  --  can we not contrive to throw in a small portion of acid , mixed with the tincture of aloes ; sweet , sour , and bitter , compose a pleasant beverage , which we might present her  --  what say you ? Can . Mr. Cancel I am incompetent to dictate , express your wishes , and I will obey , if possible . Mrs. L Mrs. Loverule Can we not rid her of a portion of this fond fools affection . Jealousy is an agreeable cooler to fever 'd heart , it stings and rankles in the wound . Then the gentle zephyr of poverty might fan the fire of passion , while the tears it extorts would aid in extinguishing the flame . These children , two sweet buds of wedded love , they might be pruned and sent to that better world above ; there I shall never , never meet them , and perdition will lose a portion of its horrors . Can . Mr. Cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why hate jealousy and poverty ? I might aid in administring , but beware , murder ! Innocence must not bleed . ( emphatically . ) Mrs. L.

Where shall I see those charming innocents , I long to feast my eyes with a sight of the grand children of him who led me from the paths of virtue , betrayed and then forsook me , for another ?  --  ( Walks about distractedly . ) Oh ! the agonies of that moment , never will they be forgotten or forgiven ; but where is the wretch ? yet hush , mention not his detested name , you know who I mean . Can .

Mrs. Loverule Fire and furies , you torture my heart your words are daggers to my soul  --  speak , knows he Maria is his child ? Can . Mr. Cancel If he did , how would his heart exult with pride and pleasure ; then would every plot against her prove abortive . Mrs. L.

Sally . Sally Why poorish kind of folks , that live like nobody . C. F.
