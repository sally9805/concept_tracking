txt 11 . The Westminster Review. -A new quarterly publication with this title has been commenced in London . It comes out with a bold and spirited attack on the Edinburgh and Quarterly , charging them with having pursued a partial and narrow course , looking to certain ends not the most honorable , moved only by the interests of party , and having little sympathy with the spirit of the times , or regard for the literary wants of the people . In the introductory article , written with strength and in a high tone of liberal feeling , many deep reflections are made on the characteristics of the times , the changes now going on , the progress of national politics , new developments of the human powers , and the kind of writing , which the present state of inquiry and the present habits of thinking demand . Two declarations are set forth by the conductors of this Journal ; first , that they will be devoted to no party ; and secondly , that they will echo the public voice . We have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introductory article . That the spirit and manner , in which the leading reviews have been conducted , are susceptible of improvement , is implied in the present attempt to increase their number . Our hope of success is grounded on that greater conformity with the spirit of the times , in all its honorable peculiarities , which is allowed by our freedom from the trammels of party . Such a publication as we project , seems to us to be called for by the voice of the people ; of whom we are , from whom we have no separate interests or objects , and to whom , though we can not sacrifice a single just principle or personal conviction , we heartily devote our efforts in the pages of the Westminster Review . Let us be tried by our country. * p. 16 . Their political tone may be understood from the extract , which we are about to make . After a series of remarks on the influence of the press in diffusing knowledge , and exeitin* mind to act on mind , till the prodigiously increased importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman , the sermons of the divine , the lucubrations of the author , and the criticisms of the reviewer , * we are presented with these statements . It could not be expected that political power should remain the exclusive and undisputed possession of the few , after the many // had once begun to feel , and make felt , their importance . Nations and governments are just in the middle of a warm controversy on this point . The question is increasingly interesting to all rulers and all subjects , and the combined power of the former is marshalled against the combined intelligence of the latter . The theory of despotism is more offensively stated , and more broadly asserted than ever . Despots have more than ever made a common cause of it . These facts are not so alarming as they have appeared to some friends of liberty . The principle of legitimacy was never so asserted before , because never before so controverted . The combination of despots was never before so complete , because their monstrous usurpations were never before in such peril . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and with such agents they may oppress and execute for a time , but can scarcely hope for ultimate success . The people are becoming aware that they too have a common cause . The world is divided into two great classes , the oppressors and the oppressed ; and the members of both classes have their Holy Alliances . Any stretch of prerogative , in any country , is felt as a victory gained by every member of the great monarchical conspiracy . Any popular advantage is a triumph for all nations . There is less of that narrow and selfish patriotism , which used to exult ln the slavish condition of other countries . It has given way to a nobler feeling  --  to sympathy with all who are struggling to be free . It begins to be reckoned as good a thing for the Greeks to win a battle , as for the Opposition to carry a motion . In either case , the common enemy is beaten . Foreign politics and home politics lose their distinction . At home or abroad , there is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of a single question - are kings to be everything , or shall the people have a voice in the direction of their own affairs ? Different answers make a division paramount to that of party or country . The cause of liberty is one and indivisible . The sympathy of its friends is characteristic of the present age . The consolidation of their union may emancipate a future generation. * p. 3 . It is a favorite topic with these Westminster reviewers , that everything is bending to utility , that the people are taking the lead , and the intellectual , as well as political world , is daily falling into their train . Certain kinds of studies are going out of use , like antiquated words , and must soon become obsolete . The intellect of the age , that portion of it , we mean , which is de* voted to literary and . scientific pursuits , is chiefly directed towards subjects which are generally interesting to a population thus advancing in knowledge . Our authors have a vivid and constant consciousness of belonging to a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wilderness . Its tenant is no longer ab // stracted , even in his profoundest speculations , or wildest imaginings , from the society of his fellows . It is no longer a cell in the cloister of a monkish fraternity  --  the literary few , who were all the world to every individual of the brotherhood . He has now the " kingdom for a stage ; " and there is a wider fame than their praise , and a louder peal than the anticipated echo of posterity to their voice , in the immediate and immense plaudits of the multitudes who constitute his auditory . ' Of course , in lists of new publications , the article CC Politics " always appears splendidly attended , and drags along an almost interminable train of titles . The character of the times , however , is not so distinctly marked in this as in the subjects , style , and size of the works announced . The writers are evidently pleading at the bar of the public , and not at that of the legislature or the aris$ocracy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from the high ground of theory into the broad field of practical utility . Or if they theorise , it is not on the origin of society and rights of man , but on the principles to which it is sought to reduce the multitudinous and seemingly conflicting facts of political economy . The degree of interest felt in them by the public is the great regulator of our studies . Tbe abtruser branches of mathematical science are comparatively neglected . We care not to toil after truth for truth 's sake ; but must first know what use we shall make of it , and what get by it of fame or profit . The geometrical purists are making their parting bow , like other gentlemen of the old school . The short cut of analysis has superseded the circuitous route of strict geometrical demonstration . It is not Euclidian , but it solves the problem , and that s enough . The ancient method is said to have been a fine exercise of the intellectual faculties ; but so , it is replied , was the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine exercise of the walking faculties , yet now every body goes the new path . Nor has the art of reasoning ( especially if we are to judge by the works which some of the greatest mathematicians were so unfortunate as to publish in unscientific matters ) suffered more by the change than the art of walking . Accordingly , propositions are established , and theories demonstrated , and problems solved , and questions answered , as Bonaparte took towns and destroyed armies , in the most expeditious and businesslike way , in defiance of old rules and old masters . The byes of the triangles have waxed cold . Their suitors affect them , not for themselves alone , but for their properties in navigation or p. 9 . Having thus shown how the wisdom of the present age has found a more direct road to truth , than the 01 ( 1 one through the . dark re // gions of mathematics and geometry , the writer disposes of meta. physics in a similar manner . Few persons study ontology . Little heed is given even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of its faculties . They are too remote from public interest and public utility , to have many votaries . A supposed connexion with religious doctrine keeps some opinions on this subject a little in grace ; and they have the additional recommendation of occasionally being instrumental to the raising of a clamour about materialism , atheism , and French principles , against some obnoxious geologist or anatomist ; but this purpose answered , they go back to the armory of the friends of " social * to accumulate rust for a future execution to rub off . Practical treatises on education succeed better . They harmonize with the spirit of the age . We take man as he is , and make the best we can of him , and read those who assist us in so doing . The rest is considered perhaps somewhat too exclusively , as " not germane to the matter ; " or if the relationship be made out , still it is a quarter from which there are no expectancies , and therefore no account is taken of it . This cui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreverence on the Greek metres , and has much reduced the number of classical quotations . Even Greek and Latin must be made subservient to some obviously useful purpose of history or science , or they are pushed from their stools . The wig that is stuffed with them must wear well , to win either praise or a purchaser . The multitude does not understand such matters ; and the literary world only cares about what the multitude does understand . ' p. 11 . Poetry , too , has been carried away in the tide , and swallowed up in this vortex of popular utility . The vox populi conquers all ; it has called the muses from their retreats , and compelled them to walk in the plain , rugged pathway of common life , to become familiar with rude and homely things , and to sacrifice the dignity of retiring greatness and unbending principle to a love for mingling in the crowd , and drinking the sweet sounds of vulgar applause . Such is the power with which the popular voice is armed . All our great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choicest specimen . Not that he is entitled to rank as the first living poet ; but his productions exhibit many of the characteristic marks to which we refer , more glaringly than those of his contemporaries . His tales of war , and chivalry , and love ; the unelaborate and universally perceptible melody of his verse ; his resort to nursery tales and vulgar superstitions in preference to the stores of classic history and mythology ; his recklessness of the charge of plagiarism , and free use of commonplace expression or description , whenever it serves his purpose ; his frequent disregard of the niceties of language and of rhyme ; and the bold outline by which he aims at ef // feet ; these , if we add to them from Byron the Kean-like expression of the most violent passions , an occasional mixture of the vituperative and the burlesque , and ever recurring hits at the popular topics of the day , will furnish a pretty complete picture of a poet moulded by the spirit of the age , and bearing the image of his creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school , or rather to be himself the whole school ; of Campbell to secure the suifrages of men of refined taste ; of Moore to charm young ladies ; and of Southey to promote the interests of his employers ; - have modified this influence on them , which the structure of their minds seems also less calculated to receive ; yet its impression is on them , broad and deep . They sing for the many ; except that Wordsworth seems rather to chaunt a demonstration to the initiated few that the many should be sung to . Cowper was the herald of this revolution . He first disused the conventional phraseology which poetry had been schooled to use , and bade her " speak right on " in the language of nature and simplicity . He was unconscious of what he did ; and wrote , not to please the people , but to please himself , one of the people . Pursuing the latter object he attained the former . Wordsworth aimed at the former , and succeeded in the latter . This reformation of the poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taken altogether , which have resulted from the increased number and different character of the readers of poetry have made it of more intrinsic worth , is very questionable . It is not , however , for the present generation to quarrel with bards , who in their eagerness to secure its plaudits are ready to " jump the life to come " of posthumous reputation . ' pp. 12 , 13 . From these extracts we suppose our readers will have a pretty accurate understanding of the objects proposed in this new work , which comes forward with no humble pretensions , and which , if the first number may be taken as a sample of what is to follow , may justly assume a high tone , and speak at least with some show of authority . As to being of no party , a position in which the reviewers take pains to make it appear they stand , this is a very good string to strike in the beginning ; it will vibrate with notes of melody to the people 's ears ; but the thing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . Whoever are not for the ministry are against them ; ministerialism is party , and opposition is party ; there may be different shades of opposition , and consequently different gradations of party ; but still , it is party , and nothing else . In the present number we have a eulogy on Cobbett , and one or two clever hits at the Holy Alliance . It is among the ingenious attempts of the reviewers to show , that the present leading parties , the ministry and the opposition , both aim at a tyrannical aristocracy ; each in its own way , to be sure , // but each on nearly the same principles . Much labor and ingenuity are bestowed to prove , that the entire strength of the Edinburgh Review has , from the commencement of that work , been expended in building up the aristocracy of the opposition , which , if it were on the throne , the Westminster reviewers affirm , would be no better than the aristocracy of the king and nobles . Both these aristocracies are hostile to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Charybdis ; a shipwreck is inevitable on either side ; and it is the generous purpose of these reviewers to steer the people*s bark in safety amidst the perils to which it is exposed . In short , their work may be emphatically styled the People 's Review ; they are of the party of the people ; but , after all , this is a party ; and by the reviewers ' own showing , it is a party marked by much stronger lines of distinction from the other two , than they are from each other . In regard to America , the Review has taken a liberal and independent ground . In this country we have been so much accustomed to the studied injustice , and intemperate abuse of the English reviewers , when anything pertaining to America has come under their notice , that we have long ago been taught to regard with almost equal indifference their censure and their praise . In the present work are two articles bearing on this country , both of which are written with candor and fairness . They show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American affairs , than could have been desired , yet the spirit is good , the intention honorable , and the general representations as accurate as could be expected from the materials on which the reviewers relied . They make a formal attack on the late article in the Quarterly , which professes to he a review of Faux 's travels in America . This article they treat as an American would have done it , expressing the utmost indignation at such a tissue of impotent malice and hardened falsehood , such a farrago of miserable spleen and nauseous slander , which , in the whole thirty two pages to which the venom of the author is spun out , contains not a hint to show that he knows anything of the subject on which he proposes to write , or has a rega rd for truth , character , or the common principles of human nature . T he man , who could write such an article , is to be pitied for his imbecility , despised for his mean , malignant temper , and shunned as a scorner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject the Westminster reviewers speak as follows . Now a more base and mischievous falsehood , than that conveyed by the totality of the article now under consideration , it is impossible to conceive ; base , because in the face of repeatedly conflicting statements contained in the very book referred to , the reader of the article is induced to believe , that the book contains none but unfavorable representations , and he is told ( p. 368 ) , that the reviewer // has given " but the smallest portion of the unfavourable account of the American population ; " - mischievous , because by every species of insolence and contempt , endeavors are made to exasperate against each other two nations , who have the strongest interest in preserving the relations of friendship . ' p. 252 . Alluding to the kind of evidence on which the libeller in the Quarterly rested his slanders , the reviewer observes , Who-unless it be one whose intellect has been blinded by existing abuses-is ignorant of the leading principles which assign the various degrees of trustworthiness to the various species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between direct testimony and hearsay ? What child does not know , that in passing from mouth to mouth every story either gains or loses so much , that after a certain number of transmissions it is often difficult to recognise the original narrative ? Now at least one half of the facts , selected with such care by the Quarterly Review from Faux 's journal , rest , not upon Faux 's own observation and direct testimony , but upon no better evidence than mere hearsay , and that of the weakest and most unsatisfactory kind ,  --  the babble of loose talkers , tavern companions , and disappointed projectors . Great reliance is placed by the Review on general assertions hazarded at random , collected from few or inconclusive particulars , and mixed up with the foolish opinions of foolish individuals , and yet after having been at the pains to devote four pages to the rendering contemptible and ridiculous an individual , whose opinions Faux details at the greatest length , the writer concludes his article by ascribing to the opinions of others , so repeated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Faux himself , whose integrity and understanding are highly vaunted at the beginning of the critique . ' Ibid . The reviewer then goes on to show , by a few apposite and striking examples , how easy it would be to make out a blacker catalogue of crimes , and wretchedness , and infamy in Great Britain , than the libeller has strung together about America , if any body could be found base and wicked enough to engage in the task . The whole examination on the part of the Westminster writers is fair and impartial , and in a spirit of good feeling towards this country , which presents a strong contrast to the tone , commonly assumed by the various fraternities of transatlantic reviewers . We need hardly say , that we are glad to find a better spirit growing up in any quarter . A principal source of reproach and abuse thus far , has been ignorance of what America actually is . We do not remember having seen a volume , review , pamphlet , or newspaper notice of much length , printed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain numerous , and frequently gross errors , either in regard to our institutions , the practical routine of // our politics , or our geography , and statistics . Even the Westminster reviewers , who devote several pages to a series of statements respecting the expenses of our government , the modes of taxation in the several states , and other particulars , quote as authority Warden 's book on the United States , a work , which could only have been of value fifteen years ago , if ever , and a very great portion of which has nothing in common with the state of things among us during the last quarter of a century . The consequence is , that the re* statements and calculations are full of errors , and some of their conclusions false . They seem to have read nothing on the subject , but Warden 's book , and the President 's last message . If they intend to devote a portion of their pages to the affairs of America , it would be an object worthy of their care , now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of statistics , some of our best political journals , and to take an occasional glance at our maps . With knowledge from these sources , they may write on America , and tell their readers many truths of interest and value , which have never as yet found their way to the British public , because no channel has been open through which They could pass .
