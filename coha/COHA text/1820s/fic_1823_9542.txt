" The king comes here to-night ! " He who could wring Our hearts at will , was " every inch a king ! " For when in life 's bright noon , the stage he trod , In majesty and grace , a demi-god ; With form , and mien , and attitude , and air Which modern kings might envy in despair ; When his stern brow , and awe-inspiring eye , Bore sign of an imperial majesty ; Then  --  in the zenith of his glory  --  then , He moved a model for the first of men ! The drama was his empire : and his throne No rival dared dispute  --  he reigned alone ! " His feet bestrode the ocean ! his waved arm Crested the world ! " His voice possessed a charm , To love 's , to friendship 's , and to classic ears , Like the sweet music of the tuneful spheres : " But , when he meant to quail , and shake the world , " His accents were " like rattling thunders " hurled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove The worth of freedom , and the joys of love ! Whether he gave ungentle wives rebuke , As simple Leon , or Aranza 's duke , Or tamed ( as wild Petruchio ) the shrew , Or showed a fiend in the unpitying Jew ; Displayed the wrecks of passion 's withering storm , In stern Penruddock 's , or the Stranger 's form ; Whether he bid unnumbered victims bleed , " As Macedonia 's madman , or the Swede , " Moved as Iago , or the generous Moor , Or gallant Rolla , mid the battle 's roar , Stemming alone , the tide of war and death ; Hamlet , or Damon ; Bertram or Macbeth ; Gloster , Young Wilding , Falstaff , Charles de Moor , The graceful Doricourt , the gay Belcour ; Brutus  --  aye , both the Brutuses  --  of Rome ; Mark Antony , lamenting Csar 's doom ; The proud Coriolanus , or the sire Of sweet Virginia . Still his soul of fire With grandeur blazed , to ravish or appal  --  He " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reckless mien of Pierre , Or the time-scathed decrepitude of Lear , " Fourscore and upwards "  --  he might justly say , " Did n't I , fellow ! I have seen the day , " When , with the very lightning of my brow , " I would have made them skip  --  I am old now , And these same crosses spoil me : "  --  Yes , ' t is true He once commanded , where he now must sue ; For he 's old now  --  and those unrivalled powers For you exerted , in his happiest hours , Like flickering lights , which in their sockets burn , Are fast departing  --  never to return ! But shall he now , when silvered o'er with age , Who never made his exit on the stage But ' mid the thunders of heartfelt applause , Unhonored pass when he at last withdraws ? He , who devoted all his noon-day powers To strew your thorny path with classic flowers  --  He , whom with laurels you have richly decked , Shall he at last be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is Cooper 's right to claim  --  Besides the glory of a deathless name  --  Of your regard , a more substantial proof Than the loud cheers which shake this vaulted roof  --  Protection for his offspring !  --  dearer far To his fond heart than earthly glories are ; And you concede this claim  --  or else to-night , Here were not seen a galaxy so bright , Of beauty , taste , and fashion  --  ' t is a blaze Which so reminds him of his better days , That fond regrets , with gratitude sincere , Are mingled in the language of a tear . And as the worn " war-horse , " at the trumpet shrill , Leaps o'er each barrier that restrains his will , Impatient still to claim the hero 's right , The foremost post amid the desperate fight ; So comes our monarch of a former age , Again to claim his empire o'er the stage , From tyro potentates this truth to wring , He was and is " in every inch a king ; " With one bright flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his honored name .
