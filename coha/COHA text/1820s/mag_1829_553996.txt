txt ART . V.- Travels in the North of Germany , in the Years 1825 and 1826 . By HENRY E. DWIGHT , A.M. New York . G. &amp; C. &amp; H. Carvill. 1829 . Svo. pp. 450 . FOR the combined advantages of a temperate and healthful climate , richness of soil , extent of territory , grandeur of natural scenery , numerous and noble rivers , and variety of productions , Germany has no occasion to envy the rest of Europe . That beautiful country is inhabited by a hardy , persevering , intelligent , honest , pacific , though martial race , which has received from its climate , religion , and laws , as well as from circumstances , the character it has constantly displayed . Foreign civilization has necessarily caused some modification of the original type ; yet , the primitive features pierce strongly through the customs and manners adopted from the Franks , with whom the Germans were united , and from the other nations with whom they afterwards came in contact through commerce , wars , or travel . The delineation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found even at present far more accurate , than any that has been drawn of the moral condition of the French before their revolution , or of the Spaniards , thirty years ago . Not that from apathy or prejudice , or through the influence of religion or government , the Germans ever were remarkable for that inflexibility , or ( to use IXI. de Chiteaubriand 's expression ) that sta*nation of character , " which until recently distinguished the Spaniards ; but although an extensive and continual intercourse with other nations , together with a good-natured pliancy to foreign taste and fashions , sometimes modifies the earnest enth1lsiasin , the spirit of independence , the candor , and the bonhommie deeply impressed in the national character , these rarely become so adulterated , in any individual , as to be mistaken by a competent observer for the ardor of the Italians , the sentiment of political dignity in the British , or the perfect simplicity of heart and mind , which one would rejoice to find elsewhere than in Captain Hall 's account of Loo Choo . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up with a degree of shrewdness , in the confidence and placability of a German . The vehemence and depth of his feelings are seldom widely expansive , and are , therefore , when they lead to wo and destruction , fatal only to one or a few individuals . VOL . XXTX. - NO. 65. // Thus also national pride , and love of freedom , have not as yet shone in Germany , as in other countries , whose inhabitants are inferior in those qualities , which insure what that pride and that love seem to promise . Nothing has so much contributed to this , as the subdivision of Germany into a multitude of sovereign states . National glory had to contend with an ambition , which may be called individual , when tl ) C extent of the whole country is compared to that of any of the several states . time surprise or humiliation which a Prussian may feel , at being asked in Spain or in remoter countries , whether he is a German , must be greatly diminished , if he reflects on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national denomination and speaking ' the same language ; * and who are notwithstanding divided into numerous political bodies , which have powerful and almost inevitable motives to be reciprocally jealous , and sometimes in hostile array one against another . Yet this dispersion and consequent mutilation of force , and and an increasing difficulty of concentrating resources , which might seem to be intended by nature to remain for ever united , have been and will continue to be , the source of great moral and intellectual advantages . Universal empire has never yet produced to mankind real and lasting benefit , on whatever scale or at whatever epoch it has been attempted . It would strengthen the government to an excessive degree , he it more or less monarchial ( truly republican it could never be ) , and lower the subjects in moral dignity , hy which the national character , if it had once been great , would become debased , and , if weak , still weaker . It was , therefore , fortunate for Germany , that the endeavor of some of its early sovereigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy , became as fatal to them as similar ones have always been to the French ; that the scheme of some of the heads of the German Empire to lower the nobility , by the increase of the wealth and the authorThere is a singular exaggeration in Rees 's Cyclopmdia ( Art . Germany ) in regard to the several dialects and shades of pronunciation of the German language . " The tie of language was so weak , that the national hatred of the inhabitants of the Prussian domimons against those of the Austrian states , was as great as that which prevailed between the English and the French . " The writer might have mentioned truer and stronger motives for their political estrangement and popular prejudices . // ity of the clergy , soon induced an arrogant and ambitions Pope to conspire against the dignity of the Emperor ; that an interregnum reduced more and more the imperial dignity ; that the feudal subordination , which bound together divers members of the Empire , was loosened by l ) rix*ate wars ; that whilst the Emperors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they xvaated the private revenue , and would have sought in vain for the l ) ublic aid , necessary to recover the power which the immediate successors of Charlemagne and the Othos had possessed ; and that when the elective right was devolved upon seven princes , the jealousy of the nobility and of the free cities against the heads of the Empire , became the greater , the electors themselves sharing in this jealousy . Thus it was also a happy circumstance , that the clergy for many centuries were stron *lv inclined towards Rome ; that the power and wealth of the different states were very unequal , and that the Empire was unwieldy , as long as such a cause as the religions disturbances of the sixteenth century , or the personal qualities of a sovereign like Charles the Fifth were wanting to infuse into it an unusual spirit of vigor , enterprise , and harmony . The power of the Empire , ' says Machiavelli , in a memoir on the affhirs of Germany , is very great , but it is difficult to bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frightened by it reflect upon the few great things it has done for a long time , they must confess that little reliance can be placed on it . ' The causes of this inefficiency produced many advantages , which it was not the object of the great Florentine statesman to consider . Had Germany been what he xvished Italy to become ,  --  a single political body ,  --  Protestantis*n would not have made so rapid a progress ; and the vast consequences it has produced , would probably have been exclusively confined to England , a portion of the Low Countries , and Switzerland . However fortunate it might have been for the cause of religion , and the interest of the civil institutions connected with it , had no political views been mixed up with the reformation of its abuses , and bowever desirable it might have been that , whilst these abuses were era ( hicated , a sparing hand should protect the establishments which had their origin in the Church , it is still certain that , without political rivalry and without wars among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious toleration could not have prospered , at least so extensively and so rapidly // as it di4 , in a great portion of Germany , from the moment that a political schism broke out in the Empire . As soon as the triumph of Protestantism was secured , several branches of the German family partook of its immediate and remote advantages , in proportion as they were more or less imbued with its spirit , and yielded more or less willingly to its influences . In regard to internal and external polity , domestic prosperity , progress in literature and science , and the cultivation of natural resources , Catholic and Protestant Germany presented different degrees of advancement , but the most important features of the national character remained in both identical . The same causes do not produce the same effect in Switzerland , because the cantons in which either of the two religions prevail , are , in comparison with most of the analogous German states , too small to render inoperative the effect of the ecclesiastical system which they in preference maintain , and hold more closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affirmed , that , as neither the Catholic religion nor any of the Protestant churches has ever enjoyed anywhere in Germany , since the sixteenth century , an exclusive sway , and as the political spirit of the new doctrines has deeply penetrated the minds of those even who have tenaciously clung to the church of Rome , no portion of that country has remained without benefit from the greatest of all revolutions-that which emancipated conscience from imaginary crimes . There is , however , so much truth in the remark , that literature , industry , and education are in a more advanced state in the Protestant , than in the Catholic districts of Germany , that , by the habit of exaggeration so natural to superficial observers , Austria , for example , is almost ranked by some on a level with bigoted countries ; and because the hand of a suspicious government ( suspicious , in consequence of the diversity of the nations it rules , the embarrassments arising from a long existence , and its geographical situation ) weighs somewhat heavily in its metropolis , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the whole country as lying un* der the burden of a blind despotism and of a systematic ignorance . Such a representation , however , is vastly exaggerated . The difference of civilization becomes insensibly less striking to the view of an observer placed alternately in the Austrian and Prussian dominions , or in Bavaria and Saxony ; and if he // finds the agents of the police at Vienna too rude , he must not expect to be altogether without secret followers at Berlin . Economy prevails in all the German governments ; in private matters justice is administered , under every one of them , with expedition and perfect impartiality ; political crimes are seldom committed , and are certainly not encouraged , from vindictiveness or from an intention to strike terror in the minds of the people ; the shackles that impede the free action of industry are few ; the taste for military parades and for war has wonderfully decreased ; the higher classes are less haughty , since the lower prefer wealth and the influence it procures , to mere nominal advantages ; the oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve hardly any . Such is the general condition of Germany ; but the Protestant portion of it nevertheless displays more activity than the Catholic . There investigation is freer and more unrelenting ; the excitement of literature is greater ; and arts and manufactures vie in prosperity with agriculture . Learning , however , is not confined to Saxony , Prussia , or Hanover , though in Austria readers are less numerous . There is more repose in the latter country , and more intellectual life in the former . In Austria , ambition is the privilege of the higher classes ; in Protestant Germany it is to thousands the source of more enjoyments and also of more sufferings ; in Austria the government proceeds with secrecy to the same end , towards which , in the neighboring states , it has been found that public attention could he called without danger . With the principles that direct the Austrian government ( an Imperial aristocracy ) , a state may expect a long undisturbed existence ; whilst with those which guide the Prussian rulers , the safety of their political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a considerable degree on public opinion , and consequently need greater abilities and skill , though not more virtue , or better intentions . We have been led to these reflections hy the limited range of the excursion Mr Dwight has made in Germany . As his work treats of Northern Germany alone , we thought a few hints on the effects of the territorial division of that country , and of the reformation , and on the distinctive features of the Catholic portion would serve to remind our readers , that all which our author says is by no means applicable to the whole of Germany , although most of his remarks on the national character apply to the mass of its inhabitants . // Mr. Dwight considers the present Germanic confederation , of whose fundamental principles we shall presently give his own account , exclusively in its material force , and its aptitude , on that score , to fulfil tbe common purposes for which it must be supposed to exist , if we are to judge from the name it bears . In this point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet far from testifying either the high sagacity or the perfect sincerity of its founders . Contemplated as a barrier against France , the author is not unwarranted in doubting the scrupulous adherence of such a state as Nassau or Hesse-Darmstadt to the laws of the confederation , should it find itself in an emergency , which would leave it with no other prospect , than to be helplessly exposed to the horrors of war , or with little hope of escaping the subjugation of its enemy or of its allies . The army of the old Germanic Empire gathered few laurels . Nevertheless , the Germanic confederation was from its origin a wise and profound conception . But to view it in this light , it is necessary to dwell more on its moral source and moral tendency than on its physical 6apacity . Frederick the Great did no less by his wars of invasion , than by his predilection for French literature , to extinguish in the hearts of his countrymen every German feeling ; and his philosophical tenets , aided by the cosmopolitism and the irreligious spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely permitted his subjects to be Prussians , a*sd in no way Germans . Those who rejoiced at the humiliation of Austria , did not foresee , that dangers might spring up , which could only be overcome by a common resistance . The Empire was , in spite of its many defects , a means of union ; and even had Austria and Prussia been compelled to remain in a jealous reciprocal position , on account of their private interests , or the welfare of all Germany , still two leagues might have been organized , with sufficient physical means to resist the aggression of Russia and France ( the only two foreign powers that Germany had to fear , since Italy , Spain , and Turkey had ceased to he connected with its policy ) , and to balance the two principal German monarchies . When after an unsuccessful attempt of Joseph the Second to incorporate Bavaria with Austria , be sought to obtain it by an exchange for the Low Countries , Frederick the Great , even after the Emperor had abandoned his ambitious project , thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly to the security of Ger // many , to form a Germanic league , by a treaty , concluded in July 1785 , which France secretly promoted , and to which the only parties at the beginning were Prussia and the electors of Saxony and Brunswick , but to which afterwards several princes and states of the Empire acceded. * This league , known by the name of the League of Princes ( der Fi*rsten6und ) was essentially defensive , and had for its model those of SinaIkalde ( 1539 ) , the union of 1609 , and the confederation concluded at Leipsic in 1631 . The sagacious minister of Maria Theresa , Prince Kaunitz , became alarmed , and endeavored to counteract the designs of the great sovereign of Prussia , by proposing to the members of the bmpire a league with the Emperor . But that devised by Frederick was maintained , and only dissolved by the events which gave a new direction to the policy of his successor , Frederick William . Then , indeed , the attempt to maintain any such league would have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tranquillity and honor of Germany , and all belief in a general interest of the several German states , had already as little effect on the political combinations of the leaders , as on the habitual feelings of the people . This lamentable indifference for national concerns explains , better than the military enthusiasm and the revolutionary fervor of the armies of France , the conquests they made in Germany , and the disgrace with which they covered so many of its princes . A real national feeling did not show itself , particularly in Prussia , till the war , justly called the war of freedoer ( not altogether of civil liberty , as theorists and speculators might wish ,  --  but of political freedom , or more properly of independence ) . The first sparks of the holy fire , which , during that struggle , warmed a vast majority of the Germans , were visible in Prussia before the battle of Jena . The guerilla system was tried , and not without success , in Silesia , by the Prince of Pless , and the government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself carried triumphantly over the precipices with which it was surrounded . It was not so much from a fear of revolutionary commotions as from a want of energy and the novelty of the circumstances , that Frederick * The Dukes of Saxe-Weimar , Gotha nod Deux-Ponts , Mecklenburg , Hesse , the Bishop of Osnabruck , the Prince of Anhalt , the Margrave of Baden , and the Bishop of Mentz. // William did not , at that epoch , seek his strength where it really lay , and where the force of circumstances afterwards compelled him to look for it . During the negotiations at Vienna in 1814 , the most able statesmen of Germany , several of whom will ever deserve to be numbered among her most patriotic sons , were aware , that , unless some bond of union was created , the same apathy , the same disunion , and the same inability to act for a common object , would soon again influence the common destiny . The smaller states had been the most mischievous in the conflict with France . The hold politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins three or four great masses , fl ) ust not he accused of parricidal or ambitious designs . Machiavelli was certainly not a votary of despotism , though he wished that much power should be deposited in some quarter , for the purpose of liberating Italy from the barbarians . ' The reforms in the internal administration , claimed hy the advancement of society , might have been realized more promptly in extensive monarchies , than in a considerable number of small principalities . But the difficulties respecting Saxony proved too clearly , that such a chan6e could not even he tried by way of experiment , and that compactness , identity of interests , natural boundaries , and consequently a new division of Germany , for purposes principally relative to its foreign relations and to political reform , must he given up for the present if not for ever . Such being the law imposed hy existing interests , long habits , and prejndices , which could be neither disregarded nor reconciled , it appeared best to keep alive the national feeling by a machinery which wonld remind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bavaria , &amp;c. , there exists the common German fatherland . We are not , we confess , among those who regret that the former plan of organizing three or four great political masses , failed of success . We place greater hopes in the system that now exists . Its moral spirit , the sentiments from which it has taken rise , its capacity of being amended and enlarged , the means it has of calling out the energies of the nation ( though it seems at present not to have breath enough to disturb the slumbers of the most nervous ) , its resemblance , in one word , to other powerful engines , which conceal their wholesome or destructive energies , until touched by a skilful hand ; all these warrant its usefulness , its duration , and its gradual improvement . // Considered in this light , it has already become unimportant whether Meatz , a fortress of the Confederation , is garrisoned by the troops of one , two , or three princes , at an epoch so little remote from the time , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solicitude of those sovereigns who , on account of the greater interests they had at stake , were the most concerned in their own independence , and that of all Germany .

In politics , as in 1 ) rix*ate conduct , safety lies in prznczpies . Germany l ) ad none at all , as a body politic , at the beginning of the present century . It wanted a soul , and it was treated like a body without life by the reckless hand of revolutionary experimentalists . Russia displayed magnanimity , disiaterestedness , and solicitude for the preservation of peace , in contributing to the present j ) olitical system of Germany . 13y the treaty of Teschen , she had become a guarantee of the Germanic Empire ; - an office , which the treaty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia never has in any way abused . At the congress of Vienna , she forehore , not only to avail herself of her right to revive the preceding political organization , but generously contributed to the construction of the present Germanic body , without claiming , for the future , the influence which had been granted to her at Tesehen over the affairs of Germany . We copy from the work before us the prominent principles of the compact , which binds together the German confederates. 1 . Der Deutsche Band , or the German Alliance , has avowed its object to be the preservation of their own freedom . In doing this , the thirty-nine states which compose it , are mutually pledged to stIpJ ) ort each other in every defensive war . In war of conquest , or in one which is offensive , the other states are not required to lend any assistance to the aggressor . 2 .

If one of the states is threatened by a foreign power , and the danger apppears real , the Diet is required to adopt those measures which shall be necessary to protect the party threatened . 4 . The German Alliance has the right of declaring war in full assembly , whenever two thirds of the voices are in favor of it . 5 . If the majority of the diet decide that there is no danger to be apprehended from the conduct of a foreign power , and some of the states are still convinced of it , they have the right to take the necessary measures for resisting an invasion . 6 .

If one of these states , which has possessions not represented at the diet , declares war on its own account , as an European power , the Alliance are not required to render to that state any assistance . Should , however , the other German states be in danger from such a contest , they must , whenever a majority of the Diet shall think it necessary , assist that state , so far as is necessary , to protect the independence of the Alliance . S. After the Alliance has once declared war , no state , whether it has possessions out of Germany or not , can individually make peace or agree to a cessation of hostilities . 9 . Peace can be concluded in a full assembly only . ' p. 30 . The author ought to have qualified the opinion he ascribes to the Germans , in regard to the *veight of the Confederation in the affairs of Europe . It is not indeed viewed as very important by impatient reformers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politicians do not wonder , that the principal powers of Europe have regular diplomatic missions at Fraukfort . It is to he hoped that one of the earliest results of the new German compact , will be the removal of the obstacles which politically obstruct the navigation of the streams intersecting several of the German states . At the congress of Vienna , the allied sovereigns pledged themselves to leave entirely unrestricted the navigation of these rivers to their mouths , to all who should conform to the regulations under which this aifranchisemnent was to be granted . Among these rivers , the Elbe and the Rhine are of most importance in regard to external trade . The former runs through Bohemia , Saxony , Prussia , and Hanover , and falls into the German ocean . The latter rises in Switzerland , and waters Alsace , Baden , Hesse-Darmstadt , Nassau , the Rhenish provinces of Prussia , and the Netherlands . Under the stipulations of the treaty of Westphahia , the mantime // commerce through Antwerp and the ancient Spanish Low Countries was prohibited to the German nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had reserved to themselves by the treaty concluded with Spain in 1648 , as essential to their political existence . We need merely allude to the difficulties in which Joseph the Second was involved , on endeavoring , in 1784 , to open such a communication through the Scheldt . France , at last , paid him four millions and a half of forms , and the United Provinces five millions and a half , in order to make him desist from his pretensions , and to close again the Scheldt from Saxtingen to the sea , and the canals of Sas and Sxvin . The restraints that embarrass the navigation of the Rhine now consist principally in the tolls and taxes which the several governments exact from those who pass through their territories . A desire to protect local industry and to increase the public revenue by restrictions on foreign trade ( a political mistake , we must confess , though not everywhere censurable in the same degree , and at all times , ) is sufficient to explain the obstinacy with which some of the German cabinets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation , and at any rate renders it unnecessary to ascribe their conduct , in this respect , to a constant , systematic , and secret hostility between certain states on all subjects . The day when the Rhine shall become entirely free , will certainly open a new era in the commerce and industry of Germany . Already Prussia , from her coast on the Baltic , is endeavoring to soar to the dignity and independence of a sea-faring nation . Her flag is no longer unknown in regions that , during more than two centuries , had never heard of her as a maritime power ; and perhaps before long she will seek to obtain a colonial establishment in the West Indies , for the same purposes , and with the same advantages , as those for which Denmark and Sweden possess islands in that region . Struensee , the able minister of Frederick the Great , strove to produce these results , by several wise financial measures , and by the protection he granted to the national commerce . But the wars in which his successors were engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Secret History of the Court of Berlin contains curious details respecting the basis upon which Struensee endeavored to give to Prussia a new impor. * tance in the commercial world . // Leaving political topics , we proceed with Mr Dwight to G6ttingen , where he is naturally led to make many reflections on the studies , libraries , professors , and students of the German universities . In 1821 there were twenty-two universities in Germany , containing ten thousand six hundred students and eight hundred and sixty instructers ; and the number of both have so rapidly increased , that , in 1825 , the former amounted to sixteen thousand four hundred and thirty-two , and the latter to one thousand and fifty-nine . Catholic Germany , with a population of nineteen millions , had but five of these principal seats of learning ; and the Protestant portion , with two millions less of inhabitants , had sixteen universities . The medical students were more than one fourth part of the whole number . The duels and the clannishness , at the German universities , have become in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of Mr Russell 's interesting , but somexvhat prejudiced xvork. * The redeeming circumstances blended with these youthful extravagances , have not , however , been sufficiently brought into account . They will not seem illusory to those who know how insolent and overbearing the military was , until lately , in Germany towards the bourgeoisie , and how strong the barrier still is , which separates the nobility from the roture . At the universities , impertinent lieutenants become mild and reasonable ; and counts and barons mingle without scruple , and fraternize with those who have not even the von before their names . Although many of these young sprigs of aristocracy resume , after their academic studies , a true patrician coldness to their friends of obscure condition ( somewhat in the manner of the Spaniards , who leave at the foot of the Pyrenees , the fashions and manners they have adopted in another country , or of a high-born British traveller , who forgets in England the acquaintances he has made on the Continent ) , still equality has for some years been admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social intercourse , and consequently arrogance and prejudiccs have received a salutary check in early life , In a political and historical view , the German universities have as yet been very far from performing so considerable a part as those of Scotland , after the rei0n of the Stuarts , or Tour in Germany and sonic of the Southcrn Provinces of the Austrian Empire . By John Russell . // that of Oxford , not only under Cromwell , but in the more pacific times of the the two first sovereigns of the House of Hanover . A charge of indiscretion and insubordination against the former can therefore he grounded only on a few examples of obscure and private misdemeanor . The stain which frequent duels stamp upon the character of the German students is moreover diminished , in some degree , by the precaution they use to guard themselves on common occasions with sundry defensive implements . To protect the hand , ' our author says , a circular piece of brass or iron of six or eight inches in diameter , rises between the handle and the blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which come almost to the elbows , and of a leathern jacket corresponding with a breastplate , which is so stuffed and padded that a sword can not penetrate it . This descends below the hips and gnards every vital part of the body . Nothing but the face is exposed , as if it were the only part of the person worthy of being ornamented with scars . At this they aim all their blows , as it is considered unworthy of a Barscli to strike at the legs of his opponent . The seconds are arrayed in the same costume as the combatants . They place themselves on each side of their friends with drawn swords , and ward off those blows which defy the skill of the principals . Although not in the thickest of the affray they not unfrequently receive wounds themselves . ' p. 52 . The German students , as Mr Dwight justly observes , distinguish themselves , notwithstanding their fopperies , from those of France , by a breater care in their personal appearance . They come to the university with the consciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ; and if this be taken into account in connexion with the fact , that the most boisterous , on leaving the universities , are generally , throughout their whole existence , quiet and inoffensive citizens , some indulgence will be granted to the short period of their folly and youthful ebullition , during their first , and often their only enjoyment of self-government . The establishment of a university in Berlin was a subject of serious apprehension to many , who feared the seductions which so great a capital presented to the youthful appetite for pleasure . But no school of such eminence has ever risen so rapidly , or offers at present a more splendid prospect . It does great credit to the liberality and the wisdom of the Prussian government , and will cc vtailly prod nec wholesome results , not only in point of learning , but also in point of elegance an ( l refinement // of manners , an early taste for political transactions , attention to the public institutions , and enlarged patriotic views . The want of a university in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast extent to which learning had been carried , has produced but very few highly distinguished individuals in the diplomatic career , and that her present minister for foreign affairs was , in a measure , solicited from Denmark . Fifteen years ago the students of Leipsic were sneered at in Halle and G6ttingen on account of their effeminacy , or rather their intercourse with the Plzilisiines , as money-making people , and all those who are not of the learned classes were called . Although the students of the Berlin miniversity are , according to Mr Dwight , the most slovenly and negligent in their personal appearance that he had seen in Europe ' ( p. 193 ) , generally very poor , and almost exclusively devoted to their pursuits , we venture to foretell , that they will gradually improve in their external address by a free intercourse with higher orders of society than are met with in the smaller cities . We are less struck , than our author , with the great longevity of the literati of Germany . Heyne died at eighty-six , Kastncr at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kant at eighty , Jacobs at seventy-six , and the poets Wieland and Klopstock at eighty-one and at seventy-nine years of age . Goethe is now seventy-six . ' We could easily make out a numerous list of mathematicians of different countries , who have attained a very great age . Literature and science , cultivated with extraordinary energy and with an exclusive fondness , contribute so much to 1 ) eace and well-being , that , unless organic defects counteract their wholesome influences , the course of life is generally very smooth and long . Mr Dwight gives too much importance to the mild and uniform temperature arising from stoves ; although he would be right in pitying the poor student , born in Germany , who had to depend for heat upon a fire-place that requires constant care , that smokes , or scorches one part of his body , while the other is chilled with cold . The rooms of the German literati are generally too warm from the unceasing action of their stoves and tobacco-pipes , and a carelessness in renewing the air ; and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrangement . It is gratifying to learn , that the professors have now better // salaries and larger incomes than twenty years ago . Five or six thousand dollars are a large revenue in Germany where there was , at Mr Dwight 's time , at G6ttingen , a young prince whose fortune ( allowance ? ) did not exceed six hundred dollars a year ; an income , ' adds he , inferior to many of our tailors ' and shoemakers ' . ' He found at Hanover a female institution , and similar establishments are not rare in Germany though we do not remember to have read an account of them in any of the works published recently on that country . There are in Hanover eleven Protestant convents , where young ladies may retire who have survived the bloom of youth , and have arrived at single blessedness , and may pass down the stream of time , in each other 's society , in uninterrupted tranquillity . Each of these institutions is under the direction of an elderly lady , corresponding , in some degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive annually from two to three hundred rix dollars , with which they are enabled to live gen-* teelly . The restraints of the institution are not severe . They receive visits from their friends , usually in the presence of the governess , though that is not required , or has been for a short time only . It is not necessary to reside here constantly ; a few weeks of each year being sufficient to entitle them to the pension . Some of them accordingly pass most of their time with their friends , and whenever they are thrown out upon the world by the dissolution of their families , they have a refuge , to which they can retire , without experiencing those mortifications which are so frequently attendant upon adversity . These asylums are under the direction of government , to which parents , wishing to procure such places for their children , apply . It requires some influence at court to obtain them , as the number of applicants is much greater than that of vacancies . Parents not unfrequently solicit them while the children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them even from the cradle , although , I believe , they do not enjoy the emolument until they approach the shady side of twenty , unless they reside in the convent at least a part of the time . As they receive visits at these institutions without great restrictions , it sometimes occurs , that a visiter is wounded , and can find no peace , until the fair mademoiselle has blessed him with her hand ; for love , who usually makes " the camp , the court , and the grove , " his favorite haunts , sometimes pays a flying visit to these convents , to prove to the world his omnipotence . Whenever a lady is thus addressed , she has the consolation of knowing that her lover is actuated by the purest affection , as her limited pension is taken from her as soon as she enters into // the " holy bands . " Of the cleven convents of this description , now in hanover , nine of them arc for the daughters of the nobility ; a striking evidence not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poverty of this class of society .

The following are the principal traits of the German universities , which the author has attempted , not without success , to exhibit in a holder relief by allusions to the colleges in his own country . The former have various classes of teachers ; one , consisting of the public professors , enjoying a fixed salary with the privilege of doing so little for it , as to compel the students to attend their private lectures , on paying , it is true , a very moderate fee ; the other , who may be compared to the repetitori of Italy , and the preceptors or college tutors at Oxford and Dublin , depending altogether on private or subsidiary tuition for their subsistence , until they rise by the excitement of emulation and by increasing exertions to the higher rank of public professors . The second peculiarity of these academic schools is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of classical and polite learning , has its own professor , but most of their main subdivisions are explained in special courses . This classification and separate teaching , and the close study of the subject they require , l ) produce obviously immense advantages . Still , it may he questioned , whether the usual residence of no more than three or four years at a university , allows the most industrious student to take more than an extremely limited survey of the several branches upon which such special lectures are delivered . The greatest utility he derives from them is , perhaps , to become familiar with the names and merits of the authors be may study after his academical course is ended . In this respect , the abundant notes the students take clown during the lectures , and which swell , under the pen of the most unremitting , to twenty or more thick manuscript volumes , are really of much importance to them for their future literary or scientific pursuits , although their attention must too often be merely fixed mechanically upon what falls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote of a young gentleman , who is sai ( i to have returuc ( i to the university from which // he had just departed , and attended afresh the lectures , only because he had lost the trunk which contained his memoranda . It is certainly all important to be guided in the selection of books and in the mode of study . For the same reason , obligation will be felt , even by those who are most conversant with literature in its widest range , to authors who follow the example of several German writers in accompanyin0 their works with a catalogue raisonn* of the best treatises already existing on the subjects of which they themselves treat . Thus , few historical works of any merit have been published recently in Germany with the blemish of Voltaire 's Essai sur les . Mceurs , which , from a neglect of reference to authorities , often leaves the reader in doubt as to the truth of the facts , up on which the philosopher of Ferney sarcastically comments , while he places himself in the unguarded and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill , or confident in hi , light and well-tempered weapons , hut altogether unprovided with a buckler or any other defensive armor . Well considered , an academic course can not , and in a measure should not , do more than afford a clear and rapid view of the wide field of general knowledge , an incipient acquaintance with the best authors , and a just notion of the best methods of pursuing leisurely , regular and extensive studies , be they professional or not , medicine alone excepted . Seldom has a student future means or opportunities like those which the universities of continental Europe , arid the establishments connected with them , afford . Accordingly , academic degrees are not distributed in Germany with a lavish hand ; and since to obtain them , is almost without exception the reward of long study and of great and solid attainments , the leaving of Halle or G6ttingen , without even the less brilliant of these honors , does not tend to disparage the conduct or the abilities of the student thus departing . We speak here , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or preparatory schools , had they even the privilege of conferring degrees . We refer the reader to the work under review , in regard to the attainments that arc required from a native to be regularly received into a German university , and the facilities which he finds in them for being initiated in every branch of theoretical knowledge . Jr Dwight ought perhaps more to have borne in mind the differences that exist between those high schools and the colleges of the Uuited States , conyou , . xxIx. - No. 65. 52 // stituted as they are at present , and must remain , so long as candidates for public offices shall not be obliged , as in Germany , to give proofs of a regular academic education . The immense libraries of the German universities and the great number of others , that are also open to the public , but inferior to the former in extent , are , in the author 's opinion , one of the most enviable privileges of Germany . He dwells largely and repeatedly on this topic . Several pages of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just encomium on the liberality with which these repositories of learning are opened to the student , and he has not said too much on the excellent order in which they are kept ; on the good sense which leads to a disregard , in their progressive increase , of mere typographical splendor ; and on the zeal , in Germany , to partake of the advancement which learning makes on every point of the globe . Three or four years have elapsed since Mr Dwight wrote these letters , and the lists he has collected are doubtless , at present , defective by many thousands of volumes , considering the ceaseless fertility of the presses in all European countries , Turkey and Spain always excepted. *lr Dwight looks back with fond yearnings to these immense libraries , and expresses more than once his belief , that as long as similar ones , or at least such as approximate to them in number and variety , are not found in the United States , this country will hold a very low rank in the world of scienc&amp;* and of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misapprehension of the political and intellectual genius of this portion of the new world , and ol an inattention to the circumstances which must necessarily produce , before long , a reaction against the luxuriance of the press . In a comparatively new country , constituted in many respects upon a social basis totally different from that of the old world , public taste will not be guided , and the mind of the learned or the studious fixed , solely by forming libraries upon the model of those in Germany . We have no books , ' exclaims Mr Dwight , we are artisans without tools . What therefore can be expected from us ? ' He will probably think otherwise on more reflection . It will not be , we beg leave to assure him , from the facility of accumulating quotations by means of huge libraries , that discoveries will be made for the benefit of mankind ; and a taste for foreign literature will not be necessarily promoted , by an accumulation of books , however excellent , in various // languages . On the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are peculiar , and on the other , the study of foreign languages , or their neglect , is no sign of intellectual superiority or inferiority . The circumstances which occasioned and accompanied the settlement of the British colonies ; the situation in which they were placed , until the elements of their present condition were sufficiently unfolded to ensure their separation from the mothor country ; the literature of the epoch , when that event took place , a literature which nowhere else has been permitted to produce all its effects so entirely without any restraint ; and the principles upon which the new institutions were founded ,  - -  have given to the national genius a freedom that could not fail to create , by a necessary consequence , an independence of mind , a reliance on individual powers , a self-will , and a practical character , as contrary to a tame submission under foreign rule , as to an easy adhesion to other dictates , than those of personal discrimination , reason , and conviction . Amidst such circumstances it is vain to expect , and if not unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into as much cultivation as in the old world . Many years must pass , before there will be in the United States a class of men exclusively devoted to such studies , as are pursued by the German literati ; and the political institutions must become radically altered , before such men , even were they to appear in any number , would cease to take an interest , too active for classical pursuits , in the political concerns of the country . In re6 ard to the study of foreign languages , it must not he forgotten , that the people of the United States have not the same inducements , as the Germans , to give much time to this acquirement . Social , commercial , and political circumstances are indispensable to stimulate a people to impose upon itself the irksome task of learning various languages ; and the learned begin to study the modern literature of other countries , to any extent , only when , from the circumstances we have mentioned , foreign idioms have become from necessity familiar among a large portion of their countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Portugal , even during the epochs of their most active exertions in literature and science , no other Ianguage than that of the country itself was ever much cultivated by the learned , with the exception only of such as the comtuercial or political relations of the time brought Ibr a period // into use . Thus when the South American states shall have attained that tranquil and truly independent condition for which they are still struggling , the Spanish language will be in the United States , what , for instance , the Italian was once in Spain ; an ( l possibly Spanish literature may receive from this circumstance a vivifying impulse in this country . But it can not be reasonably expected , that the mere importation of some thousands of German or Italian books , will suddenly create a thirst for reading them , or that which is emphatically called German diligence ' ; or that even the collection of classical works , in such quantities as are found in German universities and royal libraries , will be sufficient to awaken a taste for exegetical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transform Sheridan into a Porson or Parr , and Charles Fox into an Adam Smith , merely by heaping the works of those great autlors along the walks of the one to his accustomed scenes of pleasure , and of the other to Westminster Hall , the true sphere of his genius . in regard to public instruction , the most interesting and useful point of view , under which Germany can be exhibited , is in the multitude and the organization of the gymnasia , and her seminaries for the education of schoolmasters . Luther and Melancthon were , in this respect , the earliest and among the greatest benefactors of that country . Saxony , among the Protestant principalities , has the most zealously followed the great designs of those two reformers ; next to Saxony comes Prussia ; and both these kingdoms have no rival in Europe , unless it be the Southern I ) art of Scotland . The Prussian government has never neglected to direct and foster the elementary schools , of which there are about seventeen thousand in the villages , and three thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as an instructer , an examination and a written permission from a committee of examiners are indisl ) ensable . Every province of the kingdom has one or more seminaries , at the expense of the government , for the education of schoolmasters , who prepare themselves in these establishments , by two or three years of severe study , not only to teach properly , hut to cultivate the morals of their youn* pupils . The parochial clergy are entrusted with the duty of visiting the schools of the parishes , and of conferring with the teachers on the improvements they think proper to suggest ; and if they fail to agree in opinion , the question is submitted without further // appeal to the superintendents of the district . The minister of public instruction receives annually from these functionaries reports on the condition of the respective schools , founded on information furnished not only by the clergy , but by the inspectors , who once or twice a year accompany the superintendents in their visitation of all the schools in the province . The instructers are generally obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , some of which , however , are distinct from those of educating and teaching . They officiate as choristers , and during the absence or inability of the clergymen , they act as their substitutes , in reading the sermons which are furnished them for the occasion , and in catechizing their pupils . To send their children to school is not optional with the parents . Such as do not avail themselves of the facilities which are afforded by the government for the education of their offspring , and disregard the admonitions which the clergyman of the parish is hound to address to them , are fined , and no exception is made but in favor of the peasant who wants the aid of his children for the harvest , and a vacation for half the day from the first of April to the first of July . This continues until their confirmation , which is administered when they reach the age of fifteen or sixteen . The school-house , ' says Mr Dwight , whom we have closely followed in the preceding short notice , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parish , and must be sufficiently large to accommodate the scholars and the family of the instructer , who receives the use of it gratis . In the vicinity of this edifice is a small garden and sometimes a few acres of land , of which he has the use so long as he remains the instructer of the parish . This building is not very elegant , as it usually contains but four or five chambers , but it is suitable for one whose income is so moderate as that of most of the instructers . Every parish has a treasury , from the funds of which the instructer is paid from seventy to eighty dollars per annum . Besides this amount each parent pays him six " pennings " a week , or about six cents per month , for the instruction of his children . In some cases he receives also a small quantity of butter and flax from the parents . His whole income , exclusive of the rent of the school-house , and the ground connected with it , rarely amounts to more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village schools . Those who live in the towns receive about one hundred and fifty dollars . All the books which are studied , are selected by the consisto // ry , and no new one can be introduced without its permission . The Bible is universally read by the children , and forms , as in our own country , the foundation of education for the youth of Prussia . ' 1*P * *25*2 . This is a picture that might easily seduce such minds as those of Shenstone , Crabbe , and Wordsworth , to dwell pathetically on the callin * , the sufferings , and the virtues , that characterize so many who walk in this humble but useful sphere of life. * It remains to mention the gymnasia or higher seminaries of Prussia and of Saxony . They are either private or public . In the former a large proportion of the boys are lodged , boarded , and constantly kept under the eye of the instructer , whilst the remainder live with their parents except during the seven or eight hours that they are obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only required during the lectures . At the head both of the public and private schools are rectors or presidents , and conrectors or vicepresidents . The instructers are examined by professors of a * The traveller in Germany meets with an object of much interest in the town of Eisleben . The guide conducts you through one of the narrow streets , so common in the European cities , till you approach a dwelling very humble in its external appearance , almost as much so as that of Shakspeare in Stratford upon Avon , and bearing the inscril ) tion over the door ,  --  ' This is the house in which Luther was born . ' On the same board is drawn by a rude pencil a portrait of the great Reformer , much resembling in execution the head of Franklin , sometimes affixed to our printers ' shops . When you enter the door you find yourself in the midst of a small school , the teacher of which very civilly accompanies you to two upper apartments , which are kept sacred to the memory of Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque ; and the rooms contain chairs , tables , and other decaying relics of their former possessor , which were brought here after his death .

After satisfying your curiosity , and taxing the attentive schoolmaster with various questions , you write your name , with ink from Luther 's inkstand , in an album upheld by the wings of the swan , and depart . The house has been purchased by the king of Prussia , and is preserved as nearly in its primitive state as possible . No flhmily resides in it , and it is only used for accommodating the little school .

Boys are generally sent between the ages of nine and ten years , and they remain till they reach the age of sixteen or seventeen . They seldom wander from one gymnasium to another , for they would find it difficult to he admitted in any , unless they could give strong reasons for leaving the one to which they formerly belonged . Some of our youthful readers will be astonished at the account which Mr Dwight gives of the proficiency these scholars attain in Germany , after four or five years ' study . They are already expected to translate from Latin into Greek , to converse in the former of these languages , to write Latin prolegomena to the ode they are reciting , to translate in verse the great poets of their country , or at least to write good Latin prose . The instructer does not correct the reciter or the writer unless some rival scholar has failed to point out the defects . They read ( though not in every gymnasium , as Mr Dwi b ht would lead us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iliad and Odyssey , Xenophon , Herodotus , Demosthenes , Aristophanes , Virgil , Horace , Cicero , Quintilian , Tacitus , Livy , &amp;c. , some of the French classics , and a few hooks of the Old Testament in Hebrew . In mathematics , they study arithmetic , geometry , trigonometry , conic sections , spberics , and logarithms . ' The extensive verbal or printed commentaries by which , in these preparatory schools , the mind of the German youth is made conversant , not only with the dead letter of the works he reads , but with the genius , the local and moral circumstances , and the habits of those ancient nations , whose language he studies in their poetical and prose remains , are , as our author justly observes , one of the great reasons why classical studies are pursued in Germany , even in early life , with no less success than enthusiasm . The German student reads Homer , ' says our author , with the eye of a Grecian , who is familiar with its society , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iliad with views formed solely by the manners and the feelings and systems of the nineteenth century . The former , by his previous studies , has been able to transport himself to a distant age and people , while we , standing at the distance of nearly three thousand years , look with the feelings we have acquired from our peculiar education , at a country which seems indefinitely remote . To him the siege of Troy is a living reality , and the characters // of Sophocles , iEschylus , and Euripides , are all embodied . He shares in every passion which they feel , for he is a spectator of their sufferings ; their joys , their deliverance , relieve him from a distress almost as real as if he had been their contemporary . To him they are living beings , acting their appropriate part on the great theatre of life ; to us they are but spectres , dimly seen through the night of ages , and flittering before us in forms so indistinct , as to leave few traces of their existence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Utopian system of education , but one which has long existed in Germany . ' p. 390 . In the gyrnuasia as in the universities , instruction is much subdivided . They have from eight to twelve instructers , each with a separate department . Two or three teach , exclusively , Latin or Greek ; for he who lectures on the grammatical construction is not thought to have time enough to go into the exegetical part of the explanation . Scholars of the greatest merit have dwelt during a large portion of their lives in these preparatory schools , and many of them have declined the flattering call to a wider influence , greater fame , and more emolument , as professors in the most celebrated universities . We hasten to what may he considered the most curious part of Mr Dxvight 's work on Northern Germany ,  --  the state of religion , and the influence of the several philosophical systems , which , since Kant , have found ardent followers in that country . An unbelieving clergy ,  --  Lutheran and Protestant ministers , who generally deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest even the veracity of the New Testament , are certainly a phenomenon , worthy of some consideration , as well in its origin , as in its influence on the political condition of the community at large . The great distinctive characteristic of the Reformation , in England and Germany , is , that in the latter country the church remained independent of the state , no political tie binding them together , although the Protestant princes reserved to themselves a share in the nomination to the ministerial offices , a superintendence over the schools and theolo ical studies , and a sort of administrative interference in clerical matters . But in fact the Lutheran and Protestant churches enjoyed a more complete independence than the general character of the political institutions and the principles of government might have seemed to warrant ; and being in a great degree abandoned to themselves , the maintenance , relaxation , or developement of the doctrines of the new churches , depended almost // entirely on their native strength , and their compatibility with the continued advancement of society in philosophical investigations . Melancthon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Luther had made successful efforts to extend that of the Latin in the elementary schools . The impulse thus received from these great men , served to create and to maintain for some time a unity in religious matters , freer than that which existed in countries where the Catholic religion was exclusive , and still apt to impede a too eccentric flight from primitive tenets and principles . But the progress of Calvinism , and the licentiousness that ever accompanies wars ( from which those of religion are by no means exempted ) , soon begot reciprocal asperity between the contending parties , by which the cause of each suffered as much as the reputation of their leaders , and gradually produced a general lukewarmness and indifference in religion . A large portion of Protestant Germany was in this latter condition towards the middle of the seventeenth century . Spener appeared , and soon became , by his catechetical lectures , his writings , and plays , not less than from the persecutions he suffered , the head of a religious party , which really had at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful in its efforts . They wanted a name , and if the adversaries they had to contend with gave them that of Pietists , they might have felt regret at not having inscribed it themselves on their banners , for piety was really their impulse and its resuscitation their aim . The university of Halle was established through the exertions of Spener ; but the exegetical lectures on the Bible , which were delivered in that institution , might have led any observer , endowed with some foresight , to prophecy great latitudinarianism as an inevitable consequence of such investigations and such commentaries upon scriptural truth , almost unlimited and unrestrained as they were by any political or ecclesiastical authority , whose duty it would have been to be constantly intent on the preservation of certain doctrines , principles , and forms . Thus scepticism sprung up in the vicinity of numerous sects ; and our author does not exaggerate the religious state of Prussia in saying ( page 402 ) , that " in no country except France , that ever received the name of Christian , has unbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reigned with a more absolute sway . " // Yet in Prussia , as in all countries where political power is without the control of free institutions , the government , although less clearly and less constitutionally invested than in England , or in Catholic kingdoms , with an ecclesiastical supremacy , interfered deeply in the religious Opinions of its subjects ; and at the epoch to which we allude , its bias was to encourage unbelief . The appointment to the academical chairs would alone have been a powerful auxiliary in paving the way to that end . But Frederick the Great , by his victories as well as by the example of his personal conduct , the distinctions which he bestowed upon the French philosophers of his time , and the willingness with which he seemed to follow anti-monarchical opinions , lent additional means to lessen the influence of religion . If he can be suspected of any selfishness in pursuing such a system , it must be only by supposing that his vanity blinded him in regard to the interests of his ambition . Most certainly his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph as a disciple of a rising and aspiring philosophic school . Under these auspices , Kant , a greater admirer of Hume than of any of the sages of France , brought forward his Critique of Pure Reason , and a great portion of Germany espoused his principles more from religious unbelief , than from a conviction of the soundness of his logic . Though there was as wide a difference between the existing religious creeds and that philosophy , as between the belief of Socrates and the mythology of the Greeks , yet there was perhaps as much harmony between the private religious opinions and the philosophy of both epochs . The popularity which , after a short neglect , the sage of K6nigsberg acquired , encouraged him to declare more clearly his views with regard to Christianity . However , his Religion within the Limits of Ikason , to which Mr Dwight ascribes the triumph of having definitively withdrawn the clergy of Protestant Germany from a belief in the inspiration of the Old Testament , was not long permitted to circulate . But it could not be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested by its prohibition , when public opinion chimed in with its spirit and tendency , and helped to extend its influence . A cautious examination of the historical portion of Scripture was all that Kant seemed , at the outset , to ask from his followers as well as from his antagonists . Al:hou*h he found in Schulze , a professor of the G6ttingen uni // versity , a strong adversary , his system lost more of the ascendancy it at one time enjoyed , by its half-partisans , than by its absolute opponents . The idealism of Fichte , the internal revelation of Jacobi , the pantheism of Schelling , followed , and struggled with each other , so as to prevent tbe exclusive sway of the first real German philosophy since that of Leibnitz and they agreed , or rather concurred , in nothing so much as in weakening any system that might be in accordance with a belief in the inspiration of Scripture . At the same time biblical criticism was more and more studied . Ernesti published his Hermeneutics , and we must content ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers only his name and those of Semler , Miclia*lis , and Eichhorn . By degrees the authenticity of the Epistles of the New Testameat was assailed , and afterwards that of the Gospels . The orthodox of the Protestant Church proceeded like the Catholics , thinking themselves secure behind the bulwark of long revered doctrines , and deeming themselves the stronger on account of the diversity of parties into which the host of their adversaries was split , they remained lukewarm in their own defence . Besides , the Neologists ( for so were the sceptics called at one time ) avoided professing their princil ) les in the pulpit , by seldom preaching ( loctrinal sermons ; and the great bulk of the people seemed indifferent to a sceptical system , which none had the hardihood to make acceptable to the vicious and the incautious , by such profligate means as were employed in France to ksil the beast ( in the infamous language of Voltaii*e** and to corrupt the heart by perverting the imagination* But security , founded upon such grounds , must at length necessarily have proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not brought ' into Germany the pestilential seeds of their demoralization . From their first appearance in that country , till the time that German valor , and the innate honesty which is associated with it , drove back those political and moral foes to the wails of their proud Babylon , religion had no other supporter in Germany than general misery . When the measure of that terrible searcher of the human heart became full , the public mind , bowed down to earth by long misfortunes and in an almost hopeless state , began again to soar towards heaven with aspirations for pardon , as well as with prayers for deliverance . In the midst of such emotions of deep and solemn feeling , an undefined and irregular re* // ligious belief would have been but too quick and too natural a growth , even among a people less inclined than the Germans to reveries and mystery . German mysticism has been scoffed at enough , but its exculpating circumstances have not been sufficiently taken into account , although its favorable consequences on the national concerns are generally acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time with much discernment , and it is creditable to the sagacity of the rulers , that they did not permit themselves to be blinded to the fatal results , which such a dreaming and shadowy religion would have produced , if it had not been restrained as soon as the hour of danger was past . Otherwise Germany might have sunk into a poetical theology like that of Hesiod , which would , in fact , have brought about anew absolute materialism . Such a moral condition reminds one of the situation of Greece from the time of Pythagoras to Socrates . The school of sophists was certainly , at no epoch , so near being revived , as at the one of which we treat . The same fate , which their baneful influence brought on the Grecian governments , would have attended that of Prussia . But Frederick William lost no time in stemming a current so dangerous , not only to his monarchical power , but to all that had prospered under its shade for more than a century and a half . The first firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union of the Lutheran and Protestant Churches into one , called the Evangelical Church . To this were added the prescription of a liturgy , and the visitation of four episcopal sees . It it not perhaps necessary to exhibit a stronger evidence of the religious latitudinarianismn and relaxation which prevailed in that country , than the attempt , in a great degree crowned with success , of a government to effect , by a simple royal decree , such an immense revolution ,  --  a revolution for which other nations would have bled for half a century . However , the liturgy met with opposition from a portion of the clergy as well as from the people . Until a very recent epoch , the public mind was still much agitated , although with no symptoms of a dangerous paroxysm . But in such a state of things , we are more inclined than our author to consider with indulgence the delay or the hesitation of the Prussian government in establishing the free institutions it has promised to its subjects . At least we think time may be fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to questions and interests of a more delicate nature , and of more vital importance , than most of the practical concerns of life . In addition to these difficulties , arising from the peculiax* moral and religious situation of Prussia , a great though we trust not an invincible political obstacle is thrown in the way of a reformation of its government , on the basis of what is usually termed a free constitution , by the complex character of its aristocracy . Its nobility includes , we believe , from thirty to forty ancient members of the Empire , who , on the score of their great landed property , and the place they hold in public opinion , are well qualified to be the component parts of a House of Peers . But how could that branch of the legislature be filled up to a degree corresponding to the number of the inferior branch , in a country where a large proportion of the population , though possessing all the rights and the moral prestige of a patrician order , is separated from it by its poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the princes of the royal family would be a very insufficient addition to the thirty or forty peers before mentioned . A similar difficulty existed in Spain , where the grandees are at most eighty in number . Many of the Constitutionalists , who endeavored honestly to rebuild , in 18113 , at Cadiz , the political fabric of their country , acquiesced , with a sort of despair from that circumstance , in the formation of the Cortes as a single house . XVe have neither time nor space nor go into a further view of the embarrassments in which the Prussian government seems to be involved , and which may serve as an excuse for the dilatoriness , on account of which Mr Dwight professes that he is prevented from respecting the king , ' notwithstanding his excellent qualities and his paternal government . We may , on a future occasion , add some light to the information furnished by this author ( paae 216 ) on the provincial assemblies of Prussia ( a first step in the constitutional career of the country ) , and by Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agricultural class by the royal edict of 1810 . For the present , we must content ourselves with recoinmending Mr Dwight 's Travels in the North of Germany , as a work containing many valuable details , not unmingled , however , with mistakes , which a longer residence , a closer observation , or more preparatiry study , might have enabled a foreign tourist to avoid . // ART . VI. - The . Imerican Jurist . No . I. Boston . January . 1829 . THE history of the law in this country may be properly divided into three several epochs . The first , from the settlement until the charter of 1692 . The second , from that period to the time of the Revolution ; and the third , from the year 1780 to the present time . During the first of these periods , the government , both executive and judicial , was what might truly be called primitive . No trace can he found of law as a science or profession . The judges left the ploughed field for the hench , when occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient substitute for the Pandects or Year Books . In the piety of their hearts they adopted the law of Moses for their criminal code , and in civil litigation the common law of England was made , as far as their slender means of information would permit , the rule of their decision . Frequently the separate functions of a judge and jury were attempted to he exercised ; but even then a judge of modern date would have been shocked at the encroachments of a jury upon the province of the law , and perhaps amused to see a juryman exercise the right , then conferred upon him by legislative enactment , of consulting with any bystander . The clergy possessed , as in England , much of the legal knowledge of the community , and therefore we early find , that difficult legal points were referred to their decision , much as the le islatures refer such questions to the judiciary under the provIsions of the state constitutions . We have reason not only to be thankful that the clergy of that day did not make an improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also that there is no necessity of trying the experiment at the present day . Perhaps no incident more forcibly proves the correct principles of our forefathers than the fact , that , when the outrageous conduct of Sir Edmund Andros had roused the people from their natural peacefulness , when the royal authority was set at defiance by the confinement of its representative , and when , in fact , all law had ceased to exist , then it was found that no law was wanted , and in the midst of revolution and violence we discover no symptoms of riot or outrage . The second epoch of our law commenced with the reception
