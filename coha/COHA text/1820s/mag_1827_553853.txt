txt ART . IV. - Sketches of a Tour to the Lakes , of the Character and Customs of the Ch*ppeway Indians , and of Incidents connected with the Treaty of Fond du Lac . By THOMAS L. M'KENNEY , of the Indian Department , and Joint Commissioner with his Excellency Governor Casa , in negotiating the Treaty . Baltimore . F. Lucas . Svo . Iv we are not mistaken , Carver , who made a tour through the region of the lakes more than sixty years ago , begins his journal at Detroit ; and states , as a reason why he passes over all his previous notes , that they relate to a part of the country already too well known to justify any remark . If such forbearance were proper at that early period , it would appear to be so now in a much greater degree . It would be difficult at this time to write a new thing on either the Hudson river , the Niagara Falls , or even the Grand Canal . Indeed , through the medium of books of travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost every nook and corner of the United States , within the reach of stagecoaches , steamboats , or even pedestrian enterprise , has become familiar to every reader . For this reason , we were somewhat surprised to find Mr M'Kenney 's Tour to the Lakes* beginning at Baltimore , or , ratlrnr , at Washington , and could persuade ourselves to give the first hundred and more pages only a cursory glance . Passing sketches of our maritime cities can excite little interest ; and while we regard the pride and delight with which the author moves up the New York Canal , as natural and honorable feelings , and should have questioned his taste and sensibility , if he had viewed the Niagara Falls with less wonder and enthusiasm ; nevertheless , we think no graphic powers , of either the pen or the pencil , could give any of these topics the charm of novelty , or even of ordinary interest . We have standard descriptions of all these wonders of nature and of art , under their present aspects ; and until they exhihit new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for information . // Mr M'Kenney embarked at Buffalo for Detroit in a steamboat , which then plied between the two places in conjunction with six or seven others . In 1820 , Mr Schoolcraft , who then made a tour of the lakes , found only one steamboat on Lake Erie . In his letter dated from Detroit , Mr M'Kenney , like every preceding traveller , is led to speak of the distinguished Indian , Pontiac , whose exploits have given soniethirig like classic celebrity to the grounds around that place . There is much that is attractive in the history of this champion of the forest ; and as we understand there are extant some manuscripts written contemporaneously with the events connected with his name , we may anticipate a further illustration of his character and wars . Mr M'Kenney has added little to the facts stated by Mr Schoolcraft ; who , in his turn , copied them with due credit from Carver . Nothing worthy of particular note occurs during the boat voyage from Detroit to the Sault de Ste Marie . We are struck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller met with a British garrison at Drummond 's Island . We had supposed this island to have been determined , several years since , to belong to the United States , and that the British had evacuated the post upon it . In a military point of view , its occupation may perhaps be regarded with indifference ; but there are other considerations , which would seem to render it highly objectionable . Sovereignty should be intangible to a foreign power ; and there is a proof upon the Champlain frontier of the readi .. ness with which we abandon a military position , when determined to appertain to another nation . Mr M'Kenney says , that as many as three thousand Indians had been recently at Drummond 's Island , in order to receive presents . Most of these Indians were , we presume , from within the boundary of the United States . We are utterly at a loss for reasons to account for this perseverance , on the part of the British Indian Department , in the present-giving system , so far as it relates to Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the only motive which strikes our apprehension ,  --  a wish to preserve a claim to services , in the event of another war , which were so useful in the last war ,  --  for we hope such a contingency is too remote , to be the basis of any such policy . It is known that strong representations have been made by the local authorities to the government , setting forth the injurious consequences that may result from such an interference // with our internal concerns . To ensure that tranquillity , which it is the aim of the United States to perpetuate among the Indians , it is all important , it is indispensable , that their association should be confined , in all respects , to those who , so far from having any interest to counteract such beneficent intentions , will cooperate to give them the fullest effect . We believe we are not mistaken in saying , that there has been a diplomatic correspondence between the two countries on this subject , and that the British authorities averred ignorance of any such intercourse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British government , the fact of its existence , to an alarming extent , is unquestionable . While at Drummond 's Island , Mr M'Kenney witnessed the interesting spectacle of an assembly of Indians , engaged in religious worship , and heard them sing an Indian hymi , which had been adapted to music . At the same place he had an opportunity of observing another kind of devotion , which we are led to believe is almost as rare among the savages , as enthusiasm in religion . The habitual indifference with which they treat their wives , the unfeeling inequality with which they distribute the burdens and labors of life , reversing the ordinary scale of relative weakness , and making the females , as it were , the stronger sex , lead us to suppose them unsusceptible of all sentiments of love . But whatever want of tenderness or gallantry the Indian females may be accustomed to after their marriage , when , according to savage nations , they become the slave of man , and the services exacted of them are submitted to as an inevitable lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no doubt that the maiden of the forest has her season of coquetry and triumph , in which she is propitiated with those sylvan blandishments , which , however far they may be behind the courtly wooings of polished life in delicacy and refinement , as decidedly show the temporary ascendancy of the sex . Mr M'Kenney says he found a young Indian , one soft and bright moonshiny evening ,  --  just such a night ' as Jessica 's lover might have chosen ,  --  seated in front of his mistress ' cabin , serenading her with a three-holed flute , ' in which melodious occupation he passed the whole night . This simple instrument , whose compass is confined to three notes , appears to be consecrated to love , for we believe it is resorted to only during a paroxysm of that passion . Since the time when Mr Schoolcraft visited the Sault de Ste // Marie , in 1820 , a military post had been established at that place , forming the terminating point in that quarter of a cordon of posts , which not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper found in the neighborhood of the Sault , appears early to have attracted the notice of the French missionaries ; for Charlevoix says that one of them , who had been bred a goldsmith , had made chandeliers , crosses , and censers of that metal . The whitefish is caught there in great abundance and of a delicious quality . The salmon-trout likewise abounds in Lake Huron . It is often found weighing over forty pounds , still retaining most of the peculiar flavor belonging to that species of fish . Mr M'Kenney gives a very lively description of the mode of taking whitefish in the rapids , which we are tempted to extract . The whitefish is taken by both whites and Indians with a scoop-net , which is fastened to a pole about ten feet long . Two persons go out in a bark canoe , that you could take in your hand like a basket ; and in the midst of the ' rapids , or rather where they pitch and foam the most . One sits near the stern , and paddles ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wire-dancer , balances his " egg-shell , " that you or I would be ready to turn over in our attempts to keep steady . When a fish is seen through the water , which is clear as crystal , the place is indicated by the man with the net , when , by a dexterous and quick motion of the paddle , by the Indian holding it , he shoots the canoe to the spot , or within reach of it , when the net is thrown over the fish , and it is scooped up , and thrown into the canoe ; meantime the eye of the person in the stern is kept steadily fixed upon the breakers , and the eddy , and whirl , and fury of the current ; and the little frail bark is shot away in a smoother place , or kept stationary by the motion of that single paddle , as circumstances may require. * Maple sugar is manufactured in considerable quantities at the Sault , mimy families making , according to Mr M'Kenney , more than a ton weight in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cultivated with success , and some garden vegetables . But the winters are tediously long , and the cold severe . The snow falls to a gre at depth , and remains on the ground about seven months in a year . It is not , however , without its appropriate amusements . Trains , drawn by dogs , are the common vehicles of pleasure , and , according to Mr M'Kenney , afford some conveniences , for which the more cumbrous equipages of other climes are but ill adapted . When // a visit , or other excursion is intended , the train is drawn into the house , and , before a comfortable fire , the lady arranges herself among the robes of fur , and goes forth . It is not so stated , but we should hope that custom allows the lady to maintain her seat in this train , until she can alight on the hearth of a friend ; These dogs are large , with thick necks and broad shoulders , as if fitted by nature for the draft for which they are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had an opportunity of seeing an Indian dance . The ball began at eight o'clock in the evening , and ended with the rising of the sun the next morning . It terminated with a feast , which was served up in two six gallon kettles . ' Dancing appears to be one of the chief amusements belonging to the savage life . Every Indian , of either sex , who is not incapacitated by some bodily defect or infirmity , seems to have acquired this accomplishment , the cultivation of which begins with their earliest years . The ordinary dances , which have no great variety of movemert , are danced by all ; but there are others of a higher character , which require a muscular power , and a capability of enduring fatigue , which render them generally unattainable . The Buffalo ( lance , which is performed with a buffalo scalp ( that is , the skin of that animal , taken from the top of the head , including the horns , and a part of the neck ) on the head , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mostly in a crouching attitude , is probably as severe a trial of the physical strength , as any exercise within the range of the gymnasium . On the tenth of June , 1826 , the party embarked in three barges , and one bark canoe , and left the Sault for Lake Superior . This is the third expedition which Governor Cass has conducted into the remote regions of the northwest , for purposes almost solely connected with the future welfare of the Indians scattered over that immense tract of country . His zeal and activity have been rewarded by the most complete * In the winter of 1819-20 , two gentlemen came from Lord Selkirk 's establishment , on the Red River , to Prairie da Chien , on the Mississippi , a distance of several hundred miles , each draxvn in a train by two or three dogs . The party returned to Red River in the spring in boats , and most of the dogs were consequently left behind . As soon as they saw that they were abandoned by their old masters , each dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate maintenance of his post , and a Pithful guardianship of the premises , compelled the occupant to adopt him as a part of the establishment . // success ; and the great scheme of meliorating the condition of the sons of the forest , by establishing boundaries , and allaying ancient feuds , will probably be indebted for its consummation more to his agency , than to that of any other individual . As we shall hereafter have occasion to speak of the treaty , we will now make no reference to the objects of the expedition . Mr M'Kenney went in the bark canoe ; and we can not give a better idea of the buoyancy and capacity of this beautiful craft , so common in the northwestern waters , than by stating the fact , that this canoe , which was thirty feet long , four feet in the beam , and two and a half feet deep in the centre , and could be raised out of the water by two of its crew , carried eleven men , with their baggage , weighing in all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made the same impression on Mr M'Kenney as on all preceding travellers . The scenery has a grandeur suited to the embouchure of the Father of Lakes , ' - elevated peaks arid precipitous bluffs , that give boldness to the outline of the waters , and leave the imagination to indulge in theories of elemental war . ' Point Iroquois has likewise a moral interest , deriving its name from a bloody Indian fight , which has given it a traditional celebrity through more than a century . On the second day after their entrance into the lake , the party encountered a severe blow , one of those almost cloudless tempests , which , in the face of a bright sun , chafe the lake into a fury , that one would expect to see only under the influence of a black and stormy heaven . The rage of the winds on these lakes , at certain seasons , is vehement in the extreme . But , according to IX ! . Charlevoix , the element gives a kindly premonition , which the voyager neglects to notice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is stated , affords ample time for measures of precaution . Charlevoix says a coming tempest may be told on Lake Superior three days in advance ; the first day exhibiting a light ripple ; the second , tolerably large waves , but without crests ; but the third day , le lac est tout en feu ; l'oc*an , dans le plus grand fureur , n'est pas plus agit* . ' We somewhat distrust the certainty of these signs , and suspect the irregular turbulence of Lake Superior , as well as of all the other lakes , baffles all weatherwise calculations . The first days of the voyage appear to have been barren of incident . The shore of the lake was low and monotonous , and on the fourth day , even animate nature seems to have been // scattered along their route with singular sparinguess , and want of variety ; for our traveller says in his notes on that day , I have not seen a living thing today ( exclusive of our party ) , except two crows , a spider , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impossible for a traveller to pass up the south side of Lake Superior , and not notice the Grandes Sables , and the Pictured Rocks , the two most striking features of the lake . They have both been slightly noticed in our review of Mr Schooleraft 's Narrative Journal. * This gentleman , in his Mineralogical Report ' to the Secretary of War , in 1822 , gives the following scientific view of this magnificent scene . The Pictured Rocks commence three leagues beyond La Pointe des Grandes Sables , and extend along a very irregularly indented shore to the western curve of Grand Isle Bay , a distance of eighteen miles , when the further view of them is intercepted by a point of woodland extending into the lake . They consist of a formation of sandstone , which is in some respects peculiar , on account of its composition , its color , its extreme friability , and the great thickness it presents to view , it is composed of coarse grains of siliceous sand united by a calcareous cement , and deposited stratumsuper-stratum , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipice along the margin of the lake . In some places we observe imbedded pebbles of quartz , and waterworn fragments of other primary rocks ; but the attraction of aggregation appears to be very feeble , and where the strata are exposed to the influence of the xveather and the lake , they are rapidly submitting to decay , and the fragments are easily crushed between the fingers . Its recent fracture presents a light grey color , which is uniformly diffused , but externally the rock is black , red , green , yellow , brown , white , producing a diversified and pictured appearance , to which this singular range of bluffs is indebted for its name . In no place , however , does the recent fracture disclose any traces of the red color predominant in the Superior sandstone ; and the variety of outward coloring appears to be attributable chiefly to the washing down of the banks of colored clays and loam , which form the superincumbent soil . In referen*e to their color and position , however , we may suppose that the Pictured Rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which they rest . Traces of such a deposit are furnished by several parts of the Superior shore ; but as it is much more perishable in its structure , it appears to have first // yielded to decomposition ; and hence probably the origin of Les Grandes Sables , and of those numerous and extensive sandy tracts , of which Whitefish Point , the plains of Ontonagon , and Point Chegoimegon , afford conspicuous instances . ' These stupendous battlements of rock , from the account of all travellers , offer to the eye a scene of variety and sublimity , which it is impossible to view without delight and enthusiasm , notwithstanding the idea that must constantly be present to the spectator 's mind , that he is purchasing his enjoyment at considerable hazard . They can not he viewed to advantage , except while floating along their front ; and the suddenness with which such a wind , as would render the situation dangerous , springs up on this lake , dashes the pleasure with a strong alloy . Mr M'Kenney appears to have verified how nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat behind his party , in order to take a minuter survey , his bark , while he was yet at no great distance from the beetling heights , encountered a freshening wind , that soon disturbed the waters sufficiently to make him and his companions feel a most unpleasant sense of jeopardy . While at Grand Isle , our author heard repeated the story of the Chippeway war party , which Mr Schoolcraft relates as a recent incident , when he first visited that island with Governor Cass . It affords a strong illustration of the bravery and devotion of the Indian character , when excited by powerful motives . Indeed , instances of martyrlike sacrifice of life , which are so rare in the annals of other nations , are not uncommon among the Indian tribes . We have not space to extract the story , but we can not forbear presenting the main incidents of it . The Chippeways of this part of the country appear to have incurred the reproach of cowardly inactivity in recent hostilities with the Sioux . To efface this , thirteen warriors made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly met a war party of the enemy , of ten times their number . As efforts were then making to restore harmony between the two nations , the Sioux were willing to receive this little band as friends . But the Chippeways were resolved on a fight , and made preparations for an attack the next morning . They were easily repulsed , when , retiring to some rude intrenchments , which had previously been dug , they were all killed , excepting one , after having destroyed twice thefr number of the enemy . This survivor , being the youngest warrior , had been directed to // take his stand on a neighboring height , whence he could view the result , and , as soon as he saw their fate , to return with the account to their friends . On the seventeenth of July , our party arrived at Granite Point . The back country here begins to be lifted into high bills and mountains . Mr Sehoolcraft named this point Granite Point , because the geological character of the shore here changes to rocks of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height rising at this place out of the lake , connected with the main by a neck of red and grey sandstone , in horizontal layers . ' Mr M'Kenney gives the following animated description of his clambering to the extremity of this point . Descending from rock to rock for about thirty feet , I seated myself on a ledge that projected far out into the lake , to survey the scenery , and contemplate the motion of the waters , that in towering waves would roll against these rocks as if asleep , and unconscious of their approaching destiny till awakened by the shock of the contact , when they would mount high in the air , and fall back broken into a thousand parts , and be swallowed up by their successors , which , on reaching the same point , met with the same overthrow . I had been observing these waves for some minutes , when a mother duck with her brood of younglings , ten or twelve in number , and which appeared to be only a few days old , swam out from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively still . She was , on seeing me , greatly alarmed , and with both feet and wings made her way into the lake , and , on getting ahead of her brood , would turn back and flap her wings on the water , and then away again , till presently I saw her as she would mount over the top of the wave , and her little family looking like small corks on the billows . ' We make this extract , as presenting a pleasing view of lake scenery , and as answering the inquiry so frequently suggested by a sight of the migratory flocks , that , through the desert and illimitable air , ' wing their way northward each season ,  - -  What region brings their long and lofty pilgrimage to a close ? There are clusters of islands rising out of the lake in the neighborhood of this point , which the author supposes may once have formed an elongation of the point . Such a supposition finds countenance in the geological character of the neck of Granite Point , uniting it with the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluvion , covering a friable sandstone , which is incapable of withstanding the action of the waters , like its associate masses of granite , and which will doubtless one day wear away , and leave the present extremity of the point an island . // When Mr Schoolcraft passed up Lake Superior in 1820 , the party made the usual portage at the neck of Keweena Point , and , of course , saw little of this extraordinary projection of land into Lake Superior . As Governor Cass ' party at this time made the circuit of the point , Mr M'Kenney had an opportunity of examining its features . He describes the shore as being for more than two thirds of its length uninteresting and monotonous , ' and as almost upon a level with the lake , and covered to the water 's edge with a growth of pine , cedar , aspen , spruce , &amp;c . Two high , conical mountains are seen rising from the interior . Towards the termination of the point , its character changes to rocky and broken precipices ' The shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a quarter of a mile , into many of which we entered , while the rocky projections of the mountain hung over us as if to threaten us with destruction . Huge masses of rocks , that had parted from the mountain , were lying out in the lake , some fifty and a hundred yards from the shore , between which and others that formed a kind of passage way , and with perpendicular walls , our little bark was passed on the smooth surface of the waters . It was like a mite in comparison with these ruptured and stupendous fragments . ' Nature has adorned this remote and unfrequented point with cascades , and with green and lovely recesses , in one of which 1*1r M'Kenney says he found that rare plant , which botanists and poets have so long sought for in vain , the rose without a thorn . ' This point is said to have been first coasted around about forty years ago . Common canoes and barks can be easily taken across the portage , but the barges of the present party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circuit . It is fortyfive miles long . The Indians have a tradition , that a party , in passing around Keweena Point , and approaching Beaver Island , which is off the point , were frightened back by a female , whose form expanded to a most appalling size ; and that since that time , no savage has ever trespassed upon the interdicted region . It would seem to require nothing more than the length of this rather perilous circuit , and the facility with which the Indians can carry over the portage their small craft , to restrain them from this circumnavigation ; but the Beavers appear to have profited by this superstitious or accidental desertion of the point , as they are said to have been found in extraordinary abundance on the island bearing theit // name , by the first white man who dared . to invade the phantomprotected waters . On arriving off the Ontonagon river , the party had a view of the Porcupine mountains , far in the interior , which were estimated by Captain Douglas to be about two thousand feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au Indian hamlet , and entered one of the lodges which belonged to a Fre ; ichman , who had married a squaw . This iod*e is stated to have been twelve feet in diameter , and to have contained , at the time he visited it , the mistress , five children , several squaws , an old chief , a crow , and six dogs . Our readers , who are accustomed to the elbow-room of spacious houses , will hardly imagine how so many persons could voluntarily crowd within so small a space ; and this lodge probably afforded the best accommodations of all in the hamlet . The old chief who was present , said , he had been for the last ten days living upon wild garlic . ' St Michael 's Island , which is about four hundred and twenty miles up the lake , was the seat of a French mission more than a century ago . The cross was erected there , and no doubt many a red neophyte rewarded the zeal of the priests . No vestige now remains of the labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few efforts , which have cost so much privation , suffering , and death , have been so fruitless in permanent effects , as the labors of these early missionaries . At the time we allude to , a religious establishment so far distant as St Michael 's Island , was as arduous and hazardous an enterprise , as a similar one at the present day beyond the Rocky Mountains . A priest , once in a year or two , passes up from Montreal to Fond du Lac , on a spiritual visitation of the stationary traders , and of the few Indians who still preserve a shadowy connexion with the church . A Mr Johnson , of the lake country , informed Mr M'Kenney , that in 1791 , he bad here met with a scientific Frenchman , or Italian , who called himself Count sindriani , and who was making observations , with instruments , upon the latitude , &amp;c . This casual mention of his name , appears to be , so far as our knowledge extends , the only glimpse of notoriety on this side the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . In passing onward the party met several Indians on the shore , who were in a starving condition . One of them , who said he had eaten nothing for two days , begged for tobacco the first // thing . To endure hunger appears to be habitual with the Indians , particularly with those of the northern regions , hut even while they are sinking under atrophy , the love of whiskey or tobacco still predominates over all other cravings . The party reached Fond du Lac on the twentyeighth of July , after a voyage of eighteen days , the distance being five hundred and twentynine miles . Governor Cass remained at that place until the ninth of August , to effect the treaty , which he , in con-* junction with Mr M'Kenney , had been commissioned to form with the Indians assembled , agreeably to a convocation , for that purpose . It will be recollected that Governor Cass , in conjunction with General Clark , of Missouri , had met several tribes of Indians at Prairie du Chien the year before , to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general pacification among them . As these objects could not be fully attained at that time and place , this second council was appointed , with a view to accommodate such tribes as were too remote for attendance at Prairie du Chien . The author has appended to his work all the speeches and papers connected with the council . The beneficial results are matters of publicity . The supplemental article to the treaty , shows that a new subject of negotiation had arisen since the last council . A murder of a party of whites upon Lake Pepin had been committed by the Chippeways , and the murderers were to be demanded at Fond du Lac . As these persons were not present , all that could be effected then was , a promise to have them forthcoming the ensuing year at Green Bay , where another council would convene under the direction of the same commissioners , for this and other objects connected with the welfare of the Indians. * * An instance of the integrity with which they fulfil such promises occurred at Prairie du Chien in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers were murdered and shockingly mangled in the neighborhood of Fort Armstrong , on the Mississippi . As circumstances rendered it almost certain that some Winebagoes were the murderers , that tribe was immediately summoned to give them up . The chiefs at once promised to bring them to Prairie du Chien within a stated time , and they were brought accordingly , preceded by a white flag , and attended by a large concourse of the tribe . They were taken into military custody , and the next morning examined separately before three magistrates of the place , in the presence of several Winebago chiefs . The youngest of the three ( for that was the number given up ) was first examined . He said he was the adopted child of an uncle , with whom , and an elder brother , he // During the author 's stay at Fond du Lac , he observed many things , and collected some traditions and stories , which throw new light on the indian character and condition . It is not surprising , that a simple and suffering people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr M'Kenney relates anecdotes strikingly illustrative of this weakness . Soon after their arrival , an emaciated and squalid looking Indian presented himself , and was recognised as the guide who had undertaken , in 1820 , to lead Governor Cass to the Copper Rock . He had the ill luck to lose his way in this instance , which was considered hy his brethren as an evidence of the anger of the Great Spirit , who viewed all such intrusions upon the riches of his kingdom with jealous eyes ; and this accident , together with his subsequent ill success in hunting , created a belief with his tribe , and at last with himself , that he had been abandoned by his Manitto . He was in the last stage of despair at this time . It was judiciously determined , that the best method of restoring him to self respect , and to the respect of his tribe , would be , to improve his condition by l ) resents , and thus give one of the strongest proofs that good fortune had returned to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaints us with a singular kind of posthumous kusbandship , of which we do not recollect to have seen any previous mention . He says many squaws were observed , who constantly carried a roll of clothing* about with them , which had gone to Rock Island , on which Fort Armstrong stands . While they were in the bushes near the fort , they saw two soldiers approach them in ordcr to cut poles . While they were thus engaged , his uncle told him and his brother , that some time before , a relation of theirs had been murdered by the whites , and that now was a proper time to avenge the deed , by killing these two soldiers , who were unarmed and in their power . He said he tried to dissuade his uncle from the act , but finding him inflexible , he stood by , while the deed was committed , neither assisting nor opposing . lie added , that his elder brother had likewise tried to dissuade his uncle , but , when he found him determined , had assisted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed , in all respects , the testimony of the younger , acquitting him entirely of all blame , excepting that of havin5 been a passive spectator . He assumed a portion of the guilt himself , hut referred all the responsibility of the act to his uncle . The uncle was then called , who confirmed the statements of his two nephews ; saying , that he believed the whites to he 've killed his relation , and that he had been bound in duty to retaliate . The younger brother was immediately discharged ; the other two were afterwards tried , and found guilty . // they appeared to preserve with much care . On inquiry , he found they were widows , and that these rolls were emblems of their bereavement , and of the continuance of their mourning . It is indispensable , when a *voman loses her husband , for her to take off her best apparel , and roll it up , and confine it by means of her husband 's sashes ; and if lie had ornaments , these are generally put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of cloth . This bundle is called her husband , ' and must be her inseparable companion , until taken away by some one of her late husband 's family , which is not generally done until after the lapse of a year . We can see no great hardship in exacting such a season of mourning on such occasions ; at least it is not going beyond what is required in more civilized life , without , however , annexing to it such an inconvenient badge of nrief . But it appears , that inexorable relations sometimes leave these widows several years with this miserable substitute . It is not , however , without its advantages . Whenever presents are distributed , this cylindrical husband comes in , with all the fulness of the marital character , for its equal share , which , of course , oes to the disconsolate widow . Another custom of the Chippeway women is mentioned , which exhibits their maternal affection in a strong light . When a Chippeway mother loses her child , she dresses an effigy , which takes its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unconscious object of every maternal kindness and attention . During his stay at Fond du Lac , Mr M'Kenney frequently visited a young female Indian , who was suffering under a severe disease , which he considered hemiplegia . One half of her body had been paralyzed , and the optic nerves so affected as to render her blind . Her countenance was handsome and interesting . Perhaps no description of their poverty and wretchedness could give us such a vivid idea of the comfortless condition of the savages , as this picture of suffering and sickness , deprived of all those remedial and soothing appliances , which mitigate the pains of disease in civilized life . Here we find an interesting girl of sixteen . prostrated by one of the severest visitations of Providence , raised from the bare earth only by a thin rush mat , and having no other nourishment offered to her sickly appetite , than pork and flour soup ; ' and even this dainty probably became attainable through the accidental occurrence of the treaty at that place . The parents were unremitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a con* // sciousness that they could only watch the progress of disease , without any power to check its force . The materia medica among the Indians is extremely limited , and where nature and superstitious incantations fail to effect a cure , the patients generally find no relief , hut are surrendered with hopeless submission to their fate . The council at Fond du Lac exhibited the somewhat novel spectacle of a female , who took her seat in it as proxy of her husband . It may he worthy of remark , that she made a short and pertinent speech . Mr M'Kenney confirms the often repeated assertion , that there are man-women ' among the savages . He mentions one who had been induced by a dream , or some such accident , to assume the dress and duties of a squaw , and had even gone through the ceremony of being married to a man . The Indians call the aurora borealis dancing spirits , ' which is both a beautiful and poetical appellation . The party left Fond du Lac , on its return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the river Ontonagon , for the purpose of endeavoring to move the copper rock , ' with a view to transport it to Washington . It appears by the report of the person having charge of the detachment , that the shallowness of the river rendered such a scheme impracticable . They built a fire on the rock , in order to facilitate a separation of it into portable fragments , but without success ; and this famous rock will still remain on its old ground , to puzzle geologists , and perhaps lead to new mining speculations . And there let it stand in its native form and dimensions , till the art of man can devise means of removing it , without fracturing it into parts , and thereby destroying the chief qualities , which make it a wonder of nature . On his return , Mr M'Kenney had an opportunity of seeing the Pictured Rocks to better advantage , than when ascending the lake . The relic of Indian pottery , ' as it is termed , is a curious exhibition of the manner in which conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art . It resembles a vase in form , having a stem about five feet high , and a body twelve feet , with well proportioned dimensions in other respects . Some fir trees , which grow out of the top , form an ornament well suited to the vase . The urn and monument are still more singular and wonderful exhibitions of the same kind , particularly the first , which is described // as being about sixty feet high , and with exact proportions . ' All these are adjunct features of the Pictured Rocks , ' which he now approached at a point , or projection , bearing the name of the Castle Rock . ' The outstanding mass is three hundred feet high , and one hundred and fifty feet wide , with an opening or cavern at its base about forty feet broad . When within fifty yards of this cavern , on looking up , he found himself under the drop from the edges above . ' Notwithstanding this threatening aspect , he entered the opening , and discovered within a circular passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a roof of thirty feet , supported on pillars , averaging twelve inches in diameter . ' Near the cave rock lies an immense mass of ruins , which show that these overhanging precipices occasionally descend into the lake beneath . The party reached the Sault de Ste Marie in safety . The author here collected two Indian allegories , which show that the savages have fancies skilled in happy personifications . We have not room for further extracts . Mr M'Kenney estimates the number of Indians on Lake Superior to be about eight thousand , and says that they bring in furs to the amount of about twentyfive thousand dollars . This leaves but a small dividend to each individual , in a country where hunting forms an important source of subsistence . There is no doubt the Indians in this quarter suffer privations , greater than fall to the lot of most of those who reside within our jurisdiction . The earth is niggardly in its spontaneous productions , and the shortness of the season holds out little inducement to the indolent habits of the Indians , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake affords a supply of fish during a part of the year , but for many months this source of supply is cut off by the rigors of winter . Mr M'Kenney indulges a kind and generous hope , that the condition of these Indians may be meliorated . Such a hope must find a concurrent sentiment in every breast ; but we fear there is little practical encouragement for any scheme of this nature , unless they be regarded as national paupers , and supported accordingly . They are cast on a sterile shore , which the industry of even white men could hardly cause to bring forth an increase . But their privations spring from their birthright , and they suffer as their fathers have suffered before them . If they have not heretofore been induced , by the repulsive sterility of their native soil , and the ease with which they can change their ambulatory homes , // to seek out a more genial and abundant clime ; we apprehend that the government could offer no sufficient inducement to such an emigration . Some instances , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof in point . Crowded , threatened , and persecuted , the Creeks may be said to have no choice . But we must leave a subject which presses upon us a thousand reflections . The commissioners , on their return , visited the island of Michillimackinac , and some striking sketches are given of its wild and singular features . Excepting the Pictured Rocks , this island is undoubtedly the most attractive object in the country of the lakes . It is about three miles in diameter , and , in the vicinity of the main and other islands , bearing little similarity of character , rises out of the lake , with a rampartlike shore on almost every side , of about an hundred and fifty feet in height , and brad ually ascends from the edge of this precipice to the centre , where it terminates in a cone , whose peak is about three hundred feet from the water level . This acclivity is mostly covered with trees . As this island stands in the strait connecting Lakes Huron and Michigan , the great thoroughfare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigines , and , striking on their fanciful eyes with its peculiarity of form , appears to have been immemorially the object of their admiration and worship . As the observer approaches it from Lake Huron , and finds the minuter features of the island gradually unfolding to his view , the first that strikes his eye is the military blockhouse upon the summit , whose square outline rests on the sky ; following down the slope , the eye is next attracted by Fort Mackina , whose whitened walls stand on the brink of the precipitous bank , overhanging the little bay immediately beneath , around whose shores , upon a level with the lake , is collected the village of Mackina . These three objects mark distinctly the three gradations of the island . We have not space for much more than a simple enumeration of the remarkable objects which have engaged the attention of our traveller . The lire/med Rock , or Giant 's lirch , as Mr Schoolcraft terms it , is described as being singular and picturesque in the highest degree . In comparison with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects have the advantage . The Natural Bridge presents few appearances of convulsion or ruins . It seems to have been formed by a silent and gradual process of elemental dissolution , and , // standing fixed iii its OWfl tranquillity , ' strikes the cursory observer as some rude achievement of art . But the Arched Rock at Mackina strides over a slope of massy fragments , that spread down the bank in such wild disorder , as to refer its origin at once to some uncommon disturbance of nature ; while the apparently slight adhesion of the different parts of the arch excite a wonder that it should so long have balanced itself in the upper air . Mr Schoolcraft , in his Narrative Journal , says , Its abutments are the calcareous rock common to the island , and have been created by the falling down of enormous masses of rock , leaving a chasm of eighty or ninety feet in height , and crowned with an arch of fifty or sixty feet sweep , having the usual curve of factitious arches . ' The Sugar Loaf Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its base , and between eighty and ninety feet high , its general outline resembling the usual shape of a sugar loaf . A few stunted trees grow out of the crevices in its sides . The Scull Rock is another lofty and insulated mass , having a cavern at its base , which has become interesting by many traditions . A great quantity of human bones have been found in this cavern , the deposit of which in such a place , not being satisfactorily accounted for by the generally known customs of the savages , has been the subject of some speculation . But we must close these remarks . Although Mr Sclioolcraft 's journal through Lake Superior was still fresh in our memory , and we could hardly expect any thing new in a tour over the same route , saving personal adventures , yet we followed Mr M'Kenney from the Sault de Ste Marie to the Fond du Lac , finding ourselves entertained with many lively descriptions of scenery and many well told anecdotes relating to Indian manners and modes of thought . His friend and correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable to the partial eye of such a person a literal fulfilment of this request might he , we can not but think , that , when these extemporaneous and desultory notes were about to he submitted to the public , umueb pruning and condensation would have heemm judicious . Mr M'Kenney was generally known to have been some time connected with the Indian Department , and to have made this tour in the capacity of commissioner to treat with the Indians , and the public perhaps naturally expected that his 1 ) 00k would contain more new and substantial information on subjects connected with them . A liberal . benevolent . and // gentlemanly feeling prevails throughout the work , and we know of no tourist who appears to have moved along in better humor with every thing around him . If we objected to the first hundred and more pages , as being a redundancy in a tour like this , we can not but regard the last thirty or forty as being still more liable to the same objection . No charm of *vriting , or ingenuity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told tale .
