WHEN we compare the present state of the world with what is called antiquity , there is nothing in which the superiority of the later ages appears more conspicuous , than in the advancement of the natural sciences , or discoveries of the laws , operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us , that the common way of talking about antiquity is erroneous , and that men have begun to reckon at the wrong end The old age of the world , he says , is the proper period to be thus denominated , and not the green years of youth and inexperience . We of the present day are in fact the true ancients , and Zoroaster , Pythagoras , Plato , Aristotle , and others , whose lot it was to come upon the stage in the opening scene of the drama of human existence , are in reality the younger brethren of the great family of mankind . They had the imagination , the fire , and the inquisitiveness of youth , the power of genius and the resources of intellect , but , without the light of // experience , they wandered in dark paths and desert wastes , and gathered but little of the genuine fruit of know1ed*e Science made but slow progress in their hands ; they contrived systems , which served as prison houses to the mind , rather than instruments for unfolding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountains of truth ; and , what was the worst of all , they had the art to construct these systems so ingeniously , to rivet their parts together so firmly , and clothe them with such attractions , as to awaken the admiration and revereut*e of after times , and produce an influence , the ill effects of which are felt to the present day . The philosophers of early times amused themselves with speculations , fancies , dreams , which had little to do with the realities of things , or the obvious laws of nature . Witness the cosmogony of the Persians and Egyptians , the physical theories of the Greeks , that beautiful fabric of the material world first conceived by Democritus , matured by Epicurus , and adorned by the brilliant poetry of Lucretius . Witness the mythology of all the early nations , the agents to which they ascribed natural phenomena , their deities , demigods , and local divinities . Nature was not studied , nor its laws understood ; knowledge was at a stand , truth hidden , and experience unknown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries , were as much in the dark as the most humble and uninformed . That great magician , Aristotle , whose wand was so potent , after having trod in the open plains of history , ' if we may credit lord Bacon , and viewe ( l tile works of nature , yet dug to himself a dunbeon , and filled it with the vainest idols ; ' and Plato , the divine Plato , according to the same high authority , was not only a well bred sophister , a tumid poet , and fanatical divine , ' but he turned men 's thoughts from tile history of nature , and from things themselves , and tan bht tile mind to enter into itself , and there , under the name of contemplation , to tumble over its own blind and confused idols . ' Thus it was with those , who were called philosophers , and received the homage of the world for many ages , as the oracles of wisdom , and the true interpreters of nature . Aristotle wrote a history of animals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another on plants ; Pliny the elder compiled a work embracing all the branches of natural knowledge common in his time ; but hi story acquaints us with little , that can be dignified with the name of science , till within two hundred years . Bacon himself was the first to detect the errors // of preceding times , to point the way and set the example in pursuing scientific inquiries , on just and permanent principles . From that period the study of the sciences has been , not one of the most agreeable only , hut most useful , which has engaged the efforts of genius and industry . If we take in the whole compass of the sciences , indeed , as embracing the works and laws of nature in their widest extent , it may safely he said , that the modern improvements in society , view them as you may , have been owing more to the investigations of science , than to all other causes . Look at the single discovery of Newton , in demonstrating the great law of the universe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down to the minutest objects of nature around us , *and behold it regulating every motion , sustaining the organization of matter , halancing the world on its centre , and ruling the affinities hetween the smallest particles in the masses of material things . Examine its operations as applied to chemistry , and witness the extraordinary and heneficial results , which have grown out of this science , since it has been pursued according to the principles of the new philosophy of Bacon and Newton . The recent triumphs of science are seen everywhere , giving a new aspect to sociat existence , improving the arts and multiplying the enjoyments of life ; they axe seen in the increased facilities of navigation and commerce , inanufactures , agriculture , and the rumor hranches of industry . And what is more than all , a barrier has been fixed , beyond which the minds of men will not range in search of impossibilities and ahsurdities . Whole lives of labor and ingenious research will not he lost , as formerly , in dreaming about the philosopher 's stone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Truths have been discovered , and principles settled , which will serve as future guides , and help forward , to an indefinite limit , a knowledge of the properties , uses , and ends of nature . But when we descend to what have been called , by way of distinction , the natural sciences , as applicable to time three great kingdoms of nature , the mineral , vegetable , and animal , the utility of such studies may seem less obvious . We apprehend , however that , if the subject he viewed in its proper relations , no objection can be raised on this ground . There is doubtless nothing in the economy of nature , which may not be known to advantage by the beings , who live here in the midst of its infinitely varied operations , and who are furnished with capacities , which enable them to turn all knowledge to some useful ac* // count . Who can tell , moreover , how much one l ) art depends on another ; how much the mineral may affect the vegetable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are close affinities between the whole , that one relies on another for life and support , and that all contribute in general to the comfort of social man . Without aids from the mineral kingdom , we should be destitute of machinery and implements for executing the necessary operations in the arts of life ; from animals and vegetables we are clothed and fed . Now it may not be clear at once , what special and immediate benefit will be conferred on the human race , by the labors of a life spent in gathering up , naming , and describing the shells , which are driven to the beach by the waves of the sea , or in examining and niarkin* the peculiarities of different spires of grass and plants , that grow in wilds and solitudes ; but let it be remembered , that great and substantial results can be brou 6ht only out of these minute investigations , that a methodical arrangement of all the parts is necessary to constitute a perfect whole ; let this be realized , and these studies of the naturalist will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sciences threatens , undoubtedly , to throw an embarrassing Ol ) stncle in the way of rapid inquiry , and to retard for a time the progress of desirable knowledge . Names are multiplying beyond the compass of memory , and almost beyond the acquisition of an ordinary life . There is no remedy for this inconvenience , but it will gradually be diminished . When all the marked varieties in the departments of nature shall have been examined , described , and named , the only task then to be accomplished will be to methodize and simplify the facts thus collected , and establish a permanent classification . The system of nature will then be exhibited in its harmony and beauty , and the extent to which its various parts may be converted to the uses of man will be understood ; or , at least , all the elemen 's necessary for pursuing the study with this view will be established . So broad a range , indeed , we need not take , to discover the utility of the natural sciences . If nothin more were aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation , or an elegant accomplishmeut , they would claim a distinguished rank among liberal studies . A mind trained to the accurate observation of nature will receive a tone , and possess resources fitting it for contentment and happiness , which it can not derive in so high a degree from any other kinds of study . The // book of nature is always open , and the person , who from habit feels a pleasure in reading it , will ever have at hand the best antidotes against those common maladies of the mind , which beset the great mass of mankind for the want of engaging topics of thought , and incitements to application . Again , the natural sciences , as now pursued , contribute to the perfection of the arts , and the taste of the community is thereby refined , as its knowledge is enlarged , and means of enjoyment multiplied . To illustrate this fact , by eminent examples , we need only refer to Wilson 's and Bonaparte 's Ornithology , and Say 's beautiful work on insects , all published in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in every collection of books , public or private , in which it is deemed an object to treasure up memorials of the talents , taste , and skill of those , who have made the most successful researches in our natural history , and published them in a style that does credit not more to the authors and artists , than to the nation . But we are wandering wide of our purpose . We did not design , when we began , to read a solemn lecture on the ancients , nor to compose a dissertation on the dignity of science , nor to talk of the utility and influence of a just knowledge of nature ; we set out with no other intention , than to hazard a few remarks on the two works , whose titles are printed at the head of this article . We say hazard , for really we have not the affectation to pretend to an acquaintance with the subjects on which these books treat , and therefore we shall not say a word about genus or species , nor discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly called . Musctcapa Tyrannus , according to Linn* , or Tyrannus Savana , as set forth by Vieillot , and adopted by Mr Bonaparte . Matters of this dignity beloub only to the initiated , and should not be lightly handled . Besides , were we as deep in the mysteries of science , as Linn* himself , or Buffon , our Journal would be no place in which to display this knowledge , either to instruct the unlearned , or to astonish the skilful by the compass of our attainments . After this frank acknowledgement , we hope no offence will be taken , that we should presume to review books , which we do not understand . A sad , dull , heartless employment indeed , would reviewers have of it , if they were to be shut . up within these limits , and if all books must be understood before the critic can be allowed to sharpen his quill. in the first place , it may be charitably believed , that very few authors understand // what they write . Why deny to reviewers the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon come to an end , if such rigid rules were adopted ; for how many can you find , who will confess , that they frilly understand another 's book , however suecessfid the author himself may have been in fathoming his own thoughts ? It is a well established axiom , in short , drawn from the practice of ages , that writing and understanding are quite different things . Let it not be charged abajust us , therefore , that we abet any innovation in uttering a few remarks , touching two books on ornitholo*y , althouah we are fain to own , that we . know not one bird from another , except as we see them flying in the air , or hear their warblings in their wonted haunts . After these confessions , we presume our readers will he quite as well pleased to listen to the authors themselves , in their own language , as to anything we can say ; and in this particular we shall gratify them pretty freely in what remains of this article . In addition to the high scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful typography , accurate delineations from nature , and exquisite coloring , which have appeared in this country . The first , called a Supplement to Wilson 's Ornithology , published by Mr Ord , contains several plates , which exhibit birds engraved from Wilson 's original drawings , and intended by that distinguished ornithologist for a part of the ninth volume of his great work , had he lived to complete his task . Mr Ord deserves the wannest thanks of the public , for bringing forward these rem*ins of Wilson , in a style so elegant , and with accompaniments , which give them additional value and interest . A large portion of the volume is occupied with a tnemoir of the author , interspersed with many original letters , and closed with a series of critical remarks by the editor on the various literary productions of the ornithologist . Although these materials are thrown together without studied method , or rigid selection , yet they are fraught with entertainment , and show the prominent points of his character in strong relief . So much has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so wide is his fame , that we shall forbear to enlar*e on these topics . He was a Scotebman by birth ; the firs years ol his residence in this country were devoted to schoolkeeping in Pennsylvania ; an early acquaintance with the venerable Bartram kindled within him a love of science , and after he commenced his ornithological inquiries , he pursued them for the remaining short period of his life with an enthusiasm , // perseverance , and self devotion , which have rarely been equalled . lie died in Philadelphia , August 23d , 1818 , at the age of fortyseven . His Thnerican Ornithology , executed under every possible disadvantage , and with encouragement so slender , as hardly to keep him from the heavy pressure of want , is a monument to his name , that xviii never decay . The old world and the new will regard it with equal admiration . We may add , without hcsitation , ' says Mr Bonaparte , that such a work as he has published , in a new country , is still a desideratum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the fhcilities , which the arts and knowledge of Europe afford , would confer no common distinction ; but when it is considered , that Wilson taught himself , almost unassisted , the arts of drawing and engraving ; that he made his way in the science with very little aid from hooks or teachers ; that he entered a path in which he could find no companions , none to stimulate his ardor by a similarity of pursuits or communion of feeling , none to remove his doubts , guide his inquiries , or to be deeply interested in his success ; when these thiu*s are considered , the labors of Wilson must claim a praise , which is due to a few only of the solitary efforts of talent and enterprise . In the strictest sense of the terms , Wilson was a man of genius ; his perceptions were quick , his impressions vivid ; a bright glow of feeling breathes through his compositions . In tile professed walks of poetry his attempts were not often fortunate , hut his prose writings partake of the genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and minute observation of the natural world , are strongly indicated in whatever has flowed from his pen . lie travelled for the double purpose of procuring subscriptions to his book , and searching the forests for birds ; and some of his *raphic descriptions of the scenery of nature , and the hThits of the winged tribes , are inimitable . Sometimes he walked ; at others descended rivers in a canoe ; again he was on horseback , in a stahecoach , or a farmer 's waggon , as the great ends of his wanderings could be most easily attained . The cold repulses of the many , from whom he solicited subscriptions , he bore with equanimity , undaunted by disappointment , unsubdued by toil and privation ; the acquisition of a new bird , or of new facts illustrating the habitudes of those already known , was a fountain of joy in his ? *loo'niest moments ; it poure ( l the waters of oblivion over the past , and gave him new energy in his onward course . The following beautiful extract is from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching , when the garden , woods , and fields , will again display their foliage and flowers . Every day we may expect stran*ers. flocking from the south , to fill our woods with harmony . The pencil of Nature is now at work , arid outlines , tints , and gradations of lihts and shades , that baffle all description , will soon be spread before us by that great master , our most benevolent friend and father . Let us cheerfully participate in the feast he is preparing for all our senses . Lct us survey those millions of green strangers , just peeping in to day , as so in any happy messengers come to proclain-i the power and munificence of the Creator . I confess , that I was always an enthusiast in my admiration of the rural scenery of Nuture ; but , since your example and encouragement have set me to attempt to imitate her productions , I see new beauties in every bird , plant , or flower , I contemplate ; and find my ideas of the incomprehensible first cause still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sometimes smile to think that while others are immersed in deep schemes of speculation and n*grandizement-in building towns , and purchasing plantations , I am entranced in contemplation over the plumage of a lark , or gazing like a despairing lover , on the lineaments of an owl . While others are hoarding up their bags of money , without the power of enjoying it , I am collecting , without injuring my conscience , or wounding my peace of mind , those beautiful specimens of Nature 's works , that are forever pleasing . I have had live crows , hawks , and owis-opossurns , squirrels , snakes , lizards , &amp;c. so that my room has sometimes reminded me of Noah 's Ark ; but Noah had a wife in one corner of it , and in this particular our parallel does not altogether tally . I receive every subject of natural history that is brought me ; and though they do not march into my ark from all quarters , *s they did into that of our great ancestor , yet I find means , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them find the way fast enough . A boy not long ago , brought me a large basket full of crows . I expect his next load will be bullfrogs , if I do n't soon issue orders to the contrary . One of my boys caught a mouse in school , a few days ago , and directly marched up to me with his prisoner . I set about drawing it that evening , and all the while the pantings of its little heart showed it to be in the most extreme agonies of fear . I had intended to kill it , in order to fix it in the claws of a stuffed owl , but happening to spill a few drops of water near where it was tied , it lapped it up with such eagerness , and looked in my face with such an eye of supplicating terror , as perfectly overcame me . I immediately untied it , and restored it to life and liberty . The agonics of a prisoner at the stake , while the fire // and instruments of torment are preparing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor mouse ; and insignificant as the object was , I felt at that moment the sweet sensations that mercy leaves on the mind when she triumphs over cruelty . ' pp. 42 , 43 . The passage , which we are now about to quote , is part of a letter to Alexander Lawson , dated Lexington , Kentucky , April 4th , 1810 . Having now reached the second stage of my bird catching expedition , I willingly sit down to give you some account of my adventures and remarks since leaving Pittsburg ; by the aid of a good map , and your usual stock of patience , you will be able to listen to my story , and trace all my wanderings . Though generally dissuaded from venturing by myself on so long a voyage down the Ohio , in an open skiW I considered this mode , with all its inconveniences as the most favorable to my researches , and the most suitable to my funds , and I determined accordingly . Two days before my departure the Alleghany river was one wide torrent of broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this score . My stock of provisions consisted of some biscuit and cheese , and a bottle of cordial , presented me by a gentleman of Pittsburg ; my gun , trunk , and great coat , occupied one end of the boat ; I had a small tin occasionally to hale her , and to take my beverage from the Ohio with ; and bidding adieu to the smoky confines of Pitt , I launched into the stream , soon winding away among the hills that everywhere enclose this noble river . The weather was warm and serene , and the river like a mirror , except where floating masses of ice spotted its surface , and which required some care to steer clear of ; but these to my surprise , in less than a day 's sailing , totally disappeared . Far from being concerned at my new situation , I felt my heart expand with joy at the novelties which surrounded me ; I listened with pleasure to the whistling of the red bird on the bank as I passed , and contdmplated the forest scenery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous sugar camps rising lazily among the mountains , gave great effect to the varying landscape ; and the grotesque log cabins , that here and there opened from time woods , were diminished into mere doghouses by  --  the sublimity of the impending mountains . If you suppose to yourself two parallel ranges of forest covered hills , whose irregular summits are seldom more than three or four miles apart , winding through an immense extent of country , and enclosing a river half a mile wide , which altei*nately washes the qwq // torn on the other , of a mile or so in breadth , you xviii have a pretty correct idea of the appearance of the Ohio . The banks of these rich flats are from twenty to sixty and eighty feet high , and even these last were within a few feet of being overflowed in December , 1808 . I roxved twenty odd miles the first spell , and found I should be able to stand it perfectly well . About an hour after night I put up at a miserable cabin , fiftytwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be corn stalks , or something worse ; so preferring the smooth bosom of the Ohio to this brush heap , I got up long before day , and , bein , r under no apprehension of losing my way , I again pushed out into the stream . rrhe landscape on each side lay in one mass of shade , but the grandeur of the projecting headlands and vanishing points , or lines , were charmingly reflected in the smooth glassy surface below . I could only discover when I was passing a clearing by the croxvin* of cocks ; and now and then in more solitary places the big horned owl made a most hideous hallowing that echoed among the mona tains . In this lonesome manner , with full leisure for observation and reflection , exposed to hardships all day , arid bard births all night , to storms of rain , hail , and snow , for it froze severely almost every night . I persevered , from the twentyfourth of February to Sunday evening , March 17th , when I moored my skiff safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , after a voyage of seven hundred and twenty miles . ' pp. 217-220 . For the gratification of such of our readers , as have not seen Wilson 's great work , we shall select one or two specimens of his descriptions , which are happy arid well sustained . The plumage of the Mocking Bird , though none of the homeliest , has nothing gaudy or brilliant in it ; and , had he nothing else to recommend him , would scarcely entitle him to notice ; but his figure is well proportioned , and even handso* . c . The ease , elegance , and rapidity of his movements , the animation of his eve , and the intelligence he displays in listening , and laying up lessons from almost every species of the feathered creation within his hearing , are really surprising , and mark the peculiarity of his genius . To these qualities we may add that of a voice full , strong , and musical , and capable of almost every modulation , from the clear mellow tones of the wood thrush , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accent he faithfully follows his originals . In force of sweetness and expression he great improves upon them . In his native groves , mounted upon the top of a tall bush or half grown tree , in the dawn of dewy morning , xvhile the woods are already vocal with a multitude of warbiers* // his admirable song rises preeminent over every competitor . The ear can listen to his music alone , to which that of all the others seems a mere accompaniment . Neither is this strain altogether imitative . His own native notes , which are easily distinguishable by such as are acquainted with those of our various song birds , are bold and full , and varied seemingly beyond all limits . They consist of short expressions of two , three , or at the most five or six syllables ; generally interspersed with imitations , and all of them uttered with great emphasis and u'piditv ; and continued with undiminished ardor , for half an hour , or an hour , at a time . His expanded wings and tail , glistening with white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye , as his song most irresistibly does the ear . lie sweeps round with enthusiastic ecstasy . He mounts and descends as his song swells or dies away ; and as my friend Mr Bartram has beautifully expressed it , " He bounds aloft with the celerity of an arrow , as if to recover or recal , his very soul , which expired in the last elevated strain . " While thus exerting himself a bystander , destitute of sight , would suppose that the whole feathered tribes had assembled together , on a trial of skill , each striving to produce his utmost effect , so perfect are his imitatioiis . He many times deceives the sportsman , and sends him in search of birds that perhaps are not within miles of him ; but whose notes he exactly imitates . Even birds themselves are frequently imposed on by this admirable mimic , and are decoyed by the fancied calls of their mates ; or dive with precipitation into the depths of thickets , at the scream of what they suppose to be the Sparrowhawk . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given with remarkable spirit , and with imagery so minute and glowing , as to attest its truth . This distinguished bird , as he is the most beautiful of his tribe in this part of the world , and the adopted emblem of our country , is entitled to particular notice . He has been long known to naturalists , being common to both continents , and occasionally met with from a very high northern latitude , to the borders of the torrid zone , but chiefly in the vicinity of the sea , and along the shores and cliffs of our lakes and large rivers . Formed by nature for braving the severest cold ; feeding equally upon the produce of the sea3 arid of the land ; possessing powers of flight capable of outstripping even the tempests themselves ; unawed by anything but man ; and from the ethereal heights to which he soars , looking abroad , at one glance , on an immeasurable expanse of forests , fields , lakes , and ocean , deep below him ; he appears indifferent to the little localities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can pass from summer to winter , from the lower to the higher re*ion* of the tmos ; diere , the abode of eter* al cold ; and thence dc*s end at will to the torrid or the arctic regions of the earth . He is ther&amp;ji e found at all seasons in the countries which he inhabits but i*refers such places as have been mentioned above , from t**e rreLt p : *rtVil ; tv he has for fish . In procuinT toese iis:Jays. in very siui*ular manner , the genius and en r*vy of his c1i racter. xviich is fierce , contemplative , d:iri ; ig an I tyi anuical ; a4tributes n 4 excrted but on particular ocasions ; but when put forth , o* er*x h lining all opposition . Elevated upon a high de d Ii oh of some cui*ant c tree , that commands a wile view of toe ii.irhbourin* shore and ocean , he seems cdlinly to conte noht* toe notl ' ) iis of the various feathered tribes that pursue their buQy avo*ations below the snow white gulls slowly xviuibo*vin* th air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains of duet*s stieaiiino ' over the surface ; silent and watchful cranes , intent and wa , lin* clamorous crows , and all the winged intiltitudes that *ihsist by the bounty of this vast liquid magazine of nature . high over all these hovers one , whose action instantly arrests his attention . By his wide curvature of wing , and sudden suspension in air , he knows him to be the fish hawk settling over some devote ' victim of the deep . His eye kindles at the si*:ht , and balancing liimselg with half opened win*s , on the branch lie watches the result . Down , rapid as an arrow from heaven , descends the distant object of his attention , the roar of its wings reaching the ear as it disappears in the deep , making the surges foam around . At this moment the looks of the Eale are all ardor ; and levellin* his neck for flight , he sees the Fish Hawk emerge , struggling with his prey , and mounting into the air with screams of exultation . These are the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instantly gives chase , soon gains on the Fish hawk , each exerts his utmost to mount above the other , displaying in these rencontres the most elegant and sublime aerial evolutions . The unincumbered Eagle rapidly advances , and is just on the point of reaching his opponent , when with a sudden scream , probably of despair and honest execration , the latter drops his fish ; the Eagle poising himself for a moment , as if to take a more certain aim , descends like a whirlwind , snatches it in his grasp ere it reaches the water , and bears his ill gotten booty silently away to the woods . ' pp. 2f37-209 . Mr Ord devotes several pages to erilKeisms on Wilson 's writings , both in prose and poetry , which throughout bear the marks of fairness and discritnination ; the parri&amp;ity of friendship seems neither to have biassed the opinions , nor guided the pen of th' // critic . As a poet , he allows his author very little merit , and justly considers his fame to rest on the extraordinary talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ep ; stolary writings . We have only to add , that we can not commend Mr Ord 's judgment in printing some of the letters , which he has selected from Wilson 's corre*pon Li ice . We ie fet particularly to parts of the letters from B to Waslmiiy ton , Charleston , and Savannah ; and even * pm tim* of the letter from Lexington , printed during his liletime , m*r*t have been omitted with advantage . XViison 's qn*cL oos* wtin must have discovered to him many things in his U V*IIS xxi cli would appear peculiar , odd , or ludicrous , when comnp ' *r*d web his local associations , anti in a sportive hour there was no n'rrn in describing them in his own way , for the amusu nent &amp; friend ; but when such things are p inted in ! i grave quarto , they are out of place , and produce a disagreeable , rather than a pleasing effect . Bmoad caricatures of the manners and habits of a people , drawn from the observations of a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beguiled a few of the writer 's listless moments , or contributed to the gratification of his friends , are not matters for the world 's instruction . In Lexington market Wilson saw , among other strange things , skinned squirrels cut up into quarters , ' and his letter , announcing this important fact , was published not long afterward . Some patriotic Lexingtonian questioned the statement , and called it a joke . Wilson replied , that it was no joke , but a solemn matter of fact , correcting , however , a slight error from his note book , in which he had entered the word halves , ' instead of quarters ; and so it was maintained , that , in Lexington , skinned squirrels were brought to market in the form of a saddle of venison , not in that of a leg or a shoulder of mutton . ' This seems to have silenced the Lexingtonian , for we hear no more about him . The whole correspondence is recorded , however , in Mr Ord 's Supplement . We repeat , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fame of Wilson , and added to the value of this volume . It has already been mentioned , that Wilson died before his work was completed . It is the professed object of Mr Bonaparte to carry through the unfinished design of his predecessor The first volume is published , and two more are to follow , which , together with the nine volumes of Wilson , he thinks will *inplete the whole subject of American Ornithology . Of th' // scientific merits of Mr Bonaparte 's labors , we have said enough to sboxv , that it is not for us to judge , but we may safely testifv our admiration of the beautiful manner , in which every part of this first volume has been executed . Neither trouble nor expense has been spared , and the author , artists , and publisher claim unqualified praise , each in his rCsl ) eCtiVe department . The drawi*g , engraviiy , and coloring of the birds are in the very fist style , and show a manifest improvement in these arts sin e the tima of Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Mr Titian Peale from the recent hird , and not from preservezl specimens . ' This advantage the artist was enabled to possess by his xvide travels , and particularly wiLh Major Long , in his Expedition to the Rocky Mountains . From drawings thus prepared , the engravings were executed by Mr Lawson , who distinguished himself in engraving some of Wilson 's birds , and who , from his lo*g practice and skill , it is said , may be justly styled the first ornithological engraver of our age . ' The colorin* was done from nature ' by Mr Rider . We have been thus particular in mentioning names , because excellence of so high an order , as these specimens of art indicate , deserves to be commemorated . Nor should the part performed by Mr Mitchell , the publisher , be passed over , in these days of wretched printing . A more splendid work , as a whole , we certainly have never seen from the American press . Posterity will regard it among the Aldines of our day . Two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tribute , which we are qualified to render to his talents as an ornithologist ; though we accord to him cheerfully the fame he holds among those , who are in the highest ranks of science , and we will not be backward in expressing our due share of gratitude to a foreigner , of his qualifications , who has made his home among us , and takes so deep and practical an interest in the scientific progress of our country . To this sentiment we beliere there is no American , whose heart will not respond , and who will not look with eager hope to the successful prosecution of Mr Bonaparte 's ornithological labors , or any other projects of science , in which his taste or leisure may incline him to engage . The following is an extract from Mr Bonaparte 's curious account of the Burrowing Owl . Venerable ruins , crumbling under the influence of time and vicissitudes of season , are habitually associated with our recol ' // lections of the Owl ; or he is considered as the tenant of sombre forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harsh dissonance of his voice . In poetry he has long been regarded as the appropriate concomitant of darkness and horror ; and , when heard screaming from the topmost fragments of some mouldering wall , whose ruggedness is but slightly softened by the mellowing moonlight , imagination loves to view him as a malignant spirit , hooting triumphantly over the surrounding desolation ! But we are now to make the reader acquainted with an Owl to which none of these associations can belong ; a bird , that , so far from seeking refuge in the ruined habitations of man , fixes its residence within the earth ; and , instead of concealing itself in solitary recesses of the forest , delights to dwell on open plains , in company with animals remarkable for their social disposition , neatness , and order . Instead of sailing heavily forth in the obscurity of the evening or morning twilight , and then retreating to mope away the intervening hours , our Owl enjoys the broadest glare of the noon day sun , and flying rapidly along , searches for food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votaries of natural science must always feel indebted to the learned and indefatigable Say , for the rich collection of facts he has made whenever opportunities have been presented , but more especially in the instance of this very singular bird , whose places of resort in this country , are too far distant to allow many the pleasure of examining for themselves . We feel doubly disposed to rejoice , that the materials for the history of our birds , are drawn from his ample store , both on account of their intrinsic excellence , and because it affords us an opportunity of evincing our admiration of the zeal , talents , and interrity. which have raised this man to the most honorable and enviable eminence as a naturalist . ' In the trans-Mississippian territories of the United States , the Burrowing Owl resides exclusively in the villages of the Marmot , or Prairie Dog , whose excavations are so commodious , as to render it unnecessary that our bird should dig for himself , as he is said to do in other parts of the world , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variable in their extent , sometimes covering only a few acres , and at others spreading over the surface of the country for miles together . They are composed of slightly elevated mounds , having the form of a truncated cone , about two feet in width at base , and seldom rising as high as eighteen inches above the surface of the soil . The entrance is placed either at the top or on the side , and the whole mound is beaten down externally , espe // cially at the summit , resembling a much used foot path . From the entrance , the passage into the mound descends vertically for one or two feet , and is thence continued obliquely downwards , until it terminates in an apartment , within which the industrious Marmot constructs , on the approach of the cold season , the comfortable cell for his winter 's sleep . This cell , which is composed of fine dry grass , is globular in form , with an opening at top capable of admitting the finger ; and the whole is so firmly compacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the floor . It is delightful during fine weather , to see these lively little creatures sporting about the entrance of their burrows , which are always kept in the neatest repair , and are often inhabited by several individua*ls . When alarmed , th ' *y immediately take refuge in their subterranean chambers , or if the dreaded danger be not immediately impending , they stand near the brink of the entrance , bravely barking and flourishing their tails , or else sit erect to reconnoitre the movements of the enemy . The mounds thrown up by the Marmot in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains , have an appearance of greater antiquity than those observed on the far distant plains . They sometimes extend to several yards in diameter , although their elevation is trifling , and , except immediately surrounding the entrance , are clothed with a scanty herbage , which always distinguishes the area of these villages . Sometimes several villages have been observed almost entirely destitute of vegetation ; and recollecting that the Marmot feeds exclusively on grasses and herbaceous plants , it seems singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot for the place of his abode . However this may be accounted for , it at least affords an opportunity of beholding the approach of his enemies , and allows him to seek , within the bosom of the earth , that security which he has neither strength nor arms to command . In all these Prarie Dog villages the Burrowing Owl is seen moving briskly about , or else in small flocks scattered among the mounds , and at a distance it may be mistaken for the Marmot itself ; when sitting erect . They manifest but little timidity , and allow themselves to be approached sufficiently close for shooting . but if alarmed , some or all of them soar away , and settle down again at a short distance ; if further disturbed , their flight is contintred until they are no longer in view , or they descend into their dwellings , whence they are difficult to dislodge . ' The burrows into which these Owls have been seen to descend , on the plains of the river Platte , where they are the most numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been inferred by Say , that they were either common , though . // unfriendly residents of the same habitation , or that our Owl was the sole occupant of a burrow acquired by the right of conquest . The evidence of this was clearly presented , by the ruinous condition of the burrows tenanted by the Owl , which were frequently caved in , and their sides channelled by the rains , while the neat and well preserved mansion of the Marmot , showed the active care of a sk:lful and industrious owner . We have no evidence that the Owl and Marmot habitually resort to one burrow ; yet we are assured by Pike , and others , that a common danger often drives them into the same excavation , where lizards and rattlesnakes also enter for concealment and safety . ' pp. 68-71 . The author dwells at much length on the description of the Wild Turkey , which is accomnanied with a beautiful drawing . lie asserts manfully the original claim of America to this bird . The first certain account of it , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his History of the West Indies . It was sent from Mexico to Spain , in the early part of the sixteenth century , and thence to England about the year 1524 . By degrees it spread over Europe , and within a century was introduced into Asia , Africa , and the European colonies . The origin of the English name , Turkey , as applied to this bird , is a little singular . It was first brought to England at a time , when it was customary to denote articles of luxury from foreign countries by this appellation , and as this bird was a delicacy of novel and rare occurrence , it took the same name . This error was perpetuated , from the circumstance of its being supposed to have come , through Spain , from Asia or Africa . Some naturalists represented it as having been known to the ancients , but they confounded it with the Guinea Fowl . The Turkey is in fact indigenous in America , and was a stranger to the old world , till after the discoveries of Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which it has been called among different tribes of Indians . From the author 's full description of this bird , we shall select two or thre9 paragraphs , in which are exhibited some of its habits . When about to cross a river , they select the highest eminences , that their flight may be the more certain ; and here they sometimes remain for a day or more , as if for the purpose of consultation , or to be duly prepared for so hazardous a voyage . Duriwr this time the males gobble obstreperously , and strut with extraordinary importance , as if they would animate their companions , and inspire them with the utmost degree of hardihood ; // the females and young also assume much of the pompous air of the males , the former spreading their tails , and moving silently around . At length the assembled multitude mount to the tops of the highest trees , whence , at a signal note from a leader , the whole together wing their way towards the opposite shore . All the old and fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile in width ; but the young , meagre , and weak , frequently fall short of the desired landing , and are forced to swim for their lives . This they do dexterously enough , spreading their tails for a support , closing their wings to the body , stretching their neck forwards , and striking out quickly and forcibly with their legs , If in thus endeavoring to gain the land , they approach an elevated or inaccessible bank , their exertions are remitted , they resign themselves to the stream for a short time , in order to gain strength , and then with one violent effort , escape from the water . But in this attempt , all are not successful ; some of the weaker , as they can not rise sufficiently high in air to clear the bank , fall again and again into the water , and thus miserably perish . Immediately after these birds have succeeded in crossing a river , they for some time ramble about without any apparent unanimity of purpose , and a great many are destroyed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These birds are guardians of each other , and the first who sees a Hawk or Eagle gives a note of alarm , on which all within hearing lie close to the ground . As they usually roost in flocks , perched on the naked branches of trees , they are easily discovered by the large Owls , and when attacked by these prowling birds , often escape by a somewhat remarkable manomvre . The Owl sails around the spot to select his prey ; but notwithstanding the almost inaudible action of his pinions , the quick ear of one of the slumberers perceives the danger , which is immediately announced to the whole party by a chuck ; thus alarmed , they rise on their legs , and watch the motions of the Owl , who , darting like an arrow , would inevitably secure the individual at which he aimed , did not the latter suddenly drop his head , squat , and spread his tail over his back ; the Owl then glances over without inflicting any injury , at the very instant that the Turkey suffers himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is secure from his dreaded enemy . ' Wild Turkeys are very tenacious of their feeding grounds , as well as of the trees on which they have once roosted . Flocks have been known to resort to one spot for a succession of years , and to return after a distant emigration in search of food . Their roosting place is mostly on a point of land jutting into a river , where there are large trees . When they have collected at the // signal of a repeated gobbling , they silently proceed towards their nocturnal abodes , and perch near each other ; from the numbers sometimes congregated in one place , it would seem to be the common rendezvous of the whole neighborhood . But no position , however secluded or difficult of access , can secure them from the attacks of the artful and vi*ilant hunter , who , when they are all quietly perched for the night , takes a stand previously chosen by daylight ; and , when the rising moon enables him to take sure aim , shoots them down at leisure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches first , he may secure nearly the whole flock , neither the presence of the hunter , nor the report of his gun intimidating the Turkeys , although the appearance of a single Owl would be sufficient to alarm the whole troop ; the dropping of their companions from their sides excites nothing but a buzzing noise , which seems more expressive of surprise than fright . This fancied security , or heedlessness of danger , while at roost , is characteristic of all the gallinaceous birds of North America . ' pp. 82-91 . In connexion with these characteristics of the Turkey , and the description of the Bald Eagle above quoted , it may be no improper place here to introduce Dr Franklin 's humorous remarks , as contained in one of his letters , concerning the bird , which was chosen for the emblem of our nation . " Others object to the Bald Eagle , " says he , " as looking too much like a Dindon , or Turkey . For my own part , I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bad moral character ; he does not get his living honestly ; you may have seen him perched on some dead tree , where , too lazy to fish for himself , he watches the labor of the Fishing Hawk ; and when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish , and is bearing it to its nest for the support of his mate and young ones , the Bald Eagle pursues him , and takes it from him . With all this injustice he is never in good case ; but like those among men , who live by sharping and robbiiig , he is generally poor , and often very lousy . Besides , he is a rank coward ; the little Kingbird , not bigger than a sparrow , attacks him boldly , and drives him out of the district . He is therefore , by no means a proper emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America , who have driven all the Kingbirds from our country ; though exactly fit for that order of Knights , which the French call Glievaliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure is not known as a Bald . Eagle , but looks more like a Turkey . For in truth the Turkey is , * in comparison , a much more respectable bird , and withal a true original native of America* // Eagles have been found in all countries , but the Turkey was peculiar to ours . lie is besides , ( though a little vain and silly , t is true , but not the worse emblem for that , ) a bird of courage , and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards , who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on .
