SCENE :  --  At and near King 's Bridge , situated twelve miles from the city of New-York . TIME :  --  Forty eight hours . Main text ACT 1 . SCENE I.  --  Interior of a Country Dwelling : Mr. Richardson and Mary seated at table ; Mr. Richardson overlooking newspapers . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  Alas , I can find nothing here but accounts of the defeat of the American Army , in every quarter ; but there is no confidence to be placed in the exaggerated statements of the British press . Come , come , cheer up Mary , all will yet be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt but freedom will triumph , and Frederick be shortly restored to our arms . Mary . Mary  --  But is there no method we can devise to hear from him  --  could not a letter be sent ? Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  No , my love , it would endanger our safety . I am already suspected by the British of favoring the American cause ; and the least confirmation of those suspicious , would draw down their bitterest vengeance upon our heads . I must be circumspect in my actions , for the sake of my aged wife ; she is very ill , and needs my assistance to comfort and cheer her drooping spirits  --  ' t would break her old heart should I neglect her now :  --  we have passed forty happy years together , and now only regret that we can not count them o'er again . And for your sake too , Mary  --  for when your dying father committed you to my charge , I pledged an oath to cherish and protect you , nor endanger your safety by exposing myself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am rejoiced in the happy confirmation that my son has given his heart to one so worthy its possession . I must remain inactive , and in silence submit to the insults of both friend and foe ; the Americans brand me with the name of tory  --  the British call me a rebel ! Oh , if the prayers which are daily offered to heaven , from these aged lips , for the cause of freedom , constitute me a rebel  --  I am one . But tory ! were I not detained by duty , in the field this arm should rebut the charge  --  and the blood hounds of tyranny should sink beneath the flash of my sabre , as dmons sink from the light of heaven . ( knocking without ) But whither has my indignation led me , perhaps betrayed me . Mary . Mary  --  Let me hasten to the door . ( going ) Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  ( detaining her ) Nay , child  --  Enter Cato . Cato . Cato  --  Massa , dare somebody at de door dat look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  And his business ? Cato . Cato  --  He want to come in I ' speck ; for it quite a sea-storm on de road  --  I tell him to wait little : but here he come now , wid French leave , and Turkeyish imperdence . Enter a Stranger , muffled in a cloak , with a military hat . Mary and Cato retire to the back of the stage as he enters . Strang . Stranger  --  Having been overtaken on the road by a storm , I have taken the liberty to intrude here for a shelter . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  No intrusion , sir ; my doors were ever open to the stranger  --  be seated . They seat themselves  --  Mary comes forward , and Cato goes off eyeing the stranger in a very circumspect manner . Strang . Stranger  --  Thanks to your kindness , sir . ( looking about inquisitively . ) Have you no other member to your family but this lovely girl ? Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  I have , sir ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strang Stranger  --  And this maiden , sir ; is she your daughter ? Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  ( aside . ) What can he mean by these questions ! No , sir , she is the orphan of an American officer , who fell in the defence of his country  --  his rights  --  his liberty ! Strang Stranger  --  ( aside ) Nobly said ! but I 'll sound him farther ; it can not be true that he secretly favors the British cause . Pray , sir , is here any news from the army of Washington ? Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  None but contradictory statements of their total defeat . It is the prevailing belief that Washington will not succeed in establishing the independence of his country . ( aside ) That will prove him friend or foe . Strang . Stranger  --  Not succeed !  --  the cause which has roused such a spirit as Washington 's , would succeed , though all the tyrants of Europe were combined against him . It is the cause of suffering thousands , who are determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom : and when led on by Washington , with heaven for his guide , what power on earth can resist them ? Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  You seem to be quite an enthusiast in the cause of liberty . Strang . Stranger  --  I am , sir I belong to the army of Washington ; actuated by feelings of love for my country , I have taken arms against her oppressors . I have fought and bled by the side of that god-like hero  --  followed him through fields of carnage  --  gazed upon his calm collected features amid the din and rage of battle , and thought him more than mortal ; and when victory perched upon our banners , when the thunder of artillery and clash of the sabre had ceased , Washington was still the same ; there was no haughtiness in his conscious superiority over his conquered foe  --  no pompous pageantry glittered in his path ; but with the same calm countenance he received the submission of his overpowered enemy , and congratulated his fellow soldiers upon their victory . This is the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fetters of bondage , and achieve our independence . Blood will flow in torrents from America 's martyr 'd sons  --  aye , and freely will it flow ; none will shrink from the sacrifice . For myself , should necessity demand it these veins shall be drained to the last drop at the altar of my country 's freedom . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  I honor your sentiments , sir . I have an only son , who is now in the field and who I trust is actuated by the same noble impulse which has impelled you ; and though I am denied the privilege of taking arms in this glorious struggle , still will my prayers be daily offered for its success . Strang Stranger  --  With the prayers of such good men as you , and the determination of our gallant leader , our cause must eventually succeed . ( noise without ) But hark  --  the tramp of the horse is distinct , and I must begone ; ' t would be your ruin should the enemy discover me here . ( going ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare some lobster back sogers tying dare horses to de rail sence . Strang . Stranger  --  Ha ! the red-coats ! should they discover me , death would be my inevitable portion . Mr R. Mr Richardson  --  My dear sir , you had better conceal yourself ; in that room you can remain safe . Strang Stranger  --  No : concealment were perhaps dangerous ; I will confront them  --  if they are enemies , this disguise will shield me from their prying curiosity . Mary . Mary  --  ( coming forward ) Dear sir , do enter that room  --  should they discover you , poor father  --  Cato Cato  --  Yes , massa , and da stick poor Cato same as de butcher kill de pig . ( pushing him ) Mary . Mary  --  Quick ! do conceal yourself  --  they are at the door  --  repay not my father 's kindness with ingratitude ! Strang . Stranger  --  Nay , ' t is too late now . Cato . Cato  --  What a damn discombleging feller dat is ( aside ) Exit . Enter Percy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( alter eyeing the group contemptuously , seats himself near the stranger ) This is a stormy night . Strang . Stranger  --  Yes : but what signifies the raging of the elements without , when all is calm within the bosom ? Percy . Percy  --  Very true , sir ; but how many can say his conscience is at rest ? Strang . Stranger  --  I can answer for myself , sir ; can you ? Percy . Percy  --  aside to Sergeant Who the devil can this be ? Serg . British Sergeant  --  Some canting methodist preacher I presume , by his books . And perhaps direct from the city . Percy . Percy  --  Quite likely . Pray , sir , can you give me any information of the army of Washington ? Strang . Stranger  --  None but that which is poison to the ears of its enemies  --  its success ! Percy . Percy  --  You speak bold , sir . I am in his majesty 's service . Strang . Stranger  --  To his majesty himself would I speak my sentiments freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , protects you from my resentment . Strang . Stranger  --  hostily My garb , sir  --  recollecting himself is the garb of a christian . retires Percy . Percy  --  seeing Mary By Sir George , these are charms that could fire the heart of an anchorite . This is but a sorry place for you to dwell in , my pretty maid ; that form should grace a soldier 's tent . Let me taste those cherry lips of thine . seizes her Strang Stranger  --  rushing forward Wretch desist ! insult not the inhabitants of this dwelling , who have hospitably sheltered you from the storm . Percy Percy  --  Who are you that dare to interfere ? Strang . Stranger  --  throwing off his disguise An American ! Percy . Percy  --  By heaven , an officer in the rebel army . Mary . Mary  --  ' T is , ' t is Frederick . falls in his arms Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  My son , oh , my son , your rashness I fear  --  Fred .

Mr. Richardson  --  You , my love ; how would you assist him ? Mary . Mary  --  By obtaining an interview , and conveying to him a disguise suit of my own clothes . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  And expose yourself to the rude insults of the British soldiery ? No , no , my love ; we must trust alone to the lenity of his judges , for his safety . Mary . Mary  --  The lenity of his judges ! is he not in the hands of tyrants ? And think you they will administer justice , or show mercy ? No , they will murder , basely murder him . Let me fly to his rescue ; to save my Frederick I will brave every danger , encounter every ill . Mr. R. Mr. Richardson  --  The blessings of heaven protect you . Exit following Mary . SCENE II .
