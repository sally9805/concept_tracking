txt ART . VI. - Symzonia , a Voyage of Discovery , by Captain . /Idam Seaborn . New York , 1820. l2mo , pp. 248 . NOTHING furnishes a stronger illustration of the superficial taste of men , than the almost exclusive attention they have paid to the external surface of the globe . The same willingness to be blinded by the outside appearance , which obtains in the details of manners and character , has exerted a much more pernicious effect on the general regard men have bestowed upon the earth they inhabit . One is fatigued with the mass of travels to explore its unknown regions , of voyages to discover its distant seas . Not an arrogant mountain , that towers upward , but has been measured ; nor an indenture on the rind , by the name of an ocean , a mine , or a valley , but has been fathomed , descended , and traversed till one is weary of // this superficial pains-taking . All the while , the honest solid interior , the root and heart and kernel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have remained worse than unexplored . We say , worse than unexplored , ' because if men had confined themselves to a total neglect of these regions , much as we should have derided their folly , for travelling round and round so fair an abode without venturing bravely into it , we could have accused them of nothing worse than insensibility . It is a matter , however , which admits of no disguise to the diligent student of antiquity , or the observer of popular belief , that the conduct of men toward these interior regions has not . rested here . And without trying to soften what after all must be confessed and hurried over as well as it can , it is a fact too notorious to be concealed , that the ancients from some primitive pique against the internals , early contrived to get the t in the name of the latter changed into auf ; and to propagate the idea , that the centre of the earth was actually the location of a spot , which we desire not to mention to the ears polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awkward feeling in men 's minds , about visiting these abodes ; and as the same insidious geographers were careful to lay down the entrance to them either in some pestiferous grotto or flaming crater , the persons best inclined by temper and taste to gravitate to the centre have either been wholly deterred. , or gone about it with great tardiness of spirit . One of the most distinguished explorers of ancient times , indeed , found courage to undertake the excursion , by the virtue of a branch of gold , which he had the good fortune to find growing near the avenue ; and if any thing would be attractive enough to enlist imitators of the experiment , we think it would be to have the entrance , through forests equally promising . We find no mention in Michaux , however , of a fungus of this kind , on any of our forest trees ; and a late distinguished prince , the unfortunate emperor of Hayti , appears to have placed his hopes for the discovery of the internal regions ( we make a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , to be sure , in principle , but different in form ; for it is the only apophthegm , as far as we are acquainted , preserved of this monarch , that if there were a bag of coffee in the mouth of - there would be two Americans after it . ' To do men justice , it must be acknowledged after all , that // this their conduct has not proceeded from an abstract aversion to having the lower regions explored . On the contrary , they have shown themselves more disinterested on this head , than on most others . Backxvard as they have been to undertake the expedition themselves , there is none on which they are so ready to set out their neighbours ; and if polite wishes and friendly intimations could carry one thither , there are not many parts of the upper regions , which would be more frequented than the lower . But it seems to have but little effect ; and people stand complimenting each other , like over polite folks at a door , neither being willing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward . We confess that we have always thought this prejudice against the interior unreasonable , and wholly unauthorized by analogy ,  --  the best guide we can have in the want of positive information . The works of nature , the more they are studied , are found to exhibit a certain beautiful harmony , on which we have a right to proceed in regard to what is unknown . There are so few productions of nature , which fall beneath our inspection , of which the outside is not the least valuable part , that we find it hard to believe that she has lavished all her resources on the exterior of the great globe itself ; and condemned the main mass of it to a base and inanimate stratification , or to a hopeless chaos . In general , that which is good for much , whether in the unorganized , the vegetable , animal , or intellectual world , carries its merit within ; and external beauties and superficial merits are proverbially transitory and worthless ; either found to be unattended with interior worth , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mildew , and decay . If you would have a fixed and permanent scarlet dye , you must seek out some unpromising mineral oxyde , or grind up a poor worm from a foreign coast ; while that which you find on the leaves of the tulip , on a beautiful cheek , or the evening sky is gone almost before you can notice it . Messrs Perkins , Fairman , and Heath , nay Messrs Murray , Draper , &amp; Co. have an ingenious machine , by the aid of which , and a productive paper-mill , they can make money almost as fast as a woman of fashion can spend it ; such beautiful money too , that our brethren in the west have already borrowed a million or two of it from one bank , without the demand being ha ( f satisfied : ' nay , have even given a premium for the new bills over the old , as we ourselves , in our earlier days , remember to // have entertained a strong prejudice in favor of a bright cent . So rapid too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hemp and flax yesterday , and linen , and rags , and money today , too often brings you down to rags tomorrow , and not perhaps quite so often as it might , to hemp again the day after . This is superficial money , while the true , interior , substantial coin must be dug deep out of a dreary mine , amidst the rushing of subterranean waters , and the toiling of ponderous engines , and be beaten , and roasted , and smelted% and coined , and milled out of rough , unseemly ores ; and after all is but a white or yellow counter , with an ugly Spanish nose upon it ; while the other money is covered with ships , and eagles , and lions , and goddesses , as gay as the pantheon . The moment you turn your attention to the globe itself , you find it increase in value , as you penetrate below the surface ; thereby furnishing the strongest encouragement to make thorough work ; and instead of grubbing on the outside , go at once to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we all know , barren , sterile , worthless ; and decked with beauties and riches not its own . The great trees , which adorn it , are not set down like flower pots on the top , but if Virgil can be trusted , actually go downxvard as far as they rise upward , and bring from below all that nourishes the splendid foliage above . It is so with the members of the whole vegetable tribe , which would die in the first sultry sun on the treacherous bosom of the soil , if they - did not shoot inward their sagacious fibres , and force down their greedy taproots , and suck out some of the nutriment of the rich strata within . The farther yo* *go down into the earth , the richer it grows . You first meet with your pigments and ochres , then with your rich porcelain clays and petuntzes ; farther down you have your salt and your coal , and still farther your gold and your silver . Thei* too what blessed fountains of health gush up from its hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth to get plain fair water , and this , at some places , as at Taunton , is so weak that it will not run down hill . While the fountains from beneath come bubbling up with all their sparkling carbonic gases , and tingling chalyheate freshness . In short , we look upon the earth as a great fig , the outside black and unpromising ; remove the skin , and you come to an agreeable , nutritious pulp ; while the germ , the fructific*ition , the origin , and life of the whole is shut up and enclosed in the centre . // We have thrown together these ideas , by way of forestalling the favor of our readers to the projects of our ingenious countryman , one of the few men of the day , who seems to have pursued these analogies , and to have emancipated himself from the slavery of superficials . Col. John C. Symmes , whose original and highly instructive correspondence has , till the appearance of the work at the head of our article , been communicated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what may literally be called an insight into the nature of the earth , and to have disclosed the astonishing fact , that this globe we inhabit is but a shell , and that its interior surface is actually accessible . We are unfortunately not able to inform our readers , in what way the colonel was conducted to these interesting conclusions ; but it does great credit to his zeal and the curiosity of his neighbours , to find him engaged in making his discoveries the subject of courses of lectures in some of the western towns . This fact reflects great honor on our country ; and while the inhabitants of the old world are still grovelling about the surface and sending out voyage after voyage of circumnavigation and discovery , and expedition after expedition to the south pole and the north , we may claim , we think , the undisputed glory of suggesting and organizing a practicable route to the interior . The colonel , we believe , has presented the public with printed memoirs and lectures from his own pen . These , we regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing ; probably from more pains having been taken , by the publisher , to furnish the inside of the earth , than this poor bark on which we live . Nor can we wonder that the inhabitants of those regions should , out of gratitude , buy up the first editions of the colonel 's lucubrations ; since , if they esteem it any advantage to be brought to light , they must feel it to be one , for which they are exclusively indebted to him . The same grateful feeling appears to have actuated them in bestowing the name of their discoverer upon some of their regions ; for , as our readers perceive in the title of this work , the chief internal continent is actually called Symzonia . The work before us is the journal of a voyage actually undertaken and carried on with success , in pursuance of Col. Symmes ' discoveries . It was ostensibly made to the islands 4ately discovered in a high southern latitude , of which some of our shrewd countrymen are said to have kept the secret for // a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose name will go down to the admiration of the latest posterity with that of Col. Symmes , had no such ordinary views of interest , and leaving a part of his crew at these new found regions , he push .. ed boldly on with the rest to the southern opening , and made an effectual entrie into the before unexplored world . He found it , as might have been expected , instead of the dismal regions of the poets , the fiery volcanic caverns of cosmogonists , or the solid massy granite of modern theorists , a light . ' . some , happy abode , with inland seas and islands , and wise and good men . The adventures of the worthy captain have a pleasing Gulliverian cast ; and in point of authenticity will compare to great advantage with Sinbad the Sailor , Robinson Crusoe , Gen. Pillet 's researches in England , and the from it the happiest results . In the first place , it pro .. cures us a vast accession of territory , probably of the richest kind , for if ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are not only at the bottom , but on the other side . The addition to our jurisdiction is almost immense . It is well known that in the vocabulary of political science , all nations , for the first time discovered , are heathen , savage , and barbarous ; of course wholly without right or claim to the land on which they live , of which the property immediately vests in fee simple and unqualified sovereignty in the discoverer ; - .. who becomes authorized , to use an expressive phrase , to extinguish the Indian title , ' in which process it commonly hap .. pens that the Indian is extinguished with it . A milder policy , however , prevails in some regions ; and in South America the natives are only condemned to perpetual slavery , in the mines . As these are five or six hundred fathoms deep , those who live in them are favored with a cool temperature in those hot tropical climates ; and never coming up , are not exposed to those vicissitudes which bring on phthisis ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , they are compensated again , by being steeped gratis in the fumes of the sublimating mercury of the amalgamation process , so that they get their calomel cheaper , though probably not more abundantly , than the patients of the most decisive modern physician . Should it be found expedient to run a tunnel from our external to our internal territories , tJlis would furnish us with a fine opportuni // ty , to make the labor of our newly dicovered subjects available , in this humane way ; and when the work shall reach the point , where the respective gravitations from th** outward and inward surfaces meet , it will doubtless afford some novel theorems in the doctrine of forces , highly worthy the attention of the inquiring mind , particularly of the statesmen , who , in this awkward neutrality of party politics , hardly know how to choose their ground , and of writers like ourselves , who are of no party , which of all sides we ever happened to be on , is that where the kicks bear the largest proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for our pro . ' duce . There is no reason to believe that the Internals will not be glad to eat flour , and wear Waltham shirtings , and smoke tobacco ; and it was ever a main feature of the benignant colonial policy , that the colony should feed and clothe itself from the mother country . Thus in our own happy state of colonial union with England , it was a crime in New England to manufacture hats , because this would cramp the industry of the mother country . The manufacture was accordingly prohibited , and this is what is called being fostered by the care of a mother country . ' Should the Internals refuse to eat , drink , and smoke , as we direct , there then will doubtless be found ways to compel them . As to the latter article , there can be no difficulty . No one takes tobacco at first without nausea , and if we actually put it down their throats by main force , a struggle , more or less , is of no consequence . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening at the poles , and we can have them upon their knees , for their very sunshine . We have no doubt that Col. Symmes , who has distinguished himself so much in opening this passage , Would , with equal readiness , undertake to close it ;  --  and if it were thought necessary for greater security , would erect a half moon , or even , like his comrade in Moliere , a whole one , on each of its opposite edges . With respect to the reputation of the discoverer , we think that these extraordinary disclosures will place the name of Col. Symmes on an equal rank with the illustrious Ilixiofon . ' If the mere conception of a north-western passage , which he did not find out , has given his glory to Columbus , what a title to immortality does not the colonel possess ! The opinion Which may be formed of honest Capt . Seaborn 's researches has no effect on this question . If they are authentic , then // certainly the great proposer of this splendid path ought to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic , nay if no such opening as the colonel describes should ever be found , we should be glad to know what this detracts from the brilliancy of Col. Symmes ' theory . Never have men been so niggardly , as to demand a mere practical success . Columbus would have been the most arrogant schemer on this principle . He sailed not for America , but for bdia ; and he thdught he had found it . But he did not find what he sought , and he did not seek what he found ; and yet we load him with praises , because he happened to be arrested by Hispaniola , on the way to the Indian ocean . Col. Symmes ought to have the advantage of a similar indulgence . We doubt if all Pinkerton and Purchas contain more splendid discoveries than those which Col. Symmes projects , and we maintain that if the not finding a north-west passage round the world is a source of glory to Columbus , that the colonel has as fair a prospect of immortality , for not finding the passage through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often a mere mechanical thing , in which chance , and ship-timber and fair weather have more to do , than learning or sagacity . Whether any body will a.tually penetrate to the interior ( granting for a moment that the work before us is a romance ) we are willing to leave in doubt . But we take leave , out of justice to merit to say , that we think Col. Symmes fairly entitled to the credit of a theory , which never entered into the head of any other man before ; and of which , much as we should expect from the fruit of his lecturing-if he lectures as well as he speculates-we have strong doubts whether it will ever enter into the head of any body again . He may be truly said to have exhausted worlds and then imagined new . ' Goldsmith bestows great and just commendations on the Belgic sires , ' for having , as he calls it , scooped out an empire ; ' but our enterprising country** man , in scooping out the globe itself , and proving it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Goldsmiths of our country with higher themes of panegyric . It is impossible to anticipate the changes , which these great discoveries may make in science . If the falling of an apple led to the Newtonian theory of gravitation , what will not this excavation of the earth do for our systems of philosophy . The speculators of the present day , with a disposition somewhat talparicmn , have chosen $ic centre of the earth as th' // great theatre of their doctrines . Not daring to meet the examination of the world in the face of day , they have gone down To the mountain 's massy core , To the mines of living ore , To the dank and to the dry , To the unseen of mortal eye ; ' and played their fantastic tricks in the antipodes of high heaven . The colonel , we think , will ferret them out . We have observed the countenances of our geologists to lengthen ominously at the mention of Capt . Seaborn 's voyage ; and , Wernerian or Huttonian , we find they are alike far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , which they have chosen to fill with their central volcanoes and gulfs . We have not heard of one of them offering to accompany colonel Symmes to the centre . Cuvier affects to be busy with his Megatherion , the great school at Freyberg maintains a solemn silence with tegard to Col. Symmes ' call for volunteers ; and we do not believe that if the Pope , in imitation of the grant of his predecessor Alexander VI . to the Spaniards and Portuguese , were to cede one of the internal hemispheres to the Vulcanians , and the other to the Neptunians , that there is one of them would dare to put his theory to the touchstone of observation , and set off for the arctic or antarctic opening . We say , we do not believe it ; there is no movement toward it . On the contrary , an effort is made to keep up a scornful silence , on the subject of Col. Syinmes ' proposals ; an intemperate and arrogant indifference is put on by the geologists ; - they seem to think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , by a boisterous reserve on their part ; and we think Col. Symmes should come out at once , with a R*ponse au silence de Messieurs les geologistes . ' The public will go along with him , in any step of this kind ; for the hanging back of the geologists , on this occasion , has excited much the same disgust as Mr Clay 's refusal to emigrate to Shebro , with the reverend Mr Kezzel , and the brethren of his color . We have heard but one voice from the African Society of Boston on that subject , which was that of the admirable sentiment at their public festival , Mr Clay and our colored brethren , if he wants them to go , why does he not go himself ? ' It is with a disapprobation equally marked , that the American public has seen the busy ignorance in *yhich the geologists have chosen to remain in regard to Col. // Symmes ' offers to lead them through the polar openings , itwas thought that , with the first annunciation of the proposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expeditions : - that the one party , in a fire proof ship , with ropes and sails of amianthus , and masts of iron , with fire engines and fire buckets , and every thing necessary to withstand a conflagration , would have sailed off , in a mass , to the southern opening , to explore their internal volcanoes . We do not say that they would have been bound in duty all to jump in ; but till they had gone to the crater , till they had brought us back some of their internal obsidian , till they had shown us a fragment of basalt or celestine from Symzonia , they could not have asked of the public any farther faith in their theories . Meantime , we should have looked for a corresponding conduct on the part of the Wernerians ; an outfit to the interior gulf , a tight seaworthy vessel , with ample provisions to go and plough about on the edges of the great abyss ,  --  and then if they had come back and told us they had actually seen their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their antediluvian fish working their way through a surf of liquid schistus , they would have done more for their theory than they have hitherto been able to effect . This they should have done , but instead of this they keep grovelling upon the Calton hill , the chalk basin of Paris , and the Harz mountains , and if a piece of lava or madreporite from the centre would save the nation , we do not believe ( here is one of them would go and fetch it . But it is time to draw to a close , and we beg leave to recom* mend the discoveries of Col. Symmes again to the publhx His success with the unexplored interior of our earth is so signal , that we advise him next to turn his attention to th' moon , unless as some features in his speculations lead us to tbink , he has already done it .
