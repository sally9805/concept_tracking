Enter Barnes , in character of a Physician . Barnes . Barnes . Oh , spare your hands  --  ' t is useless , all this blarney , The play ca n't live , without a word from Barney : ' T is like a patient  --  quacks to death may steam him , And he is damned , if science do n't redeem him . Grappling with fate , ' t is I alone can part ' em  --  Barney will save the piece , secundem artem . Go on  --  that 's right  --  your smiles are what I 'm after  --  The best prescription is a roar of laughter ; One hearty laugh , no matter how excited , May save a life when every hope is blighted . ' T is true , Placide has got an epilogue , But ' taint the thing  --  it do n't " go the whole hog ; " So , while he 's back there , spelling out each line , I 'll give you an extrumpery of mine ; Original throughout  --  no one has read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare to shed it . " A certain fair one  --  once , in days of yore  --  Caught a bad quinsy , and her throat was sore ; She could not speak , nor swallow , chew nor sup , She scarcely breathed  --  the doctors gave her up ! Her weeping friends , in silence , breathed their sighs , And stood prepared to close her fading eyes ! ' T was at this awful crisis , ' mid the gloom , Her favorite monkey stole into the room ; With doctor 's formal air approached the bed , Seized hold her wrist , then gravely shook his head ! The droll manoeuvre called a smile from death , And one convulsive laugh restored her breath ; Broke her disorder , let the fair escape , Who owed her cure alone to Dr. Ape . " D'ye take ?  --  or must I give your wits a jog ? Stay  --  here comes Harry , with his epilogue . Enter Placide , who comes forward and speaks . Placide . Placide . " In ancient times , when plighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're too late , Hal  --  the epilogue is spoken . Placide . Placide . Spoken ! By whom ? Barnes . Barnes . By me . Placide . Placide . By you ! Barnes . Barnes . ' T is certain . Placide . Placide . Why ' taint a minute since they dropt the curtain , And my address a good half hour employs . Barnes . Barnes . I 've done the deed  --  didst thou not hear a noise ? If you attempt , you 'll find yourself mistaken ; I made them laugh  --  that saved the author 's bacon . Placide . Placide . And who bade you display your monkey capers ? The sun requires no aid from farthing tapers  --  I saved the piece , sir . Barnes . Barnes . You ! Placide . Placide . My humble talents Secured the thing 's success , and turned the balance ; Or , as Prince Rupert says  --  " alone I did it ! " It 's true , I pledge my honor ! Enter Hilson , speaking . Hilson . Hilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle " up the spout ! " Placide . Placide . Hilson , be quiet ! I know what I 'm about . Hilson . Hilson . That tone , my boy , smacks sharply of the acid . Barnes . Barnes . Placide by name , but not exactly placid . You 're somewhat wroth . Placide . Placide . I am  --  and shall be wrother  --  I 'll speak my speech ! Hilson . Hilson . Not if you love the author . Since I have saved his opera , ' t were wrong To jeopardize it with a speech so long . Placide . Placide . You saved the opera ! Barnes . Barnes . You saved it ! Both . Both . You ! Hilson . Hilson . Yes , I myself alone  --  you know it 's true ; I hit it on the head  --  and , lest it fail , Here 's a short epilogue , to clinch the nail : Addressing the Audience . " When erst the muses , on Parnassus ' top , In mazy dances  --  " Barnes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physic to the dogs , Nor bore our friends , here , with dull epilogues . Hilson . Hilson . Agreed , old Barney !  --  and , to end disputes , The readiest way to harmonize our flutes Is to admit  --  so be it understood , To please our friends we 've all done what we could . If we have failed  --  Placide . Placide . Why , then  --  Barnes . Barnes . What , then , Placide ? Placide . Placide . They 'll take a good intention for the deed . Hilson . Hilson . I 'll answer for ' t  --  I know these gen'rous folks , They ' re always laughing at us , or our jokes . But what of our young author ?  --  Jests nor wit Wo n't add a penny to his benefit . Placide . Placide . His benefit is safe . Barnes . Barnes . What then of Rokeby ? Hilson . Hilson . Should that be damned it would a serious joke be . But see !  --  there 's mercy in each judge 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not die ! Placide . Placide . Egad ! their plaudits make old Drury shake ! Hilson . Hilson . It 's just the thing ! Barnes . Barnes . I say  --  " there 's no mistake ! "
