" O'er the brow of care To smooth away a wrinkle . " Moore PREFACE The author of this , while preparing a tragedy of five acts for the press , has passed his leisure intervals in the composition of two lighter dramatic pieces , of which this is one  --  should it be read , the other will shortly follow . The author claims the merit , if the present be considered to possess any , of adapting lord Byron 's story of " Don Juan " to the stage , and that of originality in at least two-thirds of both plot and dialogue  --  with what justice , he leaves the reader to determine . Moore 's " Light-house " is introduced in act 1st , as an air peculiarly appropriate , and one which , though characterized by striking beauties of poetry and music , has never been heard from the stage , and but seldom in private circles . New York , Jan. 1822 . DRAMATIS PERSON . MEN . Sultan , Lambro , Juan , Orloff , Baba , Mustapha , slave-seller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sultana , Haidee , Zoe , Attendants , &c.; Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  A view of the coast .  --  Music . Enter Haidee and Zoe . Haidee . Haidee How dreadful has the storm been ; oh ! how I 've felt for the poor mariners at sea  --  I doubt many have been lost upon these Grecian Isles , Zoe . Zoe . Zoe I saw pieces of some wreck as we came along  --  who knows but some one may have been thrown on shore ? Hai . Haidee It may be so indeed  --  go , Zoe , to yonder rock , and look around . pointing off the stage . exit Zoe . How calm it is , and how brightly shines the moon to-night ! what sad yet pleasing associations arise , when wandering near yon light-house and on a moonlit shore  --  I love to sit there , lost in thought , and sometimes while away a lonely hour by a song . The scene was more beautiful far to my eye , Than if day in its pride had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the azure arch 'd sky Look 'd pure as the Spirit that made it : The murmur rose soft as I silently gaz 'd On the shadowy waves ' playful motion , From the dim distant hill , till the Light-house fire blaz 'd Like a star in the midst of the ocean . No longer the joy of the sailor boy 's breast Was heard in his wildly breath 'd numbers , The sea-bird had flown to her wave girdled nest , The fisherman sunk to his slumbers : One moment I look 'd from the hill 's gentle slope , All hush 'd was the billows ' commotion , And tho't that the Light-house look 'd lovely as hope , That star of life 's tremulous ocean . But where can Zoe loiter thus ? enter Zoe . Well , Zoe  --  Zoe . Zoe I found yonder by a rock a youth , the loveliest you ever gaz 'd on , thrown on the beach . Hai . Haidee Was he alone ? Zoe . Zoe I left Hassan with him , who by every effort was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's haste to him  --  tho ' my father 's absent , our mansion is open to the stranger in distress . Come , Zoe , come . SCENE II .  --  Scene changes to an adjacent part of the coast . Hassan supporting Juan 's head , who lies insensible  --  a cave at the end of the stage  --  sea in perspective . Music . Has . Hassan Poor gentleman ! he has sunk to sleep  --  that 's a good sign  --  I hope it will revive him  --  He looks as pale as marble  --  well ! I 'll never go to sea  --  not I  --  Horses are too wild to trust to , and ships , too crazy  --  I 'll do my travelling on foot  --  that 's all feet are made for  --  yet , my master and his crew do n't act as if they thought so , as my breech can bear witness . enter Haidee and Zoe . Zoe . Zoe There , lady  --  there he lies  --  shall we not wake him ? Hai . Haidee No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him sleep on . gazing on him Ah ! he has suffer 'd much  --  for on his thin worn cheek the hectic plays , like the last streak of dying day upon the snow-tops of the distant hills  --  the blue veins , unhidden by his curls , still dewy with the spray , look shadowy , shrunk , and weak  --  And oh ! how beautiful . Juan , Juan rising on his elbow , and looking wildly around him . Where am I ? Hai . Haidee How dost thou , stranger ? Juan . Juan Thanks to your care , I 'm better , yet weak  --  very weak ; and yet  --  ' t were better to have perished on the waves than live to wretchedness . Hai . Haidee To wretchedness ! here 's all to cheer and make you happy . Juan . Juan What gentle voice is that ? ( looking up at Haidee . ) What angel look ! art thou a spirit that directs the storm , and calls me back to being ? Hai . Haidee Nay , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shall know all in time  --  now , let me conduct you to yon shelter 'd cave  --  there be refreshed with food , and thence we 'll onward to the castle  --  Come , Hassan , support him . Juan stops to kiss her hand in gratitude , then exeunt into the cave . Music . SCENE III .  --  A moonlight view of Lambro 's garden . Enter Hassan and Zoe . Has . Hassan Well , my pretty Zoe  --  while young master and mistress are billing and cooing yonder , you and I must n't lose the harvest . Zoe . Zoe Get along , you fool ! Has . Hassan Nay , Zoe , you know I love you , and you must n't be so cruel , you must n't  --  now listen to me , when our mistress Haidee and this young stranger come to better terms , which I see soon will be , for they 're marvellously struck with each other already  --  ( love at first sight , you know , ) I say , Zoe , when they settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoe Ay , Hassan , you and I will be wiser than our betters , and keep out of harm 's way awhile  --  What think you all this will come to , when old Lambro , our master , gets home ? Has . Hassan True  --  He hates feasting and rioting , as I do the devil ; and what is this merriment all for ? forsooth , because a young fellow was thrown on shore here , and happen 'd to have a likely phiz of his own . Zoe . Zoe I wish all may end well : Lambro 's a savage fellow , when his blood 's up . But what else could you expect from a pirate ? one , who has made his fortune on the seas ; he will not wink at our young lady 's fancy for this friendless pauper . Has . Hassan No ! that will be wormwood to him . I tell you what , Zoe  --  I do n't altogether like having had any thing to do in this affair ; I shall be bastinadoed at least ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him drown , and may chance to be thrown to the fishes in his stead for my humanity . Zoe . Zoe Well ! ' twill be the first time you ever furnished food for any thing but  --  a laugh ; and that you do every hour of your life . Has . Hassan Oh ! Zoe ; it makes me quake to think on him ; he 's a terrible-fellow  --  but make him angry , and he cocks his eye and his pistol both at once , and there 's an end of you : but here comes the enamour 'd pair . Enter JUAN and HAIDEE , followed by girls with garlands , who come forward and dance while they are seated ; after the dance , the girls exeunt with Hassan and Zoe . Hai . Haidee We 've been but a short time , acquainted , and yet , Juan , you have taught my heart to love , as if for years we 'd known each other . Juan . Juan And thou , Haidee , art dear to me as is the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch , did I not love thee as my soul . Enter Lambro . Juan . Juan Shall it be ever thus ? and shall our days glide on in love and peace ? wilt thou be true , Haidee ? Hai . Haidee Doubt me not , dear Juan ; when first I gaz 'd on you , my heart was won ; and time can but fix your image there more deeply . ( while hanging fondly on Juan 's arms , sees her father and shrieks ; Juan draws his sabre . ) Lam . Lambro What means all this ? lock 'd in a stranger 's arms ! waste and profusion , song and dance around !  --  What means all this , I say ? Hai . Haidee This is a stranger , whom upon our shore  --  Lam . Lambro I 've heard the tale . Young man , a thousand scimiters await my call ; put up your silly sword . Haidee clings to Juan and exclaims  --  Hai . Haidee ' T is Lambro , Juan , ' t is my father ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , It must be , yes  --  he will , he will . Lam . Lambro Young man , resign your sword . Juan . Juan Not while this arm is free . Lam . Lambro How ! ( drawing from his belt a pistol , ) your blood be on your own head then . ( Haidee rushes between Juan and the pistol . ) Hai . Haidee On me , on me , let death descend ; the fault is mine ; he found , but sought not , this fatal shore  --  I 've pledg 'd my faith ; I love him , and will die with him ; I knew your firmness  --  now know mine  --  ' t is Lambro 's blood that stirs within his child . Lam . Lambro ( To his daughter sternly and calmly , having thrown down the pistol )  --  Not I have sought to do this stranger harm ; yet few would bear this outrage , and not kill  --  But I must do my duty by thee , girl  --  how thou'st done thine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by my father 's head , his own shall roll before you like a foot-ball . What ! thou wilt not ? Music . Raises his whistle and blows ; another answers without ; some of his train enter . ) Arrest or slay yon Frank ; ( they advance  --  two of the first fall by Juan 's sword , he is then overpower 'd by numbers )  --  He shall to the Turk 's a slave  --  bear him to the shore on board the ship to sail at nine , away with him . ( To Hassan Conduct this girl to her apartment , and remain there till I come  --  away . Music . Exeunt Hassan and Zoe , conducting Haidee . SCENE IV .  --  Apartment in Lambro 's house ; door at the rear . Enter Lambro and Hassan Lam . Lambro I go to see these slaves despatched , and will return ere long ; be careful of thy charge . she must be look 'd to well , or thy life , thou know'st  --  exit . Has . Hassan Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is , whose every other word makes your teeth chatter , and your head hang loose on your shoulders , like a Chinese mandarin in a toy-shop  --  ( tapping at the door ) Lady , are you ready ? Hai . Haidee ( enters from back apartment in boy 's disguise ) I am , good Hassan  --  Have you secured the interest of the guard ? and will he let me pass among the slaves on board ? Has . Hassan He will : I have settled all . Hai . Haidee And think you that in this garb , I can deceive my father , and escape unnoticed ? Has . Hassan Quite sure of it ; you look no more like lady now , than I do like a gentleman , and that , defy any body to say of me  --  besides , your father do n't know the race of one of them . Hai . Haidee I have secured my jewels , and shall , when I have sailed , make interest with the captain of the vessel , by which I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wealth will obtain me every where interest and friends , and , should I find my Juan , will throw off his chains , and make our union blest with affluence . Has . Hassan You seem to understand the use of gold lady , as well as e'er a vizier of them all  --  a little money goes a great way in love , as well as politics but while you and master Juan are eating , drinking making love , et cetera , on these same jewels . certain somebody I could name , will have his love affair too , but in rather a different way  --  he 'll chance to be made love to by some complaisant shark , or out of pure love be swallowed up by some d  --  d grim looking whale or other ; you know , Lady , the hand I 've had in your escape , and you know your father . Hai . Haidee Yes , and to guard against the effects of his anger , I reserve for thee and Zoe , what will make your lives glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , take this purse and these jewels  --  Tell Zoe , how much I regretted that my father would not let her approach me , and that I could not bid her farewell  --  do thou escape with her , and retire awhile ; and when my father leaves these shores again , ( as soon he will do ) thou canst find a home in some other clime ; there 'll always be some means to bear thee hence  --  retires to back apartment . Has . Hassan Now , on second thoughts , I take back what I said just now , and begin to feel , methinks , quite like a gentleman ; ( chinking his purse ) yes , very like a gentleman indeed ; and have an air of dignity , as it were , a kind of a Three Tailed Bashaw feeling  --  ( strutting with much consequence ) I 'll take a lease of pretty Zoe 's tenement in the first place ; then , then I 'll buy a ship for a pleasure boat , and a place , high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a gentleman indeed ! Re-enter Haidee . Hai . Haidee Hassan , what is the hour ? Has . Hassan ' T is past nine  --  ( and as for my wives , I 'll have one for every day in the year , pretty souls ! to himself . Hai . Haidee Then has Juan sailed ; oh ! that I could have gone with him ; but that was impossible , and now I must e'en take this opportunity , which Providence offers me to follow him . Is it not time that we go , Hassan ? Has . Hassan It is , lady ; the vessel sails at twelve . I 'll manage to keep your father off , while you embark with the last of the slaves . Hai . Haidee Well , let us on , then  --  come . Exeunt . SCENE V.  --  Sea coast , ship off at sea , boat at shore , slaves back of the stage , Haidee enters and mingles with them , in disguise . Enter Lambro . Lam . Lambro Well now Juan 's disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a league or two hence ; so much for him  --  as for my daughter , I shall fast her into good humour  --  as the guard is preparing to send off slaves , Lambro moves to advance towards them , when Hassan comes forward and prevents him . Has . Hassan Now , help me , Heaven ! and my impudence  --  ( aside )  --  my lord ! my lord ! I 'm out of breath , and come in great haste to tell you  --  such a tale , my lord ! Lam . Lambro What ! is the fellow mad ? Has . Hassan No , my lord , no ; that is , I 'm not quite , absolutely mad , as one may say  --  but it is enough to make us all mad ; such an event ! so disastrous ! so terrible ! ' twill make your flesh creep , your hair stand an end , I 'm sure it has mine  --  oh ! Lam . Lambro Speak out , vile slave , and come to the point , or this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way of bringing one to the point ; oh ! my l-o-r-d , you make one 's heart beat , and one 's joints shake so , I ca-ca-ca n't speak it out for the soul of me . Lam . Lambro What have you to tell ? quick or I despatch . Has . Hassan Who during this scene , has kept his eye anxiously on the boat , on seeing it push off , says aside All 's safe ; they 're off  --  Your daughter  --  Lam . Lambro What of her ; speak  --  Has . Hassan She 's dying , sir , very low indeed , sir ,  --  dying of a broken heart , sir , and wishes to see you in great haste . Lam . Lambro Why did n't you say this before , villain ? Has . Hassan Because , sir , I was out of breath , and  --  Lam . Lambro Slave , follow me . Exit . Has . Hassan Yes , sir  --  if I do , I 'll give you leave to dose me with cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , no , here lies my way : I 'll to Zoe , swift as legs can carry me ; and then , good by t'ye , master Lambro . Hem ! ( pulls out his purse , and chinks it ) one more look  --  very like a gentleman ! ay , very much the gentleman indeed ! ( turns and sees ship sailing ) Ha ! she 's under way ; all 's safe ? huzza ! huzza ! Exit . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  A mart for slaves  --  white and black slaves in the rear of the stage , from among them Juan advances  --  Orloff follows him . Orl . Orloff You and I , my boy , of all this motley crew of Georgians , Russians , Africans , and what not , are , methinks , the only gentlemen  --  so let us be acquainted . Juan . Juan With all my heart , sir  --  what 's your name  --  your nation ? Orl . Orloff I am a Russian , and my name is Orloff  --  and yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name is Juan  --  what brought you here ? Orl . Orloff Oh ! nothing very rare , some half dozen Tartars and a dragchain ; fortune has play 'd us here a freak , but no matter , she ' ll turn again , ' t is her way ; the jade 's as fickle as a coquet , and has about as much heart too  --  now I have answered your questions , you must be as courteous , and reply to mine . Juan . Juan Alas ! mine ' s a distressing story , sir . Orl . Orloff No matter , out with it . Juan . Juan And a very long one . Orl . Orloff Then you 're very wise to keep it to yourself , my boy  --  I like every thing short and merry , but my purse and a psalm tune . Juan . Juan I envy you your spirits , Orloff . Orl . Orloff Pooh , pooh ! do n't droop , Juan . Fortune , tho ' she 's a jilt , will not leave you long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickle . Juan . Juan I mourn not for the present , but the past . I lov 'd a maid : and I have borne on the rough deep hardships , that had worn out the hardiest ; but this last blow ! Orl . Orloff Blow , say you ? you that are used to gales , should n't heed blows , my lad . What ? not a tear ! Well , I thought it would come out : there was a lady in the case  --  I would shed tears too , were I in your place  --  let me see  --  I cried , if I recollect aright , when my first wife died  --  ay , and when my second ran away  --  my third  --  Juan . Juan Your third ! you can scarce be thirty  --  have you three ? Orl . Orloff No , I 've only two , just now , above ground  --  ' t is not so wonderful to see a Christian thrice chained in holy wedlock . Juan . Juan Well then , your third  --  what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she , sir ? Orl . Orloff No , faith ! Juan . Juan What then ? Orl . Orloff I ran away from her . Juan . Juan You take things coolly , sir . Orl . Orloff Why , what would you have a man do ? tears would neither bring them nor me back , you know . Besides , upon second thoughts , I do n't think the best of wives are worth crying for ; and mine , God knows , were none of that sample . Come , cheer up , you 've many rainbows in your sky ; mine have vanish 'd , and ' t is left somewhat of the cloudiest . Juan . Juan You still seem happy , sir . Orl . Orloff No . I 'm the most miserable dog on earth : yet I wo n't hang a head , Juan . Consider yourself , as I do , a citizen of the world , travelling in pursuit of knowledge . Juan . Juan Knowledge ! Orl . Orloff Ay ; we can gain it here . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to behave ourselves , when we get to be masters . Juan . Juan Would we were masters now , if but to try how apt we are to catch the lessons which these Pagan friends teach us . Heaven help the scholar , whom his fortune sends here . Orl . Orloff Perhaps we shall be masters some day hence , when our bad luck mends ; but after all , what is our present state ? ' t is bad , and may be better ; all men 's lot . Most men are slaves  --  none more so than the great  --  slaves to their passions , whims , and what not . ( During this last speech , Baba , having examined the slaves at the foot of the stage , advances in front , and eyes Juan and Orloff . ) Juan . Juan Who 's that , who seems to eye us so ? I am tired of this , and wish to God that somebody would buy us , and have done with it . Orl . Orloff Yes  --  we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and age , and capabilities , to discover if we 're fitted for the purposed cage . No lady e'er is ogled by a lover , horse by a black leg , fee by a counsel , or felon by a jailer , as is a slave by his intended bidder . Juan . Juan And are we not most wretched ? sighs . Orl . Orloff Sigh not thus , ' t is the lot of half mankind ; all are to be bought , if you consider their passions , and are dexterous : all men have their price , from crowns to kicks , according to their natures . Enter Mustapha , to slaves , in the rear of the stage . Juan . Juan There 's the slave seller , as I guess , and there stand the wretched group  --  poor creatures ! they seem sadly changed , if they were ever what their garb denotes  --  from friends , from home , and freedom far estranged  --  my heart bleeds for them  --  Orl . Orloff Ay , all seem jaded with vexation but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , no doubt , as eels are to be stay 'd ; poor devils !  --  Mustapha advances with slaves and purchasers . Come , walk this way , my friends  --  we 've disposed of all our female slaves , but one , and she has beauty enough for a Sultan . Come , I 'll recommend a wife , to the single , to avoid the intended tax upon bachelors , and to the married , on the principle that a man , who is deep in the mud , need'nt be afraid of the mire  --  I say there she stands ; how much for her ? 1st pur. 1st purchaser two hundred sequins. 2d pur. 2nd purchaser three hundred sequins . Mus . Mustapha Well then to begin , 300 sequins . She 's vastly pretty , sings well , dresses fine , and dances to a miracle ; she 's no more soul than my whip-stock , shows a whip in his hand and has just brains enough to keep out of the fire , and so forth ; so you see , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off in a crowd  --  how much for her ? 3d pur. 3rd purchaser 400 sequins. 1st pur. 1st purchaser 500 sequins . Mus . Mustapha No more ! she 's yours ; 500 sequins for a wife .  --  Here 's a fellow somewhat obstinate , but very strong ; the bastinado , some twenty times a day , will do no harm to him ; how much ? 2d pur. 2nd purchaser 100 sequins . Mus . Mustapha He 's worth ten times the money ; why , he 'll do you two good men 's work , keep but an eye and the lash on him ; he 's a good subject for your young whippers to learn their trade by , and will give them a grace , an air , thus . throws his whiplash over the slave 's shoulders. 2d pur. 2nd purchaser If no one bid higher , I 'll take him at 200 sequins . Mus . Mustapha Well then , to the next . Here 's a fellow fit to wait on your wives and daughters  --  he 's so damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or scare crows , just as you have occasion : he 's as good as a plague : no woman would touch him , tho ' her helpmate had fourscore years , and her gallant a palsy : how much for him ? 1st pur. 1st purchaser 200 sequins  --  3d pur. 3rd purchaser 300 sequins . Mus . Mustapha This wo n't do : he 's worth double the sum ; he 's got an eye like a hawk  --  he 'll look to it , that none of you , who buy him , are made " fit for heaven , " in a certain way . Such a slave is invaluable  --  What ! no more ! he 's as ill-shap 'd as the devil , has but one ear , squints , and so has the advantage of seeing two ways at once , and then he moves like an old spavin 'd horse : look at him . Mufti . Mufti 500 sequins . Mus . Mustapha Set him down to the Mufti . Mus . Mustapha Here now is one form 'd for jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises well from his pedigree : his mother was a thief , and his father look 'd down upon the world , when he died : his fate was a rope 's end . Who hids ? he 's just your man , if any of you have a faithless or an ugly wife , or a shrew , whom he would get rid of  --  he 's no more conscience than a block , nor religion than a Greek . Muf . Mufti 600 sequins . Mus . Mustapha No one bids for him but the Mufti : he has him . Here 's four negroes : I cant stand all day , we 'll sell them altogether : they are all sound except one , and he must speak for himself . I wont warrant him : they look somewhat worse for wear and tear just now , having been stowed away with little food , and less air on their passage : but they 'll mend . 700 sequins shall have the lot . 2d pur. 2nd purchaser They 're mine . Mus . Mustapha There stands one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small share of health , and impudence to boot : an able bodied fellow ; his arm I 'll warrant strong , almost to a fault . Orl . Orloff ( aside . ) I should like to try its strength on you , you Turk . Mus . Mustapha I 'll sell him for 300 sequins . Baba . Baba I 'll take him at that . Mus . Mustapha Here 's another : this is another Christian dog , a likely fellow too  --  a very Adonis ! he 'd do to grace a lady 's toilet , or to kill and stuff for pastime , for a statue  --  he 'd make an ornamental piece of furniture .  --  Hold up your head . Juan . Juan Unhand me , wretch ! Mus . Mustapha There 's an eye for you  --  see what a flash it has ! there 's soul and fire for you  --  I 'll keep him to look at , before I 'll take a fraction less than 1000 sequins for him . Baba . Baba I 'll give that for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , now we 've finish 'd for to-day  --  Come , let 's in and settle . To the slaves . Get along , you rascals . Exeunt all but Juan and Orloff . Baba . Baba As he goes out . I 'll just step aside with Mustapha , and return to you . Exit . Orl . Orloff I say , Juan , what think you of this traffic in human flesh , where we are sold like a parcel of sheep , and are in a fair way to be fleeced too . Juan . Juan Oh ! t is too shocking , humanity should blush at it  --  all men were born to be free , and the curse of Heaven light on the wretch who would enslave them . Orl . Orloff The Greeks , ' t is said , who groan beneath oppression , are every where aroused , and the spirit of war is kindling . Juan . Juan And may it blaze afar , until its beams are quench 'd in glorious liberty . Heaven grant their cause to triumph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Enter Baba . Baba .

( Picturesque scenery  --  two gilded boats , on a river , in view , two Turkish soldiers in each  --  two of the soldiers advance forward as Baba enters with Orloff and Juan ,  --  Baba delivers them to soldiers , who conduct them to a boat , and push off . ) Baba . Baba There they go ; as pretty a pair of fellows as one would wish to look at  --  knowing no more than a cat in a bag what 's to become of them , and yet one of them talks as merry as if he were going to a feast . Enter HAIDEE still in disguise and singing . Baba . Baba Who 's that ? Haidee sings Alas ! the sad and fatal day , Would I were in my grave ! They tore me from my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baba A likely lad this , and sings like a nightingale  --  he looks down-hearted . Again  --  Alas ! he 's gone , ah ! never more He 'll come his love to save ; And I must mourn , his loss deplore , Until I find a grave . Hai . Haidee I can learn nothing of my Juan , yet he must be here  --  could I but get access to the sultan , I 'd tell him my story ; and thro ' him might find out where Juan is , and purchase his liberty  --  ( Turning round , sees Baba gazing at her ) Ha ! there is the black fellow , whom they pointed out to me , as the sultan 's agent in the purchase of his slaves  --  a thought strikes me  --  my good fellow ; would it be possible , think you , to gain the ear of the sultan ? Baba . Baba I doubt it , sir . Hai . Haidee I am in distress , and ' t is in his power to relieve me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baba . Baba Why , ' t is somewhat of a ticklish affair ; should he chance to take a fancy to your company , why , ' t is all well enough  --  but should he happen to think you a little in the way , or not be in the right vein exactly , why , then  --  Hai . Haidee What then ? Baba . Baba Then you 'd have just breathing time left to call yourself a fool , and say your prayers , and those none of the longest  --  that 's all . Hai . Haidee Yet would I encounter every risk and difficulty to see him ; you have influence there , no doubt ? Baba . Baba Influence ! oh ! yes , as to that , I flatter myself ; yet , sir , I can not , I have business ; matters of vast importance , sir , absolutely hurried to death  --  ay , to death , sir ; we public characters , you know  --  Hai .

Orloff Well , here we are within the palace walls : a noble mansion too , by Mahomet , and such a genial savour from pilaus , roast meat , and stews.  --  We 'll make a set too , when we get at them . Juan . Juan I little care for food , my mind is ill at ease . Orl . Orloff Not care for food ! Smacks his lips as tasting . Why , the youth 's craz 'd  --  he 's crack 'd , that 's certain . Of all the appeals made to men 's feelings , altho ' I grant the power of pathos , of beauty , flattery , and threats , and above all , of that divinity ,  --  ready cash , nothings to a hungry man , ( and I am well nigh famished , ) nothing 's like that all-softening , overpowering sound , that tocsin of the soul , the dinner bell : we 've no bells here , but by these fumes we 've what is better than a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that huge fire shine , and cooks in motion with their clean arms bar 'd . Juan . Juan I see them all . Orl . Orloff I wonder your looks do n't kindle with the prophetic eye of appetite . ( Looking around . ) Whoever puts up here , must be as rich as Croesus . Juan . Juan All , as we pass 'd along , was most magnificent , and struck the eye with wonder . Orl . Orloff Wonder enough  --  it 's a puzzle to unriddle what half of the furniture means  --  such sofas too ! it were a sin to sit upon them . Carpets so rare and costly , they make you sigh to be a golden fish to glide over them  --  I 've felt all the time as if the milky-way with all it 's stars had been under my feet ; and trod as lightly , as if stepping on eggs , thro ' fear of staining them . But where stays our sable guide , who went to get us clothes ?  --  oh ! there he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum . Enter Baba . Baba . Baba ( To Orloff . ) Here 's for you a Candiote cloak and trowsers ; a shawl ; slippers , and a dagger . Equip yourself in them forthwith  --  Now my boys , would you take my advice , you 'd make your fortunes ; I make the proposition only  --  do as you please , there 's no compulsion . Juan . Juan What would you have us do ? Baba . Baba Turn Mussulmen  --  that 's all . Juan . Juan I 'll be no Turk for one . Orl . Orloff ( To Juan , aside . ) Stay , my friend ; do n't be so hasty . ( To Baba . ) We 'll think of this . Juan . Juan Change my religion for a Turk 's . Orl . Orloff Hush ! hush ! not so fast . ( To Baba . ) My sable friend , I thank you for this excess of goodness in leaving us a voice in such a trifle , and can scarce sufficiently express my admiration of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Aside to Juan . ) Have a care , and keep well with our friend here till after dinner  --  for my own part , good Baba , after swallowing down a slight refection , for which I have some little appetite , I doubt not , I shall be quite reconciled to the business  --  quite . Juan . Juan Will you ?  --  Strike me dead , my very head cut off ; ay , cut off a thousand heads before  --  Orl . Orloff Nay now , pray , Juan , just step aside , and leave me to manage our affairs  --  you 'll affront this good fellow here . ( aside . ) Whose , Baba , is this palace ? Baba . Baba ' T is the Sultan 's . Orl . Orloff The Sultan 's ! by the mass , Juan , he 'll make stews of us , as a wash for his fav'rite Sultana. ( aside to Juan . ) What sort of a man is he ? Baba . Baba You may chance to see him  --  he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bearded to the eyes  --  He leaves all state affairs to the vizier ; he has enough to do to attend to his wives . Orl . Orloff How many may he have ? Baba . Baba Four lawful , and one thousand beside . Orl . Orloff Lord bless us  --  what would our Christian husbands do in his case , most of whom think they 've one too many already  --  I say , Baba , do n't there a slight slip happen now and then ? eh ! Baba . Baba When there does so , nobody 's the wiser for it ; the sack and the sea , settle all that  --  so that by these mischances , ( as you may suppose , ) morals are better , and the fish no worse . Orl . Orloff I understand you , friend ; they make pretty short work of it , behind the scenes . Has the Sultan many favourites ? Baba . Baba Yes , there 's one of his wives and a dancing girl , are the reigning toasts just now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his bow . Baba . Baba Two ! ( Making the motion of the string of a bow round his neck . ) Were you to see it twang sometimes , you 'd think it had a thousand . Orl . Orloff Is your Sultan a sage kind of man ? Baba . Baba Why yes  --  he 's something of a philosopher ; he 's found out that the moon 's no cheese ; and having travelled much , some fifty miles or so , and seeing no sign that it was circular any where , he has discover 'd that the earth 's square . Orl . Orloff How is his temper ? Baba . Baba He 's fierce enough , when anger 'd , and would'nt care to string up some dozen before breakfast , when out of humour , to give an edge to his appetite . Orl . Orloff I 'll get into favour  --  I 'm determined . Baba . Baba If you do , take care he do n't leave you in the lurch . Orl . Orloff And does he serve his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oddest in his way  --  when he cuts his acquaintance , ' t is by the throat . ( Pointing to his own . ) ( Turns to Juan , who has been walking aside , during greater part of the dialogue . ) But ho ! there , young man , come along with me , and dress yourself ; here are clothes , that would rig out a princess . Juan . Juan Princess ! old gentleman , I 'm not a lady , nor in a masquerading mood just now . Baba . Baba In what mood you may be , I neither know , nor care  --  do as I tell you , I 've no time to waste in words  --  Juan . Juan At least , I may inquire the cause of this odd travestie ? Baba . Baba Be not too curious  --  you will know all in proper time and place ; I 've no authority to tell you more . Orl . Orloff Now methinks , Juan , it would be marvellous pleasant to change one 's sex , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should count myself a maid , man  --  ( and I am , I guess , as much a maid , as most of those without beards here about  --  there 's in all likelihood a plentiful lack of chastity , where there 's but one husband to a thousand wives . Juan . Juan ( Taking part of the dress from Baba . ) What 's this ? what the devil shall I do with all this gauze ? ( throwing it down , ) No ! if I do , I 'll be d  --  d  --  there . Baba . Baba Hold ! do n't be provoking , young gentleman  --  this spirit 's well , but it may wax too bold , and you 'll find we 're not too fond of joking . Juan . Juan What , sir ! shall it be said , that I unsex 'd my dress ? Baba . Baba Incense me , and I 'll call those , who 'll make you of no sex at all  --  you would not fancy the stiff cravat they 'd give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a woman 's , true  --  but there 's a reason why you should wear them . Juan . Juan What ! though my soul loathes the effeminate garb ! by Heaven !  --  Orl . Orloff Nay , my dear fellow , do hear reason ;  --  they cant ravish you , you know . ( aside to Juan . ) Baba . Baba ( to Orloff . ) You , sir , when you are dress 'd , may walk into the next room and dine ; but ( to Juan. ) you , my worthy Christian nun , must along with me  --  nay , no trifling , sir ; for when I say a thing , it must be done . What do you fear ? think you this is a lion 's den  --  why , ' t is a palace ; we wo n't eat you ; for tho ' we Turks have fierce appetites , we are not so selfish as to leave the worms nothing  --  besides , a pound of good roast meat is worth a whole carcass of Christian flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one means you harm . Juan . Juan So much the better for them  --  else they shall feel the weight of this arm , which is not quite so light as you may deem it . I yield thus far , but should any one dare to take me for what I seem  --  Baba . Baba Blockhead , come on and see . Orl . Orloff Farewell , Juan . Juan . Juan Adieu , Orloff  --  this soil seems fertile in strange adventures . Orl . Orloff It does indeed ; this black enchanter here has made a mussulman of me , of you a maid .  --  What we 're to turn to next , heaven only knows  --  any thing , I say , but Camelions , for they live on air . Juan . Juan Farewell ! should we meet no more , I wish you a good  --  appetite . Orl . Orloff It grieves me sore to part with you  --  when we meet next , we 'll have a tale to tell each other  --  keep your good name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . Juan . Juan No fear  --  the Sultan himself sha n't carry me , unless he wed me first ; and he would n't find that so pleasant a love affair , I can tell him . Baba . Baba Come  --  away . ( They part . ) Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  Sultana 's apartment . Music . ( She sitting under a canopy , surrounded by her maids , leaning on her hand ; at Baba 's approach with Juan , she motions her maids , who retire . ) Juan . Juan Well , why pause you here ? Baba . Baba Behold yon Canopy  --  Juan . Juan Ha ! a lady ! Baba . Baba The fairest in the world . Juan . Juan She 's beautiful indeed ! Baba . Baba Yes , she looks like a Venus just fresh from the sea  --  her eyes are like a pair of diamonds and her arms are fair as moonlight  --  look at her . Juan . Juan I see she is exceeding fair ; Baba , is this the Sultana ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advance with me , and kiss the hem of her robe ; nay , no fooling  --  do as I do , you 'd best , if you 'd sleep in sound skin to-night , and with a head on your shoulders ; come  --  ( both advance , Baba kisses Sultana foot , Juan shrinks back . ) Juan . Juan It grieves me , but I 'll kiss no shoe , unless it shod the Pope ; not I , by the mass . Baba . Baba Again , I tell you , you 'd best not disobey ; look , the lady seems to pray you to advance  --  she may chance to prey on you next , if you do n't  --  nay , she begins to frown ; she 's no lamb , as my back can testify . Sul . Sultan Is this the stranger , Baba ? will he not advance ? Baba . Baba He will , great empress ; he 's bashful , and is struck dumb with admiration of your peerless charms ; come , see how she smiles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan . Juan I 'll do any thing a man should do ; but as for her foot , I would n't kiss it , were she the bride of Mahomet . Baba . Baba O Lord ! what profanity ! ( aside . ) Juan . Juan ' T is a piece of gallantry which my Castilian blood revolts at . Baba . Baba Think of the bow string . Juan . Juan I am above fear . Baba . Baba They may hang you , and you will be  --  but think of me ; I shall by this perverseness dance in the air too ; we 'll hang together , side by side , a black and a white , like the spots on a chess board . Juan . Juan No matter , if I am paired with you , I shall only lose the queen , ( pointing to Sultana ) and ( clapping Baba on the shoulder ) have a stale mate ; that 's all . Baba . Baba Nay , then do but kiss her hand . Juan . Juan Oh ! there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her hand . ) Sul . Sultan Fair stranger , welcome ; throw off this air of sadness from your brow  --  all here is pleasure , and all that 's here is yours ; from what land dost thou come ? Juan . Juan My native home is Spain ; Castilian ancestry I boast . Sul . Sultan Is your tale a sad one ? Juan . Juan In truant mood I left my country , was taken by pirates , wreck 'd on a Grecian Isle , and thence was , after most strange reverses , sent here as a slave  --  this , in brief words , is my disastrous fate  --  ( Here the Sultana waves Baba to retire . ) Baba . Baba ( aside to Juan . ) You 're in luck , my boy ; you see , I 'm order 'd out of the way . aside . Exit . Sul . Sultan Stranger , ' t was by my order , Baba brought you here ; I saw you , when you mingled with the slaves , and even while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cans't thou love , fair youth ? Juan . Juan Love , say you , Lady ? Sul . Sultan Ay  --  love . Juan . Juan Oh ! thou dost wake remembrances of joys gone by , so sweet , that my heart sickens , when I think on them  --  Haidee ! beloved of my soul ! oh ! ( sighs . ) Sul . Sultan How ! dar'st thou thus confront me , when I stoop to unveil my beauties to a slave ? Juan . Juan The prison 'd eagle will not pair , nor I serve a Sultana 's sensual phantasy  --  I am a man  --  a proud one ; do not rouse me . Sul . Sultan Why , thou dost rave . This to me ! at whose feet the world lies prostrate , and a thousand knees bow down ? Juan . Juan Ay , lady ; had'st thou as many worshippers as Mahomet , and did thy slaves and flatterers , that crouch beneath thee , like the stars in Countless myriads throng , I 'd tell thee , I abhor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call for those shall humble you . Juan . Juan Call , if thou wilt ; I fear thee not  --  these manly trappings will betray thy guilt , and show the wolf ; I have cast off the clothing of the lamb . ( pointing to his female dress , on the floor . ) Sul . Sultan What ! ho ! there  --  Baba ! Baba ! Juan . Juan Let but the wretch approach to do me ill , I 'll lay his headless trunk upon you threshold .  --  Thou ask'st if I can love ? be the proof how much I have lov 'd , that I love not thee ; in such vile garb as that you 've forced on me , the distaff 's web and woof were fitter for me  --  I am a slave , and love is for the free ; I am not dazzled with this splendid loof ; whate'er thy power , tho ' heads bow , knees bend , eyes watch around a throne , and hands obey , our hearts are still our own . Sul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast : the blood mounts to my cheeks , and crimsons them with shame , revenge and tenderness  --  ( after a struggle she looks on him proudly , and endeavours to speak ; then overcome with contending emotions , bursts into tears . ) Juan . Juan A woman ! and in tears ! Lady , I do repent me of my harshness  --  behold me at your feet , to make atonement for the wrong I 've done you . Sul . Sultan Oh ! when my heart did beat with springing love , to outrage thus its feelings ! was not this most unkind ? ( she looks tenderly on him . ) Juan . Juan It was ; it was  --  by Heavens I do repent me , that I injur 'd aught so lovely . Sul . Sultan I , even I , who never sued to man before , and have been shrin 'd like some bright deity to be adored ; I sue to thee  --  I ask of thee , thy love ; live , stranger , near my throne , and reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yours ; I 'll kneel to thee  --  ( is about to kneel ; Juan prevents her . Juan . Juan Rise , Lady , from that posture ; ' t is for man to kneel , and beauty to command ; that I admire thee from my heart , and con thy beauties o'er like form of more than mortal mould ; and deem those tears upon your eyelids more beauteous than the pearls around the sparkling gems , is most true ; but oh ! my heart is sear 'd by sorrow , and is steel 'd ' gainst love . Sul . Sultan And can you leave me then to sigh ? Juan . Juan Oh ! sigh not , lady , for yourself , but sigh for me ; I am the object of your pity , that I can not love , ( as she should be lov 'd , ) the pride and glory of her sex . Enter Baba . Baba . Baba Bride of the sun , and sister of the moon ! most mighty empress of the earth ! whose frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles would make the planets dance with joy  --  your slave brings tidings , which may not be unworthy your most sublime attention ; the sun himself has sent me like a ray , to hint that he is coming . Sult . Sultan I wish to Heaven he would not shine till morning  --  Old Comet hence , ( to Baba ) and , Christian , resume your garb , and mingle with the rest , thou'lt find in me a friend . Enter Damsels , Eunuchs , &c.; and Baba . Then enter the Sultan . Sul . Sultan How fares our empress ? On this auspicious night , the moon doth greet her sister from the clouds , and all the stars shine bright above , like gems , to form for thee a diadem . Sul . Sultan How is the sun , whose dazzling light doth make the moon 's pale beams retire , as darkness flies before the rosy dawn ? Sult . Sultan Our majesty is well . ( he takes her hand and they walk down the stage . ) Baba . Baba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stint that majesty of stride  --  ' t would be as well ; and swing a little less from side to side , which looks somewhat of the oddest for a woman  --  have a care , these mutes will discover you ; you know how near us is the Bosphorus , and you and I may chance to find our way to Marmora without boats , stitched up in a sack , a mode of navigation not rarely practis 'd here . Sult . Sultan ( coming forward , sees Juan . ) Who 's that ? you 've bought another girl , it seems , and a fair one , tho ' somewhat tall , methinks , Baba . Here , ( aside to him ) I 'll have her sup with me to-night  --  see that we 're private . Baba . Baba I will ; Oh ! Lord ! what 's to become of me now ? my throat aches already . ( aside . ) Sult . Sultan Where is the youth you spoke of ? bring him in , we 'll have some music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise . Sult . Sultan We 'd have a song , boy  --  some cheering strain . Hai . Haidee My heart is tun 'd to sadness , and plaintive music only can I give ; Whate'er thy majesty would have of such , thou'st but to order , I but to obey . Sult . Sultan Sing us some plaintive air then , as thou wilt . Hai . Haidee The mistress , whom in former times I served , had , by her father 's cruelty , been torn from him she loved ; there was a favourite air of hers she sung , when she recall 'd scenes of past happiness to recollection  --  I will sing that air . AIR  --  I SAW FROM THE BEACH . Oh ! love ! once so sweet ! thy fond hopes while resigning  --  O'er scenes so endear 'd left in anguish to mourn , Still , still , there are joys yet around them entwining , Tho ' all that once blest them for ever is gone . Juan . Juan This was once Haidee 's song , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . ) Hai Haidee 2 Oh ! would that my fate thus had never bereft me , Or a glow of the heart to this hour were unknown  --  How tranquil had glided the joys that were left me ! Those joys that this bosom now never can own . ( Juan , during this second and third verse , seems doubtful and impatient by turns , gazing on Haidee. ) 3 Yet to feel that the heart we have lov 'd is still ours , Tho ' the germ of enjoyment for ever is dead ; Is sweet , as we oft prize the rich bloom of flowers , Tho ' all of the fragrance they yielded is fled . 4 ( Here Juan , in the transport of his feelings , unable to restrain himself , throws off his disguise and rushes to her . ) Juan . Juan The voice is her 's ; ' t is she ! ' t is she ! my love , and here ! Hai . Haidee ( falling on his neck ) Juan ! oh ! Heaven ! Sultan appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's this ; a man ! now by this blade , thou faithless wretch , thou diest. ( rushing to Baba with sabre drawn . Baba on his knees . ) Juan . Juan Hold ! do not be so rash , he 's guiltless . Baba . Baba Ay , as a babe  --  do n't murder me , I swear by the prophet 's beard I am ; pray do n't . Juan . Juan He 's innocent , he bought me from among the slaves in woman 's guise , to attend the Sultana , I wore it to avoid being sold some slavish drudge . ( Sultan looks suspicious around , and at the Sultana , who affects surprise . ) Baba . Baba ( aside ) That 's a good lie now , the devil himself could n't have told a better . ( Then aloud to Sultan ) Its true , most mighty  --  I swear it 's true , every syllable truth . Sult . Sultan Can I believe this ? Who 's this girl , whose garb doth ape our sex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , having lov 'd this youth , sent by my father to be sold a slave , preferr 'd to follow him in this disguise , and share his hapless fortunes . Sult . Sultan Whence come you , fair one ? Hai . Haidee From one of the Cyclades , most mighty lord . This youth was wreck 'd upon our shore , and had in my father 's absence won my love  --  on his return , indignant at my choice , ( I know not why , ) he shipp 'd him off a slave ; a vessel sailing some hours after him , and also destined hither , I , from my father having fled , bribed the guard to let me pass among the slaves on board  --  I did so , and arrived here : meeting by chance your agent , Baba , there . ( pointing to him , ) he . struck by my voice , ( as I desired he should be. ) brought me before the Sultan , to whom I wish 'd to tell my piteous tale , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost Juan was disposed of as a slave ; I knew , great monarch , that to your ear misfortune never told its tale in vain . Sult . Sultan This wears an air of truth , I like this girl . ( aside . ) Baba . Baba ( aside . ) She seems to fit him to a hair , as if she 'd liv 'd all her days with him . Oh ! this flattery ! these women have the knack of it . Sult . Sultan ( to Haidee . ) Thou art not deceived , fair girl  --  I am fierce in my revenge , but gentle as the dove , to sorrow ; where 's thy Father , girl ? Hai . Haidee He must be in pursuit of me e'er this . Sult . Sultan He shall not harm thee or thy Juan there . We will protect you , and reward your faithful loves . Wealth , splendour , and a monarch 's smiles , shall bless your future days  --  You sir , ( To Juan. ) shall still enjoy your native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Sultana . ) The Sultana will have a claim to your 's . Hai . Haidee Dear Juan , let us thank our benefactors . Juan . Juan We do return your bounteous kindness with our hearts  --  We 'll pass our lives beneath your favouring smiles , and study to evince our gratitude . I have a friend , whom Baba there disposed of ; I would like to have him witness to our happiness  --  he was my male protector . Sult . Sultan Go , Baba , bring him here . Baba . Baba I will , your grandness. exit . Juan . Juan Now , Haidee , we 'll be happy ; and the storms we 've lately met with shall but serve to give new zest to our enjoyment . Hai . Haidee Yes , Juan and enliven some of these dull hours , which life is fraught with ; but here comes Baba with the friend you spoke of . Enter Baba and Orloff . Juan . Juan Orloff ! Orl . Orloff Ha ! Juan , my boy , I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magician here tells me you are . I 've had a merry time of it  --  those savoury stews and rich sherbet make the blood circulate to a charm . But I say , who 's that ? ( Seeing the Sultan as he comes forward ) Juan . Juan The Sultan . Orl . Orloff Ah ! Sult . Sultan Is this your friend ? Juan . Juan It is . Orl . Orloff ( kneels to Sultan . ) Commander of the faithful , low I bow , and do salute you with all duteous love . Baba . Baba ( Aside ) He 's turn 'd mussulman  --  oh ! these Christians ! here 's three ; one lies , another wheedles , the third 's a renegade  --  have mercy on us , what will come next ? Sult . Sultan Rise for the sake of the young loving pair , to whom we have extended our protecting love , we 'll make thy fortunes too . Now , let the world the Sultan 's act approve , Who crowns with wealth and honours faithful love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
