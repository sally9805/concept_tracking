By G. C. Verplanck , chairman of the committee . // sive appropriation of the national property for the support of schools . Grants of national lands have already been made to a considerable extent , for . the aid of colleges and schools in some of the western states . The same grants have not as yet been extended to the old states , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states have any claims on the general government for similar grants , as a balance to what are conceived to be at present the exclusive privileges of the new *tates . The subject was first brought before the public , we belieye , by Mr Maxcy in a report made by him as chairman of the committee on education and public instruction , in the senate of Maryland , February 1 , 1820 . After stating the manner in which the lands have been granted in the west , Mr Maxcy observes ; The public lands , though located in the west and south , are the common property of afi the United states . Each state has an equal right to a part*cipation* in a just proportion of that great fund of national wealth . Your committee can discern no reason why the people , who have already settled in , or shall remove . to , those states and territories , w ic have been formed out of these public lands , should enjoy any peculiar and extraordinary advantages from this common property , not possessed by those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censuring that enlightened policy , which governed congress in making the liberal appropriations above mentioned , for the encouragement of leartiing in the new states and ter is ones . They , on the contrary , most heartily applaud it . But they , at the same time , are of optu* ion that the people of the original states of this union , by whose common sword and purse those lands have been acquired , are entitled , upon principles of the strictest justice , to like appropriations for the endowment and support of literary institutions , within their own limits . ' The Report , containing the words here quoted , was introduced too late to be taken into consideration during that seszion of the legislature . The same proposition was renewed the year following by Mr Maxcy , and defended in an able and elaborate Report , which was adopted by the senate and house of delegates of Maryland . The following resolutions were passed in both houses . 1 . Resolved by the General . Llssembly of . Maryland , that each of the United States has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public lands , the common property of the anion. // 2 . That the states in whose favor Congress has not made appropriations of land for the purposes of education , are entitled to such appropriations as will correspond , in a just proportion , with those heretofore made in favor of the other states . S. " That his excellency the governor be requested to transmit copies of the foregoing Report and Resolutions to each of our senators and representatives in congress , with a request , that they will lay the same before the respective houses , and use their endeavors to produce the passage of an act to carry into effect the just principles therein set forth . 4 . That his excellency the governor be also requested to transmit copies of the said Report and Resolutions to the governors of the several states of the union , with a request that they will communicate the same to the legislatures thereof , respectively , and solicit their co-operation . ' These resolutions have been accordingly transmitted to the governors of the several states . In Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously . In New York a counter report was drawn up by Mr Verplauck , chairman of the committee on colleges , academies , and common schools , and accepted by a majority of the legislature . Connecticut has approved the Maryland resolutions , and adopted a report , which , among other things , contains a resolution requesting the senators and representatives of that state in the Congress of the United States to use their endeavors to procure an appropriation of a part of the public lands , for the promotion of the objects of science and education in the several states , to be divided among them in such manner and proportion as to congress shall appear just and equitable . ' What have been the decisions of the other states , whose legislatures have been in session since they received the Maryland resolutions , we have not learned . Before we undertake the investigation of the principles on which the Maryland resolutions are founded , it may be well to inquire a little into the manner in which the United States came into possession of the public lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Mississippi river , was derived by cessions from several states . The claims of these states to any portion of the lands , beyond their established boundaries , were , in our view , for the most part merely nominal , and in no case supported by any good foundation . Take Virginia as a memorable example . This state professed to claim all the extensive and valuable territory northwest of the Ohio , // and east of the Mississippi . But upon what grounds will appear by a very brief statement of facts . Originally the whole tract of country north of the Gulf of Mexico , extending to the present northern boundary of the United States , was called Virginia . This name was given to the country after sir Walter Raleigh 's expedition . The patent granted to him by queen Elizabeth specified neither name nor limits . The new patent of James I was more definite . This patent was granted with similar conditions to two separate companies , one of which settled at Plymouth , and the other near Cape Henry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was limited to one hundred miles along the coast , and one hundred up the country , making a square of one hundred miles . The settlers near Cape Henry were usually denominated the South Virginia , or the London Company . To this company , in the year 1609 , and six years after the date of their first patent , Was granted a new patent or charter , enlarging the boundaries of their former grant . And this is the charter from which Virginia professed to derive her title , after the revolutionary war , to the territory northwest of the Ohio . The boundaries of the tract thus granted to the London Company were defined as follows , namely , being in that part of America , called Virginia , from the point of land called Cape or Point Comfort all along the sea-coast to the northward , two hundred miles , and from the point of Cape Comfort all along the sea-coast to the southward two hundred miles ; and all that space and circuit of land lying from the sea-coast of the precinct aforesaid , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and northwest . ' Charter of Virginia , sec. fi . Few men at the present day , probably , would presume so much on their sagacity , as to attempt to attach any meaning to the last half of this extract . At the commencement of the revolution , however , it was discovered to have a very profound meaning , and on this obscure clause alone were built the claims to all the unsettled lands in the northwestern territory . The phrase , from sea to sea , it was contended , meant the whole space between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans . But the claimants , notwithstanding , were not so exorbitant in their demands . Their moderation brought them within vastly narrower limits , than , according to their interpretation , the charter warranted . By gradual encroachments , other states had been formed xvith* // in what were contended to be the chartered limits , and Vir. * ginia was at length bounded on the north by Maryland and Pennsylvania , and on the south by North Carolina . By the treaty of 1763 between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary between British America and Louisiana . This brought the limits of Virginia very much short of the Pacific Ocean . And , finally , the claimants were contented to have their territory compressed within the lakes on the north , and the Mississippi on the west ; thus giving up the very interpretation of their charter , upon which alone they professed to found any claim . But what makes the thing still more extraordinary is , that the charter was vacated , fifteen years after it was granted , by a quo warranto from Charles I. The company , to which it had been given , was dissolved . Oldmixon says , that this was caused by the mismanagement of the proprietors . Grants were given to private adventurers , who not only raised quarrels among themselves , but exasperated the Indians , and induced them to commit outrages on the peaceable settlers . To prevent further difficulties , king Charles dissolved the company , and annulled the charter . He took the colony under his own direction , sent out officers of his own appointment , reserved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given in his name . How then could any claim be made under this charter , even admitting the obscure clause , which alone was supposed to sanction the claim , to have any meaning ? The charter was never afterwards made the rule of government in the colony . The king was the only proprietor and Virginia was in the strictest sense a regal province . This was also the understanding of the British government , as is manifest from the proclamation of the king in 1763 , relating to the American colonies . It is there stated to be the royal will and pleasure , that no governor , or other officer in the colonies should grant warrants of survey , and pass patents for any lands beyond the heads or sources of any the rivers , which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the west , or northwest . ' Laws of the U. S. vol. i , p. 446 . This language is a proof , that the king considered Virginia a regal colony , and that its western boundary , even in that charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia received the king 's proclamation in this sense , as may be seen in a letter of the president of the council to Lord Hillsborough . Afterwards , // also , when lord Diusmore made a grant of certain lands on the Ohio , without the king 's authority , he received a sharp reprimand in a letter from the secretary of state , reminding him of the king* s express command , that no lands should be granted beyond the limits of the royal proclamation of 1763 , until the king 's further pleasure was signified . ' From the facts contained in this short view of the subject , the infer .. ence is irresistible , that Virginia , as a distinct colony , had no claims to any of the unappropriated lands. - The subject of the Virginia claims was handled with great ability at the time , in an essay entitled Public Good , by a writer who has been more famed for his acuteness and talents as a politician , than for the correctness of his moral principles , or his reverence for religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states , we are convinced their claims would prove quite as groundless as those of Virginia . Those parts of the charters , by which these claims were supposed to be sustained , are either so unintelligible , contradictory , or jndefinite , as to render it almost absurd to make them a serious ground of claim . Take , for instance , the following clause in the charter of Massachusetts , upon which the claim of that state was grounded . After defining the northern boundary of the province , the charter goes on to include all the lands and hereditaments whatsoever , lying within the limits aforesaid , and extending as far as the outermost points or promontories of land called Cape Cod and Cape Malabar , north and south , and in latitude , breadth , and in length , and longitude , of and within all the breadth and compass aforesaid , throughout the main land there , from the said Atlantic or western sea and ocean , on the east part , towards the south sea or westward , as far as our colonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , who can persuade himself ; that he has any clear ideas on reading this passage ? And above all , that it could give any just claim to a tract of country three thousand miles in extent , from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean ; more especially , when it is known , that this would pass directly across the large grant , which had already been made by Charles II to the Duke of York ? * The charter of Connecticut is less obscure , it is true , and states in plain language , that the boundary of the colony should be the South * The charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay was given October 7 , 1691 ; and the grant to the duke of York , March 12 , 1663. // sea on the west part . ' This , also , was given the year before the grant to the duke of York , and is not , on this ground , subject to the same objection as the charter of Massachusetts . But before any right can be supposed to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it not necessary to ascertain the views and intentions of the parties ? It was the general impression , that the South sea was very near the Atlantic . Drake had seen the Pacific and the Atlantic from the same point on the Isthmus of Darien . The proximity of the . two seas was supposed to be the same along the northern coast . This is proved from several curious facts . Stith relates , in his History of Virginia , that in the year 1608 a company was fitted out in England , with a barge , that might be taken in pieces , with which the company were instructed , under the command of captain Newport , to go up James river with a view to discover the country of the Monakins , and from thence they were to proceed , carrying their barge beyond the falls to convey them to the South sea . ' Hutchinson also gives an account of some of Champlain 's people , who , having been but a few days ' march from Quebec , returned with great joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had discovered the South sea . ' Such were the vague notions , when the charters were granted , respecting the situation of the South sea , or the Pacific ocean . The truth is , the South sea boundaries seem to have been another name for indefinite limits , which the king was afterwards to circumscribe and define as he should think proper . This is very plain from the circumstance of grants being made , which ran into the western borders of the colonies , whose chartered limits were defined in this obscure manner . Thus , Maryland , Pennsylvania , and North Carolina , were taken out of what were considered the chartered limits of Virginia , and made over by royal charter to their respective proprietors . Then , and not before , the northern and southern boundaries of Virginia became defined . And so with the western boundary of Connecticut , which was at first unlimited . It was defined the year after by the grant to the duke of York . We may say the same of the western limits of Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely . They were afterwards defined by the Georgia charter . If it was not the understanding from the beginning , that these western limits were considered indefinite , and left to the future decision of the crown , how is it to be ac* // counted for , that encroachments were suffered thus to be made without a single remonstrance , or complaint from the states , or colonies , thus encroached upon ? From these views we are convinced , that , before the revolutionary war , no state had any claims to lands beyond its chartered limits , and that no fair construction of any charter could extend these limits into the lands northwest of the Ohio . These were residuary lands , neither subject to the control of any proprietary , or chartered colony , nor any of the colonial crown governments , but wholly , and exclusively , at the dis .. posal of the king . For the same reason , after the revolution , they belonged to the United States . In regard to Georgia , although it was bounded by the South seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi belonged at that time to the French . And whatever question of territory might arise , this state could exhibit no exclusive claims on the strength of its charter ; because twenty years after the charter was given , it was surrendered to the king , and the government became entirely regal . The claims of North Carolina were less incumbered , as its western limits had not been defined by any charter subsequent to its own . The United States , however , bad the same power to define these limits , as the king had before the revolution , and which , as we have seen , he exercised in numerous instances . The question concerning the lands , involved in these claims , began to be agitated soon after the declaration of independence . The claims of particular states were considered unjust and unfounded by those states , which had no part in these claims . It was contended , that the right of property in these lands was secured by the common efforts , and the common sacrifices of all the states , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of all . The state of Maryland , in particular , expressed a prompt , and very decided opinion . This state , ' says Mr Maxcy , as early as the 80th October 1776 , expressed its decided opinion , in relation to the vacant lands , by an unanimous resolution of the convention , which framed our constitution , and form of government , in the following words : " Resolved unanimously , that it is the opinion of this convention , that the very extensive claim of the state of Virginia to the back lands bath no foundation in justice , and that if the same , or any like claim is admitted , the freedom of the smaller states and the liberties of America may be thereby greatly endangered ; this // convention being thinly persuaded , that , if the dominion over those lands should be established by the blood and treasure of the United States , such lands ought to be considered as a common stock , to be parcelled out at proper times into convenient , free , and independent governments . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by resolves , and instructions to their delegates in Congress , expressed their sentiments in support of their claim to a participation in these lands , in still stronger language , and declined acceding to the confederation , on account of the refusal of the states claiming them exclusively to cede them to the United States . They continued to decline , on the same grounds , until 1781 , when to prevent the injurious impression , that dissension existed among the states occasioned by the refusal of Maryland to join the confederation , they authorized their delegates in Congress to subscribe the articles ; protesting , however , at the same time , against the inference , ( which might otherwise have been drawn , a aryland had relinquished its claim to a participation in the western lands . ' The Maryland resolution was probably in unison with the prevailing sentiments and feelings of the other states . But nothing decisive was done till after the treaty of peace in 1783 . By this treaty Great Britain relinquished to the United States all claim to the government property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof . ' This established a new relation between the states . It gave strength and certainty to the bond of union , which had before been comparatively weak and dubious . They had not the same motives for clinging to individual interests , as when they were looking forward to a variety of possible results . The great object , for which they had been struggling , and in which they had merged all others , was at length gained . Their independence , and every political , civil , and religious right had been secured . The important question remaining was , how these privileges were to be converted to the most certain means of a permanent union and happiness ? Policy and interest united with the best moral principles to dictate the wisest course . The generous spirit of patriotism , and a disposition to conciliate , which must at this time have pervaded all parties , produced just impressions , and brought into harmony the views of those , who before acted on discordant principles , because they imagined themselves to have separate and conflicting interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others equally honorable , the respective states yielded up what they conceived to be their claims to the unsettled lands . These cessions were made at different times , and all , except that of Georgia , within a few years after the peace . By these cessions , all the unappropriated lands , within the bounds of the United States , except such as belbnged to the Indians , became the property of the United States , and are of course brought under the jurisdiction of the general government of the states . The result , therefore , was precisely the same as if no claims had been made , with this difference only , that some of the states gave up their claims with reservations and conditions . These the United States ' government was bound to respect , whatever might have been the original validity of the claim ; because receiving lands as a cession was acknowledging a previous right to those lands in the party which made the cession . Hence Connecticut reserved a valuable tract on the south shore of lake Erie , the proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of schools in that state . It was also made a condition of the cession by Georgia , that the United States should pay one million two hundred thousand dollars to that state , and extinguish the Indian title to such lands as were held by the Indians , within the reserved limits of the state . No attempt was ever made to contest the claims of any of the states . They were all voluntarily given up , and in this amicable manner the United States have acquired an indubitable title to all the public lands on the east side of the Mississippi . The territory west of the Mississippi , as well as the southern parts of the states of Mississippi and Alabama , was purchased by the United States of France in 1803 , and paid for out of the common fund . It hence follows , that all these lands are the common property of all the states collectively , and under the entire control of Congress . As these lands are a common property , in which each state has an interest proportionate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so disposed of as to confer a proportionate benefit on each . This is equally conformable to justice , and the fundamental principles of our federal union ; and , moreover , this disposition of the lands was , with some of the states , a special condition of cession . This was particularly the case with Virginia , whose claim was considered much the // most important . After specifying certain conditions , requiring the United States to reimburse the expenses , which Vir .. ginia had incurred in defending the territory , and also providing that the French inhabitants within the territory should have their possessions confirmed to them , the act of cession requiring that all the lands , not included in other special conditions , shall be considered as a common fund for the use and benefit of such of the United States as have become , or shall become , members of the confederation , or federal alliance of the said states , Virginia inclusive , according to their usual respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure , and shall be faithfully and bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use or purpose whatsoever . ' Here is an express stipulation , and it is the spirit of all the acts of cession . Now , as we have already observed , however defective the claims of any state were originally , when they were recognized , the United States were bound to comply with all conditions on which a title was resigned . These conditions , therefore , expressly on the part of Virginia , and impliedly on the part of the other states , afford an additional reason , if such a reason were required , why all the public lands obtained by cessions should be appropriated for the proportionate benefit of every section of the union . No argument is required to prove that all the lands , which have been purchased out of the national fund , should be disposed of by the same rule of appropriation . We come next to inquire whether Congress has uniformly acted upon this principle . Have the proceeds of the public lands been distributed in due proportion to every part of the union ? Mr Maxcy 's remarks on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands have been sold , and the proceeds been received into the national treasury , all the states have derived a justly proportionate benefit from them . So far as they have been appropriated for purposes of defence , there is no ground for complaint ; for the defence of every part of the country is a common concern . So far , in a word , as the proceeds have been applied to NATIONAL , and not to STATE purposes , although the expenditure may have been local , the course of the general government has been consonant to the principles and spirit of the federal constitution . But so far as appropriations have been made , in favor of any state or states , to the exclusioii of the rest , where the appropriations would have been beneficial , and might have been extended // to all alike , your committee conceive there has been a departure from that line of policy , which impartial justice , so essential to the peace , harmony , and stability of the union , imperiously prescribes . ' In discussing this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of the distinction between NATIONAL , and 5TATE interests . In one sense they are the same . Whatever may be said , with strict truth , to be beneficial to the nation , may be considered in same degree beneficial to each part , inasmuch as the safety of a part depends on the stability and welfare of the whole . But , on the other hand , it is very possible for the whole to be benefitted at the expense of a part ; so that the United States may be gaining strength and pros . perity , while an individual state is losing its comparative standing and influence . In all such cases some of the states are increasing beyond their due proportion . This consequence may sometimes happen to a certain degree , from the nature of our political and local relations ; and for this reason , it is a consequence , against which it is the duty of Congress to guard with very great vigilance . So far as it depends on the structure of the state governments , the nature and productive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , or any thing peculiar to place or condition , it can hardly come under the control of Congress . And as all these circumstances will have a very active influence in moulding the character , and deciding the comparative importance , prosperity , and happiness of individual states , it becomes so much the more necessary , that in all those things , in which Congress has the power of bestowing benefits , this duty should be discharged with the strictest impartiality . The defence of the country , and the protection and encouragementof commerce , are a common cause , and whatever appropriations are made for these purposes may be considered as promoting national interests . By these , every state is benefitted alike , because the rights of each are equally secured , and the expenses of each for the support of the general government are proportionally paid . State loterests are such as relate to all kinds of internal improvements , agriculture , manufactures , encouragement of industry , science , literature , the arts , or useful inventions . To promote any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , or section of the union , without an equivalent , either in kind // or value , to every other state , or section . This is a fundamental principle , which should not be violated to the injury of any state , even if such violation were to produce a large national benefit ; for this principle is the only security of the state interests . Congress may , and ought , to afford encouragement to all the purposes here enumerated , but never for the benefit of the whole , or a part , to the manifest injury of another part . If it can be allowed that , on any possible occasion , a majority of Congress may vote away the privileges of an individual state for the general good , it will virtually dissolve the ties which hind the states together , by destroying the object for which a union is desirable . Each state has rights , privileges , and concerns , peculiar to itself , which it is as important should be maintained , as those which it enjoys in common with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the principle here stated can not easily be reduced to practice , yet the principle should be held sacred , and never be deserted without an obvious necessity , or as a temporary and pressing expedient . By this principle it is proper to try the proceedings of Congress in regard to the plan , which has been pursued in disposing of the public lands . Before any of the states had relinquished their claims , it was urged by those , who did not hold these claims to be good , that a portion of the public lands should be converted into the means of defraying the expenses of the war , in which all were taking an equal part . New York was the first state which resigned its claims , and in the preamble to the act giving power to its delegates in Congress to make the cession , it is stated , apparently as a motive , that it had been conceived , that a portion of the waste and uncultivated territory , within the limits or claims of certain states , ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . ' And this is the purpose for which the revenue derived from the sales of these lands has been applied by Congress . Acts have been passed at different times to facilitate this object ; and the whole amount of proceeds arising from these sales is now pledged for the gradual payment of the public debt , till it shall be extinguished . This scheme is no doubt equitable . It operates equally in favor of all the states . It consults the national interests , without interfering with those which are peculia* to any of the states . But another system adopted by Congress for disposing of // the public lands , is that first proposed in the ordinance of May 20 , 1785 , and which has since received several modifications . This is the systcm which is thought to be partial in its action , by granting privileges and property out of the common stock , to some of the states , which are not granted to others . The outlines of the plan may be detailed in few words . All the public lands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are uniformly divided into townships of six miles square , by lines running with the cardinal points , and consequently crossing each other at right angles . Every township is divided into thirty-six sections , each a mile square , and containing six hundred and forty acres . One section in each township is reserved , and given in perpetuity , for the benefit of common schools within that township . Thus one thirty-sixth part of all the public lands is appropriated for the benefit of particular states in aiding common schools . in addition to this , the state of Tennessee has received a grant of two hundred thousand acres for the support of colleges and academies . For the same purpose , also , two entire townships have been granted to Ohio . The appropriations generally , in the new states , for seminaries of the higher order , according to Mr Maxcy 's statement , amount to about one fifth of those for common schooh . Starting with these facts , Mr Maxcy goes into a calculation to ascertain what quantity of land , according to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States for the use and benefit of those states only , which have been , or will be formed in the territory not embraced in the old states . As the basis of his calculation he takes the estimates contained in Seybert 's Statistical Annals . From these it would appear , that the states and territories on the east side of the Mississippi , in which appropriations have been made , amount to 237,297,125 acres . And according to the ratio abovementioned , the aggregate number of acres actually appropriated on the east side of the Mississippi is 7,909,903 . Seybert also estimates the lands purchased of France in 1803 at 200,000,000 acres . The same system of appropriaation will no doubt be applied on the west as on the east side of the Mississippi . This will make for schools and colleges 6,666,666 acres . And the total appropriations for literary purposes in the new states and territories will he 14,576,569 acres . At two dollars an acre , which is lower than the average // price at which the public lands have thus far been sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to $29,153,139 . Such is the immense amount of property , which , according to the system now pursued by Congress , will be taken from the common stock for the encouragement of learning in particular sections . This is too plain a case to need any reasonings or illustrations to show that the system , in its present restricted operation , does not extend equal privileges to all parts of the union . Its justice can only be made to appear by proving , that the states which do not participate in these grants , have , in some other way , received an equivalent . But this can not he proved . They certainly have not received any equivalent in land , for no appropriations of lands have been made for their benefit , as in the other states . Nor have they received any equivalent in value from other sources . In short , the old states neither have received , nor can receive , any benefit whatever from these appropriations farther than they are the means of advancing the general interest of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally with the old , and this too in addition to the full value of all the lands granted for schools . To produce an equality , even on this principle of all the states being ben efitted by these grants , the same appropriations must be made to the other states ; not by taking any thing away from the new states , but by giving to the others , out of the lands which still remain , a quantity proportionate to what they have received . This view of the subject reflects no censure on Congress for the course they have pursued in disposing of the public lands . On the contary , every friend to enlightened improvement must consider it as dictated by sound policy , wisdom , and benevolence . The system is by no means partial in principle , nor necessarily so in application . It has happened , for what reason it is not our present purpose to inquire , that it has not as yet been applied in its full extent . This can now be done with perfect consistency , and without interfering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications , or the consequences resulting from them . Not a single act of Congress would need be repealed , nor would a single alteration be required in the machinery of the land department . No request is made to Congress to retrace steps before taken , hut to go forward and finish the work that has been begun . // The constitution delegates to Congress an absolute control over the territories , and all the public lands of the United States ; but , at the same time , it takes care to circumscribe this control within due limits , by adding the following clause , namely , and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state . ' Now the system by which the public lands are disposed of , in its present restricted application , does prejudice the claims of particular states , because each state has an equal claim to a proportional share of the common property of the whole . Each state , therefore , not enjoying a privilege which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States for this privilege , and a right to demand it of Congress . That one , or any number of states , has forborne to make this demand , is no proof that the claim is annulled , or even weakened . The claim receives its validity from the constitution itself , and must continue good , while the constitution remains in force . It hence follows , that the acquiescence of the old states in the partial operation of this system till the present time , is no evidence that their claim has been relinquished , or that it is not in all respects as strong as if they had urged it sooner . Nor ought any preference to be given to particular states , in making donations of lands , from the circumstance of these lands being within the limits of those states . Wherever they are situated , they are common property , in which every citizen of the United States has an interest . Although they are within the jurisdictional limits of a state , they can not be taxed by that state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or titles . These things are wholly regulated by the laws of Congress , in the same manner as with lands in a territory not yet formed into a state . In regard to the justice of the principle , Congress might with as much propriety grant lands in the western territory for the purposes of education in an eastern state , as a western . In either case , it is public property given to a particular state , or , in other words , it is the property of the nation devoted , not to national , but to state purposes . We are speaking here of the justice of the principle , without pretending that circumstances may not occur in which sound policy would justify , within a limited extent , an unequal distribution of public property . But under no circumstances , we apprehend , can this be done , without a corresponding bene // fit of some sort to all the states , and as nearly equivalent as the nature of the case will admit . Now we contend , that no such circumstances as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been made for the encouragement and support of education in the western states . No good reason can be shown why one state should be preferred to another in making this distribution . The revenue derived from commerce is public property , and on the same footing , in this respect , as the public lands . This revenue is chiefly collected in the commercial , or Atlantic states . And this affords just as good an argument in favor of giving a portion of this revenue for the particular benefit of the states in that section , as the circumstance of the public lands being in the west does , that they should be converted to a local advantage in that quarter . The fact , that this revenue is ultimately derived , not from the Atlantic states , but from all the states in which the articles of commerce are consumed , does not alter the case . The public lands have been derived in the same manner ; that is , from the common treasure , and united efforts of all the states . The facts we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , conduct us to the following results . First , none of the states originally had any valid claims to the lands which have since been made over by formal cessions to the United States . They were national possessions from the beginning . But when the United States consented to accept them as lands of cession , it was virtually acknowledging the claims to be just , and bringing themselves under an obligation rigidly to comply with any conditions attached to the articles of cession . Secondly , the principles of justice , and the letter and spirit of the constitution require , that the public property should be appropriated for the equal benefit of all the states . Thirdly , the system followed in disposing of the western lands has not operated equally , but has favored some states more than others . Fourthly , it is not only a constitutional right , but the duty of the states , which have thus been neglected , to petition Congress for an equal extension of privileges . To some of the positions , which we have attempted to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee of public lands in the senate of the United States , and in the Report respecting the Maryland resolutions in the legislature of New York . To these objections we now proceed briefly to reply . // It has been said , that the other states have actually received an adequate consideration for the lands appropriated for schools in the west . The money , which has accrued to the national ' treasury , by the increased value of the public lands , is thought to be a compensation . This was stated in the Report to the senate of the United States , and more at large by Mr Verplanek in the New York Report . He speaks as follows . Reservaijous of school and college lots are upon a large scale , what the reservations of public squares and walks , of lots for churches , markets , and public edifices are in the plans of cities and villages . They are not gratuitously bestowed upon the inhabitants ; nor is their value lost . But on the contrary , they tend to increase their aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their price is far more than paid in part of the purC chase money of every private sale* ' Such , Mr Verplanck thinks , has been the effect of th ' * wes-. tern grants . They have induced a readier sale , a higher price , and from the character of those settlers , who would be most attracted by these prospects , a more prompt payment . The reservations complained of ought , there fore , to be regarded , not as a partial donation for local objects , entitling every state to similar ones on principles of strict justice , but as a judicious arrangement , calculated and intended to increase the value of that " common fund , held for the use and benefit of the several states , " and made not for state , but for national purposes . ' This argument had already been anticipated by Mr Maxcy , and answered in a manner so lucid , forcible , and conclusive , that we are surprised to find it repeated by the New York committee , without any reply to the reasonings contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says Mr Maxcy , that it has been said , that the appropriation of a part of the pub ic lands to the purposes of education , for the benefit of the states formed out of them , has had the effect of raising the value of the residue , by inducing emigrants to settle upon them . Although in the preambles of such of the acts on this subject , as have preambles , the promotion of religion , morality , and knowledge , as necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind , have been assigned as the reason for passing them , and no niention has been made of the consequent increase in the value of the lands , that would remain , as a motive for the appropriation , yet the knowledge , that proviNew Series , No. 8. 4*3 // sion had been made for the education of children in the west , though other motives usually influence emigrants , might have had its weight in inducing some to leave their native homes . If such has been the effect , the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . this increase of value , however , has not been an exclusive benefit to the Atlantic states , but a benefit common to all the states , eastern and western ; while the latter still enjoy exclusively the advantage , derived from the appropriations of land for literary purposes . The incidental advantage of the increase in value of the public lands , in consequence of emigration , if it is to be considered in the light of a compensation to the ord states , must be shown to be an advan a e exclusively enjoyed by them . That this however is not the case is perfectly obvious , because the proceeds of the lands , thus raised in value by emigration , when sold , go into the United States treasury , and are applied , like other revenues , to the general benefit ; in other words , to NATIONAL and not to STATE purposes . It is moreover most clear , that this increase of the value of lands in consequence of emigration , produces a peculiar benefit to the inhabitants of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless owners of land in the new , have no participation . This benefit consists in the increase of the value of their own private property . On the other hand , it is undoubtedly true , that emigration is injurious to the Atlantic states , and to them alone . While it has had the effect of raising the price of lands in the west , it has , in an equal ratio at least and probably in a much greater , prevented the increase of the value of lands in the states which the emigrants have left . It is an indisputable principle in political economy , that the price of every object of purchase , whether land or personal property , depends upon the relation , which supply bears to demand . rrhe demand for land would have been the same , or very nearly so , for the same number of people , as are contained within the present limits of the United States , if they had been confined within the limits of the Atlantic states . But the supply in that case would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small in proportion to the demand , as to occasion a great rise in the value of land in the Atlantic states ; for it can not be doubted , that it is the inexhaustible supply of cheap and good land in the west , which has kept down the price of land on the eastern side of the Alleghany . If the Atlantic states had been governed by an exclusive , local , and selfish policy , every impediment would have been thrown in the way of emigration , which has constantly and uniformly operated to prevent the growth of their numbers , wealth , and power ; for which disadvantage the appreciation of their interest in the public lands , // onsequent upon emigration , can afford no adequate compensation . It appearing then perfectly clear to your committee , that emigration is exclusively advantageons to the new states , whose population , wealth , and power are thereby increased at the expense of those states , which the emigrants abandon , the inducement to emigration furnished by the appropriation of public lands for the purposes of education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such appropriations to that quarter of the union , offers the most weighty considerations of both justice and policy , in favor of extending them to the states , which have not yet obtained them . ' This reasoning seems to us legitimate and unanswerable . The argument itself , which proves the United States to have received a benefit by reason of the inducements held out in the west to emigration , is as powerful evidence as can be had of the unequal operation of the system . The value of the lands has been increased , it is true , and the national treasury has become richer . But how has this been done ? By exhausting the Atlantic states . Just in proportion as extraordinary encouragements have been offered to induce the people of these states to emigrate to the west ,  --  just in this proportion , have the states suffered , by losing a part of their population and wealth , and by being made to hold a lower comparative rank in the union . This consideration strengthens the claims of these states . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west , they would still be entitled to similar donations . And since it appears that this enhanced value of the public lands , which , as a national benefit , is thought to be a balance to the privileges enjoyed in the west , has actually been produced at their expense , it is certainly a very strange mode of reasoning to argue not only that their claim is annulled , but that they have been compensated for their loss . Such compensation as they have received , has been taken from their own pockets . If the Atlantic states were becoming overburdened with inhabitants , it might be considered a just and benevolent act in the general government to offer extraordinary inducements to allure some of them away . A national good might thus be realized , without injury to any state . But a century at least would elapse , before the population of any state in the union could become too numerous for ample support from their native soil . By drawing them away , a check is given to the // growth of those principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforts of civilized life , which give stability to the social compact , asrendency to the intellect , dignity to character , courtesy to manners , refinement to taste , and rational , pure , and elevated enjoyment to existence . All the blessings , which it is easy to perceive would thus grow up in the old states , they must lose , by losing their population . Their political influence in the union is also weakened , by diminishing the weight of their representation in the national legislature . Finally , the argument adduced by the New York committee sustains a position directly contrary to the one they advance . Instead of proving the Atlantic states to have no claims , it proves very clearly , that , in strict justice , they may not only ask to be put on an equal footing with the western states in regard to schools , but also to be compensated for the loss they have suffered in contributing so largely , and at the expense of sacrifices so dear , to raise the value of the public lands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The benefit resulting from this accumulation of property is enjoyed by all the states equally . The New York committee acknowledge that this benefit has sprung out of the emigration from the Atlantic states , and yet very unaccountably make this benefit a reason , why these states should not even be allowed an equal participation of those privileges , which have been the primary cause of the losses they have sustained in promoting the interests of the nation . A second objection is expressed by the New York committee in the following words : It is surely of the deepest interest to the welfare , the peace , and good order of the whole union , that the states every day springing up in the west , should not hereafter be peopled by a race , possessing nothing of civilization , but its vices and its arts of destruction . This might not , indeed , have been the necessary consequence , had the general government neglected to make provision for the difl7usion of know edge among the future population of this great territory , but it is clearly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even to require a prudent aud wise government to guard against so dangerous a contingency , not oni or the sake of those immediately interested , but for the promotion of the best interests of the whole nation . ' The force of this argument we confess ourselves unable to discover . It seems to us little more than a speculation , which // no experience nor sound reasoning can substantiate . What is the fact in regard to the states , which have grown up from a wilderness without any such provision for schools ? Is it true , that they are peopled by a race , possessing nothing of civilization , but its vices and its arts of destruction ? ' We think not . Why then fear this consequence in the west ? Or even admitting it may be feared in a remote degree , on what principles of equity is one section of the country to suffer a deprivation of its own means of improvement and happiness for the exclusive benefit of another ? And , moreover , the western appropriations are to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlers become civilized and enlightened , and then to cease . But when these states shall arrive at the point of civilization , which now prevails in the old , they will still have this accumulating fund to help them forward , while the others will have nothing . A weight is thus thrown into the scale against the old states , which is daily growing heavier , and which they have nothing , either at present or in prospect , to counterbalance . It is further objected , that , If the large additional grants for the encouragement of education , insisted on by Maryland , should now be made , a direct and obvious effect would be to diminish the fund , so important to the national interests , by placing immense tracts of lands in other hands , and enabling the individual states to undersell the general government , whenever they should think fit , and materially to retard or to lessen the sales . ' A plain answer to this objection will occur , on reverting to the object of the Maryland Report . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all the states have a right to equal advantages from the public lands ; and the fact , that all have not been thus favored . The objection before us has no bearing on these points . That the general fund of the union will be diminished is no reason , why the just claims of individual states should be rejected . Besides , the Maryland Report proposes no particular mode of answering these claims . Congress has full power to guard against the inconveniences apprehended , and to remedy every evil , by keeping the lands within its own control , by regulating the time of sale , and by fixing a price , under which the states shall not be allowed to sell . Many other modes of settling all difficulty from this // source will readily suggest themselves . That obstacles are to be encountered , or sacrifices made , in doing justice , is certainly no argument that justice should not be done . Let the mode be left to the wisdom of Congress . The amount of the claims has been considered as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being large , it is comparatively small . If the same ratio of appropriation be followed , which has thus far been obserired , the number of acres requisite to do justice to the old states will be 9,370,760 , which is less than has already been granted to the new states , and little more than two acres out of a hundred of all the public lands unsold . That is to say , the sixteen states , which have not received any grants , eomprising Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Dela .. ware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , and Kentucky , these sixteen states do not require so much land for their just proportion , as has already been granted to the states and territories in the west . The notion of the alarming magnitude of the claim therefore is not correct ; and if it were , it would add to the reasonableness of its bein equitably adjusted . It would truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying his justs debts , because they were so large . The committee of the senate of the United States admit the ground taken in the Maryland Report to be well support .. ed , as far as the principle is concerned , and think it expedient to grant something out of the sales of the public lands for the aid of schools in the old states . Two or three statements , however , in their report , appear to us to admit correction . The lands , ' say they , thus granted to the states for the above purposes are not subject to taxation by the state government , and can only be settled in the manner pointed out by the states in which they lie . If , therefore , correspondent quantities for the purposes of education are to be granted to all the old states , der which term the committee believe all states will be inclu ed , which have not received donations of land for that purpose , ) it would seem , that the states and territories , which now contain public land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with such donations , leaving but a small part of the land in each subject to taxation , or settlement , except at the will of other sovereign states . ' // This we take to be a distorted view of the subject , and hold the apprehensions expressed in the last clause of the para .. graph to he quite gratuitous . In the first place , it ought not to be taken for granted , that the lands , which are required for the old states , are to he disposed of in the same way , or to be subject to the same conditions , as those already appropriated . Nothing of this nature is contemplated in the Maryland Report . Every thing relating to conditions and modes of conveyance is left to congress , with the expectation , of course , that such a plan will he pursued , as will operate with perfect equity towards the new states . And in the next place , there is no occasion for the alarm , which the committee express , in regard to the quantity of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the estimate attached to their own Report , the quantity of public lands in each of the new states , except Ohio , is nearly three times as much as the whole amount required for the old states . Let this quantity be divided among all the states , in which the public lands are situated , and the evil apprehended in the Report will be very trifling , even in its fullest extent , and upon the false supposition , that it must necessarily exist at all . Again , the committee of the senate of the United States ob-serve , The lands , therefore , granted to some of the new states for the purposes of education , though distinguished in common parlance by the name of donations , were in fact sales bottomed upon valuable considerations ; in which the new states surrendered their Tight of sovereignty over the remaining public lands , and gave up the whole amount , which might have been received in taxes , before such lands were sold , and for five years thereafter . ' The fallacy of this notion will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any right of sovereignty over the public lands , and consequently could surrender none . It has been justly observed by an able writer , that as Congress possesses , in absolute dominion , the whole territory , before the creation of the new states , and makes those states , it is not to be understood how any right of sovereignty is relinquished by them . ' The new state becomes such on conditions ; one of which is , that it shall not tax the public lands within its limits . Nothing is given up , for nothing was held in possession . After the state is formed , then its rig/dr are commensurate with the conditions , which it has accepted . // But these conditions exclude all control over the public lands , and absolutely forbid any demands of an equivalent for what might have been derived from them , had the privilege of taxation been allowed . It is furthermore to be observed , that in no public act , relating to the new states , has it ever been intimated , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing . No other motives have been assigned , or even implied , than the benevolent and disinterested ones of promoting education , morals , religion , civil order , and *p6d government . Had any right existed on the part of the states , in the estimation of the general government , is it credible , that it would never have been recognized , or even alluded to , in the acts relating to the public lands , and especially the grants to the states ? We have thus adduced some of the general reasons , for *n equal distribution of the public property for the encouragement and suppQrt of schools and colleges in all the United States ; and endeavored to obviate , as we hope successfully , the principal objections , which have been started . It is hardly *o be accounted for , that any objections should seriously be urge1l in a case of so much interest , importance , and obvious justice . If difficulties are thought to lie in the way , let them be removed by Congress , in such a manner as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the apprehension of the difficulties blind our eyes to the perception of justice , tie up our hands , shut up our hearts , and disable us from making those efforts , which the cause of learning , and our national welfare , dignity , and honor , demand . It is at least a duty , which all the states , that have not received appropriations , owe to themselves and to future generations , to press the subject on Congress , and have their claims fairly and thoroughly investigated . Let this be done , and for ourselves we can have no doubt of the result . Nor do we discover , that the view we have taken can operate in any degree against the best interests of the western states . To suppose them unwilling to allow the other states equal privileges with themselves , would be a reflection on their magnanimity , generosity , and good principles , which is not to be admitted . They have , it is true , a proportional interest in the public property , out of which any grants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally true , that thes0 states once had an interest in the lands , which have already // been granted to them . The committee of public lands propose , that a certain portion of the amount of sales shall be allowed to the several states , which have received no aid for schools . Now this fund belongs to all the states collectively , and whatsoever is taken out for the east will consequently be drawing something from the west . But there is no inequality in this . All the appropriations , which have been , or may be granted , once belonge*l to the common fund . They were to be distributed equally to all parts of the union . Some of the states have already received their portion , while it yet remains for the others to receive theirs . To us this appears a fair statement of the case . But should it be found , on a closer examination , that the proposed appropriations to the old states will give the new ones a claim to something more , let it be granted . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible terms . Much might be said to enforce the policy of the measures , Which we have been endeavoring to defend on the ground of equity . It was an admonition of the illustrious Washington , springing not more from wisdom and foresight , than the purest benevolence , that the states should vigilantly guard against any step , which should furnish ground for characterizing parties by geographical distinctions . ' Is it not obvious , that the course thus far pursued by Congress must have this tendency ? To favor one part of the union more than another will necessarily excite sectional jealousies , sow the seeds of discord , and nourish a root of bitterness and discontent , inimical to peace , harmony and good government . The safety and happiness of the nation depend on the moral as well as the political union of the parts , a union of sentiment , feeling , and affection , founded on equal rights , privileges , and enjoyments . To preserve this union , every state must have the fullest confidence , that all its rights are respected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , also , other considerations of great weight springing out of the importance of learning , especially in a government like ours , where the supreme control depends on the opinion of the people . Under such circumstances , how important is it , that this opinion should be enlightened ? The representative body of the nation is drawn together from every part . Hence , it is requisite that the means of knowledge should be equally scattered , that the balance of advantages derived // from this source may be preserved . Without question , ' says Bacon , there is no power on earth which sets up its throne in the spirit and souls of men , and in their hearts and imaginations , their assent also and belief , equal to learning and knowledge ; ' and again , there is scarce one instance brought of a disastrous government , where learned men have been seated at the helm . ' Now the most certain mode of making learned rulers , is to extend as far as possible the influence of learning to the people from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good rulers , it makes peace. * able citizens . It causes men to have just views of the nature , value , and relations of things , the purposes of life , the tendency of actions , to he guided by purer motives , to form nobler resolutions , and press forward to more desirable attainments . Knowledge smooths down the roughness , and tames the native ferocity of men . The maxim of the poet is true ; Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes , Emollit mores , nec sinit esse feros . Laws will be obeyed , because they are understood and righUy estimated . Men will submit cheerfully to good government , and consult the peace of society , in proportion as they learn to respect themselves , and value their own character . These things are the fruit of knowledge . But ignorance is a soil , which gives exuberant growth to discords , delusions , and th' dark treacheries of faction . Ignorance in the people , in fact , takes all security from the government . While ignorant , they are perpetually subject to false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein to the wild storms of their passions , and prepared to yield themselves willing victims to the seductions of every ambitious , turbulent , treacherous , and faithless spirit , who may choose to enlist them in his cause . Knowledge will work upon this charm with a potent efficacy , lay the hideous spectres , which it calls up , and preserve the soundness and growing strength of the social and political fabric . It should , furthermore , be considered the glory , and the duty of our national legislature to aid in establishing morals and religion , both as a means of safety to the government , *nd happiness to the people . The first step in accomplishing this purpose is to fix the principles of virtue , and impress the im-. portance of religious practice , by enlarging the sphere of // mental light , touching the springs of curiosity , opening the channels of inquiry , and pouring into the mind new materials of thought and reflection . All branches of intellectual im- provement will lead to moral goodness . The mind , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend to the heavenly worlds and find him there , to go into the deep secrets of nature and find him there , to examine the wonders of its own structure , and look abroad into the moral constitution of things , and perceive the hand of an invisible , Almighty Being giving laws to the whole , will be impressed with a sense of its own dependence , and feel something of the kindling flame of devotion . It is not in human nature to resist it . And so the man , who begins to study the organization of society , the mutual relations and dependencies of its parts , its objects , and the duties it imposes on those , who would enjoy its benefits , will soon be made to respect its institutions , value its privileges , and practise the moral virtues in which its very existence con-. sists . The more extensively these inquiries are encouraged , and these principles inculcated , in the elements of education , the greater will be the certainty of moral elevation of character , and the brighter the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , ignorance is its deadliest bane . It gathers the clouds of prejudice from all the dark corners of the mind , and causes them to brood over the understanding , and too often the heart , with a dismal , chilling influence . It gives perpetuity to error , defies the weapons of argument and reason , and is impassive even to the keen sword of eternal truth . Religion requires the aid of knowledge to be received in its purity , and felt in its power . To bring into salutary action these two great instruments of human happiness , morals and religion , nothing is of so much importance , as to multiply the facilities of education and quicken the spirit of enlightened inquiry . Through the medium of education the government may give a strong impulse to the arts , and help to build up the empire of the sciences . Before men can invent , or make profound discoveries , they must be taught to think . Savages never advance a step farther in discoveries and inventions , than they are compelled by their wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful arts , which an im* proved state of the intellect has brought to light . In the sciences , and in literature , we have a vast uncultivated field // before us . We will not enlarge on so trite a subject , as the value of these noble branches of human improvement , nor on so obvious a one , as the immense advantages that must flow to us as a nation , from having them thoroughly cultivated among us . They ought to be brought under consideration in connexion with this subject ; and on every mind , whose conceptions are not narrowed within the most ordinary bounds , they xviii have a solemn and impressive influence . In the arts of traffic , and the mysteries of gain , we may perhaps be contented with the skill we possess . But to be contented with our progress in the sciences and literature , and all those attainments , which chiefly dignify and adorn human nature , would argue an obtuseness and apathy altogether unworthy of a people , who are blessed with so many political , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of the United States . In closing this article , we are glad to embrace the opportunity afforded us by the subject we have been discussing , of saying a few words on the literary enterprize and efforts of the state , in which the Rcport , recommending a general appropriation for the aid of learning , originated . The legislature of Maryland gave early attention to the establishment of schools . At the session in 1692 , an act was passed for the encouragement of learning ; and four years afterwards King William 's Free school was established at Annapolis , on a very broad and liberal basis . In 1723 a school was erected in each of the counties , and the funds , which had been provided by previous acts for the support of schools , were distributed among them in equal proportions . Lands were also given in each county for the use of the teachers . One source of income to the school fund was a tax of twenty shillings a poll on all negroes imported into the state , and also on all Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the growth of popery by the importation of too great a number of them into this province . ' In these county schools , such children as the visitors should select for the purpose were required to be taught gratis . This system , it would seem , was conducted with considerable success , and was aided from time to time by the patronage of the legislature . The school at Chestertown , in Kent county , had become so flourishing in the year 1782 , that the visitors petitioned the legislature to have it formed into a college . The petition was // granted , and the institution took the name of Washington Cob lege . The number of students at the time of this change was one hundred and forty , and was soon after augmented to two hundred . Buildings were erected at the expense of ten thousand pounds taken from the funds , which had been procured by private subscriptions . The state granted an annual appropriation of twelve hundred and fifty pounds . Two years after , another college was founded on a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which King William 's school was incorporated . To this institution was made a yearly grant of seventeen hundred and fifty pounds . The same act , by which St John 's college was founded , authorized a union of this with Washington college , under the title of the University of Maryland . The acts for founding and incorporating these institutions were drawn up with considerable ability , and they embrace many sound principles and just views . But they are marked with some radical defects . The system of government and discipline was one , under which no institution could long exist . Each college was under the direction of twenty-four visitors . These were required to assemble quarterly at the college to examine the students , hear appeals , decide on their conduct* and in general , to put the laws into execution . Thus all power was virtually taken out of the hands of the immediate officers , in whose hands alone it could be of any value in preserving necessary subordination , and enforcing wholesome rules of discipline . The students would not respect officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose decision they might appeal on the most trivial occasion to a body of men , who could have no more than a very imperfect knowledge of the merits of the case , and who at best could be but ill qualified to judge . The circumstance of meeting so often , and entering into such details , must also have contributed rather to diminish , than strengthen the interest of the visitors themselves . In addition to these evils , the scheme of having an university composed of colleges in different sections of the state , we conceive to have been wholly impracticable . The two bodies of visitors were united into one with a chancellor at its head . This body in its united capacity formed laws and regulations for the two colleges . But it is impossible , in the nature of things , that the interests of institutions so far separated could be precisely the same . Nor could they act in concert , or promote // *n unity of purpose . Under such circumstances , it is not surprising , that this university did not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So much dissatisfaction at length prevailed , that in the year 1805 , the state entirely with .. drew its patronage . We have heard other reasons assigned , than those we have mentioned , such as the spirit of party , unfortunate choice of teachers , and local prejudices . These , no doubt , had some influence ; but we are convinced that no combination of fortunate circumstances could have remedied the evils at which we have hinted . Since the decision of the Dartmouth college question , it has been made a subject of debate , whether the proprietors of these colleges can not regain their former privileges . It is urged , that many individuals made large donations , with the understanding , that the state was permanently pledged to continue the support at first granted . But it is so doubtful whether this point can be well sustained , that it is not likely any decided step will be taken . Although the state was disappointed in the success of this institution , it did not slacken its exertions in aiding the cause of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most of the counties , respectable academies have been established , which receive annually considerable sums out of the state treasury . Each county , we believe , is entitled to eight hundred dollars , and some receive more . There are instances in which two or more counties have united their resources . Charlotte Hall school is supported in this way , and sustains a high rank . In addition to these grants for academies , nearly as much more is given for common schools . The whole amount of money annually expended by the state of Maryland for the purposes of education , exceeds twentyfive thousand dollars . These details are enough to show , that the efforts of this state in advancing the interests of learning have been liberal , honorable , and worthy of the highest praise . It has afforded its patronage to several literary institutions , by loaning money , granting lotteries , and other facilities . To Baltimore college it granted a lottery , which was to yield thirty thousand dollars . In 1807 the Medical college was founded in Baltimore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in 181* the charter was extended to embrace all the departments of science and literature , with * privilege subsequently granted of raising one hundred thousand // dollars more . The institution with this extension of its charter is called the University of Maryland . It consists of four faculties , namely , divinity , law , medicine , and the arts and sciences ; and is under the control of twenty-eight regents . To obtain a degree , students are required to be examined iii the presence of the regents ; and no one can be considered a candidate for the degree of bachelor of arts , till he has attende.d lectures in the university for the space of two years , nor for the degree of master of arts , till he has attended the same for three years . The medical department is the only one , which has yet gone into full operation . As a medical school , this is believed to be little inferior to any in the country , and is daily rising in reputation . The college building is beautiful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical apparatus is considered equal , if not superior , to any in the United States . During the last session of the legislature , a loan was granted to the university of Maryland , and it is. hoped , that all the departments will before long be brought at least into partial operation . The professor of divinity , Rev. Dr Wyatt , has given a few lectures , but no regular course . The professor of law , Mr Hoffman , is preparing a course of lectures , which , if we may judge from the syllabus he has published , will do honor to the university , and justify the expectations , which have been raised by the favorable evidences of his talents and qualifications exhibited in his work on the study of the law. * St Mary 's college in Baltimore was empowered by the legislature in 1805 to admit students to degrees , and grant diplomas .

It is , indeed , a fact , which redounds much to the honor of the state , that in all its charters to literary institutions , from the time of its first acts , it is formally and explicitly stated , that no distinctions shall be made in favor of any religious sentiments , but that students , pro .. fessors , visitors , and regents , shall be taken from all denominations and be admitted to equal privileges . It is a complaint , we believe , of most of the states at the south , which have made donations for the aid of schools and * See a review of Hoffman 's Course of Legal Study , N. A.

We are confident , that the munificence of the state legislatures has been much greater than is generally imagined . A statement of the amount of donations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which they have been applied , would be a valuable document . It would afford a clue to the cause of failure in particular cases , and lay a foundation for a more judicious and beneficial management . We suspect the grounds of complaint may be traced to two sources ; a deficiency of qualifications in the persons to whom the disposal of money is entrusted , and a want of proper care in selecting teachers . Before we wholly close this article , we beg leave earnestly to recommend the principal subject of it to the attention of the American public at large , and individually of the state governments in our own neighborhood , who can not , we think , acquit themselves of unfaithfulness to the interests of their constituents , if they do not imitate the laudable example of the legislature of Maryland , in pursuing so important and just a claim . We need not , any more than the committee of the senate of Maryland , the framers of the Report before us , dis claim the idea of looking with jealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would sooner double than diminish them . But we must also be permitted to say , what experience , we believe , has already shown in some of these states , that the appropriations are likely , in the new states themselves , from hasty and injudicious application , and the gen.

' verance with which they have brought forward and pursued this claim , and to the chairman of their committee , Mr Max .. cy , for the forcible and considerate form in which the Reports are drawn up .
