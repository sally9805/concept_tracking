txt ART . IV .. - Demosthenis Opera , ad Optimorum Librorum Fidem accurate Edita . Lipsm . Excudit Car . Tauchnitz . By the great majority of the literary world , from his own time to the present , Deniosthenes has been considered as unsurpassed , if not unequalled in eloquence . While , h0wever , // there has been so little difference of opinion respecting the degree of his merit , the peculiar nature of it seems to be , at least in this countr ) , very imperfectly understood . Our knowledge of the character of his oratory rests principally on secondary evidence . With Cicero , American students are , comparatively , well acquainted . Their acquaintance with him in early youth , though short and compulsory , is sufficient to give them some general impressions respecting his distinguishing characteristics , and what is of more consequence , to facilitate a more thorough and general perusal of his works in maturer years . Demosthenes is removed one step farther from our reach , by the language in which he writes ; and his concise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to leave him little leisure to observe and relish the beauties of his author , till after repeated perusals . Few among us have the disposition , or the leisure , to read Demosthenes in the original . He has indeed been ably translated by Leland , but we may observe of translations of ancient authors , what has been remarked of engravings of fine buildings , that they seldom become objects of interest , till after the originals are generally known and studied . We judge of Demosthenes , therefore , from certain vague remarks respecting the fire , the boldness , and the magnificence of his speeches , and the errors into which such language is apt to lead us , are strengthened by an impression , which generally prevails respecting the oratory of the ancients . It is often said that modern orators speak to the reason , ancient orators spoke to the passions , a remark which , if founded in truth , is susceptible of great qualification . From the rank which Demosthenes held in the opinion of all ancient critics , and more particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to find what we consider to be the peculiar features of Grecian and Roman eloquence , displayed in the greatest force and abundance in his works . We look for extravagant declamation , for perpetual appeals to the feelings , for a crowd of similes and metaphors ; in short , for a style bearing a greater resemblance to the Irish , than to any other modern oratory , and far too bold to be adopted with propriety in a modern assembly . To those who are conversant with the writings of this orator , we need not say that the opinions , which we have just // noticed , are the very reverse of the truth ; to those who are not , we shall offer a few general remarks on his real merit . The most prominent feature in his orations , as has been justly remarked , is argument . He never declaims , till he has first reasoned ; he seems to disdain to inflame our passions , till he has overpowered our understanding . Few authors can bear a comparison with him in the originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the point proposed and with each other ; in the succinctness , perspicuity , and energy with which they are stated ; in the sagacity and generalship , if the term may he allowed , with which he directs his force to those points where his adversary is most vulnerable , and himself most powerful ; in all those qualities , in short , which constitute a powerful and accomplished logician . But though an acute and close , he is by no means a dry and cold rca soner ; he bears no resemblance to those , who state their sentiments with the calmness , as well as the precision of matliematical demonstration . His argument seems to flow from his heart , as well as his intellect , and is equally impassioned with the declamation of other orators . His declamation , on the other hand , has much of the closeness and terseness , which we find displayed in the ablest arguments . We perceive in it nothing vague or extravagant , nothing florid or redundant , nothing strained or ostentatious ; it always seems to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments to which it refers , and appears to be introduced not only naturally but necessarily . It is scarcely possible , however , to divide the speeches of Demosthenes , like those of most other orators , into argumentative and declamatory passages . Logic and rhetoric are blended together , from the beginning to the end the speaker , while always clear and profound , is always rapid and impassioned . The vivid feeling , displayed at intervals by other orators , bursts forth in Demosthenes with every sentence . We are forcibly reminded of the description of lightning in Homer ; By turns one flash succeeds , as one expires , And Heaven flames thick with momentary fires . ' Were we called upon to state , what more than anything else distinguished Demosthenes from all other orators , we should answer , his constant and complete forgetfulness of himself in his subject . His object , in his most celebrated // orations , ( with the exception of that on the Ciown , ) was to thwart and overthrow the ambitious projects of Philip of Macedon , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and their illustrious ancestry . That Philip was aiming at the sovereignty of Greece , that he feared and hated the Athenians , as the irreconcilable opponents to his schemes of aggrandisement , that he was hostile to the city of ALbens , to everything which it contained , to the very ground on which it stood , hut to nothing so much as its free government , ' these were the ideas , which seemed to penetrate and absorb the very soul of Demosthenes , and which he put forth all his strength in impressing on the minds of his hearers . His exordium , though highly finished , is generally brief ; he throws himself into the midst of his subject , and seems to have neither time nor thought for anything besides . To gain the assent , and not the applause of the audience , is his single object ; his aim seems to he to direct the councils of Athens , utterly regardless of the credit which success may reflect on himself , and he appears to think as little of the skill which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fighting for his life , thinks of the grace which he shall exhibit in the management of his weapons . When we consider , that it is the well known property of this enthusiastic sincerity to communicate itself from the speaker to his audience , that connected even with moderate abilities it seldom fails to command a res1 ectful attention , that it is of itself often sufficient to give a temporary interest to the most airy extravagance , it requires little reflection to per ceive what effects it must l ) produce , when united with the talents of Demosthenes . By no author is he excelled in the power of engaging and riveting our attention . We feel ourselves in the grasp of a giant , and are hurried along in the course of his argument with unceasing and breathless interest . While , however , we dwell thus forcibly on the entire devotion of Demosthenes to his great purpose , we would not be understood to imply , that his orations are devoid of all remarks of general application . He looks intensely on his subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his remarks centre in a single point , hut they are drawn from a wide circurnference . Almost every one of his speeches abounds in maxims of the most profound kind , and the most universal // interest , not formally ushered forth in the garb of philosophy , but , like everything which he utters , springing naturally from his subject , and bearing strongly upon it . That the mind soon loses its dignity if given up to low and grovelling pursuits ; that it is the leading duty of a true patriot never to fear responsibility ; that no community can ever be great , if it suffer its conduct to be entirely determined by external circumstances ; that it is for him who has received benefits to cherish them in his memory , while the giver should be the first to forget them ; these , and numerous other political and moral truths of equal moment , are a11 enforced with the greatest clearness and vigor by Demosthenes . We , consider him , in short , as the most striking illustration of the rule subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ars est celare artem . ' His eloquence always strikes us , as the true eloquence of nature , the language of a strong mind under high excitement . But it is not our intention to attempt a complete , still less a technical description of his various merits , and we shall merely present our readers with a few specimens of his orations , as they appear in an English dress , intermingled with such remarks as naturally suggest themselves . We quote from Leland 's translation . It is , however , necessary , to make one or two previous observations , lest our readers should think that our assertions are but feebly warranted by our extracts . The first circumstance to be noticed , is the well known fact , that Demosthenes is one of the last authors , to whom justice can be done by quotations . His orations are the very reverse of those works , which are marked by striking inequalities and forcible contrasts , by brilliant passages which can be easily distinguished , and conveniently detached from everything around them , by occasional beauties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , he everywhere seems animated with a similar , not to say an equal fervor ; even in his highest flights he rises gradually , and every part of his speeches is so connected with what precedes and follows , that it can not be extracted without material injury . The next circumstance , to which we shall advert , is the manifest disadvantage of quoting from a translation . The difficulty of transfusing the spirit of an ancient author into our language is notorious . With Demosthenes this difficulty is // greatly increased , by the nature of his style . This is concise , in many places to a fault , and finished with the most exquisite nicety . Every word is apt and significant , and occupies the . very place of all others which best belongs to it , and of course nothing can well be altered , transposed , or omitted . To imagine that such an author can be rendered into our language , without the loss of many beauties of phraseology , to say the least , would be to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues , as exists between no two languages whatever . Leland 's translation is , as before observed , executed on the whole with great ability , and should be in the hands of all , who are debarred from consulting the original . In the important circumstances of a thorough perception of his author 's meaning , and an accurate knowledge of the events to which he refers , he has seldom been surpassed . He is also distinguished by great , and when we consider the natural attachment of translators to their authors , we may add , singular and laudable impartiality . He seems to have formed the most just and discriminating opinions of the merits of Demosthenes , and to have imbibed no inconsiderable portion of the spirit of his eloquence . In one respect , however , his translation falls greatly below the Greek , in elegance of phraseology . It contains many expressions , which are now obsolete or trivial ; the words are by no means selected and varieA with sufficient care , and the style , on the whole , is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , of our extracts , we hope our readers will direct their attention to the sentiments , rather than the phraseology . The first passage , which we shall select , is the comparison in the second Olynthiac between the Athenians of the time of Demosthenes , and their illustrious ancestors . These our ancestors , therefore , whom the orators never courted , never treated with that indulgence with which you are flattered , held the sovereignty of Greece , with general consent , five and forty years ; deposited above ten thousand talents in our public treasury ; kept the king of this country in that subjection , which a barbarian owes to Greeks ; erected monuments of many and illustrious actions , which they themselves achieved , by land and sea ; in a word , are the only persons who have transmitted to posterity such glory as is superior to envy . Thus great do they appear in the affairs of Greece . Let us now view them within the city , both in // their public and private conduct . And , first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our tempies , and the offerings deposited by them , are so numerous and so magnificent , that all the efforts of posterity can not exceed them . Then , in private life , so exemplary was their moderation , their adherence to the ancient manners so scrupulously exact , that if any of you ever discovered the house of Aristides , or Mi itiades , or any of the illustrious men of those times , he must know that it was not distinguished by the least extraordinary splendor . For they did not so conduct the public business as to aggrandise themselves ; their sole great object was to exalt the state . And thus by their faithful attachment to Greece , by their piety to the gods , and by that equality which they maintained among themselves , they were raised ( and no wonder ) to the summit of prosperity. * This is in many respects a highly characteristic passage . It affords , in the first place , a singular instance of the indifference to mere oratorical display , which we have already mentioned as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here disregarded . How might he have displayed those powerful talents of narration and description , which he has proved so fully in his oration on the Crown . With what force and effect might he have dwelt on those victories , which have furnished themes for the efforts of so many orators and poets , from the time when they were won to the present age . With what graphic touches might he have described those glorious monuments of Grecian art , which are even now the wonder and the study of the civilised world . Far different was his course . The whole history of Athens , from the days of Miltiades to those of Pericles , of her power , her conquests , her trophies , her wealth , her architec* ture , is comprised in a few brief sentences . It was his design not to raise his own fame as an orator , but to waken his cotintrymen from their fatal lethargy , to shame them into a more dignified and efficient course of conduct , by reminding them , in simple and affecting terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chose , therefore , merely to elevate and fire their minds , hy a few masterly touches , and then to deliver them over to their own reflections . The next remarkable feature of this extract , which we shall notice , is the exemplary boldness with which the author reproves the follies of his countrymen . It is pleasing to reflect that the ascendency , which Demosthenes acquired and main. = // tamed over the fierce democracy of Athens , ' was in no degree purchased by a mean compliance with their humors , or a timid forbearance towards their faults and follies . This passage is far from a singular instance in which he displays a sincerity , which the most conscientious lover of strict and abstract truth would deem worthy of high applause . His orations are full of the most pointed and caustic censures of the levity and indifference of his countrymen , in their most momentous concerns . He calls them , for instance , a helpless rabble , without conduct , without property , without arms , without order , without unanimity ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their decrees , and , finally , that their constitution is subverted . ' Language like this , one would think , must be odious in any country , and the mixture of truth which it contained , when applied to the Athenians , would , we apprehend , produce any other effect than that of rendering it more palatable . If we inquire why it was so patiently heard , from the lips of Demosthenes , we may find a sufficient reason in the skill and judgment , with which it is uniformly employed . His censures evidently spring from the purest patriotism , and are uttered not merely to gratify his own feelings , but for a benevolent and practicable object . His reproofs are constantly followed by exhortations and encouragement , and while he condemns , with the most unsparing acrimony , the degeneracy of the Athenians , he never fails to prove that if they will be themselves , all may yet be retrieved . In this respect , to say nothing of any other , we think the orations of Demosthenes a model , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day . We trust , indeed , the time is yet distant , when a boldness like his , will be viewed by the citizens of this country , as a crime . In vain shall we boast of the liberty of expressing our thoughts , which is secured by our constitutions and laws , if it can only be exercised under the iron sceptre of an illiberal and jealous public opinion . Our second extract is from the third Philippic , and requires no preface . And now what is the C**USC of all this ? ( for there must be some cause , some good reason to be assigned , why the Greeks were once so jealous of their liberty , and are now ready to submit to slavery . ) Jt is this Athenians ! Formerly , men 's minds were animated with that which they now feel no longer , which conquered all the opu* // lence of Persia , maintained the freedom of Greece , and triumphed over the powers of sea and land ; but now that it is lost universal ruin and confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing subtle or mysterious ; nothing more than a unanimous abhorrence of all those who accepted bribes from princes , prompted by the ambition of subduing , or the base intent of corrupting Greece . To be guilty of such practices , was accounted a crime of the blackest kind ; a crime which called for all the severity of public justice ; no petitioning for mercy , no pardon was allowed , so that neither orator nor general could sell those favorable conjunctures , with which fortune oftentimes assists the supine against the vigilant , and renders men utterly regardless of their interests , superior to those who exert their utmost efforts ; nor were mutual confidence among ourselves , distrust of tyrants and barbarians , and such like noble principles , subject to the power of gold . But now are all these exposed to sale , as in a public mart ; and in exchange , such things have been introduced , as have affected the safety , the very vitals of Greece . What are these ? Envy , when a man bath received a bribe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be convicted ; resentment , at his being accused ; and all the other appendages of corruption . For , as to naval power , troops , revenues , and all kinds of preparations , everything that is esteemed the strength of a state , we are now much better , and more amply provided , than formerly , but they have lost all their force , all their efficacy , all their value , by means of these * We pass on from the shorter speeches of Demosthenes , to that masterpiece of Grecian eloquence , the oration on the Crown . This is distinguished from the rest , not only by its superior excellence , but by its freedom from their two most important , if not their only defects . The first of these is the coolness generally displayed in the perorations . Demosthenes complied , in this respect , with the rules of Grecian rhetoric ; and it can not but be greatly regretted , that in so important , a particular he should have suffered Art to prevail over Nature . The other fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether , indeed , this be a fault , seems to be more than doubtful to the ablest critics , it is certainly an error on the right side , and of singularly rare occurrence . It is ascribed by Leland , to the well known character of the Athenians , a people remarkable for their quickness of perception , to whom the slightest intimation was a sufficient clue to the orator 's sentiments . Another reason may be found in the fact , that the subjects on which Demosthenes spoke had in general been // 43 1826. previously discussed by other orators , and fully understood , in all their relations by the audience . The assemblies which he addressed were , besides , engaged most deeply in the business before them , and their minds wound up to a degree of interest , which suffered not a single remark to pass unnoticed or unapplied . Still , under all these qualifications , Demosthenes has carried the virtue of brevity to an extreme ; and , in this respect , he would be a very unsafe model for the imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a reader , the most wakeful and unremitted attention , and it is scarcely necessary to add , that much of the force and beauty of the finest sentiments , if expressed in a similar style , would be lost by an audience . In the oration on the Crovn , Demosthenes is , compared merely with himself , unusually diffuse . He was probably led to this course by the peculiar circumstances of his situation . His whole conduct was upon trial . He was attacked by an orator , who yielded only tO himself in skill and celebrity , and forced to answer to numerous specific charges , which could be refuted only in detail , and at great length , and , as he himself observes , he could only vindicate his own character by a complete history of his public life . This oration is , accordingly , five or six times as long as any of the Philippics , and is distinguished by every species of composition , by argument , by narration , by invective , direct and ironical , by comparison , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and language , of all descriptions . Our limits will confine us to a very few extracts . The first is an example of the bitter personal reproaches , which Demosthenes heaps on his adversary . They are certainly such as neither would nor should be permitted , by the rules of any deliberative assembly at the present day . They were provok*d , however , on the part of IEschines , by invectives of equal virulence and ability ; and the contest between the tWo orators was in fact a trial of character . We may also remark , that the reproaches uttered by Demosthenes , both in this and other passages , violent as they are , contain nothing which , if true , could not be decently told , and that they are free from that disgusting vulgarity , which disfigures those of Cicero against Piso and Antony . The lines in italics allude to the charge of cowardice , which // Eschines had repeated several times in the course of his oration . When you had obtained your enrolment among our citizens , by what means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you instantly chose out the most honorable of employments , that of under scrivener and assistant to the lowest of our public officers . And , when you retired from this station , where you had been guilty of all those practices you charge on others , you were careful not to disgrace any of the past actions of your life . No , b3* the powers You hired yourself to Simmichus and Socrates , those deep groaning tragedies , as they were called , and acted third characters . You pillaged the grounds of other men for figs , grapes , and olives , like a fruiterer ; which cost you more blows than even your playing , which was in effect playing for your life ; for there was an implacable , irreconcilable war declared between you and the spectators ; whose stripes you fit so often and so severely , that you may well deride those as cowards , who are unexperienced in such perils. - But I shall not dwell on such particulars as may be imputed to his poverty . My objections shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in your public conduct , ( for you at last conceived the bold design of engaging in affairs of state , ) that while your country prospered , you led a life of trepidation and dismay , expecting every moment the stroke due to those iniquities which stung your conscience ; when your fellowcitizens were unfortunate , then were you distinguished by a peculiar confidence ; and the man who assumes this confidence , when thousands of his countrymen have perished , what should lie justly suffer from those who are left alive ? And here I might produce many other particulars of his character . But I suppress them . For I am not to exhaust the odious subject of his scandalous actions . I am confined to those which it may not be indecent to repeat . Take then , the whole course of your life , IEschines , and of mine ; compare them without heat or acrimony . You attended on your scholars ; I was myself a scholar . You served in the initiations ; I was initiated . You were a performer in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes of speeches ; I was a speaker . You were an underplayer ; I was a spectator . You failed in your part ; I hissed you . Your public conduct was devoted to our enemies ; mine to my country . ' The next passage , which we select , is a rapid and forcible enumeration of the various and important measures , which had been adopted for the security of the state . To say nothing of its other beauties , the manner in which the orator introduces himself in the third person is singularly happy . // Consider ; what was the part of a faithful citizen ? Of a pru* dent , an active , and an honest minister ? Was he not to secure Eubcea as our defence against all attacks by sea ? Was he not to make Bceotia our barrier on the midland side ? the cities bordering on Peloponessus our bulwark , on that quarter ? Was he not to attend , with due precaution , to the importation of corn , that this trade might be protected through all its progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover those districts which we commanded , by seasonable detachments as the Proconesus , the Chersonesus , and Tenedos ? To exert himself in the assembly for this purpose , while , with equal zeal , he labored to gain others to interest and alliance , as Byzantium , Abydos , and Eubcea ? Was he not to cut off the best and most important resources of our enemies , and to supply those in which our country was defective ? And all this you gained by my counsels and my administration . Such counsels , and such an administration , as must appear , upon a fair and equitable view , the result of strict integrity ; such as left no favorable juncture unimproved , through ignorance or treachery ; such as ever had their due effects , as far as the judgment and abilities of one man could prove effectual . But if some superior being , if the misconduct of generals , if the iniquity of your traitors , or if all these together , broke in upon us , and at length involved us in one general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there been a single man in each Grecian state to act the same part , which I supported in this city ; nay , had but one such man been found in Thessaly , and one in Arcadia , actuated by my principles , not a single Greek , either beyond or on this side Thermopyim , could have experienced the misfortunes of this day . All had then been free and independent , in perfect tranquillity , security and happiness , uncontrolled in their several communities , by any foreign power , and filled with gratitude to you and to your state , the authors of these blessings , so extensive and so precious . And all this by my means. * The last quotation , which we shall make , is a part of the oration on the Crown , concluding with his apostrophe to the departed heroes of Athens . Leland 's version of this passage is uncommonly elegant and happy . The principal truth , which Demosthenes here labors to enforce , is no other , than that success is not the necessary result of human exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would seem to many not only an indisputable , but a commonplace maxim of mo . rality , though no one will deny the singular ability with which it is amplified and illustrated . It is necessary , therefore , to refer to the argument of *schines . Availing himself of the // disasters , which had befallen Athens during the administration of Demosthenes , this orator accused him with the greatest vehemence , as the author of all her calamities . He represents him as the evil genius of his country , the accursed thing which had drawn down upon her the vengeance of heaven ; the ilistarred wretch , whose disastrous destiny had outweighed and controlled her better fortunes . These charges , which we believe would not he without their effect on the feelings even of a modern audience , under similar circumstances , must have seemed far more credible to a Pagan assembly , who were prone to consider misfortune , not only as a presumptive proof of misconduct , but as a sure indication of the wrath of the gods . Demosthenes , in reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be required to possess the gift of prophecy ; after showing that the measures , which he pursued , were those of a wise and patriotic minister , and were admitted so to be , by the silent acquiescence of *schiues himself , at the time of their adoption , proceeds as follows . But , since he hath insisted so much upon the event , I shall hazard a bold assertion . But , in the name of heaven , let it not be deemed extravagant ; let it be weighed with candor . I say then , that had we all known what fortune was to attend our efforts ; had we all foreseen the final issue ; had you foretold it , 1Eschines , ( you whose voice was never heard , ) yet , even in such a case , must this city have pursued the very same conduct , if she had retained a thought of glory , of her ancestors , or of future times . For , thus , she could only have been deemed unfortunate in her attempts ; and misfortunes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven to inflict them . But if that state , which once claimed the first rank in Greece , had resigned this rank , in time of danger , she had incurred the censure of betraying the whole nation to the enemy . If we bad indeed given up those points without one blow , for which , our fathers encountered every peril , who would not have spurned you with scorn ? You , time author of such conduct , not the state , or me ? In the name of heaven , say with what face could we have met those foreigners , who sometimes visit us , if such scandalous supineness on our part had brought affairs to their present situation ? If Philip had been chosen general of the Grecian army , and some other state had drawn the sword against this insidious nomination , and fought the battle , unassisted by the Athenians , that people who , in ancient times , never preferred inglorious security to honorable danger ? What part of Greece . what part of the barbarian world , has not heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Lacedemonians , whose power was older and more extensive , that the king of Persia would have cheerfully and joyfully consented , that this state should enjoy her own dominions , together with an accession of territory ample as her wishes , upon this condition , that she should receive law , and suffer another state to presi ( le in Greece ? But , to Athenians , this was a condition unbecoming their descent , intolerable to their spirit , repugnant to their nature . Athens never was once known to live in a slavish , though a secure obedience to unjust and arbitrary power . No ; our whole history is one series of noble contests for preeminence , the whole period of our existence hath been spent in braving dangers , for the sake of glory and renown . And so highly do you esteem such conduct , so consonant to the Athenian character , that those of your *incestors , who were most distinguished in the pursuit of it , are ever the most favorite objects of your praise . And with reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men , who resigned their lands , gave up their city , and embarked in their ships , to avoid the odious state of subjection ? Who chose Themistocles , the adviser of this conduct , to command their forces ; and , when Crysilus proposed that they should yield to the terms prescribed , stoned him to death ? Nay , the public indignation was not yet allayed . Your very wives inflicted the same vengeance on his wife . For the Athenians of that day looked out for no speaker , no general to procure them a state of prosperous slavery . They had the spirit to reject even life , unless they were allowed to enjoy that life in freedom . For it was a principle fixed deeply in every breast , that man was not born to his parents only , but to his country . And mark the distinction . He who regards himself as born only to his parents , waits in passive submission for the hour of his natural dissolution . He who considers , that he is the child of his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than behold that country meduced to vassalage ; and thinks those insults and disgraces , which he must meet ; in a state enslaved , much more terrible than death . Should I then attempt to assert , that it was I who inspired you with sentiments worthy of your ancestors , I should meet the just resentment of every hearer . No ; it is my point to shew , that such sentiments are properly your own ; that they were the sentiments of my country , long before my days . I claim but my share of merit in having acted on such principles , in every part of my administration . He , then , who condemns every part of my administration , he who directs you to treat me with severity , as one who hath involved the state in terrors and dangers , while he labors to deprive me of present honor , rtbs you of the applause of all posterity . For if you now pronounce , that , as my public conduct bath not been right , Ctesiphon must stand condemned , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not that you owe your present state to the caprice of fortune . But it can not be ! No , my countrymen ! it can not be that you have acted wrong , in encountering danger bravely , for the liberty and safety of all Greece . No ! by those generous souls of ancient times , who were exposed at Marathon ! By those who stood arrayed at Plat*ea ! By those who encountered the Persian fleet at Salamis , who fought at Artemisium ! By all those illustrious sons of Athens , whose remains lie deposited in the public monuments ! all of whom received the same honorable interment from their country ; not those only who prevailed , not those only who were victorious . And with reason . What was the part of gallant men they all performed ! Their success was such as the Supreme Director of the world dispensed to each . ' No writings could , we think , be read to more advantage by the rising orators of our own country , than those of Demosthenes . A thorough study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do much to correct the two most prominent faults of American oratory . The first of these , is the excessive prolixity , by which we are most unfortunately contradistinguished from our transatlantic brethren . In our national House of Representatives , for instance , which , composed as it is of our most distinguished politicians , is certainly no unfair specimen of our deliberative assemblies , five or six weeks are spent in debating upon questions , which would be discussed in the Parliament of Great Britain , and well discussed too , in half as many evenings . The best speakers in that country generally find two or three hours at most , amply sufficient for a complete exposition of their arguments , arid those eloquent orations of five or six hours , which are so much in fashion at Washington , are almost unknown . There is some appearance , indeed , that this prolixity of our congressional speakers is working its own cure , and it already begins to be suspected that , in order to convince , it is not in ( iispensably necessary to fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fondness for unnatural and meretricious ornament , which is occasionally displayed , even by some of our ablest speakers , and which is exhibited , in irrelevant and ostentatious digressions , in cold and trite similes , and a gay confusion of metaphors , in finical circumlocutions , and a studied avoidance of direct and definite language , and , to speak more generally , in offences of every description against classical simplicity . This fault is by no means confined to our oratory , it infects in some degree every // branch of our literature , and must be ascribed in part to circumstances in our condition which can be removed only gradually . A chaste elegance in the art of composition , as in all other arts , is generally the result , in part , of assiduous culture , and consequently the evidence of a high degree of advancement . But we think , that the deficiency of several of our orators in this quality , has been owing materially to the admiration entertained , by so many of our fellowcitizens , for a few faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Phillips . We object to this admiration , not so much because it is extravagant , as because it is undiscriminating . We know that perfect simplicity is compatible with a high ( degree of ornament , provided it be apt and unforced ornament , and there are certainly passages alike faultless and striking in both these orators , and more especially in the first . But these great beauties are balanced , not to say outweighed , by faults of equal magnitude , and the contrast , striking as it is , seems to have been strangely overlooked by many of our countrymen . Misled by some of the most glaring absurdities of these bril. liant , but irregular productions , they seem to have essentially mistaken the nature of real eloquence , to have supposed not only that it was something more than plain good sense , but something at war with it . We know nothing that could he better adapted to correct impressions like these , than the frequent contemplation of the severe beauty of Attic eloquence . But above all , would we recommend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory . The present age is a period , when men are in earnest , when they seek , even in works of amusement , for something which shall excite intense thought , and call forth their inmost feelings ; when they will not endure to hear important subjects treated carelessly or superficially. * XVe may add , that if this be the character at the present day , of all enlightened nations , still , more especially , is it that of our own . All our public institutions , all our private and domestic habits , are calculated to render us emphatically a practical people . Every individual is in some degree a man of business . With us a recluse is almost an unknown being , and the most retired students are drawn from their closets to bear some part in the machinery of active socie * See Dr Channing 's Sermon at the Ordination of Mr Gannett. // ty . Our whole frame of government presupposes , what our admirable systems of early education have enabled u to verify in a great degree , that our community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature in the character of the people , at least of the older parts of our country , is more striking than their singular sedateness and gravity . Their very amusements are strongly marked by these characteristics . Their only festival days are those , which are devoted to the celebration of important agricultural , political , religious , or literary ceremonies . Nothing seems to he intended as the mere sport of the passing hnui ' ; all is serious and practical . this peculiar gravity of character is daily becoming more prominent , and difibsing itself more widely . it is surely not improbable , that it will eventually give a coloring to all our intellectual productions , but more especially to our oratory , and that in this country the most popular arid successful eloquence will be the grave , manly , argumentative eloquence ' of which Demosthenes is so splendid an example ; which disdains to trifle , which seeks to convince and persuade , not to entertain ; which speaks to the reason and the heart , rather than to the fancy ; the eloquence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say nothing of the other illustriotis orators of Greece , are alone sufficient to render the language in which he wrote , worthy of the assiduous stu ( ly of every well educated American . But the study of good models is , after all , only one means of improving the oratory of our country . Among many others , which might be mentioned , we shall suggest one , both because we consider it of high importance , and because it has not , so far as we are aware , been generally adopted , either in this or any other community ; and that is , to oblige the students of our principal literary seminaries to debate , extempore , from time to time , in the presence and under the direction of a teacher . No one will dispute the expediency of such a practice , who considers , either the manifest value , in a country like ours , of the faculty of speaking in public , or the great disproportion which exists among us , between the number of able and accomplished orators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The debates in our legislatures , for instance , more especially in New England , are principally carried on by members of one profession . // ( it is true a most respectable one , ) that of the law , or rather by that highly favored portion of them , who have previously enjoyed frequent opportunities of exercising and improving their oratorical powers before a judicial tribunal . This is certainly far from desirable . There are , in every representative assembly , many citizens of other professions and pursuits , well entitled by their wisdom and integrity to the places which they hold , and well able , had they the power of expressing themselves with ease , to shed light on every question of public importance . Yet these men , ( putting out of the question rare instances of natural eloquence , ) are compelled either to do themselves and their subject injustice , by an imperfect and embarrassed enunciation of their sentiments , or to confine themselves to a simple yea and nay , and leave the field of de*a'e to their more fluent , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent brethren . The more discreet generally prefer the latter course , and however clearly they may prove their wisdom by their votes , can exert but little influence over the decisions of others . That this evil , with many others of a similar nature , would be at least materially remedied , by the measure which we recommend , seems to us beyond a question . We may add , that it is not only a practicable measure , but one which could be carried into execution with the greatest ease , and that it has been , in fact , recently adopted in several of our Law Schools . It may , perhaps , be considered as unnecessary , since it is frequently said , that the l ) ractice of composition in writing , is the best method of acquiring the power of debating with force and readiness . We are sensible , that this opinion is countenanced by no mean authority , and we should be the last to dispute the numerous and weighty advantages , which can be derived from writing only , , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render men consummate orators . It may strengthen their power of thought , and increase their command of language , but much will obviously remain to do , which can be accomplished only by debating extemnpore . This practice , for instance , would greatly facilitate the acquisition of what is a rare accomplishment , in this and in most other countries , a good delivery . The reigning defect in our readers and speakers is monotony . Now this fault is often acquired by *eading or reciting the works of others , and is occasioned , // tnore particularly , by the extreme difficulty which we find in entering into the spirit of what we utter ; that is , in inspiring ourselves with the same feelings , while pronouncing a passage , that existed at the time it was composed , in the mind of the author . We find a similar , though a less difficulty , in repeating aloud our own compositions , because the glow of feeling with which they were written , has gone by , and can be recalled only by a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no monotony in private conversation , because we utter what we feel at the moment , instead of reciting what we recollect , and , for a similar reason , this defect is displayed much more seldom , and in a much less degree , at the bar and in the senate , than in the pulpit . We hope it will not be inferred from these remarks , that we are in any degree hostile to the prevailing custom of declaiming from the works of distinguished authors . On the contrary , we consider it of the highest value , both as an oratorical exercise , and as a vehicle of noble and useful sentiments . It is only while followed to the exclusion of any other species of declamation , that it can be open to the slightest objection . To conclude , if any readers should complain , that we have noticed only the faults of our public speakers , and passed over their good qualities in silence , we would observe , that this circumstance has resulted from the nature of our design , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory , and by no means to give a picture of its actual condition , a task much too extensive and interesting to be accomplished within our present limits . The edition of Demosthenes , mentioned at the head of this article , is entitled to the praise of great correctness . It has no other recommendation than its portable size ; an advantage dearly purchased by the entire omission of notes , and the employment of a type too small and indistinct to be read without hazard , even by the strongest eyes . This latter defect is one , which has occurred so frequently in recent editions of standard works , both in our own and other languages , that it deserves to be particularly and strongly reprehended.
