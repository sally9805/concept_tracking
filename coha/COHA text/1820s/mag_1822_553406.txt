ART . X1X . Dissertation on . Musical Taste , or General Principles of Taste , applied to the . drt of Jiusic . By Thomas Hastings . Albany , Websters &amp; Skinners , 1822. p. 228 . TRUE reformation is rarely the work of a moment . When the tenacious grasp with which mankind cling to long established customs and opinions is once broken , they generally rush to the opposite extreme , and in their eagerness for reform adopt without examination whatever seems to he contrary to their former notions . Tear away , brother Martin , never mind , so you do but tear away , ' is the maxim on which they often proceed ; and the consequence is , that when the excitement is diminished and they begin to review their labor , they find that they tore the old coat in pieces before they had made another-that they have still much to do before they can appear in a decent dress . Something like this has been the case in the change which , within a few years , has taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the community had at last become sensible of the absolute worthlessness of the music generally heard in our congregations , and awake to the necessity of a reform , it was quite natural that the first determination should be to throw aside the whole mass of insipid compositions , to which they had so long listened , and to substitute the works of foreign masters in their stead . The attempt was a laudable one ; at the same time it must be allowed that the knowledge and good judgment of those who were active in the measure , were outstripped by their zeal . The community ueeded more preparation for so great a change , and to the no small astonishment of the reformers , the anticipated result was not realized . There were two causes of this disappointment . One was a general deficiency in musical science , which prevented any just discrimination in selecting from the works of European composers . The good and the bad were equally liable to be taken , and the quantity of the latter greatly exceeded that of the former ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little for the better , But there was another cause far more operative . Bad habits of execution , which in a considerable degree had their origin in the peculiar qualities of the wretched compositions that had been so long in vogue , still remained . The tune was changed , but the ijian // ner of singing was unaltered , and of course the effect was much the same . The delicate airs of Madan were mangled and crushed by the harsh vociferations of ignorant vocalists , and the sublime harmonies of Giardini were smothered under their meagre tones and unemphatic pronunciation . Many indeed praised the music , because it was said to be good , and they dared not to contradict ; but the simple , unsophisticated auditor , who was uninfluenced in his decision by a reverence for the authority of fashion and judged only by the feelings actually excited in his breast , hesitated not to declare his dislike to it , and heartily wished that of the old school to be restored to favor . We shall have occasion in the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for minds of a moderate degree of refinement . That charm was gone , and the power of the music now in use was unfelt for the simple reason that it was not exerted . The eVils which sprung from these causes have been for some time past diminishing . Much however remains to be done before the legitimate effects of music can be generally experienced . We have long wished that some effort might be made to diffuse more extensively , just notions of the principal ends of music , and the means by which they may be attained . It was gratifying to learn that a person so eminently qualified for the task as Mr Hastings , was making the desired attempt , andthe result of his labors more than answers our highest anticipations . The work may be divided into two parts ; the first treats the subject of taste in the execution of music ; the second of taste in its composition . The qualities of good singing are thus enumerated : Tone , Intonation , Time , . tilrticulaiion , . lccent , Emphasss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated in their order . The prevailing notion , that nature only can make a fine tone , is doubtless true , if by a fine tone is meant one of superlative excellence ; but unquestionably a regard to this notion has been productive of mischief , by causing a remissness in cultivating the voice so far as it is capable of improvement . No efforts could make every tone equal to that of a Farinelli , yet a very limited observation will show that there is no tone which is not susceptible of considerable modification . In a choir of singers , however diverse their tones may have been when they began to sing together , the whole become before long very much *similated to thGse of a few leading ones , and perhaps more // often to that of the chorister alone . If he sings harshly , they all do the same ; if his tone is full and clear , or slender and imperfectly made , the tones of the whole will be so in a greater or less degree . This change may take place without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they imitate without being aware of so doing , it is plain that suitable efforts would produce far greater alterations . Softness , clearness , and volume are essential qualities of a good tone . In the natural voice they are rarely found however , especially through its whole compass . A few notes indeed about the medium one , may possess these qualities , but above and below they are usually more or less wanting , though almost always attainable . But instead of careful attention to these requisites and constant effort to produce and perfect them , the majority of singers never bestow a thought on them , and more especially on the two last . They seem to proceed on the principle laid down by the humorous Scotch peasant , when ridiculed for his bad singing . Its a far gate atween here and heaven . A ' music sounds well i ' the distance . ' Indeed if we look for the causes of the su* perior effect of distant music , we find a motive for the cultivation of tone in singing . Whatever other circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this fact is , that the sounds are in themselves of a better quality . Their roughnesses are filed off , as it were , before they reach the ear , and many slightly discordant and irrelevant sounds , arising from the imperfection of instruments , and of the human organs , are lost in passing over so great a space . If a stone be thrown into a smooth lake , a total irregularity in the motion of the water will appear at the spot ; but as the undulations extend themselves , the smaller ones become invisible , and those only can be seen which are regular and beautiful . Similar to this must be the case in irregular pulsations of the atmosphere . Care then should be taken that no breath is emitted but what is put in motion , that there be no jarring of the organs and mixture of nasal sounds . These and other defects of tone may be detected by close attention , and with proper exertions they may be greatly remedied . But if excellence of tone is necessary to produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing or playing in tune , ' is indispensable for the production of any at all , save that of disgust . Great faults in intonation can not exist , where there is the slightest ability to distinguish musical sounds , but those of smaller magnitude are often to be noticed . Mr Hastings observes , // But though the ear , that is misled by culture , learns to make its decisions with tolerable uniformity ; it yet instinctively revolts at the result of those decisions , while it continues to persevere in them . An illustration of this remark is often furnished among musicians of very considerable attainments . Let one accuse them of an habitual error in intonation , and they will deny and even retort the charge ; but let him demonstrate to them the truth of the interval in question , by variously combining it in harmony , ( which is the only practical method of demonstration ) and they will at once be surprised and delighted at the discovery . A note in melody which they had imagined to he perfectly tuned , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produced a disagreeable result to them , was now , by a slight change in its pitch , found capable of producing the most agreeable and harmonious effect . ' p. 28 . It would naturally be supposed that the imperfect chords are those most liable to be mistuned , since the perfect ones can not be altered without producing an obvious dissonance . Such is the opinion of our author . We should think , however , that the major seventh is oftener tuned too low than too high , thus producing a minor instead of a major third with the dominant as it ought. * There is no need of a long argument to prove the necessity of distinct articulation in vocal music ; for of what use is it that words are sung , if we can not understand them ? How often is the effect of music wholly lost upon us from having our whole attention given to an endeavor , and that often a vain one , to pick out from the obscure or uncouth language of singers the meaning of what they pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , and not a few that the pronunciation of many words should he intentionally changed , because they are composed of disagreeable sounds . The first notion is altogether incorrect . The articulation of the sounds of the letters is entirely independent of tone , and with proper care may be as distinct in singing as in speaking . It is true that the simple sounds composing a word can not alThere should have been a table of errata annexed to the book . In general it is well printed ; but there are several errors in the paragraph which we refer to ( p. 29 , ) calculated to mislead the reader , who is not well acquainted with musical notation . Thus second si th and eighth ' *hould be secondfiflh and eighth , &amp;c . It would have been well too , if the index to the book had referred to the pa5es , where the topics are treated As it is. the Index is little better than none . // ways , nor indeed but rarely , occupy in their pronunciation the same relative time which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more then others will affect distinctness only in a small degree . The principal faults in articulation are considered by Mr Hastings to be four , the omis ion of consonants , their substitution , such as v for f ' z for s , their improper situation in syllables , ' or in other words , an improper syllabication , and the want of separation between words . ' To these he adds feebleness in articulating the consonant sounds , and the improper disconnection of syllables , occasioned by taking breath in the midst of a word . ' His illustrations of these defects are very plain and precise . XVe could add to this list of faults one or two others , analogous to these , often to be noticed in singing slurred notes . Thes* are so prominent and common that we wonder at their omission by Mr H. , for they must have been noticed by him , and the more especially , because his own singing is entirely free from them . One is the introduction of an aspirate , or the sound of w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when passing from one note to another . The other is the change of the vowel sound , and the not dividing of it , if it be diphthongal , ( as for instance in the long i ) and giving one sound to one note and the other to the next . This is perfectly easy in practice and adds greatly to the smoothness of the execution . The introduction of aspirates and the change of vowel sounds may be shown by a reference to one instance . The word joy ending the first line in the tune Portsmouth *Bridgewater collection ) if written as often pronounced would be thus ; jo , he , ho , he , hoy , or thus ; jo , we , wo , we , whoy , it being noticed that in this illustration the o is to be sounded as in joy . This may at first seem incredible ; but who has not heard this and similar outrages in pronunciation , from many who think themselves good singers , and would be offended , were they to be accused of pronouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are disa b reeable , must be made with great caution . The consonant sounds , which are peculiarly offensive in singing , such as s , cit soft , and their combinations with others , should be no more than plainly pronounced , while others of a smoother character , as 1 and r will bear considerable prolongation . Of the vowel sounds , the slender a and e are the only unpleasant ones . A slight change of these , producing , instead of the former , one // approaching to the Italian sound of the same letter , and instead of the latter , one very nearly allied to the sound of i in pin , may be admissible , if executed with great precision , for then the change will be unnoticed unless by a very nice ear . Any obvious alteration , however , can not be made without offending every lover of accurate pronunciation . We must take the language as it is ; if it contains bad sounds , that may be our misfortune , but we can not help it any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slight changes mentioned above requirei* so discriminating an ear , and such flexible organs , that it may be better to authorize no alteration whatever , leaving those who are competent , to do it at their own risk . The principles of music require that different parts of the same measure should receive a different stress of voice . Poetry also demands that certain syllables be accented , while others are not ; but the degree of accent is not invariable . So far from this , the beauty and energy of poetry are instantly lost , when the stress of voice is made equal on each accented syllable . The accent of the music and that of the words to which it is set , are adapted to each other , and of course there is no difficulty in preserving that of both , and at the same time paying a due regard to the spirit of the words . It is rare that an unaccented syllable or unemphatic word occurs on the strong part of the measure , and vice versa ; but if a case occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of either , by arbicr*tting , as it were , between the contending parties ; observing in all cases however to preserve the entire meaning of the words . ' Excellence of tone , intonation , time , articulation , accent , and emphasis , necessary as they are to good singing , do not of themselves produce it . The body may be well formed , perfect and beautiful in its organization , and yet be destitute of life and animation . ' Expression is the soul of music . All other good qualities form , as it were , the material habitation which is to contain this etherial substance , and exhibit its powers . On this subject Mr Hastings remarks as follows ; If it be here demanded of us to give an adequate description of the nature of expression , we frankly acknowledge ourselves unequal to the task . Were we to mention boldn *ss of tone in spirited narration , mildness of tone in invitation , were we to indicate the pathetic accent by a gradual swell and diminish , that of pride , boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt termination of a tone-were we to allude to the loudness or softness , slowness or rapidity , vigor or delicacy of a movement ; or could we tell in what cases the sounds of any movement should he sustained , according to their nominal value , or when they should be uttered in the style of Staccato , we should thus furnish the singer of sensibility , perhaps with some facilities for acquiring expression ; but we should do no more towards describing the thing itself , than if we had said nothing respecting it . Nor can any written instructions be relied on as infallible guides to the artist ; fur every one will readily perceive that such qualities as we have above enumerated , must be perpetually varying9 according to circumstances , and like the emotions they are required to excite , theymay exist in degrees that are infinitely various and indescribable . ' p. 46 . To these just remarks we will barely add , that the foundation of expression in singing , as well as in reading or speaking , must be laid in a vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought must be appreciated , as if It were the production of his own mind-every feeling adopted as his own . If he wishes his music to warm the hearts of his auditors , it must acquire its heat in his own . The remarks of Mr H. on the graces , a proper selection of pieces with reference to the occasion and the union of vocal and instrumental music , are equally pertinent with those on expression . He then examines the various arguments for having the singing in religious worship conducted by the congregation at large , by a select choir alone , or by both united . The ob*. ject of music , as a part of religious worship , is to excite a peculiarity and uniformity of feeling among the audience  --  to bring their minds into a fit tone for the ready apprehension and reception of the ideas presented in the discourse or psalm  --  to abstract the mind of the hearer from the thousand fantasies that sometimes intrude themselves and call off the attention-to bring home from its wanderings , the mind unsettled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , to unite in the address to the throne of mercy . But of these important ends a large part of our assemblies seem to have not the least notion . They consider the singing rather as a sort of dropscene between the acts of worship , which has nothing to do with the general subject ; but is presented barely for their amusement and relaxation till the other exercises can be re* // sumed . The only way to correct these erroneous notions is to have music produce its legitimate effects , and to do this , we unhesitatingly say with Mr IL . it must be confined principally at least to a choir . Granting that purity of tone , accuracy of intonation and pronunciation can prevail , where those who sing are scattered through a whole congregation-which , however , so long as the unlearned and self-conceited can unite their voices with the rest , secure in a great measure from detection , we believe impossible-there can be no expressson . This requires a unity of feeling and action , which in such circumstances , is wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an army , or their efforts will not be united , and of course ineffectual . But the importance of the topics treated in the first part of Mr H's. hook , has led us to dwell on them much longer than we intended , and it is quite time to say something on the latter part , which treats of taste in the composition . Some introductory remarks on the nature and origin of mu* sical ideas , the course of study to ' be pursued by the young composer in respect to them , and the laws of association , which must ever have great influence on the style of composition , are succeeded by a more particular notice of some peculiar artifices in harmony , such as chords , fugue , and imitation . The relations between melody and harmony are then briefly noticed . The rest of the work , except the last chapter , which contains some critical remarks on a few popular pieces , is devoted to design . This subject is treated more in detail than any other in the book , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionate , and it is so in some degree ; though in treating this topic , the author has necessarily intro ... duced many remarks pertaining to the foregoing ones , which naturally find a place here , and will be better apprehended from seeing their application , than if made under their respec. tive heads . There are two constitu*nts of music , the powers of which are entirely independent of each other , though they are usually united , and ever must be , to produce the greatest effects . These are sounds , considered solely in reference to their quality ; and system , or the disposition of sounds , in respect to tsme . Whether a single tone can produce any thing but simple pleasure or disgust in the mind or not , no one can deny that certain chords naturally indnce feelings of a peculiar // character , which will not be excited by chords of a different kind . These feelings are of a very general character , however , nor are they produced instantaneously . The harmony of the A*olian harp , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before it causes any emotion . For a while it is simply agreeable , but as it continues , a serenity like that produced by viewing a beautiful landscape by moon light , begins to steal over the soul , succeeded on the one hand by emotions slightly shaded , and becoming still deeper hid in gloom , and on the other by those of a lighter hue , till they become decidedly of a cheerful cast . The effects prpduced by sound alone seem to be confined within these limits , but to exhilarate the mind and bring its higher powers into action , the aid of rhythm is demanded . This must enter largely into the composition of festive and martial music , nor do we believe that without it those kinds of music can exist in any degree . Nor is rhythm dependent on sound for its power-it may produce its highest effects when the accompanying sound shall have no effect at all , or if any , that of disgust . It is not the guttural monotone of the war-song , but its movement , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast of the Indian , and arouses his slumbering energies . It is not the obtuse sound of the spirit-stirring drum , ' but its strongly marked rhythm , which gives elasticity to the step of the soldier , and produces that recklessness of danger with which he rushes upon the bayonets of his adversaries . Even where the powers of sounds and rhythm are united , it often happens that the latter predominates . It is the measure far more than the qualities of the sounds , which in festive music gives lightness to the heel of the dancer . Here lies the secret of the fascinating power of the music , that for so long a period prevailed in our country . The ear was ever titillated with the rippling of its movement , which , though of inferior quality , was readily felt and understood ; while the feeble harmony which accompanied it , produced no other effect than to soften down in a small degree that of the rhythm , and thus partially to entitle the whole to the name of sacred music , when otherwise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its rhythm was also heightened by its being employed in almost an equal degree in every part of the score . When then foreign compositions , whose merit lay more especially in their chords , were sung in such a defective manner that the power of these // was unfelt , there was little left to interest any one , and particularly those whose taste was less refined . If the composer would produce the highest effect , be must not only know the power of the chords he is to use , and the proper kind of rhythm demanded by his theme ; but be must so adjust them as that both may operate together , and neither attract the attention tion of the auditor to the exclusion of the other . The necessity of a constant regard to this , not only in reference to chords and rhythm but to figure and imitation , is pointed out by our author in a manner equally discriminating and beautiful . The progress of music must ever be slow . Such is the delicate and intangible nature of its elements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a very advanced stage in refinement , before they can be appreciated and defined . The power of rhythm or movement is easily felt , and this is ever the first step in the art . The accompanying of this with a succession of musical intervals is the next , nor is the transition from the former station to the latter a very difficult one ; but this is yet far removed from what can properly be called melody . There must be a relation between the successive intervals ; the ideas must all tend to produce some one feeling , or the composition is not worthy of* that appellation . Without this relation , though the ideas may produce pleasant sensations , they excite no emotion . Like the gay colors and fantastic forms sometimes exhibited by the clouds as the sun is setting , they are beautiful , but they mean nothing . They must be properly combined like the colors , and the light and shade of a historical painting , before they can awaken the imagination and produce any definite emotion in the soul . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where music has not been highly cultivated . In the music of the Chinese , so far as we can judge from the specimens of their compositions which we have seen , and the accounts of travellers , we find a remarkable instance of this . Here and there will be found two or three ideas somewhat related ; but generally a complete confusion prevails , which is well characterized by the term wildness-an epithet often applied to these irregular airs . It is not uncommon to hear persons express a high admiration of such productions ; but it is indicative of a taste for music much like that , which would prefer the broken and half-formed sentences of a child to those of a Goldsmith , or the incoherent ravings of a maniac to the eloquence of a Demosthenes. // imitation properly means the employment of similar musical ideas in different parts of the same composition . It is sometimes used to denote the representation of particular notions or actions to the hearer ; but for distinctions s sake Mr H. uses for the latter signification the term imitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality belongs to music , and in what kind of composition it is expedient to use it . There is a great proneness in enthusiastic artists to magnify the powers of their art , and scarcely any class of them have run into greater extravagances than musicians . Forgetting that the chief business of music is with general emotions , they have sometimes supposed that there are as many shades of musical painting as there are passions in the human breastthat any notion may be produced in the mind by a proper arrangernent of chords and rhythm ; and even that different sounds naturally excite the idea of particular colors , and of course , that whatever may be exhibited on canvass may also be represented from the orchestra . Yet that music which is made up of sound and movement , can present an idea of that which has nothing to do with either , is a supposition which , we own , appears to us absurd , and we must remain skeptics on this point , till we actually experience such effects . That certain notions having no reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifices of the composer , is doubtless true ; yet these associations are wholly factitious , and the effects produced by them can not with propriety be attributed to the imitative nature of the composition . Aremark of our author on another topic applies with equal justice to this . The composer may produce a long succession of scientific discords that are pleasing to his own ear , and call it , if he chooses , an earthquake , a whirlwind , or the representation of chaos ; but after a gaping auditory have submitted to listen with blind approbation for a few successive performancos , their feelings , in spite of all their veneration for a celebrated author , will revolt at that , which has to them all the appearance of unmeaning jargon . While the composer , the theorist , and the amateur are receiving their several degrees of enjoyment , the ordinary listener almost feels tempted to prefer the real convulsions of nature to the sounds that are designed to imitate them . ' A real representation , however , would be as easily appreciated by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been // a frequenter of the opera all his days . A composer might , by involved harmony and abrupt modulation , pretend to imitate the intricate reasoning and unexpected relations of a mathematical argument ; by a full cadence he might signify the general theorem to which the argument leads , and call this if he pleased Euclid 47. 1 . and we might be amused by it and say that it was very well done ; but what would there be imitative in it ? And were it not for its name , who would be led by it to think of that proposition or any other ? Yet the representations of battles , hurricanes , shipwrecks , and the like , which have been so frequently attempted , are very little better , if indeed any at all . Many things can doubtless be easily and precisely imitated in music ; but to imitate is not its aim , and whenever this is attempted , the effect can rarely be otherwise than ridiculous . It is easy to see then where this quality may be exhibited . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Since then the imitative is so liable to degenerate into burlesque , it seems proper to assign the most pa*pable of its mimetic traits to a department , where alone they can find their natural element . Such traits have always appeared to us to have their true place in the comic-opera , the catch , and the facetious glee . ' p. 179 . Violations of good taste in this respect are to be found in the works of the most distinguished composers . Even the genius of Handel would sometimes check its sublime flight to play around a feather , which came in its way . An instance is to be found in that passage of the Messiah , beginning , Thus saith the Lord , the Lord of Hosts , ' yet once a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth . ' The sublimity of this terrific declaration is wholly destroyed by a ridiculous pun upon the word shake , which is repeated several times on a chain of musical shakes , as if the quavering of the voice could represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like error in the last strain of his Denmark , a tune , the general merit of which we readily acknowledge . Regardless of the sentiment of the last line , when rolling years shall cease to move , ' he attempted the imitative on the word rolling , and what is the effect ? Instead of expanding the soul , and bringing before the imagination the mighty spheres of heaven- ' orh above orb ascending without end ' - arid darting the glance of thought onward to the time when their majestic motion shall cease , and their order be changed to confusion , we are reminded of the trundling of a hoop or the insignificant revolutions of a football // In composing music for particular words there is a kind of adaptation , which is often within the composer 's reach , and which in the most grave compositions often adds greatly to the effect . It is well known that in speaking , the tone of voice is often varied according to the emphasis and various relations of the different parts of the sentence . From the rapidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely noticed ; yet they are in reality , as easy to be appreciated as those made in singing . In setting music to words which need to he sung with tolerable rapidity , the musician , by employing those intervals , which would be used in speaking the same words , can increase the effect to an astonishing degree ; and this will be still more heightened , if the pauses between the words and their relative quantity be regarded . A remarkable example of this may be found in the Messiah . If the chorus He trusted in God ' be sung with rapidity and then the same words be read with a proper regard to the sense of the passage , the coincidence of the intervals and pauses employed by the singer and reader , will surprise one who never noticed it before . This passage is mentioned by Mr H. as an instance of the imitative ; but so long as the ideas are not imitated , but only the intervals used in pronouncing them , it seems hardly proper to bring this instance into that class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentence of analogous structure , though the sentiment of the two might possess not the least resemblance . If the ground of the composer is narrowed by passing from the lighter kinds of secular music to those of a graver cast and to the anthem , it is much more so when he composes the plain psalm-tune . Here he is not allowed to use the imitative at all , while fugue and imitation , repetition , and other artifices which can be resorted to in set composition , are very rarely admissible . His sole aim must be to produce a succession of ideas so related as to tend to the production of some general emotion . The execution of such music is far more difficult than that of the kinds above mentioned . We do not mean by execution barely singing in tune ; hut singing so as to produce the best effect . In set music , most is done by the composerhere almost all is left for the singer . In the former kind , a a good degree of expression is unavoidable if the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally left to the taste and abilities of the performer . It might seem desirable at first view to have set music generally prevalent , instead of leaving // the selection of tunes and their adaptation to whatever psalm may be proposed , to the judgment of the chorister , who can not be supposed always well qualified for this task . Yet , though we acknowledge that in general the highest effects are produced by music composed specially for the words , there are many of our psalm tunes which we should be sorry to have sink into oblivion . A large proportion of them are doubtless more or less inaccurate , but it must be owned that some of them are compositions of the first stamp , and we are ready to say with the poet of Ayrshire , compared with these , Italian trills are tame . ' Independent too of their intrinsic worth , many of them are associated with the names of the great and good of former years , and of every christian land . They have swelled the hearts and borne to heaven the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hope and believe that some of them will remain and their power be felt and acknowledged till the end of time . We had intended to add a few remarks on the subjects of the last chapter of the work before us ; but this article has already grown beyond what we anticipated , when we began it , and we must take our leave of Mr H. with wishing that his book may produce all the good effects on society , at which it aims . We have been gratified with its perusal , and while we have found much to praise , we have seen little that is exceptionable . We wish that the first part of his work had been treated more copiously . Its topics are of more consequence to the community than those of the last , in the same degree that the number of those who direct in the execution of music exceeds that of those who compose it . The first part may be considered as a text book , with which every instructer should be perfectly familiar and every sentence of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be readily seen too from a perusal of what treats of composition , that Mr H. considers it no easy task to write good music , and that the composer must be a person of no ordinary attainments . The manner in which Mr H. has treated the subject deserves special commendation . There are many obvious difficulties in writing a work of this sort , which may be fitted for general circulation ; but Mr H. has surmounted these obstacles with singular felicity ; and the theoretic musician , the uninstructed singer , and the man of taste , who can not sing at all , may read and understand almost the whole of it , and receive both pleasure and benefit from its perusal .
