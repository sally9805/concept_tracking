txt ART . VIII. -1 . . qn Oration pronounced at Cambridge , before the Phi Beta Kappa Society , . /Iugust 27 , 1824 . By EDWARD EVERETT . Published by Request . Svo. pp. 67 . Boston . 2. * Oration delivered at Plymouth , December 22 , 1824 . By EDWARD EVERETT . Boston . 8vo. pp. 73 . Cummings , Hilliard and Co . As the occasion on which the first of these orations was pronounced , in presence of the Nation 's Guest , and before an assemblage of eminent persons from all parts of the Union , was one of rare occurrence and deep interest , so the subject // chosen by the orator was well calculated to suit the dignity of the occasion , and to command the attention of his hearers and of the public . This subject was , The peculiar motives to intellectual exertion in America . ' A topic so comprehen .. sive , and touching so closely the political condition , the institutions , and prospects of our country , could hardly fail to open a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plausible conjecture , and eloquent illustration . The author 's method , and the ability and success with which he has accomplished the task he set himself , will appear as we proceed . Hnme long ago attempted to demonstrate , that it was not possible for the arts and sciences , or those acquisitions , which constitute the refinement of intellect and manners , to take their rise under any other than a free government . He lays it down as an axiom , that in a community there must be laws before the desire of knowledge ; for laws give security , this prompts to curiosity , and hence inquiry , which is the prelude to knowledge . An absolute despotism is in its nature without laws ; the will of the sovereign is supreme , and as no rules exist from which the people can anticipate the mode , in which his judgment or caprice will induce him to decide and act , it follows that no sense of security , no settled confidence in the governing power remains . The case will not be altered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided . The head may delegate a portion of his authority to subordinate governors , but each of these , having no laws to guide him , will be a despot , and the security of the people will be in the same state of jeopardy , as if there were no such division of power . The moment you establish laws , you weaken the despotism , and give the people some influence in their own government . These laws will be binding on the rulers and the ruled , forming a known system , and thus far giving security . If they are oppressive , the people can take measures to lighten the burden , by making it expedient for the governing power to adopt modifications and improvements . Such was the process in Rome , when the authority of the consuls was absolute , and they decided all causes without any other statutes than their own opinions . The people grew impatient , the decemvirs were chosen , and the laws of the twelve tables pro .. // mulgated , which became gradually enlarged and formed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially free . It is , moreover , impossible for the arts and sciences to take root in a despotism , because , till they have gained some degree of ascendency , the monarch himself must be unenlightened , and ignorant of the modes of establishing forms of government suited to embrace the complicated operation of laws , and the machinery necessary for preserv* ing a balance among the various subordinate departinemits . Now , whether this argument of Hume may not be a little too specious , to be set down as a practical axiom in politics , we shall not decide . The theory appears sufficiently sound , and is probably borne out by facts as far as history records them ; but when we go hack so remotely into the ages that have been , and search for the origin of governments , and the first dawnings of the arts and sciences , we grope in a darkness too profound to enable us to fortify our discoveries by any substantial historical testimony . As all governments must have originated in the consent of the people , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law , or so despotic as not to afford security enough to give the mind leisure to become enamored of knowledge , and freedom to pursue it within certain limits* Nom ' could there have been occasion forcibly to narrow these limits ; the progress of acquirement must have been gradual , and rarely so rapid as to alarm the jealousy of despotism . Hence knowledge and laws sprang up together , and the question , as to which took the lead in the primitive forms of government , if it be not idle to ask it , will hardly be answered with the present imperfect light , which the world has on the subject . Nor indeed is it of much consequence now , at what time , or under what kind of government , the human mind began first to put forth its strength . In the present state of political advancement , it is mainly important to know the tendency of different forms , as it has been tested by experiment , and is now developing itself in the various systems , old and new , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , and if future legislators shall have the wisdom to remedy the errors , which , aided by the experience of the past and the enlightened influence of the age , they have the // sagacity to detect , we may safely conclude , that the development of wise political principles , and all the means for attaining the desirable ends of government , will advance with as sure and quick a step , as the discoveries in physical and moral nature , or improvements in the arts and sciences . But this state of things necessarily supposes freedom , the same freedom to investigate the laws , by which men are held together in society , as those which regulate the heavenly orbs in their motions , or the affinities of simple or compound bodies . If the mathematician may carry his analysis beyond the depths of former knowledge , and discover new theorems to clear up the mysteries of the planetary motions , if the chemist may bring new minerals and gases to light , and place them among the elements of his science , let the statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government and the principles of human action , and where he makes a discovery , let it be established as a new point gained . The boundaries of philosophy and reason , of enterprise and intelligence , will thus be enlarged , and these will work together in demolishing the harriers to political improvement , reared by the ignorance of former ages , and too long upheld by superstition , interest , and the tyranny of custom . The history of the last half century has clearly shown the tendency of opiiiion on this subject . Where an opportunity has occurred for changing old forms , or establishing new ones , free institutions have been the basis on which men have struggled to build up their political fortunes . The business of making kings , creating nobles , and bowing before crowned heads , has no longer any favor in the eyes of those , who are seeking to organise such a system of government , as will secure their political rights and social happiness . And the experiment of free institutions has been tried with so much success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout this whole western continent , that it would already be an idle dream to anticipate the day , when a retrograde movement shall begin , or when the progress of intelligence , liberty , and just political principles , will not be as sure and constant , as that of time itself . To investigate the influence , which these free institutions are likely to have on the condition of the millions and millions of human beings , // destined to be brought under their control , is an employment of the most interesting nature . Professor Everett pursues the inquiry with particular relation to our own country , but his discussion admits of a gener 1 application , and may be considered as having a bearing not less strong on all free governments . To a citizen of the United States it is in the highest de gree amusing , to observe the speculations into which our brethren , on the other side of the water , allow themselves to be drawn , when they touch on the politics of America . Sixteen years only have passed away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affairs , lamented , in terms truly bewailing , the self destroying tendency of what they were pleased to consider our ill contrived and disjointed political fabric , and ventured most lugubrious predictions of its premature dissolution . They were constrained to call it an absurdity , ' and , bemoaning its inherent aptness to dismemberment and ruin , ' they , in a v cry solemn manner , advised the American reformers , to think of gradually dissolving their state governments , and really incorporating themselves into one people , and one name . ' In time of peace they thought it might be possible to keep the government together , but war they assured us would give a tremendous shock , ' and the whole frame of the constitution would be in danger of falling to pieces . ' A pitiable prospect truly ! And how have these ominous predictions been verified ? We have gone on gathering strength every day , new states have been taken into the Union , our numbers have increased with a rapidity unexampled , and the most sanguine patriot of the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , could never have anticipated a success so decided , or a prosperity so unchecked , as this whole nation has enjoyed up to the present moment . We have had a war , under circumstances of high party excitement and peculiar disadvantages , but no shock has been felt , nor have the pillars of government been moved in the slightest degree . So far from shaking the frame of the constitution , this war contributed , more than anything else has done , to test its stability , and consolidate its parts ; the public mind was brought to act in a common cause ; a national feeling was kindled , and local partialities were swallowed up in the greater interests // April , of the whole . The burden of expense was cheerfully borne ; and , in short , the entire history of the government of the United States has proved the apprehensions of its ill informed friends abroad , and the eager prophecies of its enemies , to have been equally without Ibundation . The Edinburgh Reviewers have always been unlucky prophets ; the Cumnean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first years of their labors ; they brought not only Great Britain , but Bonaparte and all Europe , within the field of their vision ; they cast broad horoscopes for detecting the secret destinies that awaited the nations , and revealed their discoveries with due condescension and soleninity . It is no wonder , therefore , that sixteen years ago these political seers should turn the eye of foresight on America , and be as much deceived as in cases of greater moment nearer home . They have at length closed their book of oracles , and begin to search for knowledge like the rest of the world , in the lessons of experience , the wisdom of caution , and the plain facts of history . But what shall we say of the present Poet Laureate of England ? He continues to dream ( Ireams and see sights , to indite ominous presages , and scatter his portentous forebodings about America , with as much pertinacity as ever , and with as much apparent ignorance of the principles of our government , and the organisation of our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacious politician suggested several Important changes in our constitution , without which he is convinced the whole system of American republics must come to a speedy end , and the people be left in a deplorable state of mental and moral degradation . And what do our readers imagine these reforms to be , which are to save our republican institutions from perils so threatening * No other , indeed , than a gradation of ranks , hereditary titles and wealth , and a church establishment ! These are the salutary appendages , that M* Southey in his wisdom recommends , as the necessary safeguards to our liberty , rights , morals , and religion , which he says are fast decaying , and fears will soon be extinct . His modesty , it may be presumed , prevented his adding one thing more as requisite to the good government , virtue , and happiness of these United States , and that *s , a Poet Laureate. // But it is time for us to return to Mr Everett 's Oration . The first motive to peculiar intellectual exertion , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of civil society , which has here been devised and established . ' This view of the subject is of great importance , and exhibits the United States under circumstances totally different from those , which have prevailed in any other age or country . Society here stands on a basis , and wears forms wholly new , and , as a matter of course , results of some sort are to be expected , such as have not been produced by former experiments . In ancient and modern history there is no example , before our 0wn , of a purely elective and representative system . It is therefore , on an entirely novel plan , that , in this country , the whole direction and influence of affairs ; all the trusts and honors of society ; the power of making , abrogating , and ad ministering the laws ; the whole civil authority and sway , from the highest post in the government to the smallest village trust , are put directly into the market of merit . Whatsoever efficacy there is in high station and exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by awakening the emulation of the aspirants ? or exciting the efforts of the incumbents , is here directly exerted on the largest mass of men , with the smallest possible deductions . Nothing is bestowed on the chance of birth , nothing depends on proximity to the fountain of honor , nothing is to be acquiied by espousing hereditary family interests ; but whatev*r is desired must be sought in the way of a broacb fair , personal competition . It requires little argument to show , that such a system must most widely and most powerfully have the effect of appealing to whatever of energy the land contains ; of searching out , with magnetic instinct , in the remotest quarters , the latent ability of its children . ' pp. 12 , 13 . Another and a powerful motive for mental action in our poli .. tical system , at which Professor Everett has but slightly hinted , is that , growing out of the peculiar nature of our confederacy . This is as completely novel , as any other feature in the system . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great nation , and at the same time forming distinct governments among themselves , each of which enjoys the rights and privileges of sovereignty , Within certain defined limits . Our transatlantic critics call this a wheel within a wheel ; so it is , but every movement is regular , harmonious , and uniform , without clashing or jarring . A confederacy like this has never before existed . The Grecian // republics were bound together as states , but not as constituting one people , not as forming a union in which every inhabitant of the several states had an equal interest . The Amphictyonic league was composed of two representatives from each city ; hence the people were not represented in any due proportion ; and it would seem to have been the chief business of the Amphictyons to sul ) erintend the religious concerns of Delphi , to provide for mutual resistance of a common enemy , and to settle such differences as arose between states . The confederacy of the Netherlands was still more defective in its organisation , although it embraced a wider sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towns had elective governments of their own . Each might send as many representatives to the States General , as it chose , but when assembled they could collectively have only one vote in that body . The resolutions of the States General in many cases could not he carried into effect , till approved by the provincial legislatures , and even here a unanimous vote was sometimes required . The authority of the Stadtholder , or president , was greater than that possessed by the heads of some monarchies . The principles of the Helvetic confederacy are not less comnplicated and imperfect . To the peculiar nature of our confederacy , therefore , we may look for the action of new motives on the mind and character . As several small states , united by the bond of common interest , afford a barrier to the encroachment of power , so in like manner they present facilities for tle progress of intellect . Such a union effectually breaks down the despotism of authority , which in all monarchical governments has assumed a pernicious sway over the mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , which have kept whole nations in a state of intellectual servitude for many ages . History exhibits curious examples of the influence of authority over a nation , founded in the opinions of a sovereign ; and every one knows , that the tone of public sentiment , and too often of public morals , has been fixed by the fashion of a court . A remarkable instance now occurs to us in the case of witchcraft , in the reign of James the First . This prince early imbibed the notion of the agency of evil spirits , in controlling human affairs , and , before he came to // England , he had written his dialogues on Demonologie , in the Scottish dialect , and explained at large the practices of these spirits , and the manner in which they made compacts with witches . He also laid down rules for detecting witches , and urged the justice of their being punished . Soon after James was made king , his book was republished , and landed by all , as Di Johnson said , who desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nothing was so fashionable as to believe in witchcraft , and admire the king 's great wisdom and depth of knowledge in discovering such wonders of the invisible world . Evil spirits were seen daily , witches multiplied , and the contagion spread to the parliament , by which , in the first year of James 's reign , a law was passed against the invocation of spirits , sorceries , charms , enchantments , and the punishment of death was denounced on all witches , who should be guilty of these practices . The law , it is well known , was frequently and for many years , put in execution . It was in the genuine spirit of the times , that Shakspeare brought his witches on the stage . And we doubt not , that all the ahsurdities and cruelties growing out of the delusions about witchcraft , both in Great Britain and New England , had their origin mainly in the diseased imagination of this Scottish prince , whose luck it was afterwards to be a king , and to become an object of servile flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of separate governments in small states to resist authority , and secure freedom of thought , this system contributes in the most direct manner to add incitements to emulation . A proof of this is seen in the ancient Grecian states ; a spirit of rivalry sprang up among them , which brought out great minds to act with uncommon vigor for the honor of their native city , or province , and which was exceedingly favorable to the growth of the arts and sciences ; whereas in China , a country of immense extent , and inhabited by a people not less shrewd and sagacious than the Greeks , but ruled by an absolute monarch , scarcely a step has been taken in any branch of intellectual culture , from the beginning of its history down to the present hour . As the dominion of authority has been long and stern , popular opinion has run in the same smooth and undisturbed channel for thousands of years . // The motives to emulation , and the influence of example , are peculiarly strong in small states , united on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the prerogatives of liberty and independence . The wise laws adopted by one state will soon be understood and received by its neighbors , and thus the whole will profit by the deliberations and experience of each . The spirit of enterprise and improvement , which shall be kindled in one body of legislators , will extend to others . This has already become as true in practice as theory , and we are continually witnessing the influence of one state on another in promoting a modification and judicious revision of the laws , forming courts of justice on the best models , raising up and supporting benevolent and literary institutions , providing for the relief of the poor and the comfort of the afflicted , and in giving encouragement to all the arts of life and means of intercourse , which answer , to their fullest extent , the designs of the social compact . Here is abundance of motives to intellectual exertion , and no forms of government have ever been so well calculated as our own , to make them operative and successful . Acrain the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conspiring to produce the same effect . The powers of the national government reach to all our relations with foreign countries , to the formation of treaties , the regulation of commerce in all its branches , and whatever else may be considered as touching the mutual interests of great and distinct nations . These powers also embrace our internal concerns , so far as to provide for national defence , thesupport of the national government , the execution of the laws of the Union , and an equitable commercial intercourse between the several states . Hence the state legislatures are relieved from the weightiest burdens of government , and left to give all their attention to the domestic and immediate interests of the people , whom they represent ; and here their powers are plenary . Each state , for instance , may pass such laws , impose such taxes , and establish such regulations as it pleases , for the encouragement of education ; it can build up seminaries of learning of the higher order , endow colleges , institute primary schools in every neighborhood , reward discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful // efforts in any literary enterprise . From the very first settleInent of America , ' says Mr Everett , to the present day , the most prominent trait of our character has been to cherish and diffuse the means of education . The village schoolhouse , and the village church , are the monuments , which the American people have erected to their freedom ; to read , and write , and think , are the licentious practices , which have characterised our democracy . ' Internal improvements of every sort , also , come under the cognisance of the state legislatures . Within their respective territories they may intersect the whole country with canals , construct roads , build bridges , and grant *orporate powers for all purposes of public utility . The same may be said of the encouragement of industry , agriculture , manufactures , useful inventions , and whatever pertains to the elegant or substantial arts of life . From these brief hints , it is obvious , that the nature of our confederacy supplies new and efficient motives to intellectual exertion , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all its resources to devise and execute the best schemes for every species of improvement , for social happiness , permanent freedom , and a wise government . The author replies very ingeniously to the common objection , that the effect of our institutions is to turn the talents of the country into the track of politics , and draw the sons of genius and ambition from the haunts of the Muses , to seek a more speedy eminence in the contests of the Forum . We accor ( l but partially with his views on this subject . To us nothing seems clearer , than that there must necessarily be a great consumption , and even waste of talents , in carrying on a government organised on strict republican principles , and subdivided into numerous independent states . A distinct body of legislators must be selected from the people in each state , whether large or small , and when you add to these the multitude of persons required to fill the other numerous offices , which the machinery of a separate republic demands , you will find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moving the wheels of government . The question is not , as to the advantages of this system , its superior facilities for diffusing political intelligence , and securing wise laws and a just administration , for on this point there can he no doubt ; // yet the fa5t of its taking up a much larger portion of the mental power of the state to keep it in operation , than in governments established on less liberal principles , will not be denied . Add to this the frequency of elections , and the ever recurring opportunities for successful competition , and add still further the exciting , the almost irresistible motive , which impels aspiring minds into this political course , by reason of the certainty it holds out of a much more rapid advancement , than could possibly be attained in any other way ; take all these circumstances together , and you will have a combination of causes , which act with a strong and constant force , in beguiling the thoughts of the student from the less promising sphere of letters and science , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . Nor are we talking about things in the abstract ; whoever will look abroad , and run over in his mind the cases within his own observation , will at once perceive the harmony between theory and facts . Where are our men of letters ? Some honorable , some illustrious examples there are , but they are like the Oases in the African deserts , standing alone , and scattered at long intervals , amidst the wide wastes of our literature . But politicians meet us at every corner ; they come upon us in clouds and armies , like the locusts over the green fields of Arabia ; every town , every village , every hamlet has its phalanx of politicians ; the annual elections are so many rencounters , in which not only the competitors for office , but multitudes , who would be competitors , and other multitudes , who look impatiently to the day when they may venture such a hope , are warmly engaged . We breathe a political atmosphere , and our intellectual tone and temper must necessarily be affected , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Professor Everett , that there is no ground for ascribing the political tendency of the talent and activity of this country , to any imagined incompatibility of popular institutions with the profound cultivation of letters . ' That is to say , our popular system throws no l ) Ositive obstacles in the way of hard students and great scholars , the devotees of science and enthusiasts in the arts ; it leaves them at liberty to pursue any favorite study , as far as their genius and industry will convey them ; neither the constitution nor the // laws oppose or discourage their progress . All this we grant , and at the same time are prepared to maintain the fact , that the tendency abovementioned exists , and to refer it to very simple and obvious causes in the nature of ' our system itself . We agree , moreover , with the author , that the first efforts of social men are of necessity political , ' and that the administration of the government of a country is the first thing to be provided for . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the talent of a country needs be put in requisition to execute the task of government , or that the balls of learning need be deserted to fill up the halls of legislation . In an enlightened community like ours , there are hundreds of men as well qualified to be governors or legislators , as the actual incumbents of office , and thousands who can make a good law , where there is one that can write a good poem , or a profound course of lectures in any department of literature or science ; and were it not for the current , which is continually hurrying the whole mass into the vortex of politics , this surplusage of talent might be employed to an infinitely greater profit to the country , in cultivating elegant letters , the useful sciences , or any other branches of attainment denominated intellectual , and which have a special tendency to improve the arts of life , and elevate the tone of society . It is a very just remark of Professor Everett , however , and encouraging as it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As our population increases , its employments will multiply , a taste and a demand for the results of literary labors will gradually gain upon us , ambition will find as ready rewards in this sphere as in politics , and the number of persons requisite for bearing up the weight of government will be proportionably smaller . Another topic discussed by the author , in his usually animated and ingenious manner , is the probable effect , that our novel political or , anisation will have in modifying our literature . This is a theme chiefly of speculation , in which no trusty guides are to be found , except as they are supplied by the examples of other ages and countries ; and here the analogy between our condition and theirs is so slight , that nothing solid or satisfactory can be deduced from the parallel . With the unlimited freedom of thought and inquiry , which we enjoy , and the equally unrestrained liberty of promulgaVOL . Xx. - NO. 47. f , 5 // ting and enforcing opinion , no doubt can be entertained , that new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellectual communication devised , and that our literature will gradually assume an aspect and a character peculiar to itseW and bearing the impress of the circumstances under which it shall be developed and matured . But , in the language of Professor Everett , it is impossible to anticipate what garments our native muses will weave for themselves ; ' it is impossible to foretell the infinitely varied action of the mind and imagination on all the materials in the wide compass of nature , when stimulated by motives whose influence has never before been felt , and adapted to new political forms , and new habitudes of social intercourse . No more can be said or foreseen , than that the features of our literature will be strongly marked by these characteristics , but to what degree , or in what manner , time only can reveal . That the best auspices are opening upon us , there is every encouragement to believe . It has been objected to free governments , that they do not afford suitable patronage to learning . In repelling this objection , the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The greatest efforts of human genius have been made , where the nearest approach to free institutions has taken place . There shone not forth one ray of intellectual light , to cheer the long and gloomy ages of the Memphian and Babylonian despots . Not a historian , not an orator , not a poet is heard of in their annals . When you ask , what was achieved by the generations of thinking beings , the millions of men , whose natural genius was as bright as that of the Greeks , nay , who forestalled the Greeks in the first invention of many of the arts , you are told that they built the pyramids of Mempliis* the temples of Thebes , and the tower of Babylon , and carried Sesostris and Ninus upon their shoulders , from the West of Africa to the Indus . Mark the contrast in Greece . With the first emerging of that country into the light of political liberty , the poems of Homer appear . Some centuries of political misrule and literary darkness follow , and then the great constellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy eloquence and the deep philosophy , the impassioned drama and the grave history , were all produced for the entertainment of that fierce democratie ' of Athens . Here then the genial influence of liberty on letters is strongly put to the test . Athens was certainly a free state ; free // to licentiousness , free to madness . The rich were arbitrarily pillaged to defray th. * expenses of the state , the great were banished to appease the envy of their rivals , the wise sacrificed to the fury of the populace . it was a state , in short , where liberty existed with most of the imperfections , which have led men to love and praise despotism . Still , however , it was for this lawless , merciless people , that the most chastised and accomplished literature , which the would has known , wa* produced . rJhe philosophy of Plato was the attraction , which drew to a morning 's walk in the olive gardens of the academy , the young men of this factious city . Those tumultuous assemblies of Athens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to a man , and clamored for the blood of Phocion , required to be addressed , not in time cheap extemporaneous ratit of modern demagogues , but in the elaborate and thrice repeated orations of Demosthenes . No ! the noble atind elegant arts of Greece grew up in no Augustan age , enjoyed neither royal nor imperial patronage . Unknown before in the world , strangers on the Nile , and strangers on the Euphrates , they sprang at once into life in a region not unlike our own New England-iron bound , sterile , and free . The imperial astronomers of Chaldea went up almost to the stars in their observatomies ; but it was a Greek , who first foretold an eclipse , and measured the year . The nations of the East invented the alphabet , but not a line has reached us of profane literature , in any of their languages ; and it is o*ving to the embalming power of Grecian genius , that the invention itself has been transmitted to the world . Time Egyptian architects could erect structures , which after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their uncouth original majesty ; hut it was only on the barren soil of **ttica , that the beautiful columns of the Parthenon and the Theseum could rest , which are standing also . With the decline of liberty in Greece , began the decline of all her letters and all her arts ; though her tumultuous democracies were succeeded by liberal and accomplished princes . Compare the literature of the Alexandrian with that of the Periclean age ; how cold , pedantic , and imitative ! Compare , I will not say , the axes , the eggs , the altars , and the other frigid devices of the pensioned wits in the museum at Alexandria , but compare their best spirits with those of independent Greece ; Callimachus with Pindar , Lycophron with Sophocles , Aristophanes of Byzantium with Aristotle , and Apollonius the Rhodian with Homer . ' pp. 30-33 . The inferences to be deduced from these statements , do not seem to us well sustained ; the rhetoric is much more flowing and beautiful , than the logic is convincing . Whatever the argtmment may prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ; that is , supposing it to appear fron4 // this examination , that free institutions have been remarkable for quickening the growth of intellect , the contrary does not appear , that less liberal governments have failed to do the same . Take the position for granted , which we shall be the last to deny , that republics hold out infinitely higher motives to intellectual exertion , than any other system , yet our faith in this doctrine can he but little strengthened by the exaruples either of the old or modern democracies . What was the literature of Rome in her republican days ? Where are the orators , poets , philosophers , historians , of the Swiss cantons , of Venice , of Genoa , of the United Provinces , and of other modern republics ? A few native names adorn these countries , it is not denied , hut they are hardly distinguished amidst the brighter blaze , which has burst forth from time to time in the surrounding monarchical governments . The master spirits , that have taken the reins of the world into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment with a dominion scarcely less than despotic , have all risen up in monarchies , and never breathed the air of genuine liberty . When we run back to the remote antiquity of the Chaldeans and Babylonians , we are launched on an ocean , which has no bounds . In that infancy of the human mind , we know not what was accomplished ; the records of those times , if any existed , are swept away , and buried in the common wreck of human things . That the literature of a nation , before a written language was known , should disappear in the same gulf of oblivion , that swallowed up the nation itself , is not surprising . Tradition tells much of the intellectual progress of the Chaldeans , and the name of Zoroaster has descended to this day with a renown . that attaches to few of any age or country . The book of Job , that brilliant display of intellectual power , and of a lofty imagination , was written in the East before the age of Homer . China , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her philosoph*r , and one of the greatest , whom any country has ever produced . The wisdom of Confucius is still the guide to the opinions and conduct of millions of human beings , and it is probable that no one mind , which has been lighted up amidst the habitations of men , has sent abroad its influence to so great a number of other minds , as that of the grea*t philosopher of China . // How much have we heard , too , of the mental advanc&amp; ment of the Hindoos , their numerous writings in theology , metaphysics , astronomy , grammar , music , their logicians , mathematicians , and poets . Sir William Jones , the best judge of this subject , that ever lived , speaks with raptures of some of these works , and says , that , in addition to many beautiful specimens of lighter poetry among the Hindoos , their epic is magnificent and sublime in the highest degree . ' The Sanscrit language is represented as susceptible of a polished , elegant , and expressive style of composition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , is it not true , that the East was the fountain of knowledge to the West ? The very laws , that gave a semblance of stability to the Athenian democracies , were gleaned from Egypt , and to Egypt they came from Chaldea and India . The laws of Solon , and the philosophy of Plato , were little else than transcripts of what they had borrowed from the wise men of other coun tries . The Persians and Arabians of later times are allowed , by adequate ju ( lges , to have excelled in a refined and vigorous literature , and the poems of Hafez , Sadi , and Ferdusi are cited , as illustrious examples of beam*tiful and finished compositions . In regard to Homer , it would not he easy to give any other account of the form of government under which he lived , than what is found in his own writings . Nothing is known with any certainty about the republics of Greece , till after the beginning of the Oly/mpiads , in the age of Lycurgus ; and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Orpheus , Hesiod and Homer , flourished under despotic governments . Indeed , this fact seems abundantly established by the whole tenor of Homer 's poems . His description in the Odyssey of the governments of Ph*eacia , where his hero was shipwrecked , and of Ithaca , proves that these islands were ruled by kings , who had a council of nobles . Ulysses was himself a king . The following language of Ulysses to the Grecian forces , in the second book of the Iliad , breathcs a spirit of royalty , with which even our modern despots of the Holy Alliance might well be satisfied . To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway , His are the laws , and him let all obey . ' // It does not appear , that republican institutions had anything to do in forming the mind or taste of Homer ; he might have written as good a poem , though with machinery , incidents , and imagery far different , in Egypt or India , as in the Isles of Greece ; it was the intellect and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostering principles of any form of government , that called into life the gorgeous vision of the iliad . ' It is nearly as difficult , with all the light that history sends out , to obtain a distinct notion of the Athenian government at any particular time , as it is that of the Grecian islands in the age of Homer . Plato called it an aristocracy with the consent of the people ; but it was not unfrequently an aristocracy in defiance of the people ; and then a democracy in defiance of the nobles , or archons ; in other words a kind of half subdued anarchy . What was Athenian liberty in its best estate ? Four hundred thousand slaves , who had no voice whatever in public concerns , and twenty thousand free citizens , constituted the Athenian people . It is idle to talk of freedom , where only one person in twenty can vote , and where nineteen twentieths of the whole population are in servitude . Themistocles endeavored to restore all the Athemans to equal privileges , but his project failed . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their freedom , became so indifferent to the public interests , that they deserted the assemblies , and on a motion of Pericles it was decreed , that each should receive three oboli for his attendance . In short , such a government , or rather such a series of governments , as prevailed at Athens , can not be imagined to have afforded any peculiar inducements to intellectual cultivation , which have not been equally afforded in a thousand other instances , where the results have been totally different . But the fact of the brilliant achievements in learning and the arts , at Athens , is before the eyes of the whole world . This we allow , and we consider it an anomaly in the history of nations and of the human mind . If it were to be ascribed wholly to the influence of political institutions , why should not the same have happened in the other republics of Greece , in Thebes , Corinth , Crete , Argos ? The same advantages , the same language , climate , and features of character were common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Madam de St*el assigns two reasons why the Athenians engaged with so much eagerness in the study of the polite arts ; first , their inherent love of admiration ; and secondly , their contempt of other nations , whom they esteemed barbarians . By the first they were stimulated to great exertions , the spirit of emulation was quickened , the public taste was kept up to the standard of the best productions , and the people were brought gradually to discriminate with judgment , and admire with enthusiasm . By the second , they were induced to cultivate those arts , which raised them above their neighbors , by making them more enlightened , and giving them a rank possessed by no other people . It must be remembered , too , that , when the immense proportion of slaves is taken into the account , the number of competitors was very small , compared with what it would be in a country of general education and intelligence . The objects of comparison were few , each production was scrutinised with minuteness , competition was direct , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to their extreme limits . From these observations , connected with those quoted from Professor Everett , we tvould infer , that the history of past ages furnishes us with very slender grounds for assigning the origin and progress of extraordinary mental culture to any exclusive form of government . Great names have appeared under all forms , and , if we except Greece , the literature and knowledge of nearly the whole world , have been the fruit of monarchies , and sometimes of cheerless , withering despotisms . This is merely a question of history , however , and in no manner militates against the sound doetrine , that republics , well organised and well administered , are the truest encouragers of letters and the arts . Liberty is the life of enterprise ; it is the strongest incitement to vigorous thought and vigorous action ; and it is not to be doubted , that the spirit of liberty added a powerful , an unconquerable impulse to the great minds produced in the republics of Greece . But it did not do all ; the intellect to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellation of astonishing minds , which by the favor of Providence shone upon that country ; the same cluster would have been conspicuous in any other age or region ; perhaps // not in the same degree , but sufficiently so to have made them the wonder of all future time . Let them have come upon this orb , where accident might have thrown them , they would have formed governments for themselves , created a literature , reared monuments of art , and left behind them trophies of genius and skill for the nations to gaze at and revere , to imitate , but never to surpass . We have not room to accompany the author in his remarks on another subject of great interest , to which his attention is rlirected , namely , the probable effect , which will be produced by a community of language on our intellectual exertions and character . He is decidedly of opinion , that it will be favorable , and that it opens prospects on our rising literature never enjoyed by any other nation . instead of that multiplicity of dialect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy are cut off in the old world , a continually expanding realm is opened and opening to the American intellect , in the community of our language , throughout the wide spread settlements of this continent . The enginery of the press will here , for the first time , be brought to bear , with all its mighty power , on the minds and hearts of men , in exchanging intelligence , and circulating opinions , unchecked by diversity of language , over an empire more extensive than the whole of Europe . ' This subject , we apprehend , must be regarded in two aspects ; first , as it concerns those branches of attainment , which may be classed under the denomination of knowledge ; and secondly , as pertaining to the imagination and taste . All facts in science , history , philosophy , expositions of opinion , direct moral and religious precepts , principles of politics and law , everything pro* ) erly called information , will be more widely diffused , more thoroughly inculcated , and better understood through the medium of a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is too plain to need illustration . But in works of the imagination , that description of works , which have been the chief instruments in refining the taste , and raising the tone of moral feeling , in polishing the man .. ners of society , and softening the asperities of the human character , we presume the case is not so clear . Every nation , either from climate , or a thousand other local causes , has many , and frequently striking peculiarities , from which // the habits of thought take their coloring . The images painted by nature on the fancy , and the combinations into which these are wrought by the mind , are extremely different in one country , from those of another ; and to describe these truly and forcibly , there must be modes of expression and forms of language equally varied and peculiar . Hence a diversity of tongues , as well written as spoken , is absolutely necessary for a full development and communication of thought . This is moreover obvious from the difficulty , nay the impossibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meaning of the great works of genius into any other language , than that in which they were originally conceived and written ; and the truth of Madam de St*el 's remark , that the literature of a foreign tongue can not be fully comprehended , is established in the same principles . Why can it not be comprehended ? Either because it contains descriptions of natural scenery and social habitudes , not common where any other language is spoken , or delicate shades of thought , beauty of imagery , and combinations of ideas , of which no other language is susceptible . Now , although it be admitted , that these can not be so clearly understood and deeply ftdt by a foreigner as a native , it will not be denied , nevertheless , that they may be so far understood , as to unfold innumerable beauties , and elicit innumerable thoughts , which can not be derived from any one tongue , whatever may be its copiousness , its versatility , or its strength . In the south of Asia , where nature is alternately clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid deserts , and where the pleasures of life are sought in luxury and indolence , the train of thought and the revelries of the imagination will be totally different from those of the northern regions of Europe , where a cold climate and sterile soil stamp their stern features on the mental and physical constitution of man . What could have been more remote from the conceptions of the bards of Scandinavia , than the soft , voluptuous , and mellifluent strains of Hafez ? Yet they were both true to nature . The songs that were sung in the halls of Odin could never have been chaunted in the groves of Persia ; no one language could be so formed , as to draw out with equal vividness the imagery , or call up the associations , peculiar to both these regions . How could an // Icelandic poet describe the citron groves , the perfumed atmosphere , the bloom of flowers , the mid day heats , and cool evening breezes of Arabia the Happy ? And how can he have a language to express , what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there could have been but one language in the world , and take for this example the Greek . What consequence would have followed ? In the first place had it spread over the earth , the necessity of new names of things in one country not found in others , and of new forms of expression to communicate new combinations of thought , would soon have brought to pass a multiplicity of dialects , that would virtually have become so many distinct languages . Again , let it be granted , that the language would have retained its purity , what effect must it have had on the literature of the world ? This would never have risen above a successful imitation of the first great writers . Who would have attempted another epic in Greek afier the Iliad , or ventured to compose a tragedy after Sophocles and Euripides ? None but secondary minds , ignorant of their own resources , or whose highest ambition would be to imitate what they could never hope to equal . But let the muses be invoked in another tongue , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close a comparison with the original models can not be made , and you behold Virgils , and Dantes , and Miltons , and Shakspeares , eager to seize the harp , which even the great epic bard and the Athenian dramatists had laid down , and strike its chords with notes as bold , and loud , and strong , as they yielded to the hands by which they were first tuned to harmony and power . A similar , or a worse result would ensue , if you assume any other language as the universal one . The brilliant successes of the first in the lists would discourage future efforts ; the field of splendid action would become preoccupied , and the materials for genius to work upon exhausted . Greater obstacles still would be presented , in the incompatibleness of any given language to express the thoughts and delineate the manners of different nations . Who can imagine Shakspeare writing in French , or Cervantes in Italian , or Metastasio in German ? Suppose the scholars of the twelfth century had possessed sufficient influence to carry their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into general use , and make it the vehicle of communication for all future writers ; and let us imagine for one moment the Paradise Lost , Hamlet and Macbeth , Don Quixote , and the Divina Coramedia , clothed in the dialect of the Angelic Doctor , and Duns Scotus . In referring to our own case , it is true , we need not go to this extreme , but the principle holds good in all cases . We have a language as copious and pliable , probably , as any one of the modern languages , and yet it wants the majesty of the Spanish , the vivacity of the French , the sweetness of the Italian , and the varied compounds of the German . Some things it expresses better than any other , and many things not so well . It is the product of a foreign soil , and notwithstanding it is transplanted into a region , where there is no danger , that its native vigor will decay , or beauty be marred , yet it can not in the nature of things supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it were growing up with our growth , and receiving on its very front the deep marks of our national character and peculiarities . The mind of America will never be idle ; its highest powers will have full scope in the ample fields of knowledge here piesented for inquiry , investigation , and discovery , and in witnessing and aiding the progress of free institutions , founded on a basis as firm as the pillars of reason and truth , and under auspices as propitious as the sniiles of heaven . But we do fear , that our literature , the literature of the imagination and the heart , will be cramped by the language , which is prescribed as the measure of its stature and its strength , that it will creep too servilely in the track , which thousands have trod , and be too long a slave to foreign models and foreign caprice . Professor Everett 's recapitulatory remarks , and closing reflections , are uttered in a style of uncommon brilliancy and richness ; they inculcate lofty and animating sentiments , and constitute altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be more free in adorning our pages with extracts from this , as well as from other parts of his performance , were not the whole already familiar to much the larger portion of our readers . We have space left to say but a word on the Oration at Plymouth . In many respects we consider this a more firmished // work than the other , and built on sounder principles ; its political bearings are broad and comprehensive , and for the most part solid , judicious , and practical . The author traces with much felicity of narration , and with strictly philosophical views , the history of the pilgrims , and the impelling causes , which drove them from their native is ! and to the continent , and at length to the bleak and sterile shores of New England . He draws a lively picture of the obstacles they encountered and the hardships they endured , their early labors and gradual success , the stern virtues of their character , and the perils they braved to shake off the chair is of persecution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . The faults common to both these discourses are a too great tendency in the writer to generalise and speculate , and an occasional looseness of style . We grant that in performances of this nature , intended mainly for popular effect at the time of delivering them , great latitude is allowable in both these respects , but still there is a limit , which it is not wise to overleap . We can foretell an eclipse , and predict the return of a comet , but what will be the destiny of a great nation under any form of government , or what direction the human mind will take three centuries hence , are things of which we know very little , and can say very little with exactness . It is easy to speculate and build up beautiful theories on these subjects , because the imagination is left to play its own whimseys , without check or guidance . In the oration at Cambridge are several speculations , which seem to us fanciful , and too far pursued ; several anticipations that we have no hope will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we fear the archetypes will never exist . But after all , these two discourses are a rich acquisition to the stock of American literature ; they are imposing monuments of the author 's genius and learning , and they prove him to have examined , with a scrutinising and philosophical mind , not only the history of past ages , but the spirit of the present , and particularly the structure and principles of our own free institutions .
