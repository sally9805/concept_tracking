Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE BOWER OF CONTENT . from The bower of content ( 1829 ) In a vale far sequester 'd from tumult and noise , Content rear 'd a lonely bower , She fashion 'd it fair as the visions of joys That glow in life 's morning hour , And she said , " the pure fancies and feelings of youth Here are fix 'd by my potent spell , And none but the heart that loves nature and truth In this holy bower may dwell . " Ere she ceased , a proud chariot roll 'd slowly along , Down the narrow and winding road , The rich man hath come from the world 's giddy throng To rest in that lowly abode ; But where fashion and flattery blend not their art , Will Content bless the wealthy and vain ? Will he welcome the calm and commune with his heart ? He hath gone to the world again . Then poverty 's victim came hastily on , Repining had furrowed his face , And he sigh 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must dwell in that lonely place . " But the half-hidden roses attract not his eye , As it roams o'er the fair domain ; O , see !  --  doth not Hope 's meteor flash gild the sky ? He hath gone to the world again . Then slow , with a frown dark as hate on his brow , Sad and solemn the devotee came , Yet he speaks of the love that the heavens could bow , Of the joys that religion may claim  --  Of the vile barren earth  --  of the glories above  --  Of his hope  --  but none echo the strain  --  Men hear not the prayers pour 'd in grotto and grove , He hath gone to the world again . And the bower of Content is all blooming and gay , But the slaves of the world heed it not , They may pause at the threshold , but never will stay To examine the lone , lovely spot , Where the days glide as noiseless as angels draw near The couch where the good repose ; And joy hath no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purified flows . Hark ! a breathing of music is borne on the air , As soft as the south wind 's sigh , When it hastens the summer 's pure dew-drop to bear Where beds of sweet violets lie ; ' T is the song of Content , and at morning and even , Go list to her soothing strain , " Bring a book , and a lyre , and a heart bow 'd to heaven , And the world can not lure thee again . "
