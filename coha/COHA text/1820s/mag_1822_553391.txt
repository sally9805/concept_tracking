txt PARIS CLASSICAL CONCERTS . THE opera in Paris is in its decline . The once famous Italiens , where Tamburini , Rubini , Mario , Pasta , Grisi , and so many other voices of enchantment gave life to the compositions of Bellini , Donizetti , Rossini , was burned to the ground ten years ago , and the tradition of its composers , singers , and audience has perished with it . At the Grand Opera , that funeral monument of the brilliant , music-fancying Second Empire , neither the best artists nor the great works of the present day are to be heard ; the orchestra and chorus are less than second rate ; even the scenery is shabby . The Op*ra Comique has an - able manager , a good company , an excellent chorus , and a small but admirable orchestra ; there new operas are brought out , old ones are revived , and the gems of the national school are given regularly . Two or three times a week , Anber , Boieldieu , M*hul , Gr&amp;ry , and other French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited by its very calling to operas of the lighter sort , and it has no first-rate singers of either sex . The tenors and baritones are unequal to giving even a work like Carmen its due effect . The prime donne last winter were Mademoiselle Van Zandt and Mademoiselle Nevada , young girls with charming voices and more or less talent ; not artists in any sense of the term , although with study and experience they might become so . They are treated as stars , ' too ; the curiosity felt by idlers of pleasure and seekers for novelty about a new vocalist and a new , or newly revived , opera being turned to account by the manager to draw large houses on the nights when she sings , while the threadbare stock voices are left for Les Diamans de la Couronne , Le Pr* aux Clercs , and other native productions , to which the middle-class Parisian public is fondly constant . Whether at the Grand Op44ra or the Comique , anybody who remembers what they both were fifteen years ago will be struck // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talent and training , on the French lyric stage . To compensate for this grievous loss , a system of concerts has gradually come into existence , which , by their excellence and steadily increasing popularity , are working a revolution in musical taste . They can not take the place of the opera as a resort for amusement , or as a form of social intercourse , but they open a far wider field of enjoyment , and one more fruitful of true delight , to the serious amateur . The mundane element is entirely absent ; there is nothing in those silent assemblages of men and women in street clothes , packed into a dirty , stuffy theatre of a winter afternoon , to recall or replace the aspect of the auditorium of the Italiens or Grand Op*ra in former days . The boxes , occupied by langui ( l ladies in full dress , with bouquets , fans , and opera-glasses , and gentlemen in evening toilet , with a capejasmine at the button-hole ; the visits from box to box ; the general conversation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a favorite singer or famous air held the lively tongues in suspense ; the notorious interest of some well-known spectator - sometimes a great personage , sometimes a fair lady-in certain persons on the boards , which lent excitement to their exits and entrances ; the presence of the court ; the arrivals and departures of birds of fashion , alighting between a dinner party and a ball to hear those other birds warble a cavatina or afinale ; the curiosity and partisanship at the first performance of a new work , or the appearance of a new artist ; the indefinable emotions which a combination of lyric and dramatic art only can produce ; above all , the sense that the hearers belonged to the same world , that the opera house was in fact a vast drawing-room , creating a tacit accord and understanding throughout the audience , - these things are wanting at the weekly concerts of to-day . I will try and describe what there is to be had instead . The concert is nearly as old a form of musical entertainment in Paris as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side . The progress of their development belongs to the history of music , and would be out of place in an article which deals exclusively with the concert societies of the present period . The first of these organizations , both as regards age and excellence , is the Soci6t6 des Concerts , which gives the concerts commonly known as those of the Conservatoire . It has been in existence for upwards of fifty years , and reckons among its members , living and dead , many celebrated musicians . It rose from the grave of the sacred concerts , which were created in the reign of Louis XVI. , and expired under the Restoration , - a resurrection which took place on St. Cecilia 's day , November , 1826 , under interesting circumstances . Habeneck , the leader of the orchestra of the Conservatoire , or government school of music and declamation , asked his friends to breakfast with him on the festival of the patron saint of harmony , and to bring their instruments . He set them down first to play Beethoven 's Heroic Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until late in the short autumn afternoon , when Madame Habeneck entered , and adjured them , in the name of Beethoven , to come to dinner . This meeting gave rise to others , for the sake of practicing ; but there was no regular place of assemblage until Habeneck persuaded Cherubini , the composer , then director of the Conservatoire , to obtain leave from the ministry for a few concerts to be given in the music hall of the Conservatoire . The leader and his associates agreed to supply from their scanty purses the means of advertising , heating , and lighting the hall . M. de la Rochefoucauld , the proper authority , not only gave the desired permission , but passed a decree // that the graduates of the Conservatoire should give six concerts annually , and appropriated two thousand francs from the budget to defray the original outlay . The first concert was given on the 9th of March , 1828 . The programme consisted of the Heroic Symphony ; a duet for soprano and contralto from Rossini 's opera of S*miramide ; a solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and executed by Meifred ; an air for soprano , by Rossini ; a concerto for the violin , by Rode , a prolific composer ; a chorus from the opera of Blanche de Provence , by Cherubini ; the overture to his opera of the Abencerrages ; and the Kyrie and Gloria from his Coronation Mass . The auditorium was crowded , and so it has been from that day forth at every concert of the society . If Cherubini had more than his share of the first programme , the second was composed entirely of Beethoven 's music , the concert being to his memory ; the fourth was dedicated to Mozart , and the first of the second season to Haydn . A review of the programmes of those earliest years of the society 's existence , as well as of its concerts last winter , shows extraordinary impartiality within certain limits . Beethoven always has the first place , other classical composers receive the second honors ; modern standard musicians are more sparingly admitted , and I believe that it is a fixed practice , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not received the stamp of public approbation . The decision as to the acceptance of a new composition rests with a jury of twelve , chosen by lot from and by the members of the society , who have already heard it iii private . There are a good many formalities prescribed by the regulations of the association , but the main difficulty lies in obtaining a first hearing . The society , to which none but a French citizen and a pupil of the Conservatoire can belong , is no doubt the highest tribunal of musical criticism extant ; and it is due to its severe requirements that its concerts have been maintained at the height of perfection for which they have long been proverbial . This wholesome conservatism , however , bore hard upon youthful composers . A young man , who had suffered from it himself , and been forced into other occupations for want of an opening in the direction of his tastes and desires , on finding himself , later , in a position to follow his natural bent , devoted the remainder of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music of unknown authors should be performed as well as that of acknowledged masters . This was M. Jules Pasdeloup , the father of the select popular concert . The orchestra which seconded him in his courageous and generous enterprise was formed by him of undergraduates of the Conservatoire , but not to the exclusion of others . The programmes at first consisted chiefly of Beethoven , Mozart , Haydn ; Weber and Mendelssohn were heard oftener than at the Conservatoire , and the names of rising young composers , like Gounod , Leftibure-Wily ( so well known to American young ladies a quarter of a century ago by his Cloches du Monast*re , and long organist at the church of the Madeleine in Paris ) , and St. Saii*ns , found a place beside those of the great dead . M. Pasdeloup 's energy and enthusiasm stimulated him to the most ambitious nndertakings : he introduced Mozart 's Escape from the Seraglio to the Parisians , and , also , if I am not mistaken , Meyerbeer 's Struensee , besides many of Schumann 's compositions . His concerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given were crowded by eager listeners , but for ten years after their foundation they did little more than pay their expenses . At length M. Pasdeloup , moved by the twofold and almost incompatible desire to bring the best music within the reach of poorer // hearers and to increase the receipts of his faithful orchestra and chorus , took the bold step of hiring an immense building with five thousand seats , and putting down the prices to the lowest possible rates : the charge for the best places was about a dollar and a quarter ; the next , which are really full as good , rather less than a dollar ; and so on through several grades to the third gallery at twenty cents ! Here weekly , during six months , the masterpieces of the old and new schools of music have been given for the last twenty years ; the disinterested man who directs the concerts finding his reward in sharing his pleasure with thousands of listeners , in educating and raising the taste of his countrymen , and in directing their attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a composer himself , and he has sacrificed his personal aspirations to this higher purpose . It has given him some fame , but as to fortune , the concerts are not absolutely self - supporting . The French government , always liberal to deserving efforts for the improvement and pleasure of the public , allows twenty thousand francs a year to keep up the Concerts Populaires , as they are called , and to supplement the small gains of the musicians who take part in them . The success of M. Pasdeloup 's enterprise does not stop with his own concerts . Within the last decade two brilliant musical associations have sprung up in emnlation of his : the Association Artistique at the Th6*tre du Chatelet , directed by M. Colonne , and the Soci6t6 des Nouveaux Concerts at the Th*atre du Chhteau d'Eau , by M. Lamoureux , formerly leader of the Grand Opt*ra . At both these places there are weekly concerts from the middle of the autumn until Easter ; so that for nearly half the year ten or twelve thousand people , of all classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one afternoon in the seven , to be transported into the higher regions of thought , feeling , and enjoyment . This is a priceless gift to have bestowed upon one 's fellow-citizens . There is a marked difference between these various performances , not in quality alone , but in character , those at the Conservatoire holding the first rank . It is difficult to obtain tickets for them , there being but rime hundred seats , every one of which belongs to members or to regular subscribers . The same people retain them for a lifetime , and at their death the privilege passes to their heirs . The same faces may he seen in the same places year after year , until the eager young listeners have become attentive aged ones ; enjoying the music less , understanding it better ; taking it patiently for rest and recreation , perhaps for oblivion , instead of passionately forcing it into relation with their own personal hopes , fears , hate , love , or anguish . When the old , regular occupant of a sent disappears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally a son , nephew , or grandson of the former possessor . The owners of seats can not always attend the performances , and then they offer their tickets to friends , or send them to the office of the society , for the benefit of melomaniacs who are willing to take the various steps necessary for securing them . These consist in sending your name to the secretary of the society on the Thursday before the concert which you wish to attend ,  --  Sunday being the day of the performance , - and in going to the office on Saturday , when you take your place in a file and wait until your name is called , which is done in the order of your application , when you receive one of the returned tickets , if any remain . If there have been too many before you there is still the chance of going on Sunday at the hour of the concert , tickets oftea being sent in at the last moment ; then , by scuffling with others in like plight with yourself , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior // one for eight , - there *s nothing to be had , I believe , at less than five . The great objection to waiting until Sunday is that all the public concerts are given on the same day at the same hour , and at points very remote from each other ; so that if you fail of getting in at the Conservatoire you must miss the first piece on the programme anywhere else and run the risk of losing the concert altogether . After the music begins there is seldom room left except for standing . There are few good places at the Conservatoire : one does not hear very well in the boxes ; in the parquet , all the seats not too near the orchestra are good ; but the centre of the hall is chilly at the opening of the concert and stifling at the end , while in the amphitheatre , which is under the skylight close to the roof , and opposite the chandelier , the temperature must be upwards of ninety degrees Fahrenheit from the first , and the seats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort is forgotten . It is nearly impossible to describe playing the characteristic of which is its perfection . The sovereign charm of the orchestra of the Conservatoire is its finish , and this is produced by a combination of all the qualities which give us pleasure in music , each in a high degree , none falling short of the rest . First comes the primary one of strict precision in time and tune and observance of rhythm and accent ; then follow sonority , brilliancy , delicacy , fineness of modulation , power , perception , expression , - above all , the unanimity which in certain passages sounds like the even respiration of one great being , the breathing of some gigantic incorporation of harmony , in a happy dream . Again and again I have roused myself from the unreflecting enjoyment of merely hearing the music , in order to listen for flaws in the execution , but I never detected a single want or weak point . I am unable to explain the superiority of Richter 's Viennese orchestra , which lifts one higher in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the actual embrace of music as an ambient element , like air or water ; I can only say that it is more glorious than the Conservatoire , - that it has more inspiration . The vocal portions of the concerts of the Conservatoire are not up to the instrumental . The solo singers do not always meet the highest standard ; the chorus is not in as perfect drill as the orchestra , and there are sometimes uncertainty and feebleness in the opening bars . They give the music with great expression and effect , however , and the collective result of each individual 's being a trained singer can not be imagined by people who have heard only choruses composed of men and women singing by ear for the most part , or with a knowledge of music , but not of vocalization . The auditorium of the Conservatoire is unlike that of any other place of musical entertainment in Paris . There is something official and respectable about its dingy , old-fashioned decorations , its Pompeian red walls inscribed with famous names , the aspect and demeanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few women of fashion in the boxes , but the majority of the hearers are men , - men not of elegance , but of distinction . As a rule they are decorated ; the little red ribbon is to be seen on the lapel of almost every coat . They are the leaders of the press and of the literary and artist world , musicians , politicians , physicians , but , except the last , not men of science . It would be easier to count the unknown than the well-known hearers . Their heads and faces are marked by talent . There is great diversity among them : from specimens of the Gallia comata tribe , which still affects shagginess , to close-trimmed , smooth-chinned members of the ministry , or men of letters , who in the fullness of years and honors have put away childish things in the form // of long beards and frowzy hair . They are an audience of connoisseurs : faint , scarcely audible murmurs , a slight catching of the breath , and other sounds of disapprobation , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faltering bar ; their applause is moderate , but prompt and exquisitely discriminating ; they seldom ask for the repetition of a piece of music , and when they do they obtain it more by persistency than by vehemence in clapping and crying " Bis . " The unwritten criticism of these concerts is no unimportant part of the training at the Conservatoire . Next in order of excellence comes the Soci3h3 des Nouveaux Concerts , founded and directed by M. Lamoureux , which gives its concerts at the theatre of the C1h*iteau d'Eau , named from a large fountain falling over steps , - a style of ornamental water - works called ckdteau d'eau by the French . The theatre has two thousand seats , and although these concerts are but in their third year now ( 1883-84 ) , there is not room enough for those who wish to attend them . The difficulty has been met by giving two series , of ten each , A and B , or Pairs and Impairs ( odd and even ) , numbered one , three , five , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same programme twice in succession ; A No. 1 being the same as B 2 , A 3 as B 4 , and so on . Jt is supposed that the same people will not subscribe to both series . The repetition of the programme was common to all the concert societies a year ago , and the great success of certain compositions occasionally induced the leader to give them three weeks running ; but M. Lamoureux announced at the opening of the present season that no programme would be repeated more than once . The same qualities which distinguish the concerts of the Conservatoire are to be found in a less degree in those of the Nouveaux Concerts . The simultaneousness with which the violinists draw the bow is beautiful to see ; it looks as if all the instruments moved together by machinery . The result is a smoothness hardly surpassed at the Conservatoire itself : the . crescendo and decrescendo passages , how rapid so ever the tempo . swell and sink with an imperceptible gradation , like the rising and falling of the wind ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect resembles the sublime harmonies of Nature obeying her eternal laws . The delicacy of the players is not less marvelous ; under their bows the violin passages at the opening of the overture and finale to the Midsummer Night 's Dream sound like the singing of midges , so fine and thin and clear , and the flutes in the scherzo seem sustained by one long breath throughout the entire movement . The flute-playing in this orchestra is so exquisite that it accounts for the favor which that now neglected instrument once enjoyed . Richter of Vienna , M. Deldevez of the Conservatoire at Paris , and M. Lamoureux belong to the same school of conductors . It is most interesting to watch their mode of leading . They seem to do scarcely more than beat time quietly ; a slight inclination of the bow , now in one direction , now in another , the raising of a forefinger for a second , are their only gestures . They stand at the desk as tranquil and impassive as diplomatists , yet every musician on the platform is completely under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ascendency over his orchestra ; it is so absolute that it gives the spectator a sense of despotism in the man , that supreme autocracy which controls the very personality of others . He never appears to look after his musicians ; they look after him . I became convinced , by long observation and comparison , that the mode of playing of an orchestra expresses the temperament of the leader . Its physiognomy is another curious peculiarity . Every player has his own individual expression of // face , and it is amusing to mark the intentness , fervor , security , carelessness , or indifference with which each performs his part ; the anxious glances which some constantly dart at the leader , while others seldom or never turn their eyes towards him . But besides this , they have a collective countenance , the concrete of their predominating state of mind . At the Conservatoire it is that of a body of men who know their work so well that they do it serenely , without reference to any one else , although there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze is fixed on their music , while he on his side rarely looks away from his score . Lamoureux 5 orchestra has less tranquillity ; they work steadily , but anxiously , under the eye of their master . The contrast of M. Colonne 's with both the preceding is very striking : eyes , heads , chins , are incessantly turning towards the leader ; there is an active communication between him and his players , as rapid and spasmodic as the working of an electric telegraph . M. Colonne always reminded me of a charioteer , whip aloft in one hand , with the other checking and guiding a hundred horses , in full career and on the point of breaking loose . He has a wonderful way of holding them in , urging them on , soothing and stimulating them by motions of his head , hand , or foot , by the sound of his voice and the mobility of his features . lie leads with every nerve and muscle , and he seems to throw himself into every one of his players . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while conducting them and the orchestra through one of Berlioz 's intricate counter-movements . The concerts of the Soci&amp;* Artistique , directed by Mi . Edouard Colonne at the Th*itre du Ch*telet , rank third . They are inferior to M. Lamoureux 5 in many respects : the orchestra does not always play in exact time , some of the instruments are occasionally out of tune , the brass can not be counted upon at critical moments , there is a little irregularity and roughness in the general effect . Having admitted these shortcomings , I hasten to add that nowhere in Paris , the Conservatoire not excepted , can such performances be heard as at the Chatelet . M. Colonne possesses in the highest degree the gift which the French call le diable au corps , that union of fire and energy which dashes at difficulties , carrying everything before it , and this he infuses into his musicians . Their mode of playing is more spirited than that of any other orchestra in Paris ; they have an impetuosity which is allied to the genius of certain great works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the Damnation de Faust , illustrates the term of furia francese , which the Italians of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries gave to the onslaught of the French troops in the days of their great captains . The squadrons of Magyars charge by with irresistible rush , their barbaric strains mingling with the echoes of clashing arms and wild cries . I received the most tremendous musical impression of my life at M. Colonne 's first Wagner memorial concert , given on the 25th of February , 1883 . The selections begai* with the overture to the Tannhaiiser , fol-* lowed by the prelude to the third act , and Wolfram 's recitative as the pilgrim train advances through the valley on the way back from Rome , singing its sweet and solemn chorus . The fervent , heart-broken prayer of Elisabeth came in order , and the tender apostrophe to the evening star by her faithful , hopeless lover , closing with the minstrels ' festal march and chorus . The constant progression through so many different emo-4 tions of an intense and absorbing nature , the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical sensibilities from the trammels of personality and the musical intelligence from the limits of attention , // until the being was merged in tides of sound which seemed to beat against the bounds of space . The sense of might in the music was overwhelming . The excitement was indescribable , and pervaded the atmosphere ; leader , orchestra , audience acting and reacting upon each other with an electrical interchange of feeling . The impression can not be conveyed in words , which sound exaggerated while falling infinitely short of the truth . As the climax slowly subsided , old Joseph Dessauer 's criticism on Wagner in Vienna ten years before came back to me : " He is a cataclysm . " In fact , the music had swallowed us alive , like a gulf . The excitable audience was wrought into a frenzy , in which other passions than melomania had a share . There was in some hearers real antipathy to the composer , in others animosity to him as a German , and these prejudices struggled fiercely against the dominating power of the music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TannhaUser , the charm of the spinning chorus from the Flying Dutchman , the gravity and interest of the prelude to Parsifal , kept the dissidents in check until the wild gallop of the Valkyrie began . The stern daughters of Odin rode on the whirlwind above the din of the battle-field , sweeping mortals with them on their breathless course ; and then the storm burst in hisses , hooting , stamping , shrill whistles , calls , cries , and counter-cries : " That s not music ! " " Bravo ! bravo ! bravissimo ! " " If the Germans want to hear it , let them go hear it at home ! " " Bis ! his ! " ( Again , again . ) " You sha' n't have it ! " " Superb ! Magnificent ! " " Stop it ! " " Turn out the blackbirds ! " ( the men with the whistles . ) " Down with the circus-riders ! " This last bit of wit at the expense of the Yalkyrie raised a laugh which almost turned the scale ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the end , after a tumult which was nearly a riot , the ayes had it . The Chevauch6e was repeated amid deafening shouts , and again the terrible riders thundered through the air , while the battle raged below . When it was over , and M. Colonne caine forward in response to the acclamations of the panting orchestra and breathless audience , every hair of his well-brushed brown curls stood on end . Whatever these men play has th' same brio ; no Parisian orchestra approaches them in rendering Wagner , Berlioz , and contemporary composers of their school . Although power and passion are their characteristics , it must not be supposed that they are lacking in sweetness and tenderness . They struck me as excelling in the latter , especially in accompanying the voice , whether in solo or chorus ; the softest human notes are not softer than their pianissimo playing . But their strong point is their ability to sway an assemblage , and make it thrill and vibrate like a crowd under the influence of a strong popular sentiment ; and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twelve years ago I went for the first time to one of the Concerts Populaires , led by M. Pasdeloup . They were then the only musical recreation of a high order in Paris , except the concerts of the Conservatoire . I remember the mixture of amusement and annoyance with which I perceived the strong stable smells ( the building being the winter circus ) , the shabbiness of the audience , the discomfort of the seats . As soon as the music began I forgot every drawback to enjoyment . There was a symphony of Beethoven 's performed by over ninety instruments ; I had never heard anything like it before , and I was transported with delight . M. Pasdeloup was then valiantly combating his countrymen 's prejudice against Wagner , amounting in many of them to positive hatred , and exasperated by the anti - German rage 1 eft by the recent Franco - Prussian war . The first attempt to perform // his music at the Cirque d'Hiver was met by such obstreperous opposition that it had to be given up . This was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1882 before I attended another Concert Populaire . Beethoven 's Second Symphony was given , among other things , and for the first time in Paris the prelude to the Parsifal , with the hymn of the knights of the San Graal . Every seat was occupied , and before the latter production began , the house filled until there was no standing room . The audience listened to it in perfect silence , and it was repeated without objection . To my disappointment , I found that the orchestra was not so good as formerly , or that the other concerts of which I have spoken had raised my standard very much . The time and tune were occasionally faulty ; there was an absence both of delicacy and of volume , of fine shading , and above all of unanimity , of common impulse . M. Pasdeloup did not seem to have his players thoroughly in hand ; he did not hold them together , like the other leaders he lacked vigor , and at the same time repose . I heard his orchestra several times during the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hut third-rate . Yet some great American cities might be thankful if they could have such concerts every week , or even every month , for half the year . No lover of music can cease to feel the utmost gratitude to M. Pasdeloup for the noble work he has done . There is something , too , most amiable and expansive in his presence and individuality ; there is a genuine , genial enjoyment of music for itself alone ; when a composition is well played he looks as happy as a child . " There is not one of the leaders who loves music so heartily and with so much disinterestedness as he , " said a distinguished composer to me of M. Pasdeloup . It must have been a real satisfaction , therefore , to many people that the first Concert Populaire of the present season , 1883-84 , was a great improvement on those of last year . Mendelssohn 's Scotch Symphony was beautifully given , with great spirit and expression , and the accompaniment to Mozart 's Piano Concerto in E fiat was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , one of twenty-seven similar compositions by the same master , of which but two or three are known even in Europe . M. Pasdeloup announced in his prospectus , last September , that he should give the greater number of them in the course of the winter , M. Theodore Ritter taking the piano part . This gentleman once had a great reputation as a player of Beethoven , but sank into obscurity from too great partiality to his own compositions . His touch is a trifle heavy and hammer-like on the accented notes , but otherwise his playing is the very model of classic style ; it has largeness , solidity , sobriety , a crystalline , cleanfingered precision , and in the forte passages real majesty . The Concerto is a very fine production , with a breadth and massiveness which recall Beethoven and Gluck rather than Mozart , yet with the distinctive tenderness and grace of the last . The programme was made up by St. Sai*ns 's Jeunesse d'Hercule , an air for violoncello and harp from Beethoven 's ballet of Prometheus , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful concert . It is usual at all these performances to have concertos and vocal and instrumental solos of a very high order . Most of the foreign musical celebrities who come to Paris in winter appear at one or more of the popular classical concerts during their stay , and ' there are distinguished French artists who are seldom heard elsewhere . Their names have not reached this country , yet they are greatly superior to many favorites of our public . The concert associations , true to one of the principles of their institution , also admit youthful performers // June , as well as composers : young men and women , destined to become famous , make their first trembling appearance at the Cirque d'Hiver , the Chatelet , and the Chateau d'Eau . Great good-nature is shown , by both the audience and the musicians , to beginners . They seldom need indulgence , however , for any shortcomings , except those of timidity and inexperience ; they have the careful training and bard study of long years to sustain them before they venture to present themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their power and facility increase , but the technical part of their art must be mastered before they take the first step in public . For others very little allowance is made ; hisses and exclamations of displeasure are heard almost simultaneously with a false note or slovenly passage . The audiences are all keenly critical ; in other respects there is a marked difference between them : that of the Conservatoire is decorous and fastidious , that of the Cirque d'Hiver easy-going and plebeian ; the Chateau d'Eau is harder to please , and rowdy , and although violent scenes are less frequent there than at the Chatelet , which is extremely Bohemian , I beard an attempt to give Berlioz 's Carnival Romain an encore put down , in spite of M. Lamoureux , by hooting and braying , in imitation of the too asinine blasts of the horns . The large proportion of poor people in them all is a very interesting and touching element : hundreds of men who can not afford to pay for a seat come in before the great work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and stand through it , many of them through the entire performance . A very pathetic group is the common one of a shabbily dressed young couple , with a baby . The babies , as a general rule , are good ; but the funniest row I witnessed at the Chateau d'Eau was caused by one who whimpered during the adagio of Beethoven 's Third Symphony . After the poor mortified mother had withdrawn with the offending infant , - no easy matter through the closely packed crowd , - uncomplimentary remarks and epithets continued to fly about , which provoked the father to reply angrily ; upon which arose cries of " Turn him out ! " A grave-looking , middle-aged man suddenly said , from the other side of the theatre , " It was enough to make the child ill to bring it into such an atmosphere : that is why it cried . " The sententiousness with which this opinion was delivered caused general laughter , in the midst of which somebody cried out , " Now , then , steam up ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concert went on . But there are always many very little children present , who are evidently brought for their own enjoyment , and they do enjoy wonderfully , some sitting like statues , others nodding their heads and beating time with their tiny hands , smiling gleefully at each other . As American concert-goers may be curious to know what sort of music draws thousands of hearers weekly , who can not pay above a quarter of a dollar for their pleasure , I will give a few of last season 's programmes , fair samples of the rest . At M. Pasdeloup 's Concert Populaire on October 22 , 1882 , was given , Beethoven 's Second Symphony ; dance music by Rameau ( an old-fashioned composer of Louis XV . ' s time ) ; a piano-forte Concerto by Litolff ; the overture to Weber 's Oberon ; the prelude to Wagner 's Parsifal . On February 25 , 1883 , selections from Velldda , a new opera by M. Charles Lenepveu , one of the " jeunes , " as the rising composers are called ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera of Dardanus , by Rameau ; a piano-forte Concerto by Henselt , opus 16 ; and the Wedding March from Lohengrin . At the Ch&amp;teau d'Eau , M. Lamoureux s orchestra gave on January 28 , 1883 , the Michel Angelo overture , by Niels W. // Gade ; fragments from Gluck 's Armida ; Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony , with chorus ; an Aria by Lotti ( an Italian composer of the early eighteenth century ) ; and the overture to Oberon . Ga March 11 , 1883 , a memorial concert to Wagner , selections from the Flying Dutchman ; the prelude to Parsifal ; selections from the Meistersiinger ; selections from Lohengrin ; and Liszt 's Fantaisie Hongroise , played by Madame Essipoff . At the first concert of this season , November 4 , 1883 , the overture to Jessonda , by Spohr ; Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony ; Espaiia , a fantasy by M. Chabrier , one of the jeunes ; Mendelssohn 's Midsummer Night 's Dream music ; Berlioz 's overture to the Carnival Romain . At the Chhtelet , March 4 , 1883 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's overture to the Marriage of Figaro , and selections from Melka , an operetta or cantata by M. Charles Lefebvre , a jeune , - lovely music , of a pure , plaintive character , excellently written , and full of sweet , sustained melody , very different from that of the younger contemporary French composers as far as I know them ; the second part was devoted to Wagner , and contained selections from Tannhaiiser , the Flying Dutchman , the Walkiire , Parsifal , and Lohengrin . In the course of the past season I heard M. Colonne give Berlioz 's Damnation de Faust repeatedly , Mendelssohn 's Midsummer Night 's Dream music , selections from L'Arh*sienne by Bizet , the composer of Carmen , Berlioz 's Funeral March for Hamlet , and fragments from his Romeo and Juliet . The concerts of the Chatelet opened this season with the Damnation de Faust , and the orchestra struck me as having gained in smoothness and selfpossession during the holidays , without having lost a spark of their wonderful fire . I regret very much not having more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen hy the above list that the Association Artistique , while not neglecting the classic and standard composers , gives more time to modern and contemporary ones . The choice of music at the concerts of all the societies is very judicious . The admission of youthful talent and the revival of the charming and sentimental old-fashioned Italian and French masters keep the public from becoming too conservative in these matters . It may interest some of my readers to know the statistics of one of the popular classical concert associations . M. Colonne was kind enough to give me the following facts with regard to the Association Artistique , and although each society has its particular rules and conditions they are alike in general plan . The Concerts du Chatelet have entered upon their tenth year . When M. Colonne made the venture there was no capital to start with . Subscribers were obtained at the rate of five , four , two and a half , and two francs , and even at a franc and a half and a franc , a concert , according to the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the rest . The performers are members of the society ; M. Colonne is the president . The proceeds of the concerts are divided among them respectively at the end of the year in ratio of their individual importance . They were obliged to divide twice during the first season , in order to keep their organization together ; that year they made but ten thousand francs . The hire of the theatre and incidental expenses come to about one thousand francs a concert . The house holds two thousand people , and is almost always literally full , but there are nearly two hundred complimentary tickets . The subscribers represent about a tenth of the receipts . There is also a long list of honorary members , whose annual subscription is fixe&amp; at twentyfive francs , which admits them to the general rehearsal previous to each concert , although not to the concert itself . // Some of these members generously contribute larger sums for the encouragement of the concerts , and from these sources the receipts last year were eighteen thousand francs . The first year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand francs ; last year they were sixty-nine thousand . ' The government has granted the association a yearly subsidy of ten thousand francs . The orchestra consists of one hundred and four instruments , - eighteen first and sixteen second violins , fourteen violas , twelve bass , and twelve doublebass viols , thirteen wooden wind instruments and twelve brass , with half a dozen more , too diverse for classification . The chorus comprises about a hundred and fifty men and women , who are not members of the society , however . The performers are allowed to belong to other musical associations , to play elsewhere , to have other occupations , provided that these do not interfere with their presence at the concerts of the Chatelet and the three weekly rehearsals for each , which N ? . Colonne requires ; nothing else is exacted . When the season is over they are entirely at liberty . M. Colonne himself goes to some bathing station , or as we say springs , taking part of his orchestra with him , and making it up from chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , or something else , to eke out their annual gains . Besides these regular weekly orchestral performances , no month goes by in Paris , from November until May , without bearing its crop of musical entertainment in the shape of chamber concerts , piano-forte recitals , matin6es and soir6es , by French and foreign musicians . Each of the great piano factories has a pretty hall in its back buildings , where small audiences listen to their favorite artists . I never passed through the warerooms , on my way to the Salle Herz , Salle Pleyel , or Salle Erard , without admiring the instruments , which stand in rows , of every size and shape that pianos may be , and regretting that with us they are such hopelessly ugly pieces of furniture . The great secret of their good looks in France is their extreme simplicity . They have none of the scroll-work and jigsawing which disfigure those in this country ; they are for the most part perfectly plain , of every sort of wood , light and dark , dead , oiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; in short , they are designed with so much good sense and good taste that an upright piano is positively an ornamental object , while one may have even a concert-grand without introducing a hideous monster into one 's drawing-room . It was in a brilliant assemblage at the Salle Erard that I heard N ? . de Beriot , the son of the great Maria Malibran and of her small husband , Charles de Beriot . The young man is a pianist and composer , and has a high standing with the dilettanti in Paris . Perhaps the proverb concerning gift horses seals most people 's lips as to his performances , for he only invites his acquaintance to his concerts , which are private , and my cards of admission were sent me by a French friend . The programme was made up chiefly of N ? . de Beriot 's productions , which are as commonplace and uninteresting as his father 's . His playing is admirable as far as regards mere touch and execution , and has the agreeable and indefinable quality of taste ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sort . In the concerted pieces he was assisted by a portion of Lamoureux 's orchestra , but they were so subordinated to the piano that they could not rise above its mediocrity . Madame Sophie Menter , the court pianist of Vienna , gave a series of concerts at the Salle Herz , if I remember rightly . She is a very pretty young woman , with a childlike roundness and softness of appearance , and plays with extraordinary power and execution , but in a hard and heartless manner ; nevertheless , // she spun Mendelssohn 's Fileuse off her fingers with bewildering rapidity and deftness , and an enchanting effect of playing with the keys rather than upon them , which won an encore from the wellpleased audience . Madame Essipoff was in Paris at the same time , delighting her select worki of diplomatists and women of fashion . She has a more perfect command of the piano and its resources than Madame Menter , or indeed any other woman I have ever heard ; her force and fire are prodigious , especially considering her delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her playing is splendid . She was sometimes assisted by a compatriot , M. Braiidoukoff , on the violoncello , who supplied the expression , the depth , the soul , which she does not convey , while he made his instrument perform feats which seemed possible to the violin alone . There are elements of enthusiasm and rapture in M. Brandouko if 's playing which affect the hearer as one is seldom affected except by the voice , and more potently in that his music is without words . He impressed me as a man of real genius and as having a musical organization of the highest order . But to enumerate the occasional concerts of this sort which are to be heard in Paris during the winter would make too long a list . The musical season closes in the spring , when the races begin , and the delightful days come , when everybody wishes to be out-of-doors. rhe performances at the Conservatoire , Chateau d'Eau , Chatelet , and Cirque d'Hiver end at Easter . Their orchestras , or portions of them , continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times of year , with Maurin , the foremost Parisian violinist , and other celebrated names on the programmes ; but notwithstanding a good selection of music and musicians , the matin6es which I attended in that huge hall were dull and uninteresting . At the close of the regular season , however , there are apt to be a few benefits , or charity concerts , at which the great virtuosos of Europe are gathered , like the sun 's rays in a burning-glass . Two of these took place late in the spring of 1883 , at the Cirque d'Et6 , on the Road Point of the Champs Elys6es . At both I was fortunate enough to hear M. Plant6 , the most accomplished and finished pianist alive . This gentleman , being rich , allows himself to live as he likes , and to play when and where he likes , or not at all . His home is in the Landes , the region of great pine woods and sea-brcezes , where the shepherds go about upon stilts . There he lives in retirement most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and occasionally traveling to other countries . In the former he usually gives one concert , seldom more , - an event to which the musical world looks forward with great eagerness and excitement . Last spring , after M. Plant6 was known to be in town , weeks went by ; his adorers were on the tip-toe of expectation ; it was bruited about that he had been playing at private houses in strict secrecy , but no concert was announced . At length , losing patience , people went to inquire at the principal music shops , where advertisements appear and tickets are sold ; the answer was , M. Plant6 did not intend to give a concert that season . The disappointment was great , and great was the joy when an entertainment was proclaimed under the auspices of certain charitable and patronizing ladies in aid of their blind asylums , at which M. Plant* would play . The programmes promised a great deal of other talent , and the first-class seats sold at twenty francs ; the second , which were the dozen upper rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crowded , nevertheless ; the body of the house filled with persons who meet only on rare and special occasions of this sort . There were women of high rank and piety from the seclusion of the Faubourg St. // Germain , who never deigned to appear at the courts of Louis Philippe or Napoleon the Third any more than at M. Gravy 's receptions ; relics and representatives of each of those dynasties ; ladies who sail with the wind , and whose colors are neither Bourbon , Orleanist , nor Republican , but those of the season ; and the men who are at the beck and call of the different patronesses . The very variety made the social aspect of the affair one of extreme exclusiveness , and it recalled descriptions from Feuillet 's and Cherbuliez 's novels . There is always some curiosity felt about the personal appearance of celebrities of any kind . M. Plant* is slight , pale , and gentleman-like , looking on the whole not unlike a certain good type of American , and with nothing of the lion about him except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keyboard . He was supported by M. Faure , the first baritone in Europe , the most perfect and delicious singer of our day . He has not been heard at the opera in Paris for some years , to which its deterioration is partly due , as the presence of so gifted and conscientious an artist must necessarily keep up the standard of an entire company . M. Faure gives as much attention to the acting as to the singing of his parts . It is said , as an instance of his painstaking , that previous to appearing in Les Huguenots he practiced playing at cup and ball for six weeks , in order never to miss the catch once , as he wished to introduce it in a scene at the court of Charles IX. , the game having been in fashion at that time . He bestows the same scrupulous study upon his music , to which he adds a rich and mellow voice , a faultless method , and great general intelligence . M. Faure is a dark , handsome , thoughtful-looking man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of bearing . The music was beautiful , but the bills of fare of benevolence are always too full . Besides PIant6 and Faure there was Carlotta Patti , who sang with a science and style to throw her more famous little sister into the shade ; and there was the fiery M. Colonne , with a portion of his orchestra , and M. Delsart , a distinguished violoncellist . Actors and actresses from the Th*fitre Fran*ais were advertised , but they were unexpectedly prevented from coming , and were replaced by others of less renown , who recited humorous and sentimental poems . There was too much of it , but the audience agreed that it was a great success , and the lady managers were coml ) limented and congratulated with much effusion by their acquaintance . The second and last appearance of M. Plant* was on June 1 , again at the Cirque d'Et* , at the Festival Pasdeloup . The founder of the Concerts Populaires was present with the flower of his orchestra , M. Faure , Madame Gerster , and other musicians of note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mendelssohn ; Arioso from H&amp;odiade , Massenet , sung by Faure ; Romance from Mozart 's 8th Concerto and an andante and polonaise of Chopin 's , played by Plan U* " Ah non giunge " from La Somnambula , by Madame Gerster ; Air from Beethoven 's ballet of Prometheus , with harp and violoncello solos by MM . Hasselmans and Vandergucht ; Romance from Un Ballo in Masehera , by Faure ; Andante and Scherzo , Weber , Gavotte from Jphigenia , Gluck , Romance , Schumann , Danse Hongroise , B rahms , byM.Plant* Theme and variations , Mozart , by M. Grisez , an eminent clarionet player , and all the stringed instruments ; " Je crois , " a composition of M. Faure 's , sung by himself , and Gounod 's Au Printemps , also sung by him , and accompanied by Plant* and the orchestra ; Chopin 's Etude in A flat , a melody by Rubinstein , a waltz by Raff , and tarantelle by Gottschalk , forming one clause , played by Plant6 ; Arditi 's Fior di Margherita , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a real festival . It was one of those chosen hours when a happy magnetism pervades an assembly , and a subtle sympathy envelops them in one sensation . NI . Pasdeloup led , his orchestra performed , the other artists played and sang , as if it were a royal wedding " once upon a time , " and the fairies were showering gifts on the whole company . Plant&amp;s style is the most consummate art ; smoothness , facility , refinement , can go no further on the piano . Grace and elegance are the characteristics of his playing , but he puts fbrth surprising power without the slightest effort . It is only when he plays Chopin that one is conscious that he has his limits ; he does not possess the intensity , the lyrical passion , to interpret that suffering soul . But NI . Plant* is peerless among contemporary pianists . Liszt I never heard , but Thalberg could not be compared with him . Bulow is cold and mechanical , and Rabinstein crude beside him . He played that day with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves felt at the previous concert . Faure sang divinely . Madame Gerster had twice her wonted brilliancy and charm , and her pleasing personality enhaiiced the effect . The audience was in raptures , in ecstasies . But the artists were singing and playing for themselves and each other , mutually inspired and delighted . The climax was reached when the two idols of Parisians , Faure and Plant6 , gave Gounod 's lovely spring song with orchestral accompaniment . It was a magical achievement of delicacy and lightness . M. Faure 's faintest tones and M. Plant6 's ethereal fingering were audible through the whispered harmonies of the orchestra , modulated to the last degree of pianissimo . The ravishing sweetness and sentiment with which Faure gave the melody can hardly be forgotten by any one who heard it on that day . As he sang and Planti played and the orchestra murmured of spring , nature and the human heart seemed reviving and awakening to youth , hope , romance , love , and the poetry of existence . The audience sat entranced until the last chord died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert ended , they poured into the warm , bright air of the summer afternoon , with eyes shining and cheeks flushed or pale with exquisite emotion , and seemed to diffuse a higher enjoyment among the pleasure-seekers under the flowering chestnut avenues of the Champs Elys*e . Plant6 and Faure lingered and talked beside the fountain near the door until everybody else had gone , as if loath to break from the spell which had held them and their hearers . This memorable day closed the musical season of 1882-83.
