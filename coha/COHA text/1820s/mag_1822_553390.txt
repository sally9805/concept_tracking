ART . V.-muvres Oratoires de . Mirabeau ; pr*c6d*s d'uue notice historique sur set vie . 2 vols. 8vo . Paris , 1819 . MIRABEAU-R0B* s PIERRE-BONAPARTE-These are the three great names of the French revolution . A thousand other actors in this prodigious drama rose in different ways to various heights of power and glory ; but these are the three master spirits , who successively set their seals upon the character of three distinct periods ; and tWe Union in these leading minds of an utter absence of moral principle with transcendent genius would perhtips go far of itself , independently of any other cause , to account for the series of disasters , which so long frustrated all the attempts of the French people to reform their political institutions , it is fearful to think how much depends in times of trouble on the personal character of individuals* We are fond , for example , of ascribing the success of our ov , ln revolution to the excellence of the intellectual and moral habits of our fathers , who achieved it . But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availed them , if they had been betrayed by their leaders-if Adams had proved a Mirabeau , and Washington a Bonaparte ? If , as we may venture to presume , they would have persevered and finally effected Eheir deliverance , the revolution , under such circumstances , must have assumed a character like that of France , and degenerated into a weary and wasting struggle , instead of being , as it was , compared with any similar event of equal magnitude , a mere holiday diversion . The three personages , whom we have mentioned , resembled each other in nothing but the ascendency of their characters and the extent of their influence on the fortunes of their country. - The reputation of Robespierre for talent is , however , more equivocal than that of the others ; although it seems impossible to account for his ability to strike terror , during two or three years in succession , into the hearts of a great nation , without supposing an extraordinary degree of mental energy . But the diabolical and unexampled excess of mere malignity , that appeared in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his talents ; and he is only recollected as the most remorseless of tyrants . There is , after all , something unnatural and , as it were , mysterious in this personage . He exhibited a singular simplicity and unexceptionable correctness in his private habits ; and seems to // have felt no temptation to abuse power for the purpose of accumulating wealth or indulging in sensual pleasure . Liberty was the watch-word of the day ; but with him virtue was more especially an habitual theme of discourse ; and he goes from his daily labor of assassination to make a voluntary and solemn acknowledgment of the existence of God . His delicate taste and minute attention to his person were also strongly at variance with his political conduct ; and there is something starthug in the idea of a murderer in a nicely powdered head , and a neckcloth of the finest cambric . These frightful inconsistences almost excite the idea of a good man driven on , like Wieland in the novel , by a sort of fatality or insanity to the commission of continual crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first thought the most reasonable way of accounting for proceedings more extravagant and incongruous , if possible , than cruel. - With the other two of these characters , the splendor of genius has thrown its dazzling brilliancy over the daring and unprincipled ambition , which accompanied it , as it has done with many preceding conquerors and statesmen of ancient and modern times . Mirabeau and Bonaparte , though hardly possessing higher claims to the approbation of the wise and good , than Robespierre , not having abandoned , like him , all regard for common humanity , and having fired the imaginations of men in a much greater degree , by astonishing exhibitions of power and vast successes , are more frequently thought of , and will probably be finally remembered as the most illustrious persons of their times , rather than as great criminals . They will he ranked in history with the Alexanders , the Ca*sars , and the Cromwells ; while Robespierre , in the singular blackness and incomprehensible inconsistency of his conduct , must be contented with a station far below even the Catilines ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a terrible exception from all recorded categories of the human species . These three were all orators ; and each in a different way . Robespierre , as he was probably inferior to the others in talent , was also iiiferior to them in eloquence . His manner of speaking appears to have resembled that of Cromwell , and was marked with obscurity and painful effort . To judge from his reported speeches , his reach of mind was extensive , and he generally took a large view of the subject under discussion but his ideas are not expressed with precision or with elegance ; // and make little or no impression on the imagination or the judgment . A bewildering cloud seems to brood over his intellect , as may well be imagined with one , whose aim , in most of his orations , was to establish a connexion between assassination and virtue . Bonaparte , on the other hand , was distinguished for a very different sort of eloquence , if the term may be applied without impropriety to his written addresses to the army . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation of the great characters of antiquity , and his style , like his conduct , was imitated from theirs . It is impossible not to recognize in the productions alluded to an echo of such speeches as those of Hannibal in Livy , and Marius in Sallust . This bold and brilliant manner was entirely suitable to the audience , for which the addresses were intended ; and same of the happiest specimens of it may perhaps stand the test of exact criticism , and be admitted as examples of real eloquence . In general , however , their author 's ambitious spirit led him , in writing as in action , into caricature ; and he often oversteps the narrow boundary , that divides the sublime from the ridiculous . But eloquence , whether written or spoken , was with Bonaparte only a secondary matter . Mirabeau , with a mental energy probably at least equal , if not superior , was exclusively an orator ; and he seems to have possessed all the requisites of eloquence in as high Perfection as any orator , that ever distinguished himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his career , and the peculiar character of the period , prevented him from developing his powers to their full extent , or embodying them in such productions , as will give him a permanent rank with the most celebrated speakers . But , notwithstanding the unfavorable circumstances , under which he presented himself , he exercised an astonishing mastery over the spirits of a most enlightened audience ; and acquired in the short space of two years the reputation , which has not yet been wrested from him , of the must powerful political orator , that France ever produced . We venture to presume , that an article upon so distinguished a personage , including one or two specimens of his manner , will not be uninteresting to our readers ; and avail ourselves of the opportunity to offer it , afforded by the publication of this collection , which is not , however , very complete or very judiciously executed . We shall commence with some observations of a more general character , which are naturally suggested by the subject . // The word eloquence seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the abuse of it has proved in practice of more importance than that of most other words , as it has had no small influence on the conduct of public affairs in various countries . Eloquence in its proper sense is the faculty of speaking , that is of extemporizing , in public with effect , and is quite distinct from the faculty of writing well in the closet , or of reading with gr ce and propriety . In common usage however we apply the epithet of an eloquent man to a good writer and a good reader , at icast , a good read-. er of his own composition , as well as to a good speaker . Now these several powers , though in some measure allied to each other , suppose very different habits , if not talents . A man may be able to write in perfection , who from want of exercise or some original incapacity is unable to extemporize a sentence . This was the case with Rousseau , the most impassioned perhaps of all writers , who from a defect of humour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small circles , and observed of himself that the slightest objection uniformly overset him ; and that he had no sense till half an hour after he wanted to employ it . Again , there is nothing more common than to hear a man denominated eloquent , principally because he is able to read in a forcible and impressive way his own written composition , which perhaps on ex2mination has but little value ; and which , such as it is , he is quite unable to produce extempore . This is the case with most of our preachers , whose sermons are generally written out beforehand as they are delivered ; and whose reputation for eloquence is sometimes founded as much upon their skill in reading , as any other quality . This is also the case with a great part of the orators in the deliberative assemblies on the continent of Europe , who are almost universally in the habit of reading written speeches ; a practice which happily is not admitted in our legislative bodies or in the British parliament . Now this confusion of ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to some very serious practical consequence* . It may be regarded for example as the cause of the practice which we have just mentioned of reading written sermons and written speeches on political affairs . Both these habits are productive in different ways of great inconvenience . A reasonable degree of expedition in the despatch of public business is extremely d* irable on various // accounts ; and this is materially impeded in most of the European assemblies by the prevailing opinion that every person who is capable of writing a dull speech or causing one to be written for him , is at liberty to consume the time and patience of his colleagues with reading it to them , under the pretext of speaking to the question . There is not only a great loss of time but an intolerable degree of fatigue and disgust consequent upon this usage . It is enough perhaps to make a sensitive man vote against a measure in itself good , to see a host of orators , not one of whom is capable of uttering a sentence , rising one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , and taking out of their pockets their respective quires of eloquence . As the thing is done alike on both sides of all questions , there is no great danger of any unfavorable effect upon the decision of points in dispute ; but the praciice is at once highly inconvenient and well fitted to create a ziis*ust for the form of representative government itself . With us this evil is not experienced ; but the public service would be greatly advanced if it were undersWod that an orator must not only be able to speak , but to speak well , before he can take the floor with advantage to himself , his party , or the public . If this conviction could be once fairly established in the general opinion , it would save many an unfortunate member from b*inging disgrace upon himself and his constituents , and makii*g enemies for life of his colleagues , and that part of the public , probably not a very numerous one , who think themselves bound in duty and honor to read every speech that is printed in the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its corruption . The speaking is there left for the most part on both sides to a few distinguished members who are capable of throwing light upon the subject ; and it is not found that the public service sustains any injury in consequence , as no erroneous measure that has ever been adopted in that country can be fairly traced to a defect of public discussion . If we choose to consider the British as our enemies we should perhaps do well to apply in this case the old Roman maxim , JJ'as est ab hoste docers . The confusion of ideas to which we have alluded has also led to the practice of reading written discourses in the pulpit , one of the most unfortunate innovations that has ever been made on the discipline of the jn'imitive church . It is true that we owe to it many volumes of instructive and elegant // sermons ; but then what floods of ennui have been poured out every week for centuries through the same channels upon the Christian world . We have little hesitation in saying , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the faith of believers is exposed , is the necessity of abstaining from attendance on public devotional exercises , or listening to performances , which by their dulness excite very different feelings from those of love to G*ott and man . The great superiority of extempore preaching is evinced in the perfect success with which it is practised by the less cultiv.ated sects of Christians among ourselves and elsewhere . It is true that their discourses give no pleasure to men of education , because the preachers are generally uninformed and narrow minded ; but they delight and edify the audience for which they were intended ; while divines of much higher pretensions , well instructed in all the necessary branches of knowledge , and dubbed with all the usual degrees , but too often put their hearers to sleep . It is a mistake to suppose that the warmth and zeal of the class of preachers alluded to arise from their ignorance ; and it would be highly injurious to the cause of religion to maintain that a fervid feeling of piety is incompatible with intelligence and education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small degree to the very circumstance of their speaking extempore . When a man who is accustomed to the situation and at ease in it , ascends the tribune to harangue an audience , whether upon religion , politics , or any other matter , which admits of an appeal to the feelings , and no other should ever be treated in this way , a sympathetic communication establishes itself between him and his hearers , at every touch of feeling or flight of fancy a thousand eyes are sparkling with pleasure and swimming in emotion . And is this exhibition to produce no corresponding emotion in the mind of the speaker ? We are not stocks and stones , and a man must be something worse who is not inflamed and excited in such a situation . The oraor finds his own heart warmed by the sympathy of his audience , his imagination is excited and his thoughts flow with a freedom unknown in the laborious effort of written composition . This increasing excitement produces new exhibitions of interest and feeling in the audience ; and these again new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical communication of hearts and minds the whole man is wrought up to the // highest pitch of excitement of which his nature is capable ; and the torrent of his thoughts and feelings gushes from him in a copious and fiery flood , like lava from a burning mountain . The languor that succeeds to these efforts proves the excess of excitement under which they are made . When Mr Ames concluded his speeches , his nerves , says the writer of his life , seemed to he strained and shattered , like the cordage of a ship after a heavy storm . The effect of extempore speaking in giving life and warmth to the manner of the orator is also seen at the bar ; where a counsellor is often wrought up by the mere mechanical excitement of the act to a high degree of of heat and passion , upon matters of mere business , as cases of insurance and patents . Now the effect of introducing a written discourse , whether at the bar , in the pulpit , or in the senate house , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold dead letter , like a wall of partition between hearts and minds that are rushing into contact . A discourse may be written under the influence of strong excitement , and will thus have something in its character analogous to the situation . It will then produce emotion in the audience ; but there will still be no room for the powerful and salutary reaction , which this emotion would in different circumstances exercise upon the speaker . He must go on pouring out his lukewarm closet conceptions , like iced water , upon the fire which he has himself kindled ; and the utmost benefit that he can derive from any sympathetic communication with his hearers is a little additional warmth in his manner as a mere reader . We know that even under these disadvantages a fine writer and a fine reader is heard with extreme pleasure ; but it is , not difficult to imagine how much greater would be the effect of the same talents and graces displayed under the influence of the high excitement of extempore discourse . The heart , says Longinus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought is expressed by Goethe in his Faust , in a passage of which , as it is rather a pointed expression of a common , though important truth , we take the liberty of offering the following imitation . Faust better known by the name of Dr Faustus , is consulted by one of his students upon the proper method of acquiring the art of persuasion . " Persuasion , " says the doctor in reply ...... Persuasion , friend , comes not by toil or art Hard study never made the matter clearer : // T is the live fountain in the speaker 's heart Sends forth the streams that melt the ravished hearer . Then work away for life-heap book on book Line upon line , and precept on example : The stupid multitude may gape and look , And fools may think your stock of wisdom ample . But would you touch the heart , the only method knowe My worthy friend , is first to have one of your own . ' if then , feeling be the essential part of eloquence , every thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided , and this is the necessary and direct operation of declaiming from written notes . It may be urged , however , that extempore speaking is a matter of habit , and can not be practised without the necessa*. vy previous training , which does not form a part of our ordinary systems of education . This difficulty , however , is constantly encountered at the bar , where the young practitioner , after devoting many years and nrnch expense to the acquisition of various branches of knowledge , is compelled to risk his success in life upon his ability in an art , to which he has given no attention . But admitting the objection in its full strength , it only serves to place in a clearer light , one of the most remarkable deficiencies in our academical institutions , in all of which this branch of education is wholly neglected . In some of our universities there are foundations devoted expressly to instruction in eloquence , but by the same confusion of ideas which we have mentioned , the term is understood to mean the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not form a part of the duty of a professor of rhetoric and oratory . We have at Cambridge a trial of skill in declamation , and a distribution of prizes as the reward of success ; but declamation , as there understood , does not signify , as it did with the Romans , an extempore harangue on a given subject , but a mere recitation of scraps in prose or verse , a useful exercise enough for boys in grammar schools , but not very well fitted for the improvement of young men , on the eve of engaging in the most weighty occupations of life . This matter was very differently managed by the ancients . The attention of the professional student was directed almost exclusively to the acquisition of the habit of speaking ; and the practice of declamation in private , as an exercise , was kept up with unremitted perseverance . We find from Cicero 's letters that he continued it through his // whole life . This plan of education was even carried to excess ; and instruction in the mere learning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks was thought sufficient for the acquisition of a competent knowledge of law , while many years in succession was de*. voted to oratory . And it may , perhaps , be said with safety , that if a gentleman , instead of devoting seven years to the study of various branches of knowledge , and no time whatever to improvement in eloquence , should employ one year in acquiring the habit of speaking in public , and six months in informing himself in the most necessary points of learning , he would begin the practice with far more satisfaction to himself and a much better chance of success , than lie does at present . In reality , however , it is not necessary or desirable that any valuable department of science , which is now attended to , should be omitted ; hut only that instruction in eloquence should be superadded to the rest ; and that the manly and really useful discipline of declaiming extempore , should be substituted , in the higher institutions , for the present practice of recitation . To learn to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two thirds of our professional men , and with all who frequent our colleges , as far as they may wish or expect to take a part in the government of the country . All other studies are subsidiary to this . And yet at present the subsidiary studies alone are pursued , and the principal object , in the accomplishment of which they are to aid , is entirely overlooked . We have followed out this train of thought somewhat farther than was necessary for our immediate object , which was , merely to state with distinctness the proper idea of an orator , with a view to a more correct estimate of the character of Mirabean . If the principles here advanced are correct , the greatest orator is not the one who can bequeath to after ages the best collection of written speeches , but the one who can make the strongest impression , by the use of the noblest means , upon the most enlightened audience . An excellent writer of speeches may be a very indifferent orator , or may Rot speak at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the proper sense of the term , was no orator ; although his written speeches are perhaps the choicest specimens in existence , in this form of philosophy and fine writing . Isocrates never spoke in public . On the other // hand , Demosthenes and Cicero united the talents of writing and speaking . Their orations , as reported by themselves , are perfect models of the art ; and it is known historically that their eloquence produced the strongest impression on their hearers . But even when the same individual combines , in as high a degree as these illustrious characters , the two distinct powers , we are not at liberty to estimate his talent as an orator by his merit as a writer ; and in this case , as in every other , we can only judge of his eloquence by the historical and traditional accounts we have of its effects . Thus , no adequate memorial can ever be preserved of excellence , however consummate , of this delightful art , and we must be content to know that great orators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are guided by mere description , of the kind and degree of their powers . If this consideration is in some respects unpleasant , it is at the same time agreeable to reflect , that we are not obliged to doubt the exactness of the historical and traditional accounts that have come down to us of the great effects produced by the eloquence of former orators , because they have left no written speeches of proportional value . The reputation of Patrick Henry , for example , rests wholly on tradition ; but we are not therefore to regard it as unmerited . It is only necessary , in order to estimate it fairly , to strip the accounts we have of it , of all manifest exaggeration and then to take into view the character of the hearers he was in the habit of addressing , and the means he employed to produce effect . The conclusion would probably be , that he was at least equal , if not superior to any orator of modern times . The fame of Mirabeau also rests in a great measure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a considerable number of publications of different degrees of importance and value from his pen ; but though they all exhibit strong marks of talent , none of them belong to the class of finished and standard works , or justify completely the reputation which we know their author acquired in another field . Some of these , as the Translation of Tibullus and the Letters to Sophie , were written from merely pecuniary motives , and must be regarded as the attempts of an amateur to turn to account in time of need , the arts which he had studied as elegant accomplishments . The Essay on the Prussian Monarchy and the Secret History of the court of Berlin are rather valuable as repositories of rich and cu // rious materials , than as literary productions . The various political pamphlets which were published by Mirabeau before the opening of the revolution , although some of them excited at the time very great attention , have also long been forgotten . Among them was the one , entitled Considerations on the order of Cincinnatus ; intended to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same view of this subject was also taken , as is well known , by our illustrious Franklin ; and although no practical inconve* nience has yet resulted from the establishment of the order , it can hardly be denied that it is in theory an offence against the principles of the government . It is easy to conceive that it may have excited strong alarms in the friends of liberty abroad and at home , at a time when the success of our political experiment was still uncertain , to see so important a body as the army exhibit a hankering after the European folly of hereditary rank . These several publications served to indicate the talents of their author , and to recommend him to the public attention ; but it was not till his appearance in the national assembly that the secret of his astonishing mental energy was fully revealed . From the first organization of that body till the day of his death he was acknowledged as the undisputed leader of the popular party ; and doubtless contributed much by the prodigious power of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles above stated , we attempt to judge of the degree of his talent as an orator by the impression he produced and the character of the audience upon which it was made , it can hardly be denied that his eloquence was of the very first class . The national assembly was one of the ablest and most enlightened bodies of men that ever existed ; and it required of course an exhibition of the highest qualities of mind and character to produce effect upon it . The interests under discussion were the most important that could possibly engage the attention of an audience , and nothing but undoubted superiority could have secured the confidence of the popular party to the extent to which Mirabeau possessed it . His reported speeches however give but an indistinct notion of the character of his eloquence . Very few of them were prepared for publication by himself ; and hardly any , even at the time of their delivery , could have possessed the qualities of an artificial and elaborate oration. in such a hurry of events there was no opportunity fctr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Isocrates is said to have done ; nor was there much room to apprehend that orations would savor of the lamp , in an assembly where the most momentous questions were often proposed and decided without the intervention of a single night . To direct the storm of such deliberations required the highest degree of eloquence , understood in its proper sense , as the faculty of extemporizing with power and effect . it required not only a mental energy sufficient to grapple with and master the greatest questions in philosophy and politics , and an imagination rich enough to afford upon demand an unbounded flow of elegant and forcible words ; but the moral qualities that were necessary for bringing these talents , at any moment , into immediate action , dauntless courage , and unshaken self-possession . The very debut of Mirabeau in his legislative career , clearly proved that he had these latter qualities of a consummate orator , in at least as high perfection as the former . His famous reply to the master of the ceremonies , coming by order of the king to dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , but it is far from being the one that affords the least conclusive evidence , in regard to the moral and intellectual qualities of its author ; Tell your master , that we were sent here by the people ; and that nothing but the bayonet shall compel us to separate . ' At a time and in a country where the king was still a god , and the master of the chremonies his high priest , it required a prodigious force of character to break at once , in this way , the charm of their ascendency ; and it is no wonder that the person , who was guilty of such sacrilege , should have been regarded at court , as the incarnate spirit of evil ; although this opinion is not quite so natural in a philosophical observer , like Madame de Stael . Mirabeau had reached the age of forty before he commenced his career as an active politician . The maturity of thought and talent , supposed by this age , was probably favorable to his success as an orator ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpen his intellect by cxasperating his feelings , were unfortunately well fitted for the same reason to give his efforts a dangerous direction . The natural ardor and extravagance of his character , led him in early youth into irregularities , not very unusual in young men of high birth and large expectations , but which , it is said , were repressed by his fi*ther , with a hardship , which had // but little tendency to conciliate so lofty a spirit . The paternal authority in the higher ranks of French society was , at that time , nearly as extensive as in ancient Rome . A man of rank could obtain at pleasure an order for the imprisonment of his children for an unlimited period ; and we are told that Mirabean was deprived of his liberty seventeen times in this arbitrary way . He was confined three years in succession in the castle of Vincennes , and during this period he Wrote , among other things , his essay on Lettres de Cachet , on the blank leaves of the books which were furnished him for reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he treated the subject with feeling , and in the French phrase , avec connoissance de cause ; and , also , that when it came to his turn to lead on the attack of the popular host upon the existing establishments , he did it with a good will , and in the spirit of revenge as well as justice . When , however , the revolution began to take an unfavorable turn , Mirabean exhibited some symptoms of a disposition to relent in his pursuit of vengeance ; and on several occasions defeated the attempts of the demagogues in the assembly , without losing his ascendency over the popular party . It is even certain that there existed at the close of his career an understanding between him and the court , brought about either by corruption , or by a real conviction in his mind , that the revolution had gone far enough , and that it was necessary for the public good , that he should throw the weight of his influence into the scale of government . I am dying , ' he said upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It may be doubted whether even his influence , great as it was , would have been sufficient , at this period , to check the current of events ; and very possibly it was only his untimely death , which prevented him from adding another to the victims of the guillotine . Yet it is difficult not to feel some regret that the experiment could not be tried ; and it seems a strange fatality that the only man whose influence afforded the country any hope of deliverance , should have descended to the grave at the early age of forty-two , in the fulness of his strength , and the complete exercise of all his faculties . But the task which Providence had assigned him was to des .. troy and not to restore . He lived just long enough to complete the essential work of the revolution , and at the very moment of his death was employed in laying the axe at the // real root of the old abuses , by introducing the equal division of estates among the children , in lieu of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prepared upon this subject was read from the tribune a few hours after his death , by Mr de Talleyrand , and the measure was adopted . This single law , independently of any other , contained within itself the whole revolution . Mirabeau retained his lofty and inflexible spirit , and the proud consciousness he always felt of his powers , to the last moment of his life . Hearing , just before he expired , the report of a cannon , What , ' said he , are they celebrating already the funeral of . /Jchilies ? ' His remains were entombed in the Pantheon , from which , however , they were subsequently removed upon the discovery of his understanding with the court . Whatever may be thought of his private morals , or even of his political principles , those who like him least must admit the splendor of his talents , and the aspiring grandeur of his character : His form had not yet lost All its original brightness , nor appeared Less than archangel ruined , or the excess Of glory obscured . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in debate is given by Lemercier , a living French writer of some distinction . The appearance of Mirabeau was far from being attractive . His figure was clumsy and ungraceful ; and it was difficult to see , for the first time , without repugnance , the cloudy , olive colored tint of his complexion , his cheeks ploughed with furrows , his haggard eyes buried in a deep excavation under his projecting forehead , his wide , ill shapen mouth , and his head and breast of a size quite disproportionate to the rest of his person . Nor was there any charm in his enunciation to make up for these defects . His voice was hoarse , and he spoke with a perceptible southern accent . He generally began with slowness and hesitation ; and it was not until he became in some degree warmed by his subject , that his manner assumed an ease and energy , corresponding with the copiousness and force of his conceptions . But no sooner did the superiority of his eloquence display itself , than his ugliness was forgotten . His whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , and put on an entirely new appearance . His massy stature seemed to correspond with the majesty of his language ; // his sunken eyes flashed with inspiration , and the muscles of his lips and forehead quivered and palpitated with the various changes of feeling , that succeeded each other in his discourse . Never , perhaps , was there seen a more imposing exhibition , than that of Mirabeau wielding his thunders in a hall , that contained three or four thousand auditors , and breaking down whole corporations at a blow . I should have been glad to observe how Napoleon , who thought he could subdue every hostile force by corruption or violence , would have dealt with this great moral colossus . The reported speeches of Mirabeau , as we have already observed , are far from giving an adequate idea of the powers , which produced these prodigious effects . In fact , a report by another hand must necessarily be a very incorrect representation of an able speech . If the reporter , as is generally the case , be an indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sentence , and who has no thoughts and feelings in common with the orator , he brings down , of course , the inspirations of the latter to his own level , and gives , as it were , the ground plat of a magnificent edifice . If , on the contrary , his genius is equal or superior to that of the speaker , his report will still be incorrect , because it will be little more than a transcript of his own views on the same subject . Chatham , for example , was perhaps the greatest orator , taking the word in its proper sense , that ever appeared in England ; and Johnson was a reporter every way fitted , if the thing were possible , to give a just idea of his manner . But in the admirable report of his short and triumphant reply to the sneer of Walpole at his youth , we lose sight of the orator , and plainly recognize the sententious and epigram matic style of the great moralist . Still , however , a representation of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one that can be had . The speech , of which the following report is given in this collection , was reckoned one of the most powerful efforts of Mirabeau , and is well suited by its length for the purpose of extraction . His object was to recommend the adoption , without examination , of a scheme proposed by Necker , then minister of the finances , and embracing several measures of a very desperate character , one of which was a property-tax of twenty-five per cent . His principal topic is the danger of immediate national bankruptcy . // Gentlemen , we have heard a great many violent speeches ; I shall endeavor to direct your attention to a few simple questions , and earnestly entreat you to listen to them . Has not the minister of finances drawn a most alarming picture of our present situation ? Has he not told you that delay must ag*ravate the evil-that a day-an hour  --  a moment-may render it irremediable ? Have we any other plan to substitute for the one he proposes ? One of this assembly answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his plan is unknown , that it would require time to explain and examine it , that were it now in discussion , its author may perhaps be mistaken ; or if not , that we may think he is , and that , without the concurrence of public opinion , the greatest possible talents would be of no avail in the present circumstances . I , too , am far from thinking that Mr Necker has proposed the best possible ways and means ; but God forbid that at this critical moment I should place my views in opposition to his . However preferable I may think them , I know that it is in vain for me to pretend to his prodigious popularity , the reward of such distinguished services , to his long experience , to his reputation of the first financier in Europe , or to the singular and unprecedented good fortune , which has marked his career , more perhaps than that of any former statesman . We must therefore come back to the plan of Mr Necker . But why adopt it without deliberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to examine it in detail , to discuss the principIes , and go over all the calculations ? No , no , a thousand times , no . We can only propose insignificant questions and superficial conjectures . What , then , shall we do by deliberating ? Lose the decisive moment , involve ourselves in disputes about the details of a scheme , which we really do not understand , diminish , by our idle meddlings , the minister 's credit , which is and ought to be greater than our own . Gentlemen , this course is certainly very impolitic . Is there even common honesty in it ? Gentlemen , if we had not proved our respect for the public faith , and our horror of bankruptcy by the most solemn declarations , I could almost venture to scrutinize the secret motives , secret perhaps even to themselves , of those who talk of deliberating upon this great sacrifice , when they must know , that unless made at once , it will be utterly ineffectual . And I would ask those , who seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excessive taxes , whether a national bankruptcy is not itself the most cruel , the most unjust , the most ruinous of all possible taxes ? Gentlemen , one word more , a single word . Two centuries of misgovernment have opened a gulf of ruin , which thre tens immediate destruction to the monarchy . This gulf must be closed . Take , then , the list of the proprietors of // the country ; and select a certain number , whose property shalt be sacrificed to pay the public debt . Choose the richest , that as few citizens as possible may be ruined ; but be sure to choose enough . Come on then ; here are two thousand individuals , who have sufficient property among them to make up the deficit . Strike ; exterminate the whole ; plunge them into the abyss ; it will then close ; the finances will be restored to order , and the kingdom to peace and prosperity . You recoil with horror from this idea ; and yet , inconsistent and pusillanimous souls that you are , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what is still worse , in making it inevitable without decreeing it , you disgrace yourselves by an act a thousand times more criminal ; and , incredible as it may seem , criminal to no purpose . The other sacrifice , however horrible , would at Least relieve you from your emharrassments . But do you think , that when you have declared yourselves bankrupt , you shall thereby be clear of debt ? Will the thousands and millions , who lose in one moment , by this terrible 1 ) 10w and its consequences , all the comforts , perhaps the necessaries of life , allow you to enjoy quietly the advantages of your crime ? Ye cool observers of the incalculable misery that such a consummation would bring upon France , ye selfish souls , who imagine that such convulsions of despair would pass off like the rest , and be only the shorter for their violence , are you very sure that so many millions of starving men will permit you to cover your tables with all the usual delicacies ? No ! you must perish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will find that you have sacrificed all your personal enjoyinents , as well as your honor . This , then , is the point , to which you are advancing . I hear much said of patriotism , appeals to patriotism , transports of patriotism . Gentlemen , why prostitute this noble word ? Is it so very magnanimous to give up a part of your income , in order to save your whole property ? This is simple arithmetic ; and he that hesitates deserves contempt , rather than indignation . Yes , gentlemen , it is to your immediate self-interest , to your most familiar notions of prudence and policy , that I now appeal . I say not to you now , as heretofore , beware how you give the world the first example of an assembled nation untrue to the public faith . I ask you not , as heretofore , what right you have to freedom , or what means of maintaining it , if , at your first step in administration , you outdo in baseness all the old and corrupt governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will all be involve ( l in the general ruin ; and that you are yourselves the persons most deeply interested in making the sacrifice which the government demands of you . I exhort you , then , mo .. t earnestly to vote these extraordinary New . S'cries , No , I I. 2 // ( Jo Jllirabeau 's Speeches . supplies , and God grant they may prove sufficient . Vote them , I beseech you ; for even if you doubt the expediency of the means , you know perfectly well thai the supplies are necessary , and that you are incapable of raising them in any other way . Vote them at once ; for the crisis does not admit of delay ; and if it occurs , we must be responsible for the consequences . Beware of asking for time ; while you are lingering , the evil day will come upon you . Why , gentlemen , it was but a few days since , that upon occasion of some foolish bustle in the Palais Royal , some ridiculous insurrection that existed nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tesigning individuals , we were told with emphasis , Gatiline is at the gates of Rome , and yet we deliberate . We know , gentlemen , that this was all imagination . We are far from being at Rome ; nor is there any Catiline at the gates of Paris* But now we are threatened with a real danger ; bankruptcy , national bankruptcy is before you ; it threatens to swallow up your persons , your property , your honor ,  --  and yet you deliberate . ' The turn at the close of the following extract has sometimes been cited as a happy movement . Mirabeau had proposed an address to the king , requesting him to remove the ministers . It was objected by the other side , that such a request would be an infringement of the royal prerogative , and would be inconsistent with the theory of the division of the supreme power into three branches ; and the example of England , where the house of commons had recently petitioned the king to change his ministers , and the king had in consequence dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion in troduced into public affairs by this system . The orator replies in the following terms to this part of the argument of his ad-versaries But , it is said , you will confound the three powers . We shall soon have occasion to examine this theory of three powers , which , properly analyzed , will perhaps show the ease , with which the mind mistakes words for things , and acquiesces in accustomed conclusions , without taking the trouble to examine the principles upon which they are founded . The valorous champions of the three powers will then inform us , if they can , what hey mean by this large phrase of three powers ; and how they can conceive of the judicial or even of the legislative power , as wholly distinct from the executive . But you forget that the people , whose action you limit by the three powers , is itself the source of all power . You forget that you are disputing the right of the master to control his agents . You forget that we , the representatives of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended , even those of the chief magistrate of the nation , when he attempts to oppose us-you forget that we do not attempt to appoint or remove the ministers by our decrees , but merely to express the opinion of our constituents upon the administration of this or that minister . What then ? Do you refuse us the right of declaring our sentiments , and compel us to contemplate the conduct of ministers in respectful silence , when at the same time you grant us the power of impeaching them , and constituting the court which shall bring them to judgment ? I ) o you not perceive how much more moderate I am than you , and how much more favorably I deal with the government ? You leave no interval between perfect silence and impeachment . As for me , I give notice , before I impeach ; 1 object , before I punish ; I afford opportunity for weakness and error to withdraw , before I treat them as crimes . But look at Great Britain , see what agitation is there produced by the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost . England lost ? Great God ! what disastrous news ! But tell me then in what latitude did this happen ? What earthquake , what vast convulsion of nature swallowed up that famous island , that exhaustless store house of great examples , that classic ground of the friends of liberty ? But surely you are mistaken ; England is still flourishing for the eternal instruction of the world . England is repairing in glorious tranquillity the wounds she inflicted on herself in a paroxysm of fever . England is car* rying to perfection every branch of industry and exploring every path that leads to wealth and greatness . You are thinking of some debate in parliament-there as elsewhere , generally mere verbiage . You are alarmed at the dissolution of the house of commons ! ' &amp;c . The idea of the subordination of all the departments of government to the supreme power of the people , which is in. * sisted on at the beginning of the above extract , is doubtless perfectly correct ; and it suited the argument of Mirabeau to treat the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sovereignty of the people . In reality , however , it is highly favorable to it , because it , regards the executive magistrate , who claims in most countries to be the sovereign , as a mere functionary on a level with the other magistrates , entrusted with the duties of legislation and judg- .. ment . This view of the executive office constitutes the real distinction between rational and arbitrary notions of govern-* ment ; and involves in itself the whole theory of liberty . The name of powers applied to the branches of administra .. tion is perfectly harmless ; and no more connects the essential // sovereignty with the office to which it is affixed , than the pow-. er of attorney to manage an estate conveys a good title to it . The following answer was made by Mirabeau , then presiding in the national assembly , to an address from a deputation of the sect of quakers . He refutes all their principles with great nonchalance , at the same time that he is overwhelming them with a profusion of polite and complimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delicate persiflage . Gentlemen ! the quakers who fled from persecution and tyranny had a right to address themselves with confidence to the first legislative assembly which ever enacted the rights of man in the forms of law ; and France in the enjoyment of her new institutions and in the bosom of peace will become a second Pennsylvania . We admire the philanthropy of your principles . They remind us of the infancy of the human race when society was still in the patriarchal state , and men were united by affections , habits , and mutual wants . Doubtless the principles which should tend to restore this state of things would be the most favorable of all to happiness and virtue . ' We shall not examine your ideas considered as matters of opinion . We have already pronounced upon this point , and recognized the truth that every man is independent as regards his thoughts . As a citizen , he submits to government ; as a thinking being , he acknowledges no political authority . Nor shall we inquire into the correctness of your religious views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as free as his thoughts . What government would venture to place itself between man and his maker ? It is only as rules ot society that we shall look at your doctrines , and they will be submitted to the discussion of the legislative body . This assembly will inquire whether the manner in which you certify the regularity of marriages and births is sufficiently formal to afford the necessary security to morals and property ; and whether an affirmation made under the pains and penalties of perjury is not substantially equivalent to an oath . You are mistaken , my excellent fellow citizens : you have already taken the oath of allegiance which every citizen regards as a pleasure rather than a duty . You have not called God to witness , but you have sworn by your consciences ; and is not conscience an emanation from divinity ? You say that an article of your belief prohibits you under any pretence from bearing arms . This religious obligation to preserve peace is a beautiful idea ; hut is not ' self defence also a religious duty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered liberty for you and all of us , why should you refuse to assist us in mainiainiu* it * Would your brothers in Pennsylvania have allowed // their wives and children to be butchered by the savages , rather than repulse an attack by force ? and is not a tyrant the worst of savages ? The Assembly will , however , in its wisdom , do justice to all your demands ; and whenever I meet a quaker , I s a say to him ; my brother , if YOU have a right to be free , you have a right to prevent yourself from being made a slave . Since you l6ve your neighbor , do not suffer him to be the victim of oppression ; this would be equivalent to killing him yourself . You are fond of peace ; but weakness is the real cause of war ; and universal peace can only result from universal ability to resist aggression . The Assembly invites you to assist at the sitting . We shall close this article with the short funeral oration pronounced by Mirabeau upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous ; but it is not always that lofty language is so well justified by the dignity of the subject , as in the case of our illustrious townsman . Gentlemen ! Franklin is dead . The genius which delivered America , and poured such floods of light upon Europe , has returned to the bosom of the divinity . The sage whom both worlds clai.m as their own , whose name is recorded with equal honor iii the history of government , and that of science , is justly entitled to be reckoned among those who have done the greatest honor to our species . It has long been the practice of courts to inform each other of the decease of individuals who were only great in funeral orations , and to notice these events by formal mournings . But nations should mourn for none but their benefactors ; and their representatives should recommend to their attention and regret no others but the heroes of humanity . The Congress has ordered a mourning of two months for the death of Franklin , through the fourteen United States ; and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her political fathers . Would it not become us , Gentlemen , to join in this pious act , to take a part in this public homacre to the rights of man , and to the philosopher , who has contributeA more than any other to ensure their acknowledgment through the world . Antiquity would have raised altars to this mighty genius , who compassed earth and sky to accomplish his benevolent objects ,  --  who mastered the bolt of heaven and the sceptre of tyranny . Our free and enlightened country owes , at least , some mark of recollection and regret , to one of the greatest men that ever served the cause of philosophy and freedom . I propose that the National Assemhl*r *t ear mourning three days for the death of Benjamin Franklin .
