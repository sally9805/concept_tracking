Travels through North . dmerica , during the Years 1825 anJ 1826 . By his Highness , BERNHARD , DUKE ( iF SAXEWEIMAR-EISENACH . In Two Volumes . Philadelphia . 1828 . THE general character , displayed in these volumes , is that of a philanthropic and sensible observer . The merit which they possess is in part negative . They are not written in a spirit of haughtiness and intolerance ; the author neither affects to disdain nor to admire republican institutions . He never indulges in satire , and is never pert or malignant . We lay down the volume , with respect for his moral worth and general fairness and candor . But a book to be interesting needs much more . We have here no general views , no acute observations on social or political life among us . The account which is given of some of our cities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits . A very large proportion of the Travels is // composed of the most uninteresting details ; and the incidents which are noted , gaih their value , such as it is , from the circumstance , that the chief person in the narrative is a foreigner and a man of distinguished rank by birth and in public service . It was a highly honorable motive , which induced this princely traveller to come among us . A benevolent curiosity led him to a country , where social life and the civil institutions are so widely different from those of Europe , that the largest opportunity was afforded for extending his knowledge of man . It must have been a contrast , to one horn and in part educated on the well cultivated banks of the little stream that flows through Weimar , to have found himself on the Father of Waters ; and for one not unaccustomed to the splendor and comforts of a palace , to sit down on even terms at the frugal but hospitable board of an American farmer . The love of enlarged intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , was certainly well suited to conciliate a friendly feeling on all sides ; and the unassuming deportment of the Prince while among us , continued to increase the pleasant impression . He was , therefore , hospitably received , wherever he went ; and his willingness to be pleased , and his eagerness to see all public institutions , were met , throughout the country , by liberal attention and hoepitable regard . It was to himself while among us , that this return of courtesy was certainly due . But we are not certain , that he has done well to make a book about his travels ; or that the same regard is due to him in his new aspect of an author . The Duke is doubtless a man of good judgment and fair mind ; but he is not an interesting writer ; and the notes , which he has seen fit to consent to publish , may have been extremely well suited for the eyes of parents and near kindred , but we think are many of them such as never should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those , who called on him , and tells at whose house he dined , and where be took tea , he only . enumerates what is of no general interest ; but when he tells what kind of an entertainment he received , how many daughters his host had , and whether they were pretty or not , whether the house was well or meanly furnished , and how old and how wise the ladies were whom he visited , though he still says nothing that can be called malicious or untrue , he offends , as it seems to us , most egregiously against good taste and a sense of propriety . There is an end of all hospitality , when an account of it is to // come back in a book ; and the household circle will have to be better guarded , if every one who enters it may go away and publish to the world a description of it . We repeat , the Duke is never malicious , and seldom says unpleasant things ; but it is essentially wrong to print and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civility and consideration for a respected stranger . Nor can we express entire confidence in the observations of the Duke , even though they are generally limited to the notice of particular incidents . When , at New Orleans , he praises the superior decency , modesty , and propriety of a bali , where white men went to visit colored women , it is his sympathy with an unfortunate class of beings , which gets the better of his judgment ; for , on a second and a third visit , he found nothing but drunkenness and the aspect of a den of ruffians . ' When , in Georgia , he sees a gentleman and lady on horseback , and a negro woman by their side , carrying a heavy sack of corn , he goes too far in inferring that the negress had to keep up with the horses and carry grain for them . And when he says of Alabama , that the senators are obliged , at the seat of government , to sleep three on one mattrass , and feed almost exclusively on salt pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes and credulity are not common ; on the contrary , the volumes are generally distinguished by plain good sense . The illustrious traveller arrived at Boston on the 26th of July . It was ten o'clock , on the morning of the 26th of July , when I first placed my foot in America , upon a broad piece of granite ! It is impossible to describe what I felt at that instant . Heretofore , but two moments of my life had left a delightful remembrance ; the first was , when at seventeen years of age , I received the Cross of the Legion of Honor , after the battle of Wagram-  --  the second , when my son William was born . My landing in America , that 4xtuntry which , frorm* my early youth , had been the object of my warmest wishes , will , throughout life , remain a subject of pleasing recollection ! ' Vol. m. p. 33 . At the Exchange Coffee-House he has the good sense to respect the landlord , and it does not even occur to him to jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under good auspices , he enters on his career of observation . The streets are wide ' and well built , the stores elegant ' ; yet the Mall is but casually noticed . He had expected that no one would take . the least notice of him in America , ' but gentlemen , who // live in large and handsome houses and have amiable daughters , . gave him invitations . 4iI*enerally , ' he observes of the Bostonians , the houses and rooms are much larger , richer , better lighted , and more airy , than the English . ' Of Cambridge nothing is said , that is worth remarking . The Duke also visited the State Prison , and gives an abstract of the warden 's report . He visits Bunker 's Hill , and apparently with proper feelings . He interrupts his narration to speak of Miss Wright , whom he never saw ; and , in a later part of the work , quotes her as of the opinion that bears are of more value than men . ' * At the Hospital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen , ' says he , many hospitals , but none in which the sick were so conveniently and suitably lodged , and none in which cleanliness was so well observed . ' t Equal praise for cleanliness is given to the Asylum for the Insane . Mr Quincy took him and two Dutch gentlemen to visit the elder Adams . We quote the account of the visit , as indicative of the correet and liberal feelings , by which the Duke was animated . I was much affected when , as I approached this venerable man who had so efficiently labored in the cause of American Independence , he extended to me his hand . lie was still in full possession of his mental faculties , and remembered , not only the things which had occurred long ago , but knew also everything which had recently taken place , or was now passing . His bodily strength , however , was diminishing , and he felt a weakness , particularly in his legs . He conversed with me about half an hour , especially concerning Holland , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of his ancient countenance revived again as he dwelt on the fact , that it was owing to him that Holland then declared war against England , and the English ambassador , not . withstanding all his intrigues , could effect nothing . When Mr Tromp was introduced to him , he remembered his great ancestor , shook his hand in a friendly manner , was much affected , and said to him , " God bless you , Van Tromp ! " We left this worthy old man in deep emotion , and congratulated each other on our good fortune in having been introduced to this departing veteran of a revolution , which may well be called salutary . ' Vol. i. p. 44 . His general opinion of the prosperity of the great body of the community is satisfactory . * See Yet . II . p. 91. t See Vol . I. p. 43. // From Boston to Quincy there is a good turnpike road . It runs over some hills , on which the traveller*es a handsome panorama ; behind him the city , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome farms , on the right the Blue Hills . We passed by several neat farm-houses ; the grounds are separated by means of dry walls , the stones of which are partly hewn , and separated from each other , somewhat like those of Scotland . No old trees are found , because the first settlers very imprudently destroyed all the wood , and now it must be raised again with much trouble . Lombardy poplars and plane trees are frequent . The inhabitants generally appear to be in good circumstances , at least the farmers seem to prosper , and the houses appear to great advantage ; for instance , we remarked a common village blacksmith 's shop , which was built of massive granite . ' pp. 44 , 45 . And again we find similar remarks in an account of an excursion to Waltham . After leaving this factory we passed by several very neat houses and parks ; the latter are smaller than those in England , because in this country there are no rights of primogeniture , and the estate of parents at their death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this account we do not find such great and powerful landholders here as in England . It is a subject of dispute , whether primogeniture or equal division be preferable ; but it is certain that real prosperity is much more diffused through the nation in America , and the land is better cultivated . ' p. 46 . The Navy-yard was also visited . It gives occasion to a story , not very decent , and to a criticism , which may be worth noting . Some methods which tend to strengthen and relieve vessels , used in other places , have not yet been adopted here ; for instance , I did not observe the cruciform strengthening of the sides , and the diagonal deck , according to the plan of Sir Robert Seppings , from which two improvements the navies of England and the Netherlands derive the greatest advantage . ' p. 47 . Neither were the schools omitted ; and the highest testimony is borne to their merit . It appears to me impossible , ' says he , that young people , who receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad mesi. ' - ' I was indeed affected when I left the schools , and could not but congratulate Mr Quincy from the bottom of my heart , on such a rising generation . ' The State-house was not admired ; nor the trophies and monuments of the revolution . Since that period a statue has been erected there , which would have won a more respectful notice . No monument can be more nobly or suitably placed , // than is Chantrey 's Washington . Standing as the state-house does on an elevated site , the statue looks out upon the first scene ot ' American success and of Washington 's own glory . The general effect produced by it , in connexion with the admirable prospect that is opened upon the Common and the villages to the south of Boston , a prospect such as few capitals can boast , is altogether of the highest and most pleasing kind . No public honor which has been shown to the memory of Washington , has been more appropriate in its design , or executed in better taste . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of this admirable work of sculpture . On leaving Boston , the I*uke gives a general summary of his impressions . And they certainly are very much in favor of our good city . Thus passed almost fourteen days , in an uncommonly pleasing and instructive manner . In general my state of health allowed me to enjoy every new and interesting object with serenity of mind ; I was indisposed but two days , and this was probably owing to the excessive heat . Even the intermediate hours , which could not be dedicated to the inspection of public institutions , generally afforded instructive amusements . I passed the morning in reading and writing , then received or paid visits , and at all times met with attention , courteousness , and kindness . I visited the churches on the Sundays I passed in Boston , which are still more quietly kept in America than in England . ' I dined twice at the inn , but generally accepted some friendly invitation , and passed all my evenings very agreeably in company at musical parties and other entertainments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those already mentioned . The society , especially when ladies are not present , is uncommonly fine and lively-both sexes are very well educated and accomplished ; So much care is bestowed upon the education of the female sex , that it would perhaps be considered in other countries as superfluous . Young ladies even learn Latin and Greek , but then they also can speak of other , things besides fashions and teatable subjects . ' Many of those gentlemen who are met with in such society , have travelled in Europe , sometimes accompanied by their wives ; Europeans are frequently present , and thus there is no want of materials for conversation . The generality of the houses , moreover , offer something attractive in the fine arts ; and in returning home on an evening , the city , the bridges , and the Mill-dam are very well lighted , not indeed with gas , but with reflecting lamps , and none of hat disorderly conduct is observed in the // streets , which so often shocks the mind in the cities of England . ' pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without declaring how dear and valued ' it had become to him , and how agreeable and instructive ' a longer stay would have been . These several phrases of particular regard seem to be omitted in the translation . Travelling on the turnpikeroad , the Duke failed to pass through the villages , and the country seemed more thinly settled than he had expected . At Worcester he acknowledges the hospitality of Mr Lincoln , and the laudable zeal of the inhabitants for science ; but does not commend the horticulture of the place . An American may smile , as he next reads an elaborate description of the common Virginia fence . To make it intelligible to his European readers the Duke is at the pains to make a drawing of it . The abundance of granite in the heart of the commonwealth is noted . Of more value is the comment on the morality of the manufacturing population , and the remark , which is perfectly sound and well attested by experience , that the large manufacturing establishments especially promote the welfare of the poorer classes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the protection of manufactures as desired in Massachusetts , that the demand for that protection arose with the great mass of the community ; and that the capitalists and public men did not generally advocate it , till the voice of the many demanded it . Arrived in Northampton , the Duke cursorily praises the fertile valley of the Connecticut , the piety of the people , and the beauty of the ladies , whom he saw come out of church . The ladies should certainly forgive the stare at their excess in religious observances . Descending the river only as far as Springfield , the United States Armory was of course inspected . The very ingenious machine , invented by Mr Blanchard , for turning gun-stocks , is described at large on another occasion . But an artificial description gives no idea of the simplicity and beauty of the process . The other circumstances , which distinguish Springfield and make it the most populous and thriving town in the state , away from the seaboard , are not noticed . Ascending a branch of the Westfield river the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stream descends , and which has wildness and beauty enough to recommend itself to any lover of the picturesque . Indeed any , who think fin*i // scenery worth visiting , need not roam farther than Berkshire for it , for from one line of the state to the other , there is the most agreeable interchange of all , that enters into a fine landscape . New England will one day he as celebrated for the beauty of her scenery , as for any qualities that belong to her sons . Arrived in Albany ( it was on a later occasion that New Lebanon was i4sited ) , he had opportunities of witnessing the hopes , that were so securely founded on the influence of the canal . The darn , separating the basin from the river , seems , ' it is said , to have been badly executed . ' The horse ferry-boats , an American invention , excited curiosity . The splendor of the steam-boats on the Hudson very well merited admiration . Our traveller proceeds without delay to the West . At that time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entertained . The Duke pr*idently suggests a doubt , and predicts the necessity of expensive repairs . The expenses will , in a very short time , be replaced , and the state realize an immense profit , unless it be necessary to make great repairs , which I have no doubt will be the case , and will consequently require a large share of this income . Hitherto the great canal system was unkown in the United States , and was rather unpopular . It might have been expected , therefore , that so great and rapid an undertaking would have a tendency to astound , if we may so speak , the public mind ; so that this canal was finished as soon as possible , without calling to aid the great experience possessed by other nations . Notwithstanding , this canal , which is three hundred and sixty-two miles in length , with eighty-three locks , between the Hudson and Lake Erie , which lies six hundred and eighty*.eight feet above the level of the former river , does the greatest honor to the genius of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Holland , and England , will readily perceive , that the water-works of this country afford much room for improvement . ' pp. 61 , 6*2 . The canal which will require less expensive repairs than any other in our country , is perhaps the Blackstone . The nature of the descent has generally made no high banks necessary ; the locks are of stone ; and the water is retained on the one side commonly by the everlasting hills ; on the other by a solid mass of gravel , protected by almost continuous walls of granite , in which the region abounds . // On reaching Utica , his admiration for American enterprise makes itself heard . It is here , that a person begins to admire the great advances , which this youthful country has made in cultivation , and acquires entirely new ideas of human activity and enterprise . ' Proceeding towards Buffalo , the Duke passed through the settlement of the Oneida Indians . Their land belongs to the whole tribe , and the labor bestowed upon it is for the general good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in civilized Europe ; ' and why ? we may ask . Because children came along the carriage to beg . ' They were however Indian children . In another place the Duke is reminded of Europe by the sight of numerous grog-shops . No man can visit the Western part of the State of New York without being somewhat moved by the spirit of the scene . The Duke is no enthusiast , but he seems rightly to estimate the wonderful results of human industry , as exhibited in that section of the country ; and takes notice of the rapid progress and . beautiful appearance of the towns . At Buffalo he was favored with a military spectacle . It was a militia parade , consisting of thirty men , including seven officers and two comets . They were formed like a battalion , into six divisons , and performed a number of maneuvres . The members were not all provided with muskets , but had rammods instead . Only the officers and the rifle-company , four men strong , were in uniform . The band consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colonel 's epaulets and drawn sword ! ' p. 74 . So much for our militia system , which , if efflcient*anywhere , should be so on the frontiers . The Duke must certainly be in the conspiracy to overturn this venerable sytem , which , though a grievous burden to those who serve , and a jest to those who look on , yet offers the best excuse for a parade and the surest way to a showy dress and and a sounding title . Our traveller visited Niagara , and then proceeded down the St Lawrence as far as Quebec . The hospitality which was shown him by various families is acknowledged ; he tells who were his travelling companions , and which of them he liked best ; mentions the ball to which he was invited , and gives the name of the lady , who , in his eyes , was the most genteelly drest . As the occurrences of this part of his tour are much the same , as may befall any one in descending the St Lawrence , we shall merely give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left this place before we-sailed round a promontory , on which stands Fort Henry , into the St Lawrence . This river is here very wide , and forms an archipelago about fifty miles in length , called the Thousand Islands . The English and American commissioners for deteripining the boundary line , took the pains to count these islands , and found that they amounted to sixteen hundred and ninety-two ; in this calculation , however , they have included every projecting rock , even if it had but a singlb tree . This archipelago presents a beautiful prospect ; most of the islands are rocky , and are overgrown with trees , generally cedars . Here and there a fir reared his lofty head , which , generally growing upon the bare rocks , where the trees are less numerous , presents a picturesque appearance . ' p. 83 . Six miles below Prescott we arrived at a few islands called the Gallop Islands , and the first rapids . As we approached , the water appeared to be boiling , and high foaming billows arose , over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the swells at sea , but they are very short and rapid in their movement . As our Durham-boat , however , was remarkably long , it divided them without producing any disagreeable motion . ' p. 84 . The shores and islands of the river are generally covered with cedar trees , and amongst them we observed some neat houses and churches , with bright tin roofs . At the village of Coteau des Cadres , we were obliged to encounter the last and most dangerous rapid , called the Cascades . The waves were uncommonly high , and our vessel passed over the dangerous parts with incredible velocity . Along these rapids there is also a canal provided with locks , and intended to facilitate the ascent of vessels . If these rapids are viewed from the shore , it appears incredible that a canoe should venture in without being swallowed up . Such a misfortune , however , does not happen , as we had just proved . Below . this rapid the river , where it receives the Ottawa , again spreads out so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 . The river is throughout from one to two miles wide , but fiftytwo miles below Trois Rivi*res , at the village of Richelieu , it becomes narrower , and here are the last rapids , called Rapides do Richelieu . The banks , which as far as this place are pretty low , become higher and more rocky , particularly on the left side . The neighborhood is remarkably handsome and picturesque . The majestic stream , with its pleasant banks and the view of the distant blue mountains near Quebec , produce an indescribable effect . ' We reached **uebec at 10 o'clock in the evening . This city consists of two parts , the upper town , which is built on a rock , and the lower , which is pressed in between the river and the rock . ' p. 91. // The citadel is a new work , and not quite finished . The English speak with a kind of exultation of the fortifications of Quebec , and compare it to Gibraltar . I also expected something extraordinary , but can not say that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers make use of bricks which are burned in England , for building the casemates of the fortification . A thousand of these bricks cost the government , including transportation , two pounds ten shillings ! The reason they give is , that the bricks burned here , crack in the winter . I rather believe that the preference of these foreign bricks has some other reason . ' p. 93 . Generally speaking , the towns in Canada bear a very poor comparison with those of the United States , and will never arrive at the same point , because the settlers in Canada are mostly poor Scotchmen and Irishmen , who come out at the expense of the government ; they receive land , and are oppressed by the feudal system , which opposes all prosperity ; emigrants , however , who possess some property , and have an ambitious spirit , settle themselves in the United States , where nobody is oppressed ; on the contrary , where all the laws are in their favor . ' p. 96 . The return to New York was by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the battle ground at Plattsburgh could not be visited . The Duke also failed to see Vermont , as he merely touched at Burlington and at Shoreham . This was a capital mistake in one , whose object was to see the United States . No portion of the Union offers a more exact or successful exemplification of the great principles of our democracy . Had he visited the interior of that state , he would have seen a portion of the Union eminently distinguished by the sublimity of its mountains , and the beauty of its valleys and copiomis streams ; but he would also have seen a sovereign state , covering a large territory , in which there is a nearer approach to equality than in any of the far-famed democratic cantons of Switzerland ; a state , in which the people every year resume every function of government , reappointing not only the executive and legislative branches , but the judiciary and every peace officer , even to the village justice ; a state , which enjoys wise and equal laws and perfect security of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common wages of journeymen mechanics , and its chief magistrate not much more ; a state , filled up with mountains , and yet having roads as good and as level as abriost any in the Union . In a word , the state of Vermont exhibits a condition of society , such as the most visionary enthusiast for liberty never ventured to dream of ; a condition , // 237 1829. which leaves to the individual perhaps the greatest degree of personal and public liberty , which is consistent with the organization of social life . But the Duke failed to read the lesson ; he has nothing to say of Vermont , except that the elderly women there smoke tobacco . As we follow him up the lake , we find him stopping to observe the ruins of Fort Ticonderoga , and speculating on the adaptation of several points for places of military strength . Fort George , ' he observes , C lies in an advantageous situation , commands the whole southern shore of the lake , with a large part of the vicinity , stands , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is covered on one side by a morass . On the eastern side alone , it is commanded by a high mountain , which , however , is at some distance . If the American government should resolve to restore Crownpoint and Ticonderoga , the latter particularly would be adapted , after fortifying the two mountains , Defiance and Independence , for an arsenal of a superior kind ; it might contain large depots , serve as a fortified camp , and be successfully defended by a small garrison . Here fleets might be completed to command Lake Champlain , and an expedition against Isle aux Noix and Canada organized . However , a good road would be necessary , leading from Ticonderoga to the northern point of Lake George , three miles distant , and here it would be necessary to protect the place of embarkation by a fort . A new fort , on the same spot where Fort George was erected , would be necessary . There is a good locality between this fort and Fort William Henry to found a dock . ' yard . The communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly protected by the southern point of Lake Champlain , towards Whitehall , and by Lake George . If the English should attack the United States on this side , they would undoubtedly waste much strength , and not advance a step , unless they had seized Ticonderoga. ' pp. 102 , 103 . In general the Duke seems to take every occasion to observe the scenes , which are conspicuous in the military annals of the country ; and indulges a good deal in speculations on our means of defence and attack . Still there exists in the country neither a wish to provide for a forcible occupation of Canada , nor any serious apprehension of any formidable attack on the side of the sea . The only places , in which the English could maintain themselves in the northern part . of the Union , would be such portions of territory as are thinly settled , and where the occupation would cost England a great deal and yield little advantage . A great deal is often said on . the incapacity of our gov-. // eminent in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something of this may be true of a confederation of states . But it is counterbalanced by the immense advantage , that the credit and the power of the Union are sustained and renewed by the separate credit and power of each member of the confederacy . When the national treasury is exhausted , the nation still has its resources in the treasuries of the several states ; and if the enemy threatens annoyance from the sea on various points , the states themselves may anticipate the efforts of the general government , and protect their territory by forces , raised on their own credit and by their own authority . Such events actually signalized the last war ; and where treasure was lavished , and life endangered for defence , it seems idle to question patriotism . The Duke was too late in the season for Saratoga . Yet a few persons remained . Here too the battle grounds especially interest him , and most of all , the tomb of the brave General Fraser . One of the best , perhaps the best description of the defeat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting narrative of the Baroness de Riedesel . It is a . lively picture , drawn by a lady of fine mind and character , a constant witness of the scenes of terror and distress in the British camp . As he hastens to Albany , the Shakers of New Lebanon are not neglected . The Duke is pleased with their general appearance . For their neatness he can find no parallel but in the Boston hospital . He praises their butter and their cheese ; but most of all their hogs . It is a rare pleasure to walk about in a Shaker pig-sty. ' * One would not have expected exactly this remark from a soldier and a prince . The Duke met with an unfortunate accident on his return from New Lebanon . Indeed he was overturned eight several times in the United States ; yet , for all that , not one word of petulant complaint escapes him , and he tells of his disasters with extreme good humor . Recovering from his bruises , he descends the Hudson to West Point ; where he spent two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he bade a reluctant and affectionate farewell . The view from Fort Putnam reminds him of the banks of the Rhine . On the subject of historical recollections he feels like a man of honor . We quote his words . // During the revolution this fort was erected , like Fort Clinton , and was impregnable . To seize it , the English had recourse to bribery , and General Arnold , who commanded West Point , was on the point of delivering this position to them . This disgraceful treachery was fortunately prevented by the seizure of Major Andri. ' p. 115 . On the right shore of the latter Tappan Sea is the town of Tappan , where , condemned by the court-martial as a spy , Major Andr6 was hanged and buried . The English government ordered him to be dug up some years ago , and his remains to be transported to England , if I am not mistaken , to be laid in Westminster Abbey ; whilst the remains of General Fraser , who fell like a hero in open battle , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest memorial in the old redoubt of Stillwater ! The tree , which grew on Andre 's grave , was also taken to England , and , as I was assured , transplanted to the royal garden , behind Carlton Palace . ' p. 118 . Fine personal qualities may excite compassion ; but the death of the man , who falls in an attempt to further the commission of an atrocious crime , is a subject rather for silent and secret commiseration than for public honor . We are glad , that the Duke remained long enough at West Point to feel an interest in the establishment , and cordial respect for those , to whose active exertions the Military Academy owes its elevated reputation . indeed the character of West Point has benefited the whole army . In another place the Duke remarks , that there is scarcely any army in Europe in which the corps of officers is better composed than in the small American army ; since in the United States no one can be an officer , if he is not well educated . The officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' If a young man is seen in the uniform of an American officer , it may with confidence be inferred , that he is in every respect fit to maintain his place in the best society . ' Such testimony has a value from the military rank of the individual who gives it . Arrived , in New York , the city was so crowded with strangers , that he could with difficulty find lodgings . At length established , he sallies forth for observation . The City Hall did not please him ; nor any of the churches . The public institutions , the schools , the hospitals , the Museum , the Navy-yard , and various other places are all registered as having been visited // No opinions , worth citing , are expressed ; and in fact the Travels are here , as too often , little more than a dull , nonotonous detail of visits to the objects of public curiosity . In general the Duke seems pleased . In this manner eight days soon elapsed , and amusement was not wanting , as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed my time in cheerful and pleasant company . At dinner and evening parties I continued to make interesting acqu*iintances with men of different occupations and professions . I observed that the families I visited were richly furnished with silver , china , and glass ; the fine arts also contributed to the ornament of their apartments . At the evening parties we commonly had music and dancing . The dinner parties consisted generally of from twenty to thirty persons , whose conversation was generally refi.ned . In*New York , as.well as at all other ph*ces , where English customs prevail , the ladies leave the table during the dessert , and the gentlemen keep their seats ; however , nobody is obliged to drink , unless he feels inclined . Every one rises and leaves the house without ceremony . ' p. 126 . We pass to Philadelphia and its environs ; dear Philadelphia , as the Duke terms it on nearer acquaintance . We have descriptions of the bridges , ' the water-works , the shot-towers and other matters of equal notoriety . Generally our traveller 's judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts , and still finer of philanthropy , in that city , whose history is so peaceful , and whose situation is so favored . But on West 's picture of Christ healing the sick , he expresses himself harshly . Neither the composition nor the execution seems successful * and perhaps it is only here , where they are unaccustomed to see great and well executed paintings , * that this could excite the great admiration it has done . ' This is saying too much . It would have been quite enough to deny the merit of the picture , without denying the competency of its admirers to judge at all . There is one other subject of vastly more importance , discussed on occasion of visiting the new Penitentiary . Omitting the description of the building , we can not forbear to quote the Duke 's remarks ; partly because they form the largest specimen of reasoning in the volume , partly because the matter is of great *noMent . I do not now wish to enter upon the question whether it is advisable to abolish capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this solitary confinement , in which the prisoner is prohibited // from all human converse , without work , exercise , and almost without fresh air , is even worse than punishment by death . From want of exercise they will certainly become sickly ; from the want of work they will become unaccustomed to labor , and perhaps lose what skill they may have possessed heretofore in their trades , so that when restored to the world , they will be useless for any kind of business , and merely drag out a miserable existence . No book is allowed them but the Bible . It appears therefore to me perfectly possible , that this insulation of the prisoner will be injurious to his mind , and drive him to fanaticism , enthusiasm , and even derange .. ment . When Mr Vaux asked my opinion of this prison , I could not refrain from answering him that it reminded me of the Spanish inquisition , as described by Llorente . Mr Vaux answered that it is only an experiment to ascertain whether capital punishment can be abolished ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an expensive one , because the building has already cost three hundeed and fifty thousand dollars , and the state of Pennsylvania will have to expend annually for its support , an immense sum . The first great object of a government ought to be to provide for the welfare of its good citizens , and not to oppress them with taxes ; on the contrary , to relieve them as much as possible , as it is hard for the good citizens to have to maintain vagabonds , for the sake of deterring others by example , or to render convicts harmless . In this view it should be the object of the government to arrange the prisons so that convicts can maintain themselves . When once this is realized , then it is likewise easier to improve their moral principles . If it be possible that the prisoner can earn a little surplus money , in order that when he returns to society he may be in possession of a small sum for his pressing necessities , I believe it would be much better than any philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bethlehem was particularly grateful to the Duke , who throughout the work displays a mind capable of relishing the simple beauties of unaffected nature . We regret , that we can not quote his expressions of satisfaction . Returning to Philadelphia he continued his visits . At a Wistar-Party he met the President of the United States . The President is a man about sixty years old , of rather short stature , with a bald head , and of a very plain and worthy appearance . He speaks little , but what he does speak is to the purpose . I must confess that I seldom in my life have felt so true and sincere a reverence as at the moment when this honorable gentleman , whom eleven millions of people have thought worthy to elect as their chief magistrate , shook hands with me . ' C Unfortunately I could // not long converse with him , because every member of the party had greater claims than myself . ' p. 157 . This sentiment of respect is becoming in a descendant of one of the most distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very little of political matter in the volumes ; the only great question , on which a very decided opinion is given , is that respecting internal improvements . Reasonable men , ' it is said , conceive that the government must have the power to execute such works ; the short-sighted dispute this right . ' * From Philadelphia the Duke of course went to hospitable Baltimore . Maryland was the first slave-holding state , which he entered . The moderation with which he speaks of the subject is worthy of commendation . The state of Maryland is the first in which I set my foot where the slavery of negroes is legally maintained . Farther to the south , this state of i*hings is everywhere common . I merely mention the fact ; it doer not belong to me to give opinions on so delicate a subject . Still my journey convinced me of the truth of the old observation , that inaccurate judgments are easily formed respecting things not sufficiently known , which we have neither seen nor examined ourselves . ' p. 162 . The topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most annoying for discussion with a foreigner . The United States are in fact not at all answerable for the existence of slavery within their limits ; their only responsibility relates to its extension . The very worthy and learned man still lives in our vicinity , whose high honor it was to draft the bill in Congress , by which slavery was excluded from the vast region north of the Ohio . If personal honor is to be *ittributed to men in proportion to the beneficial results , which follow their labors , we have hardly ar*ong us any one , who is more worthy of it . To have been prominently active in such a cause would be honor enough ; but if the case was such as left the course that would he pursued by Congress doubtful , and such that a clear and well digested measure needed to be proposed in order to decide what was uncertain , then may the very unpretending individual to whom we refer , feel a pleasure , which no prai*e can equal , in contemplating the immense influence of his legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effects are incalculable. // But to return to our author . He liked Baltimore very much . He found the society very agreeable ; at dinners , everything was unceremonious , and the conversation very instructive and lively ; the evening parties afford excellent music ; the ladies in general are very handsome , and sing very well . ' At Washington , Congress was of course not in session . The account of that city is wholly without interest . It commemorates the visits , which were rendered ; and has a catalogue of inventions at the patent- fflce . The pictures in the Rotunda are condemned . The composition and execution are both found fault with . The l ) ainter was , however , placed under restraint by want of taste in his countrymen for the fine arts , who. resemble , in that respect , their English ancestors ; the posture alm6st of every single person having he en prescribed him . ' Setting aside the unnecessary charge of a want of taste brought against us and the English , the assertion in the last sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed a very strange thing . There must be some mistake . The manner in which Washington is laid out is compared to Carlsruhe . The resemblance holds good , in so far as the avenues diverge from one point ; in every other respect of situation and grandeur of view Washington is immeasurably before Carlsruhe . One word more as to Washington . I had a long conversation with the secretary of war , Mr Barbour , and General Macomnb on military subjects . I differed in opinion from the secretary about the efficiency of militia-men , of whom he seemed to entertain too high an opinion . ' In Virginia the Duke visited Harper 's Ferry , the Natural Bridge , the University , and the largest towns . At Staunton , though doubtless he was among very peaceable men , he met with no less than three generals and a suitable number of officers of lower dignity . There is hardly a town of respectable size in the country , but can show about as many . In conversing with these gentlemen , ' he adds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginians possess . I was astonished to hear them praising hereditary nobility and primogeniture. ' * It is rather too much to infer anything against the spirit of the Virginians ; especially from a conversation which was probably purely speculative . The state , which gave // to the country Jefferson and Madison , can not be charged with affording no support to the purity of democratic institutions . Of Charlottesville we have an account , and a plan of the Vir .. ginia University . Of the buildings it is complained , that they are already decaying , and that the effect of them is poor from the want of harmony . The Sage of Monticello had invited the Duke to dine . He was obliged to go on foot . Oar long walk , caused such a delay , that we found the company at table when we entered ; but Mr Jefferson came very kindly to meet us , forced us to our seats , and ordered dinner to be served up anew . He was an old man of eighty-six years of age , of tall stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation he was very lively , and his spirits , as also his hearing and sight , seemed not to have decreased at all with his advancing age . I found him a man who retained his faculties remarkably well in his old age , and one would have taken him for a man of sixty . ' pp. 197 , 198 . From Richmond the Duke descended the James river , and tells the story of Pocahontas of course ; but without any important variation . The visit to Old Point Comfort gives an opportunity of commenting on the very great neatness and order , which prevail on board an American frigate . Proceeding to Charleston by land , ' the wheat bread became scarce by degrees , and in its place we had a sort of cakes , made of Indian corn . ' Again he observes , in North Carolina candles and lamps seem to be very scarce ; for the few houses which we passed , were lighted with torches of pine . ' At night his lodgings were at a solitary plantation . It was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through the cracks in the floor we could see into the room below . " The log houses of the slaves are said also to produce a surprising effect by night , as the glow of the pine torches shines through the frequent crevices . In the houses in the interior of South Carolina , as in those of the south of Europe , the Duke often found no glass . At the openings of the windows there was nothing but shutters . ' The clear nights and deep blue of the sky showed his rapid advance to the south ; well-known constellations disappeared , and new stars became visible . The legislature was in session at Columbia . But we find little said , especially worthy of remark . The officers of government , and the gentlemen connected with the College , are // spoken of with due respect . On approaching Charleston , the comforts and beauties of a large and hospitable metropolis compensated for tile fatigues of the journey . Upon the right bank of the Ashley , in the vicinity of Charleston , an entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suburb , were , for the most part , surrounded by gardens , in which orange trees , with most splendid ripe fruit , monthly roses in full bloom , and a variety of other flourishing plants displayed themselves . The greater part of the habitations have piazzas and spacious balconies . Upon the walls and columns run creeping vines ; we took notice of a great number of passion flowers . I felt delighted with this southern climate . ' Vol. ii . pp. 4 . The journal of his residence in Charleston gives various well-known regulations respecting the police of that city . The Duke obviously feels like a philanthropist on the subject of slavery , but his remarks are all temperate , and his journal is never filled with petulant or angry criticisms . On almost every occasion the moderation of our traveller is exemplary . But in Georgia he says , all faces are haggard , ' and the inhabitants may justly be called great barbarians . ' At Milledgeville he again observes , that the men who were introduced to him had each his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lived in a state separated from the civilized world . ' Yet he seems to have been very hospitably received ; and if kindness and attention are marks of culture , there was no room for complaint . The Duke resolved on visiting the Creek Indians . The account of this journey is one of the best parts of his book . We willingly make copious extracts from this portion of his travels , for the description of Indian life , under the aspect here r*presented , is new to us . Towards four o'clock in the afternoon we reached the agency , a group of twenty log houses , and some negro huts . It is appointed for the residence of the agent of the United States with the Creek Indians ( he , however , was absent at this time ) , and is situated in a very handsome tract of land on the left side of the Flint river , which rushes over a rocky bed between pretty steep banks . The right bank belongs to the Creek nation , of about twenty-one thousand souls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log houses we took up our night 's lodging , and enjoyed some very well cooked venison . In a neighboring grog-shop we found a collection of drunken Indians , and some negroes , who were frolicking during the Christmas holy-days . Several of them were well dressed ; they // wore mocassins and leggings of leather ; broad knee-bands ornamented with white glass beads , a sort of coat of striped cotton , and upon the head a striped cotton cloth , almost like a turban . Several of them were very large . For a treat of whiskey , which I gave them , eight of them performed the war dance . They skipped here and there in a circle , moved themselves right and left , sprung against each other , raised their hands on high , let them fall again , and bellowed horribly through the whole scene . Some old men who stood near , took it in dudgeon that the young men should dance in such a way before white people . They called to them to stop . Mr Crowell , however , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Indians is a dusky brown . They have black , straight hair . Several of them possess negroes , to whom it is very acceptable to live with them , since they are treated with more equality than by the whites . Some of these negroes were very well clothed in the Indian manner , they drank and jumped about with the Indians . One of them was of colossal stature , and appeared to be in great request among the Indians , to whom he served as interpreter . The constitution of these Indians is a mixture of the aristocratical and republican form of government . The chiefs are chosen for life , and the dignity is not hereditary ; for im-. proper conduct they can be deposed . They can not write their language . Their laws are of course very simple , and founded on traditionary usage . ' The Indians have thrown bridges over two brooks with marshy shores ; at each of them we paid , with great pleasure , half a dollar toll-money . The bridges are indeed not remarkably good , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in many of the more northern states . We met but few of the Indian inhabitants ; these were all . wrapt up in woollen blankets . We only sawi*Jizee wigwams , Indian houses , chiefly toll-houses of the bridges . Th* resemble the log houses , neither are they so open as those which I saw last summer in the state of New York . ' pp. 23 , 25 . We took a walk to a plantation lying near , which belonged to an Indian named M'Intosh . He was absent at Washington as a delegate from his nation . He is the son of that M'Intosh , who obtained from the state of Georgia the title of General , and who last spring , on account of the treaty with the state , had been shot by his countrymen and hewn in pieces . Polygamy prevails among the Indians . The young M'Intosh had indeed only two wives , a white woman and an Indian . They say he had several wives whom he wished to keep ; the white woman however had driven them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only submit to one Indian rival . We did not see the Indian wife . The // white wife , however , received us quite politely . She is the daugh .. ter of a planter in Georgia , and tolerably pretty . She was attired in the European style , only , according to the Indian fancy in dress , she were a quantity of glass heads about her neck . She showed us her two children , completely white , and also the portrait of her father-in-law , as large as life , with the sword of honor given him by the United States . The family is in very good circumstances , and possesses seventy negroes. ' p. 27 . For the singularity of the thing , I will notice our dinner of today , that the inquisitive reader may observe that one is in no danger of hunger on the lands of the Indians ; soup ofturnips , roast-beef , a roast turkey , venison with a kind of sour sauce , roast chickens , and pork with sweet potatoes . ' p. 28 . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians collected in the neighborhood of a plantation . We left our carriage to inquire into the cause of it . There had been a horse-race of middling , unsightly horses ; the festival was , however , ended , and the meeting was on the point of breaking up . A white planter who was there , conducted us to the son of the Big Warrior . He was himself a chief : , and possessed a high reputation , as was said amongst those of the nation . He sat upon a felled tree between two inferior chiefs . His dress was a tunic of flowered , clear blue calico , a piece of the same stuff was wrapped round his head like a turban . He wore richly ornamented leather leggings set with glass beads , and mocassins , and had an equally ornamented hunt .. ing-poucli hung around him . Moderately fat , and of a great stature , he appeared to be about thirty years old . He had mustaches. like all his countrymen . I was introduced to him , and shook hands with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place through an interpreter who appeared to be a dismissed soldier . This creature caused the chief to rise when he commenced speaking to him ; when I begged him to remain sitting , he reseated himself mechanically . He directed no questions to me , and answered mine with yes and no . To the question , whether he knew anything of the country of which I was a native , he answered by a shake of the head . He looked no more at me . Several Indians wore their hair in a singular style ; it was shorn on both sides of the head , and the middle , from the neck over to the forehead , stood up like a cock 's comb . Seen from behind , they appeared as if they wore a helmet . Quite small boys practised themselves already in shooting with a little bow . I attempted to joke with a little fellow , three years old , but he took the jest in bad part , and threatened me with his bow . ' pp. 29 , 30 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mobile . The climate seems to have been partieu // larly agreeable to him ; in December he was cheered by the warmth of a German spring ; by the landscape , brilliant with live oaks and various evergreens , by the air , warm and soothing as a May evening . But the pleasure of the impression was marred by the recollection , that this air in summer is poisonous ; and that death comes to the work of destruction , concealed in the luxuriance of vegetation and all the abundance , which nature heaves from her lap in the fertile regions of the South . The charms of a southern clime gave an interest to travelling through countries but little inhabited , and made an excursion of pleasure out of a journey , which in the North would . h*ye ' been only a succession of privations . Thus , in travelling to Pensacola , the road could not be discerned , so few were the traces of it ; and the party , having been overtaken by night , were obliged to make their way by imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their device having succeeded , they went towards the place from which they heard the deep-mouthed welcome proceed . But the weather was like summer ; and an excellent meal could he made by the running brooks in the grateful shade . Pensacola itself was the most miserahle place , that had been seen thisside of the Atlantic . ' The Duke reached New Orleans on the 21st of January , and remained there nine weeks . I determined to wait in New Orleans for the mild season , and then to ascend the Mississippi . The result was an extensive acquaintance , a succession of visits , a certain conformity in living , which one can not refrain from yielding to in a city . No day passed over , , this winter , which did not produce something pleasant or interesting ; each day , however , was nearly the same as its predecessors . Dinners , evening parties , plays , masquerades , and other amusements followed close on each other , and were interrupted only by the little circumstances which accompany life in this hemisphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not inclined to enter particularly into the account , given of the state of society in New Orleans . In this . part of the volume the Duke allows himself in expressions more unjust , and descriptions more improper , than in the other portions of his travels . We can not but think it exceedingly indelicate to publish in a book an account of a dinner party in a private fami ly . It is wrong to speak of it at all with the name and personal appearance of the hostess ; doubly wrong , if the conversation is quoted , and it is declared who of the party drank too much // wine , and to what ludicrous results the excitement led . We are glad that the translator has omitted some passages ; which indeed contain no serious charges against any one , except him , who forgets himself so far as to publish what , whether right or wrong , belong to the sacred things of private hospitality . Our traveller is moreover very much moved with com*ssion for certain mulatto women , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not decent to be found . Surely there is no need of attributing to undue haughtiness , and to pride resembling the pride of nobility , the disdain which decent people may feel for such persons as he describes . It is but the exercise of the most corunlon virtue in rejecting alliance and intefcot , rsd with the abandoned . If it be true , as he asserts , * that such women , if they have property , can establish themselves well in Europe , it proves , not a superior philanthropy as displayed in an indifference to a tinge of negro blood , but a less delicate sense of the nature of conjugal relations . The Duke speaks of New Orleans , as though it were dangerous to be abroad there in the evening . It would seem as if every poorer man were armed with a stiletto and prepared for picking pockets . In a city , which within a few years has undergone so many changes , and which from its situation is exposed to be infested by fugitives from the West Indies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vagabonds and worthless men . The ascent of the Mississippi is next described . But the account contains nothino* of moment . On the 10th of April , b he took a solemn leave of the m*ijestic father of rivers , the Mississippi ; but , with God 's permission , not an eternal one . ' We find nothing very curious , till we come to New Harmony . And this , we must observe , is again one of the best parts of the book . Mr Owen 's society is at an end ; and we have here a very satisfactory aCcount of it in its season of greatest prodperity . The Duke deserves credit for his good sense in predicting the speedy end of it . I came with the utmost expectation to New Harmony , curious to become acquainted with a man of such extraordinary sentiments . In the tavern , I accosted a man very plainly dressed , about fifty years of age , rather of l&amp;w stature , who entered into a conversation with me , concerning the situation of the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where all was newly established , &amp;c . When I asked this man how long before Mr // Owen would be there , he announced himself , to my no small surprise , as Mr Owen , was glad at my visit , and offered himself to show everything , and explain to me whatever remained without explanation . ' p. 108 . In the first place , Mr Owen carried me to the quondam church of Rapp 's society ; a simple wooden building , with a steeple of the same materials , provided with a clock . This church was at present appropriated to joiner 's and shoemaker 's shops , in which the boys are instructed in these mechanic arts . ' Mr Owen then conducted me to Rapp 's former dwelling , a large , well-built brick house , with two lightning rods . The man of God , it appeared , took especial good care of himself ; his house was by far the best in the place , surrounded by a garden , with a flight of stone steps , and the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , contented himself with a small apartment in the same tavern where I lodged . ' p. 109 . In the evening Mr Owen conducted me to a concert in the non.descript building . Most of the members of the Eociety were present . The orchestra was not numerous ; it consisted at first only of one violin , one violoncello , one clarionet , and two flutes . Nevertheless the concert was surprisingly good , especially as the musicians have not been together a year . The clarionet player performed particularly well , and afterwards let us hear him on the bugle . Several good male and female vocalists then took a part ; they sang among other things a trio accompanied by the clarionet only . Declamation was interspersed among the musical performances ; Lord Byron 's stanzas to his wife after their separation were extremely well recited . Between the two parts of the concert , the music played a march , each gentlemen gave a lady his arm , and a promenade took place , resembling a Polonaise with pretty figures , sometimes in two couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gentlemen separated from the ladies , then again all together . The concert closed with a lively cotillion . I was , on the whole , much amused ; and Mr Huygens took an active share in the dancing . This general evening amusement takes place often in the week ; besides , on Tuesday , there is a general ball . ' All the men did not take a share in the dance , i. e. l*he lower class , but read newspapers , which were scattered over ' the side-tables . ' Military exercises form a part of the instruction of the children . I saw the boys divided into two ranks , and parted into detachments , marching to labor , and on the way they performed various wheelings and evolutions . All the boys and girls have a very healthy look , are cheerful and lively , and by no means bashful . The boys labor in the field and garden , and were now occupied with new fencing . The girl* learn female employments ; // they were as little oppressed as the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were much more employed in making their youth pass as pleasantly as possible . ' I became acquainted with a Madam F , a native of StPetersburg . She married an American merchant , settled there , and had the misfortune to lose her husband three days after marriage . She then joined her husband 's family at Philadelphia , and as she was somewhat eccentric and sentimental , quickly became enthusiastically attached to Mr Owen 's system . She told me , however , in German , that she found herself egregiously deceived ; that the highly vaunted equality was not altogether to her taste ; that some of the society were too low , and the table was below all criticism . The good lady appeared to be about to run from one extreme to the other ; for she added , that in the summer , she would enter a Shaker establishment near Vincennes . ' pp. 110 , 113 . I had an ample conversation with Mr Owen , relating to his system , and his expectations . He looks forward to nothing less than to remodel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abolish all punishments ; to create similar views and similar wants , and in this manner to avoid all dissension and warfare . When his system of education shall be brought into connexion with the great progress made in mechanics , and which is daily increasing , every man can then , as he thought , provide his smaller necessaries for himself , and trade would cease entirely ! I expressed a doubt of the practicability of his system in Europe , and even in the United States . He was too unalterably convinced of the results , to admit the slightest room for doubt . ' p. 115 . In the evening there was a general meeting in the large hail ; it opened with music . Then one of the members , an English architect of talent , who came to the United Statee with Mr. Owen , whose confidence he appeared to possess , and was here at the head of the arranging and architectural department , read some extracts from the n*V*pers , upon which Mr Owen made a very goodeommentary ; %*kampk* , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation , and the advantages resulting therefrom . He lost himslf however , in his theories , when he ixpatiated on an article which related to the experiments which had been made with Perkins 's steam-gun . During these lectures , I made my observations on the much vaunted equality , as some tatterdemalions stretched themselves on the platform close by Mr Owen . The better educated members kept themselves together , and took no notice of the others . I remarked also , that the members belonging to the higher class of society bad put on the new costume , and made a party by themselves . After the lecture , the band played a march , each gentleman took a lady , an*.I // EJan. marche4 with her round the room . Lastly , a cotillion was danced ; the ladies were then escoi*ted home , and each retired to his own quarters . ' p. 116 . In the evening I paid visits to some ladies , and witnessed philosophy and the love of equality put to the severest trial with one of them . She is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was delicately brought up , and appears to have taken refuge here , on account of an unhappy attachment . While she was singing and playing very well on the piano forte , she was told that the milking of the cows was her duty , and that they were waiting unmilked . Almost in teats , she betook herself to this servile employment , depre*atjng the new social system , ansi. its so much prized equality . ' - After the cows were milked , in doing which the poor girl was trod on by one , and daubed by another , I joined an aquatic party with the young ladies and some young philosophers , in a very good boat upon the inundated meadows of the Wabash . The evening was beautiful moonlight , and the air very mild ; the beautiful Miss Virginia forgot her stable sufferings , and tegaled us with her sweet voice . Somewhat later we collected together in the house No. 2 , appointed for a school-house , where all the young ladies and gentlemen of quality , i assembled . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , will not mix with the couimon sort , and I believe that all the well brought up members are disgusted , and will soon abandon the society . We amt*sed ourselves exceedingly during the whole remainder of the evening , dancing cotillions , reels , and waltzes , and with such anima.tiou as rendeted it quite lively . New figures had been introduced among the cotillions , among which is one called the new social system .. Several of the ladies made objections to dancing on Sunday ; we thought however , that in this sanctuary of philosophy , such prejudices should be utterly discarded , and our arguments , e* well-as the inclination of the ladies , gained the victory . ' pp. 117 , 118 . In the evening I visited Mr M'Clure and M#ans Fretageot , living in the same house . She is a French woman , who formerly kept * boa4rding-schoQl in Philadelphia , and is : caJje4 mother by all the young girls here . The handsomest and most polished of the female world here , Miss Lucia Saistare and Miss Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening when Ii came in , and therefore we could hear their performance on the piano forte , and their charming voices , in peace and quiet . Later in the evening we went to the kitchen of No.3 , where there was a ball . The young ladies of the better class kept themselves in a corner- under Madam Fretageot 's protection , and formed a little aristncratical club . To prevent all possible partialities , the gentlemen , as well as the ladies , drew numbers for the cotillions , and thus apportioned // them equitably . Our young ladies turned up their noses apart at the democratic dancers , who often in this way fell to their lot . ' p. 119 . I add but a few remarks more . Mr Owen considers it as an absurdity to promise never-ending love on marriage . For i eason he has introduced the civil contract of marriage , after the manner of the Quakers , and the French laws , into his community , and declares that the bond ofinatrimony is in no way indissoluble . The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation , for they belong to the community from their second year , and are all brought up together . ' pp. 121 , 122 . Thus we enable the reader to judge himself of the spirit with which the Duke writes , and of his general manner . We have no room for further extracts , though we could willingly follow him through Ohio . Of this state he found the Governor engaged in cutting a wagon-pole . It seemed to him , that he had fallen on the days of Cincinnatus , and we are pleased at the sincerity , with which the illustrious foreigner acknowledges the simple hospitality with which he was entertained . From Pittsburgh the Duke went to see Rapp 's society . There his heart was cheered by a very good glass of old Rhemsh , ' and by a table spread after the fashion of his country . At Philadelphia the charge is repeated , that the Americans are deficient in taste for painting . At Hamburg the Duke ' found himself surrounded by his countrymen ; and felt that the German emigrants form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A young German , who had studied at the Uni .. versities , was particularly giddy through excitement for liberty . It was the first time in the United States , that the affectation of republicanism arrested my attention . ' This is the remark of our author , and is creditable both to us and to him . One week more the Duke passes in New York . With a fervent acknowledgment of the kindness of Providence in protecting him through his long journey , after travelling over more than seven thousand miles , he set sail from New York in June , 1826 . We can not but part from the Duke with good feeling . His intentions towards this country are manifestly honest . The general impressions which will be produced by the volumes on candid persons , unacquainted with the country , are favora .. Ide . Universal hospitality and security ; freedom from affecta .. tion ; industry and thrift ; and the happiness that arises from refinement in social life ; of these , as existing among us , almost // every page furnishes examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can turn to account . Generally , however , the volumes do not touch , except incidentally , on the strong points in American character . Nothing is said of the practical influence of our political system ; and the only notices of our great men are trifling . Indeed we have in the accounts of the cities very much , which is entirely commonplace , and which might as well happen to a traveller in Europe as in this hemisphere . The only chance of forming from this work a general idea respecting the state of society among us , must be by making inferences from an abundance of insignificant details . Nor are we prepared to consider this publication as entirely accidental . We can not but suspect , that the Duke had all along an intention , not perhaps very filly developed , of making a hook ; and we further believe , that he was led to this view in part by the volume , which was published about ten years ago on Th*azil by another German Prince of scientific merit and liberal curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not worth while for Americans to be sensitive as to what European travellers say of us . The moral and political character of the country is an answer to the idle calumnies , which are often propagated respecting us . Our police is confessedly the weakest ( so far as force is concerned ) in the world ; and yet property is nowhere more safe ; we triumpli*over our enemies at sea , and repel their attacks on land . Our executive government is weak , and our country quiet . The wilderness is peopled , and free government is rapidly extending towards the Pacific . if these things do not prove the general difibsion of justice and industry , of intelligence , wholesome principles , courtesy , and courage , our condition is as much a contradiction to the eternal laws of morality and right , as it is to the theory of the benefits of unlimited monarchy .
