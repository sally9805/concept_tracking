A Pastoral Opera : SAMUEL WOODWORTH Music by JOHN DAVIES CHARACTERS MILLER BLANDFORD BELLAMY WILLIAM JONATHAN WAITER VILLAGERS , LABOURERS , MAIDENS CAESAR 1ST FARMER 2ND FARMER LYDIA HARRIET SALLY ROSE Note : 1Kb Main text ACT I. Scene 1 Note : 1Kb Distant view of a village spire , on which the dial plate of a clock indicates the hour . The stage represents a farm-yard , separated from a field by a pale fence with a gate . On the right of the actor is a cottage , and on the opposite side a rustic arbour of grape-vine . William is discovered in the field , giving directions to the labourers . Lydia and Harriet enter from the cottage , the latter with a milk-pail ; William joins them , and they sing the following Trio Here , in scenes of sweet seclusion , Far from bustling towns we dwell , While around , in rich profusion , Autumn 's yellow bounties swell , There , the loaded fruit-trees , bending , Strew with mellow gold the land ; Here , on high , from vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , to recreate us , Strains of music freight the breeze , Healthful sports at eve await us  --  What are city joys to these ? HARRIET : This may all sound very well in song , Lydia ; but , for all that , I should like to have an opportunity of judging for myself . LYDIA : So , you are sighing for a city life ? HARRIET : I will confess , Lydia , that I should like to see the city , and not remain altogether ignorant of the polite world . William returns into the field , and disappears LYDIA : Just so I once thought , and dearly have I paid for the experiment . Let my example be a caution to you , my dear friend ; for depend upon it that poet is correct , who says , " When ignorance is bliss , ' t is folly to be wise . " HARRIET : Why , surely it does not necessarily follow , because you placed your affections on an unworthy object , that every country girl who goes to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is unkind . I have yet to learn that Mr. Blandford is unworthy . HARRIET : That man can not be otherwise , who will first win the affections of an artless girl , and then doom her to wear the willow ; singing every hour of the day  --  Sings Though mourning life a mateless dove . LYDIA : That was his favourite song . But you should recollect the circumstances of our separation . I could not consent to his wild scheme of a secret marriage ; and so we parted : for mystery and concealment , in such cases , can never be productive of good . I dare not tell even Harriet , that I wear his miniature in my bosom  --  a keepsake with which I most solemnly promised never to part . Aside HARRIET : Had you been a girl of spirit , like me , you would have taken him at his word ; and might now , perhaps , have been rolling in your coach in the great city , instead of being secluded , like a nun , here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . LYDIA : And I might , on the other hand , have been an unpitied beggar , destitute of that consoling consciousness of duty which now supports me . Besides , could you be happy as the wife of a man whose haughty relatives affected to despise your plebeian blood ? Enter William But I will not detain you from your morning task , and here comes , my gallant brother to attend you . Breakfast will be ready by the time you have finished milking . Exit into the cottage HARRIET : Your sentiments are doubtless very correct , Miss Lydia ; but still I should like to live in the city one whole year . WILLIAM : A whole year , Harriet ! How would you contrive to pass your time ? HARRIET : As other people do , to be sure , in seeing the fashions , and the Park , and the Battery , and Castle Garden , and the Museum , and the Theatres , and Chatham Garden , and the circuses , and the Gas-lights , and the Water-works , and the Fire-works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , when I came home again , all the girls would so envy me , and the young men would quarrel for me . O , it would be delightful . Hem ! Affecting disdain  --  Please to keep your distance , Sir . WILLIAM : Why , what the deuce is the matter with you , Harriet ? HARRIET : Please mend your manners , sir , and address me as Miss Miller . WILLIAM : Ha , ha , ha ! Miss Miller ! Ha , ha , ha ! I say Miss Mill  --  Ha , ha , ha ! You recollect the milkmaid in the spelling-book , who lost her fortune by a toss of her head ? HARRIET : I was only jesting , William . But seriously , I intend to see the city , that is poz . WILLIAM : Indeed ! When do you propose going ? HARRIET : As soon as I can find a beau with gallantry enough to take me there . WILLIAM : Then , fare you well ; for here comes a verification of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarecrow from the city . I say , Harriet , let us have a little sport with him . HARRIET : A scarecrow ! Why , he is a genteel , delightful looking fellow , neat as a starched tucker fresh from a bandbox . Why do you call him such names ? WILLIAM : Because he frightens the birds without killing any of them . Depend upon if , all the game he carries home will be brought down with silver shot , as it is said they shoot witches . Enter Bellamy , with a double-barrelled gun and crosses the stage , disappearing behind the cottage WILLIAM : I say , Harriet , he is as gaunt about the waist as your father 's greyhound . HARRIET : Or little Caesar 's fiddle . WILLIAM : Or Deacon Forest 's hourglass . I hope he wo n't mistake the goslins for woodcocks , or the chickens for partridges . HARRIET : I wonder he did not speak to me . WILLIAM : Speak to you ! Why , he did not see you . HARRIET : Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought my hand , My heart his suit approved , But feigning not to understand , I listened still unmoved . For dim , I thought , must burn that flame , Which such a check could smother , And sprightly girls are not to blame To spurn a bashful lover . Enter Bellamy  --  listening BELLAMY : Damn fine girl , ' pon honour . Eyeing her through his glass Poor Lubin told a friend his case , Who soon his fears allay 'd , And bade him wear a bolder face ,  --  He listen 'd and obey 'd . Returning soon , with alter 'd mien , He might at once discover , That sprightly girls , of gay sixteen , Ne'er spurn a saucy lover . BELLAMY : Tolerable voice , but damn 'd little science . Wonder who she is . Aside , leaning over the fence WILLIAM : He seems to like your singing , Harriet . HARRIET : Singing louder A sprightly girl of gay sixteen , Ne'er spurns a saucy lover . BELLAMY : Aside Then you will not spurn me , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my failings . Who can the bumpkin be ? Surveying William through his glass By his dress , I take him to be damn 'd low . Comes through the gate , and advances slowly down HARRIET : I must pretend not to observe him . I say , William , tell me something more about the city . Did you say the houses all joined together ? Affecting simplicity WILLIAM : To be sure they do , Harriet , just like our corn-house and cart-shed . You may walk all the way from Whitehall to the Hospital , through a street that bends like the bow of an ox-yoke , without seeing an apple-tree or a turnip-patch . BELLAMY : Aside A mere clodhopper , that fellow . I will astonish him directly . HARRIET : Is it possible ! How I should like to go there ! BELLAMY : Aside Sweet simpleton ! How I should like to take you there . I must speak to her , and dash the native . Pardon me , miss ; I thought I heard a nightingale ; but I now perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour . HARRIET : Where , sir ? Pray do n't shoot it till I see it . BELLAMY : So far from my harming the lovely songstress , miss , it has deeply wounded me , although it seems somewhat alarmed at my presence . WILLIAM : I suspect , sir , that the birds in your walks , are generally more scared than hurt . HARRIET : Wounded you , sir ? You speak in riddles . BELLAMY : Which your looking-glass will easily solve . HARRIET : I do not understand you , sir . But , William , as you was saying  --  if the houses in New York are so close together , where do they keep their creatures ?  --  the geese , the calves , and the pigs ? BELLAMY : Permit me to answer that question , if you please , miss ; for though I have been but a short time in America , I am just from the city , and flatter myself that I know something about it . Aside What a charming little Forest Rose it is ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . BELLAMY : The geese , you must know , are mostly seen , in term time , flocking round a marble house in the park , where they generally get confoundedly plucked before they are aware of it , in which particular , your little city much resembles my native London . The calves and donkies , are principally found in your Broadway , and in our Bond-Street . As for the other animals you mentioned , the pigs , I believe New York is the only place where they enjoy the freedom of the city . HARRIET : You spoke of donkies , sir ; does that mean the same thing as dandies ? BELLAMY : Aside Humph ! Not quite so simple as I imagined . Perhaps you , sir can answer the lady 's question . WILLIAM : The two words , I believe , are derived from the same root . The real genuine dandy , however , is an imported animal ; and the breed having been crossed in this country , the full-blooded bucks command but a low price in the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha , ha ! Tolerably fair , ' pon honour . Dem me , if the clodhopper has n't astonish 'd me ! HARRIET : Well , sir , how are the sheep provided for ? BELLAMY : The sheep ! O the clergymen take care of their fleeces , I believe , in both countries , and leave the flock to pick up a living as they can . But , come , my dear , if you are so anxious to become acquainted with the city , place yourself under my protection , and you shall be there tomorrow . You shall , indeed , my dear , ' pon honour . WILLIAM : Aside My dear ! That 's plaguy familiar , though . HARRIET : Aside Poor William is getting jealous . Now I have a great mind to tease him a little . BELLAMY : What say you , sweet girl , to my proposition ? HARRIET : If my father will give his consent . WILLIAM : And if your father should consent , Harriet , would you go without me ? BELLAMY : Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend with , I perceive . I must observe this native . HARRIET : Go without you ! Is not one protector enough for any reasonable girl ? Enter Miller O father ! I am so glad you have come ! I have such a favour to ask of you ! MILLER : You had better go and finish milking ; it is time the cows were turned to pasture . HARRIET : I will go in a moment , sir . But first hear my request . This gentleman , who is all the way from London , and , for aught I know , a prince or a nobleman , has kindly offered to take me to New York with him , free of all expense . Will you give your consent ? BELLAMY : Aside Her simplicity will ruin all , split me ? MILLER : Take you to New York ! What does this mean , sir ? BELLAMY : Confused O nothing , sir ; or merely this : Your daughter expressed a strong desire to see the city ; as I happen to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow me to do less than make a tender of my services . That is all sir , ' pon honour . MILLER : Sarcastically You are very kind , sir . BELLAMY : Not at all , sir . Pray do n't name it . Such a compliment , in my country , is thought nothing of . But excuse me ; it is now near breakfast time , and I shall be waited for at the tavern . I will see vou again in the course of the day . Good morning . What a cursed bore ! I must observe the old Hunks . Exit MILLER : Your coquetry , Harriet , displeases me , and evidently distresses William . To be so familiar with a stranger ! Bellamy returns and listens HARRIET : But , then , you know , father , he is a sportsman , and a foreigner , and dresses so very genteely . Looking at William 's dress WILLIAM : I understand you , Harriet ; and if you are so easily dazzled with outside show  --  why  --  consult your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William , you are jealous . WILLIAM : You will never find a truer friend , however showy he may be . MILLER : If I thought her in earnest , William , I should regret that you ever bestowed a thought on so worthless an object ; for the girl who would reject the honest heart and hand of an American farmer , for a fopling of any country , is not worthy of affection or confidence . HARRIET : When I thought I loved you , William , I had not seen this handsome Englishman . BELLAMY : Aside ' T is plain enough , the artless creature loves me , and will be mine upon my own terms . Blandford doubts my influence with the sex . I will not astonish him . Exit WILLIAM : Very well , Miss Miller . Your father has been a kind guardian to poor Lydia and me ever since we lost our parents , for which I hope we are not ungrateful . I shall be of age next month , and if my farm be small  --  MILLER : Spurn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such submissive tones . When you have more experience , you will know that it is the vice of her sex to torture those they love . But let me caution you , Harriet , against indulging this dangerous propensity . Learn to restrain it , or you may repent it when it is too late . Exit into the cottage WILLIAM : I shall always rejoice to see you happy , Harriet , however much my own heart may ache . HARRIET : And if ever I am happy , while your heart feels a pang , William , spurn me as a wretch unworthy of your regard . WILLIAM : Are you in earnest ! Now , you have made me so happy , Harriet ! That for the English dandy , Snapping his fingers with his squinter . Ah ! ' pon honour  --  Imitating But come , old Brindle is waiting to fill your pail , and I am waiting to bring it home for you . She is now making a hearty breakfast on fresh cornstalks . HARRIET : You run and let down the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exit William Song  --  Harriet The morn awakes , in blushes dress 'd , The lambs are all at play , The blackbird quits his dewy nest , And carols on the spray ; The milkmaid hails the rosy dawn . The shepherd seeks his fleecy flock : The woods resound to the hunter 's horn , All roused by the village clock . Tick !  --  tick !  --  tick !  --  tick !  --  tick !  --  tick ! All roused by the village clock . The milky herd their stores resign , And soon regain the mead , Where cooling shades and streams combine , To cheer them while they feed . When evening twilight veils the lawn , Again the milkmaid trips away , While woods resound to the distant horn , At the closing hour of day . Tick ! tick !  --  tick ! tick !  --  tick ! tick ! At the closing hour of day . Scene 2 An apartment in Deacon Forest 's house . A door in the centre of the flat . Enter Jonathan , hastily crossing the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jonathan ! Stop a moment , till I say one word more . JONATHAN : Returning I do n't calculate , Sal , that you can say any thing to convince me that I did n't see Tom Clover kiss you last night , in the singing school . SALLY : Tom Clover kiss me ! A'nt you ashamed of yourself , Jonathan , to tell such a story ? JONATHAN : It is no story , because it is true . I saw him make believe whisper to you , and then I heard him smack you right on the cheek . There , deny it if you can . SALLY : Can you swear to it ? JONATHAN : Yes , on the Bible . SALLY : Then you would perjure yourself ; for it was I that smacked him . Ha , ha , ha ! JONATHAN : So much the more shame for you . It is treating me like a brute . I would n't serve a negro so . SALLY : La , Jonathan , what harm is there in a kiss ? JONATHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After keeping company with me , you had n't ought to let another man touch you . SALLY : Then , I am afraid , I should never be touched in my life ; for you do n't come within an arm 's length of me , for fear I should bite you . JONATHAN : ' Cause you are always playing tricks on me , if I offer any sich thing ; but Tom may do what he pleases , and you like him the better for it . SALLY : Now , Jonathan , did n't I sit on your knee last Sunday evening ? Answer me that . JONATHAN : And , ' cause I happened to get asleep , did n't you get up softly and put the big samp-mortar in your place ; and did not your father find me hugging it , when he got up in the morning ? Answer me that . I would n't serve a negro so . SALLY : Ha , ha , ha ! Now , Jonathan , what difference can it make to a man that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a samp-mortar ? But , come , now , let us be friends once more , and I will never do any thing to vex you again . Enter Rose at the door in the flat , unperceived by Jonathan . Sally directs her , in dumb show , not to advance JONATHAN : I wo n't be friends with you , for I see plain enough what your drift is . Every body says you are only running after me ' cause I got a shop . But . I guess , you 'll find yourself mistaken , for I know how the cat jumps , and will sooner burn my shop , pack up my duds , and go back to Taunton , to catch herrings for a living . SALLY : O , Jonathan , now do n't be so unforgiving . You know I do n't care a fig for any other man . Come  --  give me a kiss . JONATHAN : May I , though ! SALLY : Certainly you may . But stay ; you are so apt to blush ; let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know is blind as a bat . There , now , step a little this way , because the window is open . She places Rose between herself and Jonathan Now ! I am ready . Give me a good hearty squeeze . Jonathan embraces and kisses Rose JONATHAN : Now , that 's a dear , sweet , kind , good girl !  --  Will you always love me so ? ROSE : Yes , Massa Jonathan , me lubber you berry bad . SALLY : Taking the shawl from his eyes There , Jonathan , is not that better than the samp-mortar ? Ha , ha , ha ! JONATHAN : Darnation ! If I have not been bussing Lid Rose ! Now , Sal Forest , that is too bad ! I would not serve a negro so . Exit Sally ROSE : But you did serve poor negro so , and ax me to lubber you , and now you desert me . Exit JONATHAN : Be off with you , garlic chops ! Darn me , if ever I speak to Sal Forest again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet Miller . Whew ! how the wench smelt of onions . Exit Scene 3 A Wood . Enter Blandford with his gun . BLANDFORD : I can neither find my companion nor the road which leads to our lodging . No wonder . One subject alone occupies all my thoughts , and I struggle in vain to dissipate the mental abstraction . Cruel , cruel Lydia ! to leave me without a single clew to discover her retreat .  --  Ignorant even of her guardian 's name , and place of residence , I vainly wander about these rural scenes , making myself ridiculous by inquiries which none can answer .  --  O , could I but once more meet her , and find her still the same , these hours of misery should be repaid with years of joy . One smile from thee , my dearest Lydia , would cause this desponding heart to throb again with rapture . Song  --  Blandford A smile from thee would banish pain , And bid each doubt and sorrow flee , I ask but this , once more to gain A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fruitless sighs . And were my bright reward to be A tender glance from those soft eyes , ' T were heaven to me . But ah ! if doomed no more to meet , Whate'er my future fate may be , This faithful heart , will ever beat , With love for thee . And when I close a life of pain , The gloomy hour of death will be , An hour of bliss , if then I gain A tear from thee . During the Song , enter Jonathan JONATHAN : That 's a darnation queer kind of a tune . I wonder if I could play it on my jew's-harp . Servant , sir . Guess it will ruin to-day , do n't you ? BLANDFORD : Aside It is a vain pursuit , and I will return to town . JONATHAN : Aside Too darn 'd proud to speak to a body in a homespun coat . This must be one of them city chaps that come over here a gunning . I say , mister ! Servant , sir . BLANDFORD : Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eagle Tavern ? JONATHAN : You do n't belong to these parts , I calculate ? BLANDFORD : Of course , I do not . Will you answer my question ? JONATHAN : May be you are from New York ? How does buckwheat sell ? BLANDFORD : Will you direct me to Major Butler 's , who keeps the stage-house at the sign of the Spread Eagle ? JONATHAN : You a n't acquainted with the major , are you ? He trades at my shop . If I may be so bold , sir , what may I call your name ? BLANDFORD : Stupid  --  Pshaw ! I will keep my temper . JONATHAN : Stupid Shaw , ' Spose you a n't any ways related to ' Squire Shaw of Taunton , are you ? He that married the widow Lovett , mother of Ichabod Lovett , who was tried for horse-stealing ? BLANDFORD : Aside I must humour this fellow , or find the Eagle Tavern myself . No , sir , I have not the honour of an acquaintance with any member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are related to the Shaws of Hacksensack , here in the Jarseys ? BLANDFORD : Perhaps so  --  our family is very numerous . But if I may be so bold , sir , what may I call your name ? Imitating Jonathan 's manner JONATHAN : Jonathan Ploughboy , at your service , formerly of Taunton , in the state of Massachusetts . BLANDFORD : Do you live hereabouts ? JONATHAN : I guess you 'd think so , if you saw my name on the shop , down by the bridge . BLANDFORD : So you are shop-keeper then ? JONATHAN : A little in the marchant way , and a piece of a farmer besides . BLANDFORD : What do you sell ? JONATHAN : Every thing , whiskey , molasses , calicoes , spelling-books , and patent gridirons . BLANDFORD : With which you contrive to shave the natives ? JONATHAN : No sir ; every body shaves themselves here .  --  There is no barber nearer than Paris . BLANDFORD : You do n't understand me . By shaving I mean making a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating . JONATHAN : I would n't serve a negro so . But as to the parson or deacon , folks say they are pretty cute that way themselves . BLANDFORD : Are there any pretty girls in your neighbourhood ? JONATHAN : He , he , he ! I guess you 'd think so , if you saw Sally Forest , and Harriet Miller . BLANDFORD : I dare say that your Sallies and your Harriets are very fine girls . But do you know of any one called Lydia ? JONATHAN : Lydia ? O , yes ; but in the country here we call her Lid . You can see her any time at Deacon Forest 's . BLANDFORD : Her other name ? JONATHAN : Think of the sweetest flower that blows . Aside Darnation take the garlic , I say . BLANDFORD : Gracious Heavens ! Should it be the same ! What is her age , size , complexion ? Has she black hair , dark eyes , pouting lips ? Describe her person . JONATHAN : I take her to be about eighteen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JONATHAN : Not very tall nor very slim . BLANDFORD : It must be she ! Her hair and eyes ? JONATHAN : Black , I reckon ; but I am not sure . BLANDFORD : I live again ! Her teeth , breath , complexion ? There is none like them on earth ! JONATHAN : I do n't believe there is ! and as for the pouting lips you mentioned , just see her mad once  --  that 's all . BLANDFORD : Mad ! JONATHAN : Was you ever in Wethersfield ? BLANDFORD : No . Why do you ask ? JONATHAN : Then you know nothing about her breath .  --  Have you ever seen the ace of spades ? That 's enough . BLANDFORD : Of whom are you speaking ? JONATHAN : Lid Rose . Deacon Forest 's negro wench .  --  They call her the black Rose . BLANDFORD : Confound your stupidity , or shrewdness , I know not which to call it . The sweetest bud of hope has withered in a moment . JONATHAN : Bud of hope ! Darn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a clove of garlic . But , come , Mr. What-de-call-'em-Stupid Shaw  --  I will tell you what to do , and if you are wise , you will take a fool 's advice . All the girls within half a mile will be at ' Squire Miller 's this evening ; perhaps your Lydia may be among them . Come along with me , and I will show you the place . BLANDFORD : I thank you for the offer ; but business calls me to my lodgings  --  the Eagle Tavern . JONATHAN : Why , that 's right on the road . BLANDFORD : You will not direct me wrong ! JONATHAN : Me ! I would n't serve a negro so . Exeunt Scene 4 The farm yard  --  and cottage , as in Scene 1 . The village clock now indicates to minutes before 12 , and strikes during the scene . Enter Lydia , from the cottage . LYDIA : Harriet is absent  --  all are engaged , and I can now enjoy one moment in contemplating features which are so deeply impressed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she presses to her lips , gazes on it a moment , and then conceals it Ah , Charles ! Charles ! Why did we ever meet ! And yet I would not , if I could , forget the past , although I must look to the future without hope . Song  --  Lydia The heart sustained by Hope alone , The pains of absence may endure , But ah ! when even Hope is flown , Its sorrow has no cure . ' T is then we sigh , where'er we roam , For our maternal , peaceful home . Though mourning like a mateless dove , The languid heart be doomed to beat , It can not , will not , cease to love , It finds the pain so sweet . Yet heaves a sigh , where'er we roam , For our maternal , peaceful home . Exit into the cottage Enter Bellamy BELLAMY : I must have another interview , before I meet the moralizing Blandford . How shall I manage ? Old Squaretoes must not suspect ; and as for the bumpkin , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now in the harvest field , the coast must be clear , and this is my time . Bellamy knocks at the cottage door , which is opened by Lydia . He seizes her in his arms . She screams and attempts to escape . In the struggle a locket falls from her bosom BELLAMY : Listen to me a moment , sweet girl ! I swear to Heaven I love you to distraction , and have no desire but to make you happy . The moment is propitious  --  fly with me to a scene where wealth and pleasure await you . She breaks from him , and enters the cottage This is strange ! Can her coyness be real ? Perhaps my visit is ill-timed . I will swear that she loves me , from what I overheard this morning . Ha ! What the devil have we here ? Takes up the locket I see it all , split me ! To lull suspicion , she pretends to shun my advances , while she artfully drops a token of affection at my feet . This trophy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Wait patiently till night , my dear , and you shall find I can take a hint . Love in the dark , shall be my motto . Enter Harriet and Jonathan HARRIET : Well , Jonathan , what is it you wish to tell me ? JONATHAN : Why , Miss Harriet , Granny Gossip and I had a long talk about it last night ; and she said how  --  HARRIET : She said how ! Then what did you say ? JONATHAN : Confused I said how  --  HARRIET : Well ? You both said how ! What next ? Go on . JONATHAN : Why , darn it ! You wo n't let me tell . HARRIET : You are so long about it . Do n't you know that a smart girl , like me , wants every thing done quick ? JONATHAN : That 's just what Granny Gossip said , by the hokey ! She told me , says she  --  HARRIET : Indeed ! Then what did you tell her ? JONATHAN : I said , says I  --  No ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smartest girl in all the county , be the other who she may . HARRIET : I am very much obliged to the old lady , Then , what did you say ? JONATHAN : I said , says I , so she is ; for , says I , she can milk a cow , make a cheese , and boil a pudding , with any girl in the world , says I. HARRIET : That was certainly very kind of you . JONATHAN : Wa n't it now ? Then says she to me , says she , why do n't you strike there , instead of running after the deacon 's Sal , who do n't care three skips of a flea for you , only for your money . Why do n't you strike there ? says Granny Gossip to me , says she . HARRIET : Strike ! Where ? JONATHAN : Here  --  you ! HARRIET : Strike me ! JONATHAN : No  --  no . She meant , why did n't I court you ? He , he , he ! HARRIET : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give for not courting me ! JONATHAN : I told her I was afeard . But after talking a good while longer about it , I thought , thinks I to myself , there can be no great harm in axing the question ; and if I get the sack , says I , to myself , I sha n't be the first that 's got it by hundreds . HARRIET : That is true , Jonathan ; and you wo n't be the last by thousands . JONATHAN : And so , as you are to have a dance to-night , on account of the harvest , Granny Gossip said I had better come and ax you to be my partner . HARRIET : The old lady is certainly a very considerate woman . JONATHAN : Ar n't she , now ? She always has an eye to the main chance , as she calls it . So she says to me , says she , Harriet Miller has got something to make the pot boil , says she , and the deacon 's Sal has n't got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no objections , Miss Harriet , I will come to-night , and  --  HARRIET : Stay a moment . May I depend upon your intentions being honourable ? I hope , sir , that you do n't mean to impose upon my youth and inexperience , to win my virgin heart , and then take advantage of my unsuspecting innocence . You do not mean to ruin me ! Oh ! Weeps JONATHAN : Me ! Ruin you ! I would n't serve a negro so . Now , do n't take it on so ; pray do n't . HARRIET : Ha , ha , ha ! Well , I believe I may trust you . But do you know what to do next ? JONATHAN : No , I do n't , but if you will tell me , I am a cute fellow to learn . HARRIET : You must tell me all about my beautiful eyes , auburn hair , rosy cheeks , pouting lips , and ivory teeth . JONATHAN : That 's just what a fellow said to-day about the deacon 's wench . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swear that you love me better than all the world . JONATHAN : I never swear , Miss Harriet , nor tell fibs neither , so do n't insist upon my going on in that way . HARRIET : Without swearing then , tell me exactly how much you do love me . JONATHAN : I-I-I never can talk about love , Miss Harriet , I always stutter , when I try to speak about it . HARRIET : Sing it , then . Duett  --  Jonathan and Harriet JONATHAN : I can not tell the reason , but I really want a wife , And every body tells me ' t is the sweetest thing in life ; But as for checks like roses , with pouting lips , and such , I know no more about them , than Ponto does of Dutch . Tol de rol lol , &c.; HARRIET : Imitating If you expect to please me and win me for your bride , You 'll have to lie and flatter , and swear , my lad , beside  --  So now begin to practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even love , sir , the ground on which I tread .

Scene 1 An apartment in the Eagle Tavern . Enter Blandford and Waiter . BLANDFORD : Has Mr. Bellamy returned ? WAITER : No , sir . BLANDFORD : The moment he comes , tell him I wish to speak with him . WAITER : Yes , sir . Exit Waiter BLANDFORD : Where can he linger ? Musing Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try if business will not drive away the sad reflections which pleasure can not dissipate . And yet I know the attempt will be vain ; for there is but one charm that can ever restore peace to this harassed bosom , and that is the smile of affection from her I adore . Song  --  Blandford Is there a light whose effulgence can dry The tear of affliction , and rapture restore ? ' T is the bright sunny ray of a love-beaming eye , The smile of affection from one we adore . I 'd sigh not for grandeur , for fame , or for wealth , But thankful for little , would wish for no more ; If blest with contentment , with friendship and health , And the smile of affection from one I adore .

BELLAMY : To be sure I am , and I have reason to be ; for Sings " There 's nothing half so sweet in life , As Love 's young dream . " BLANDFORD : Are you ready to return to town ? BELLAMY : To town ! Are you mad , Charles ? We are just beginning to enjoy ourselves . Do n't think , of returning this month . BLANDFORD : I shall go immediately . BELLAMY : I am very sorry that I ca n't have the pleasure of accompanying you ; but I shall soon follow , with one of the sweetest little Forest Roses that ever graded a sportsman 's bosom . True , ' pon honour . BLANDFORD : A Forest Rose ? BELLAMY : Ay , man ! Blushing like innocence , and smiling like Venus . A woman , you sly one , or rather an angel in petticoats . BLANDFORD : An acquaintance ? BELLAMY : Of a very short standing , for I saw her for the first time this morning , and then only for about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her artless simplicity confessed it . That is enough for my purpose , you know . BLANDFORD : And has consented to accompany you to town ? BELLAMY : Begged me to take her . She did , indeed . BLANDFORD : And how is she to be situated there ? What arrangement have you made for the future ? BELLAMY : O , you must know , I seldom concern myself about the future ; but let that take care of itself . Though I think , on the present occasion , that I can speak with safety , if I say , that , ( provided I do not change my mind , ) I shall keep her a month . BLANDFORD : A month , Bellamy ! BELLAMY : Aye , a whole month ; I shall , ' pon honour . So , after this , reproach me no more with fickleness and inconstancy . Why , in London , we change them once a fortnight ; we do , indeed . BLANDFORD : And how will you provide for her then ? BELLAMY : How provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or something of that kind . The thing is done every day , on both sides the Atlantic . It is , indeed . BLANDFORD : And can you so calmly , so unfeelingly , and with so much self-complacency , meditate the ruin of an artless girl , and the consequent misery of every one to whom she is dear ? I can pity the errors of a fashionable education ; but I feel a different sentiment towards a wilful , deliberate act of perfidy . BELLAMY : Moralizing again ! I say , Charles , it is a devilish pity that you are not a parson ; your preaching goes so directly to the heart . It does , indeed , my dear fellow . BLANDFORD : Would to heaven it did . But , pshaw ! This is another of your empty boasts ; and I can forgive all your imaginary sins Edward , numerous as they are . BELLAMY : You may judge for yourself , Charles , whether this be an empty boast , or an imaginary sin . When a lover wears a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at this , and convince yourself . Displays the locket BLANDFORD : Aside Gracious Heaven ! It is  --  it is the very trinket which she vowed to wear for ever for my sake ! Where is she ? lead me to her instantly ! BELLAMY : Excuse me , Charles ; I shall not consider it friendly in you to interfere in this affair ; and must , therefore , decline giving you an introduction . BLANDFORD : Interfere ! Grant me patience , heaven ! Do you say  --  dare you swear  --  that  --  that  --  that  --  she consented ? No  --  it is impossible ! BELLAMY : What the devil is the matter with you , Charles ? BLANDFORD : Matter ! Can she  --  Oh , can she thus have fallen ! She who was all modesty  --  diffidence  --  chastity ! It can not be . The sensitive plant would not shrink more instinctively from the touch , than she from the thought of such a proposition . The thing is impossible . That locket has been lost , and you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go call a justice of the peace , and I will immediately swear that the lovely wearer of this trinket was in my arms to-day . BLANDFORD : Then is she lost indeed ! BELLAMY : Do you know the fair Harriet ? BLANDFORD : Harriet ! No , I know nothing of any Harriet . But I did know the angelic Lydia Roseville , who promised to preserve and wear this locket next her heart , for the sake of the giver . Look at it again . BELLAMY : The initials C.B. and L.R. in your own hair , are sufficient evidence of its having been your property . But how came it in possession of this milkmaid ? BLANDFORD : That is what I am impatient to learn . Show me where she lives ; it may lead to a discovery of the utmost importance to the happiness of your friend . BELLAMY : Then this will be the pleasantest intrigue in which I was ever engaged , as I may at once restore to you a lost mistress , and provide myself with a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little Forest Rose . I will , indeed . Exeunt Scene 2 The farm-yard and cottage as before . The Village clock now indicates a quarter past 4 o'clock in the afternoon . Enter William and Harriet from the cottage . HARRIET : Where did you leave your sister ? WILLIAM : In the orchard , conversing with Dobson , who has just arrived from Goshen with all the documents respecting my father 's estate , and is ready to put us in possession immediately . O , Harriet , you will be delighted with the situation . HARRIET : How do you know that I will ever see it ? WILLIAM : Because it shall be yours , or I will never see it again . HARRIET : Well , I will think of it , while you return to the orchard , and tell Lydia I wish to speak with her . Go  --  that 's a good fellow . WILLIAM : Will you remain here ? HARRIET : To be sure I will . Are you afraid that some magician will bear me off to his enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the next field ; and I thought you would not like to be left alone . HARRIET : Go along , you jealous fellow ! Exit William I wonder if the old saying be true , that love and jealousy always go together ? I think I should be convinced , if I saw William very particular to another girl . Song  --  Harriet When infant Cupid ventured first To spread his purple wing , It chanced he stopp 'd , to slake his thirst , At the Pierian spring ; When , rising from the crystal stream , A monster caught his eye , Poor Cupid started with a scream , But strove in vain to fly . To slay the little winged boy , The daemon vainly strove , His fangs could wound , but not destroy The son of peerless love . He follows still  --  ( they never part ) But vainly vents his ire , Though jealous tortures wring the heart , Yet ne'er can love expire . Enter Blandford and Bellamy BELLAMY : Apart That is she , Charles . Is she not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she furnishes me with a clew to find Lydia . BELLAMY : Stay , lovely girl , one moment , until I apologise for the alarm which my ill-timed proposal must have given you , when this locket came into my possession . HARRIET : I do not understand you , sir . BELLAMY : Apart to Blandford You see how it is , Charles ; the sly thing wo n't confess before you . I say , my dear , say what you please before this gentleman . He is our mutual friend , I assure you . He is indeed , my love , and will assist us to deceive old Squaretoes . HARRIET : I am still at fault , as you sportsmen would say ; just as I was this morning respecting a bird of paradise . BELLAMY : You see , Charles ; she pretends to know nothing about me . You had better retire , and leave us alone . You had , indeed . BLANDFORD : Pardon me , Miss Miller ; ( for that I understand , is your name , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , lost a trinket  --  a locket ? HARRIET : I have not , sir . I never owned one , or had one in my possession . BELLAMY : Aside Never !  --  Split me ! but she plays her part divinely . She does , indeed . HARRIET : Never . Do you doubt my word ? BLANDFORD : Do not be offended Miss Miller . I am particularly interested in this inquiry . BELLAMY : You need be under no restraint on this subject , as no one is present but ourselves . My friend is in my confidence , and may be trusted ; he is acquainted with every circumstance . He is , indeed , my dear . HARRIET : Then he has the advantage of me , sir ; for I am totally ignorant of any circumstance connected with the subject of your inquiry . BLANDFORD : Perhaps , Miss Miller , in the alarm which this gentleman 's sudden appearance gave you  --  being alone . HARRIET : You labour under a mistake , sir . His appearance was not sudden  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did I appear frightened , sir , when I was asking you about dandies , and donkeys , and calves ? Ha , ha , ha ! BELLAMY : My friend alludes to our second interview . Aside No city belle could perform better . HARRIET : This is our second interview ; for I have not seen you since you took so hasty a leave of my father this morning . BELLAMY : Not when you opened the door to see who knocked ? I hope , however , that you will excuse that act of apparent rudeness , when you recollect that I am yet almost a stranger to the manners and customs of this country , being but recently imported . HARRIET : Then I forgive you every thing , in consideration of the benefit you have done our revenue ; for a heavy duty , I am told , is paid on all articles the principal ingredient of which is brass . BELLAMY : She is only throwing dust in your eyes , Charles . She is indeed , ' pon honour . Enter William and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the very fellow that ax 'd me so many questions about Lid Rose . WILLIAM : The other is the English dandy I was telling you about . See ! He is honouring us with a squint through his quizzer . HARRIET : Have you any more questions to ask , gentlemen . BELLAMY : Apart to Blandford She is now throwing dust in the eyes of her rustic lover there . BLANDFORD : To come to the point at once , Miss , Miller , do you , or do you not , know the owner of this trinket ? HARRIET : I do not indeed , sir . I never saw it before . BELLAMY : Aside Her assurance is truly astonishing . It is , indeed . JONATHAN : Nor I neither , if I did darn me ! There 's a C. for cows ; and B. for bulls ; and L. for lambs ; and R. for rams . What a curious thing it is ! BELLAMY : Surveying Jonathan Split me ! but here 's a clodhopper that knows his letters . Been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pon honour . Wonder where he was caught . BLANDFORD : Let me entreat you , madam , if a glow of compassion ever warmed your bosom , to tell me how this locket came into your possession ? HARRIET : Into my possession , sir ! Have I not solemnly assured you that I never saw it before ! BLANDFORD : Nor this ? Presses a spring which opens the locket , and exhibits a miniature HARRIET : No , sir . But I perceive that it is a very striking likeness of yourself . BLANDFORD : Then , Bellamy , I demand an explanation of you . BELLAMY : Upon my honour , Charles , I have told you all I know upon the subject . I found that trinket , this morning , in the manner I described , and if it did not fall from this lady 's bosom , it must have dropped from the moon . It must , indeed . JONATHAN : I would as soon believe the moon was made of green cheese . WILLIAM : It is , certainly , very singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRIET : Indeed , I do n't know . BLANDFORD : She must be in this neighbourhood , and by heaven , I will find her , if I have to search every house in the county . I will neither taste of food , nor sleep until I call her mine , or ascertain that she has ceased to love me . Exit BELLAMY : Stay , Charles , one moment . JONATHAN : Poor fellow ! He is a little crack 'd I calculate . William and Harriet confer apart BELLAMY : You calculate , do you , sir ? JONATHAN : I guess I do , a little , in the way of trade . BELLAMY : And might one calculate on your assistance and fidelity , in an affair of importance ? JONATHAN : I take it he can , if he pays me well . BELLAMY : In that respect you shall be fully satisfied . You shall , indeed . Step this way , and I will explain . They retire up the stage Enter Lydia HARRIET : O my dear , you know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last quarter of an hour . But I suppose you have been chaunting your favourite ditty . Sings Though mourning like a mateless dove . LYDIA : Nay , Harriet , you know not what a treat I have enjoyed , by being absent ; and you can not know , until you have , like me , been for five years absent from your paternal home . HARRIET : But I can guess . You have seen Dobson ! LYDIA : Yes  --  and have strayed with him , in imagination , through every corner of our little farm . Every thing , William , is pretty much as it used to be , when we lived at home , and were so happy . Even the old cider-mill , is in being yet , and the cool dairy-house , by the side of the well . You recollect them well , William ? WILLIAM : What is there about the old place , that I do not recollect Lydia ? The mill-pond , the little waterfall , the meadow , the orchard , the well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often drank . Song  --  William Believe me , if there 's aught on earth , That can each grief disarm , ' T is the sweet spot which gave me birth , When smiling Memory paints its worth , It is my father 's farm . For every native rural charm Adorns my father 's farm . Though Fancy 's flight may mock the blast , To seek some distant charm , How soon her eyes are homeward cast , She roves awhile , but lights , at last , Upon my father 's farm . For every native rural charm Adorns my father 's farm . During the song , Bellamy is seen conferring with Jonathan , and finally gives him a purse , which the latter accepts reluctantly . Bellamy then gazes a moment at Lydia , appears to ask Jonathan some questions respecting her , and on receiving his answer , retires precipitately . Jonathan examines the contents of the purse , puts it in his pocket , and advances , just as the song is concluded WILLIAM : How now , Jonathan ! What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , if that fellow a n't a little crack 'd too . WILLIAM : Not about the middle I hope ; or he will certainly break off . HARRIET : In reply to Lydia Yes  --  and would insist upon it that I was the owner , as one of them said he found it here , by our door . LYDIA : A locket ! Feeling in her bosom HARRIET : Yes ; containing a miniature likeness of the other gentleman . Lydia shrieks , and rushes into the cottage JONATHAN : I 'll be darn 'd if she a n't a little crack 'd too . HARRIET : Lydia ! Lydia ! What is the matter ? Runs after her JONATHAN : She 's crack 'd too , by Hokey ! WILLIAM : Good day , Jonathan . Exit into the cottage JONATHAN : That 's very pretty manners , to be sure !

I must rest awhile upon this bank . Throws himself down Fool that I am , to engage in such a wild-goose chase . I shall never see her more . This trinket , however , will be dear to me , for she once wore it near her heart : it once rested on that pure bosom which I would rather press , than possess the Indies . Kisses the locket , and lays it down on the bank ; then takes a miniature from his bosom But here is her own sweet countenance . Those lips appear to move . Those eyes ! How could the artist do them justice , when their sweet gaze was fixed on him ? He rises and comes forward Song  --  Blandford That tranquil brow , and pensive eye , Those parted lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , Is kindling here , and seems to live ! A playful smile illumes the cheek ! Those rubies move ! ' Twill speak ! ' Twill speak ! ' T was fancy all ! That senseless bone , Could ne'er be taught her dulcet tone ; No art can teach that eye to move , Those ruby lips are dead to love . Illusive dream !  --  too soon it flies , The vision fades ! it dies ! it dies ! Report of a gun BLANDFORD : That must be Bellamy 's piece . So , ho ! ho ! Halloo ! Bellamy ! Halloo ! Halloo ! Exit , and is heard shouting behind the scenes Enter Jonathan JONATHAN : I do n't calculate I feel exactly right about keeping this purse ; and yet , I believe , I should feel still worse to give it back .

I wo n't dance with any fellow Jack-at-a-pinch . You could n't get Harriet Miller , and I think myself as good as her , any day , if her father is a ' Squire . Besides , there is Tom Clover  --  JONATHAN : Darn Tom Clover ! So you wo n't go along with me , hey ! SALLY : No , I wo n't . JONATHAN . Very well , Miss Sally .

JONATHAN : It is for my partner to wear at the dance , this evening . SALLY : Is it , though ? Well then , let 's have it . JONATHAN : Let you have it ! Catch me that fellow . Just now I wa n't good enough for you ! SALLY : Pshaw ! You know , Jonathan , that I was only jesting . I never intended to dance with any one but you . Now , dear , good Jonathan , give me a sweet kiss , and let us be friends again . JONATHAN : No  --  no . That cock wo n't fight , Sal . Remember the samp-mortar , and Lid Rose . I will take no girl Jack-at-a-pinch . Tom Clover wo n't have you , and I think myself as good as him , any day , though his father is a doctor . SALLY : Go then , you cruel , unfeeling monster , and see if I do n't make you smart for your falsehood and villainy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I will ; for reputation ; for keeping me in suspense ; and see what will become of your shop , then , when I recover nine thousand dollaars , which is the price every where .

Well , come now , what will you do ? JONATHAN : I 'll marry you to-night , if you say so , and never speak to another girl again , only in the way of trade , when they come to the shop after molasses , and such like . Come Sally . Do n't be cross , and here 's something to buy you a wedding-dress . Shows the purse SALLY : O what a beautiful purse that is ! Where did you get it ? JONATHAN : If you like the outside so well , what do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  There 's five guineas , and as many half dollars . SALLY : Now you are a dear good Jonathan . Where upon earth did you get guineas , though ? JONATHAN : I will tell you , Sally , and then take your advice upon the subject . Sally , what do you think ! I have promised to act like a damn 'd scoundrel for that money . SALLY : Then take it back , and restore it to the scoundrel who gave it you . Jonathan , you would n't keep such a promise as that , would you ? JONATHAN : Me ! no ! Sally , I would n't serve a negro so . But can not you contrive some method by which I can keep the purse , instead of the promise ? SALLY : Who gave it to you ? JONATHAN : A white-gilled , baby-faced fellow from New York , who wants to cut out Bill Roseville , and take Harriet Miller off to the city . SALLY : And what was you to do in such an affair ? JONATHAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men were to wait for her , and conduct her to the sloop which is lying at the landing . He said Harriet was very anxious to go ; but did not want to let her friends know any thing about it . SALLY : What a scape-gallows wretch it must be ! to tell you such a lie ! I know Harriet Miller better , and will instantly run to put her on her guard . JONATHAN : Then I must return the purse , you know . You are always ready enough to play tricks on me ; now ca n't you contrive some method to quiz the dandy , and yet make him believe that I tried to do all I promised ? Then you know , we can keep the purse with a good conscience . SALLY : Let me see . We can not deceive him with the samp-mortar instead of Harriet . JONATHAN : Darn the samp-mortar ! SALLY : I have it . Ha , ha , ha ! That will do . JONATHAN : What is it ? SALLY : No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany him on board the sloop , and that while the dances are going on this evening , she and you will slip away , and run to the willow-grove , where he must be in waiting for her . Tell him , also , that in order to prevent her being recognized by any one , she insists upon being closely veiled and perfectly silent , until she is safe on board the vessel , and beyond the danger of pursuit . Leave the rest to me . JONATHAN : Why , what do you calculate to do , Sally ? SALLY : Perhaps I calculate to take Harriet 's place and pay a visit to the city myself . JONATHAN : What ! with that fellow ! SALLY : Think what a chance there would be for you to immortalize yourself , Jonathan . Just as the ravisher had seized me in his arms , and was rifling these virgin lips of their nectareous sweets , a blow from my lover 's hand lays him prostrate in the dust . O would n't that be delightful ! JONATHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be right to knock a man down who has given me thirty-five dollars ? SALLY : Not unless you value me at more than thirty-five dollars .

Come . Exeunt Enter Miller , Blandford , William and Lydia BLANDFORD : Believe me , sir , the transport of this moment is a rich recompense for the months of misery I have endured . Where is your friend , Harriet , my love ? LYDIA : We left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far off , I warrant you . William , here , will find her directly . He is never at fault in such a pursuit . Enter upstage , youthful villagers , of both sexes , followed by Jonathan and Sally JONATHAN : I 'll be darn 'd , now , if there be n't the very crack'd-brain 'd fellow that lost the locket . What shall we do , Sally ? SALLY : We must make the best of it , Jonathan . JONATHAN : Well , I guess I am ' cute enough to do that in the way of trade . I say , Mister , you ha n't lost nothing nowhere , have you ? BLANDFORD : Yes , the trinket you saw me have to-day . A locket . JONATHAN : Not that curious thing with C. for cows ; and B. for bulls ; and L. for lambs ; and R. for rams ? BLANDFORD : The same . Have you found it ! JONATHAN : What will you give the finder , and no questions ax 'd ? BLANDFORD : A generous reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal Forest 's neck ; and all the reward I ax is the privilege of her wearing it this evening . BLANDFORD : What say you , Lydia ? It is your property . LYDIA : Let her wear it by all means ; and to-morrow I will redeem it with what will purchase Sally a wedding-dress . SALLY : Thank you , ma'am . Now , Jonathan , to the willow grove . Exeunt Jonathan and Sally MILLER : And now , as there is not a sad countenance present , let the sports commence . Find Harriet , William , and let us have a dance . Exit William The characters form a rural dance , which continues some time , when it is suddenly interrupted by a violent shriek from without . Sally rushes in and exclaims  --  SALLY : Run ! Fly ! Save Harriet Miller ! or she will be lost forever ! OMNES : Harriet Miller ! Where is she ? SALLY : There ! There ! in the willow grove , yonder ! Some wretches are attempting to carry her off by force ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others SALLY : Whispers to Lydia , who remains Enter Jonathan JONATHAN : Here they come with their prisoner  --  the very fellow that was here this morning . Enter Miller and William , dragging in Bellamy , followed by Rose , closely veiled , Blandford , and all the rest BLANDFORD : From this moment , Bellamy , our acquaintance terminates . I hope you are not alarmed , my love ? LYDIA : Whispers to Blandford Not in the least . MILLER : What have you to say , sir , in palliation of so base an attempt ! What blacker crime is there in the whole catalogue of human depravity , than to force an artless , innocent girl from the home of her infancy , and the arms of doting parents in order to initiate her into a life of vice and infamy ? WILLIAM : How can you answer this outrage to me , sir , knowing , as you did , in what relation I stood to the intended victim of your depravity ? SALLY : How can you answer it to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or to me , sir ? She is a customer to my shop , and I consider it a very black affair . BELLAMY : Go on , ladies and gentlemen . Have you all done ? Then I will condescend to explain . I have committed no outrage ; but appeal to this sweet , trembling girl , if she did not voluntarily put herself under my protection . Speak , lovely creature , and do me justice . Did you not willingly consent to accompany me to New York ? Rose bows her head in token of assent MILLER : How ! Harriet ! Speak , and explain this mystery ! Did you consent to abandon us all , and follow this foreign adventurer ?  --  this libertine in principle and practice ? Rose nods assent WILLIAM : And leave me , too , Harriet ? Rose nods assent BELLAMY : This lady is doubtless her own mistress ; and since she prefers me to you , sir , I can not see by what right you seek to control her actions . Permit me to remove this veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom you look with the eye of affection . ROSE : Throwing aside the veil On you , Massa Bellamy ; cause you kissee me so sweet , in the grove , just now . OMNES : Lid Rose ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! BLANDFORD : This , then , is the Forest Rose , that was to grace a sportsman 's bosom . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Love in the dark ! Hey Bellamy ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! BELLAMY : Looking at Rose through his glass A damn black affair , sure enough . The bumpkin is right . MILLER : Ha ! ha ! ha ! But where is Harriet ? Enter Harriet , from arbour HARRIET : Here she is , safe and sound . What , William , were you jealous again ? WILLIAM : Forgive me , Harriet . MILLER : Let us all forgive and forget ; and to prevent any further jealousies , William , there , take my daughter ; and may you both be as happy as you deserve . As for you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endanger the happiness of an affectionate family for the gratification of a selfish passion . BELLAMY : Old Squaretoes turned preacher , too , split me ! I say , Charles , I give you joy of your rustic alliance . I shall return to town immediately , and quit the country of savages in the  --  packet which sails the  --  ; I shall , indeed ; but I will not fail to notice you all when I publish my Three Months in America . WILLIAM : And do n't forget to notice the beauty and fragrance of our black roses ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! BELLAMY : Fragrance , you creature ! Strike me , exquisite , if all Roussell 's perfume would annihilate the cloud of odours with which that caricature upon humanity has impregnated my glove . Exit JONATHAN : How d'ye like onions ? MILLER : Now resume your amusements until the harvest-supper be served up , and remember that while we are lords of the luxuriant soil which feeds us , there is no lot on earth more enviable than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be omitted , at the discretion of the Manager MILLER : And now relieved from day 's turmoil , Let festive pleasures fill each breast , And no intruding sorrows spoil , The song or mirthful jest . For lords of the soil , and fed by our toil , American farmers are blest my boys , American farmers are blest . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; LYDIA : Ye fair , who seek a splendid lot , Behold content , a richer prize , Within the humblest ploughman 's cot , That rank and pride despise . And palace or cot , whatever your lot , The farmer your table supplies , my dear The farmer your table supplies . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; BLANDFORD : Whate'er the charms of mead or grove , In nature 's sweetest verdure drest , Of all the flowers that bloom , I love The Forest Rose the best . And husbandmen now , as they follow the plough , Will call it the pride of the west , my boys , Will call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil , &c.; HARRIET : Ye , fair , who sigh for wedded life , No more your lovers ' peace molest , Nor sow the seeds of future strife , Within an honest breast ; Or , when you 're a wife , I 'll bet you my life , He 'll make you repent of the jest , my dear , He 'll make you repent of the jest . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; WILLIAM : If some gay rival gain a smile From her who holds your plighted vow , Whatever pangs you feel the while , Let smiles adorn your brow ; For nought can annoy a husbandman 's joy , If Heaven but prosper the plough , my boys , If Heaven but prosper the plough . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; SALLY : Ye lasses , of some rustic chap , A sheepish , awkward thing at best , With wealth your tender heart entrap , And seek to be carest  --  Just place on his knee , a big mortar you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy will furnish the rest . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; JONATHAN : By girls we may be thus cajoled , But not by any dandy blade : A Yankee 's honour ca n't be sold , Whatever price be paid . But tempters are told , as we pocket the gold , ' T is all in the way of trade , my boys , ' T is all in the way of trade . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; ROSE : Ye city beaux , accept a hint , If forest roses please you best , Be sure there is no sable i n't , Or you may rue the jest . Our farmers all squint awhile at the tint , Before it is placed in their breast , my dear , Before it is placed in their breast . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; BELLAMY : Would you a maiden 's heart assail , Be careful or you 'll miss the mark , For Hymen 's torch with some prevail , While others choose a spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Before you make love in the dark , my boy Before you make love in the dark . CHORUS : For lords of the soil , &c.; Back matter End of THE FOREST
