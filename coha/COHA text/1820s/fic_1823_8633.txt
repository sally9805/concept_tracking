 --  " Moriainur ; et in media arma ruamus Una Salus victis , nullam sperare salutem . " PREFACE . In collecting materials for the notes on the settlement and wars of the western country , the history of the unfortunate Cayuga chief Logan presented itself . I thought his bravery , talents , and misfortunes worthy of a dramatic commemoration . For attempting the task of doing justice to the character of Logan , I have no apology to make . My right to the use of pen , and press is equal to that of any other man . Of the public I shall ask no indulgence . The imperial court of public opinion decides on the merit of every literary work , without favor or malice . If the work is well written it will live ; if not it will go where it ought , to the shades of oblivion . In the latter case however one advantage will result from my attempt , I shall have furnished materials for some abler hand to perform a work which certainly is due to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Wallace , he outlived the independence of his nation . Like Cato , he " greatly fell with his falling state . " Like Ossian , he was the last of his family , all of whom , but himself , had fallen by assassinations , which , for their atrocious character , are scarcely paralleled in history . " In every period of society , human manners are a curious spectacle . " Footnote : 1Kb The drama professes to represent them , and , when faithful to its object , can not fail to be interesting . How far I have succeeded in giving a correct portrait of the manners of the period of time alluded to , in the following composition , must be left to the judgment of the reader . As it respects the Back-woods-men , I can not be wrong , for I was brought up among them , and , I trust , that I have done justice to the customs and phraseology of the native sons of our forests . In all its historical allusions it is strictly correct . Should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it represents , is too horrible for the stage , or that its form is improper theatrical representation , I would willingly acquiesce in the decision , as I have no great ambition to appear in that department . It is enough that it be read ; but if unworthy of that , why , then , let it be thrown aside , among other abortive productions of the pen , and press . THE ARGUMENT . Logan , the principal subject of the following dramatic composition , was the second son of Shikellemus , a famous Chief of the Cayuga nation , whose residence was at Shamokin on the Susquchana . He was a man of peace , much attached to the English government , and of great service in bringing about the peace between the Indians and the Whites in the fall of 1764 . Logan followed his father 's example , till the spring of 1774 , when the atrocious and unprovoked murders of the Indians , at the mouth of Captina , on the 27 of April ; and at the mouth of big Yellow Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of Logan 's family , brought on the war of the Earl of Dunmore , which ended in the peace of Camp Charlotte , in Novemeber , in the same year . This drama , therefore , embraces a period of about seven months . It is reported that Logan , after the peace became melancholy and intemperate , and often wished for death ; and that he was murdered somewhere between Detroit and the Miami but by whom , or on what account , is not at present known .

A Militia Council of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close about us : what shall we do with them ? 1st Lieutenant . 1st Lieutenant Let us fall to work , and kill every rascal of them without delay , for they certainly intend mischief . 2d Lieutenant 2nd Lieutenant What evidence have we that they design to do mischief ? 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant Have you not heard of their having stolen horses from the land jobbers , and that they have killed nearly all the traders who were among them ? 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant I have heard these reports ; but do not know thro ' what channel they come . Perhaps they may not be true : a few days will confirm the truth or falsehood of them . We had therefore better wait a while . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant I am for no delay . You know that even a false report is always followed by a true one of the same kind . If the Indians have not already done mischief , they will soon do it . 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant I am no prophet . I can not foresee what these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid that evil is gathering about us , or why so large an encampment of Indians at the mouth of Yellow Creek ? Another has been made at the mouth of Captina . Thus they are stationed both above and below us , and more of them are now coming down the river in canoes . What do these things mean ? Why do these Yellow-jackets come so near us ? 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant They are still on their own ground . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant On their own ground ! What ground can an Indian have ? I would as soon apply to a buffaloe , for a right to the land over the river , as to an Indian . I could prove that he marked the earth with his feet , had eaten the weeds and brushed the bushes with his tail , and made paths to the salt licks , and what has an Indian done more ? Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso An Indian is not worthy to be compared to a buffoloe : He is a wolf , or bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a beast of prey . 2d Lieut 2nd Lieutenant They have at least the right of possession to the country . Providence placed them here , long before the white people knew any thing of this quarter of the earth . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso That is true , and if they had been worthy of its possession , they would have been continued in it ; but they are Canaanites , whom Providence has doomed to utter extermination . 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant I am no Moses , and am therefore not authorized to pass this dreadful sentence upon them . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso Neither am I a Moses ; but I am a Joshua to execute the decree for their destruction , and altho ' I can not command the sun and moon to stand still ; yet if my companions think as I do , this very day shall be long enough to finish some of them . Capt . Pacificus . Captain Pacificus Perhaps we had better take a little time for deliberation on this weighty concern . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we shall soon find means to discover their intentions . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso What , shall we wait for the tomahoc and scalping-knives , of the Indians to convince us of their bad intentions ! Are you not a ware that they claim the very ground on which we stand ? At the conclusion of the war between the English and the French , in 1763 , they entered into a confederacy to destroy all the forts , and settlements in the western country , and nearly did so . Have you forgotten the slaughter at Shamokin , and those of Muddy Creek , and the Big-levels , in the Greenbrier country ? Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus I am well acquainted with the history of those events , and also with the doings of the Paxton Boys , in murdering the Canestoga Indians in the jail of Lancaster . ( Pa . ) Depend upon it , if we have ground of complaint against the Indians ; they are not without theirs against us . We ought not to be too hasty in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . An Indian ought to be killed , he is naturally a murderer , and if not at war , it is only because he is chained down by fear . 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant They have been at peace with us for ten years . We are now much stronger than we were ten years ago , and I do not see any thing at present to encourage them to go to war against us . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso I am afraid you do not perfectly understand the matter . The Indians have much to encourage them to go to war : they know as well as we do , that we are shortly to have war with the English , and they will join them . I believe they have done so already , and that the English at Detroit , are now supplying them with arms , and ammunition . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant I know we shall have war : Did we not all see the great lights in the north last winter . They looked like ranks of soldiers , and troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes of the guns . The dogs have howled every night for a long time past . A few nights ago I dreamde that I saw a black cloud coming slowly from the westward ; when it came over my house it gathered into a bunch , fell down into the yard , and turned into blood . The blood appeared to be ancle deep . These we all know are signs of war , and we shall have it . We had better strike the first blow . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus Northern lights , dogs , and dreams , are not good foundations for war . If the council were disposed to hear them , I could give the most satisfactory proofs that the Indians do not intend war at this time . 2d Lieut. 2nd Lieutenant Let us hear them . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus In all their encampments on the Ohio we do not hear of any war Chiefs being among them . This is never the case when they intend war . In the time of hostilities they are more obedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their advice . The absence of their Chiefs is an evidence that their intentions are not hostile . At their encampments on the Ohio , there are more women and children , than men ; if they intended to make war , this would not be the the case . Whenever the Indians make war , they remove their women and children to a place of safety , as we do ours . If we are to have war , let us not sneak into it , like a thief in the night . If the presence of these Indians along the river is disagreeable to us , let us tell them so . In that case no doubt they will remove farther off ; if not , there will be some pretext for hostilities against them . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso I am for no delay . Let us strike while the iron is hot . They are within our reach , and we ought not to let them escape . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus Surely you will not kill women and children . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fur . Captain Furioso I would kill all , nits will be lice ; they have killed the traders , and now blood for blood . No mercy ought to be shown them . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus We do not know that they have killed any traders ; and if they have they were not within our jurisdiction , so that we are under no obligation to avenge their deaths . If traders , from a motive of gain , choose to venture among them , let them abide by the consequence . We have nothing to do with them . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant I am for avenging the blood of any white man shed by the Indians . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus Does it then belong to you or me , to make war or peace ? Peace and war , are national concerns , and not those of individuals . If the Indians have commited murders , let us ascertain the facts , and report them to government . A negotiation will follow , and if satisfaction be not given , a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to war openly , and with a good consceince . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso I am for no delay . I will not wait for a declaration of war . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus What then ? Will you be a murderer . Will you attack , and slaughter people who are at peace ? If you intend any such thing let them know it , that they may have an equal chance with you . Do not take them by surprise . Be an honorable soldier . A murderer is a coward . Besides , by killing these people you would become answerable to the criminal justice of our country . 1st Lieut 1st Lieutenant The criminal justice of our country , for killing Indians ! We are not afraid of that . All the sheriffs , magistrates , and constables in the country could not take one of us . If they should attempt it we would soon shew them the effects of club law . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso The thing must be done this very day . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the hand of Indians , and their bones are not yet buried . Now we have a chance to bury them , and we must do it . Our people will be much disappointed if we do not strike the blow . Let us be off . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus I have something more to say to you before the council breaks up . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso We are ready to hear you : provided you do not detain us too long . The day is wearing away , and we have a great deal to do . This is to be the day of vengeance . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus A day of vengeance , truly ! More so I apprehend than you are aware of . It may be a piece of sport to you , to shoot these Indian men , and bury the tomahoc in the heads of their women and children . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant Aye . This is the very game we want to be at , and that forthwith . Capt . Pac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you murder our own people too ? Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso What do you mean by this question ? Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus I will explain myself . The moment you strike the blow war is declared , and you may rest assured the Indians will not be slow in making retaliation ; but are we now in a condition to go to war ? We have had ten years of peace , during which time the country has been settled pretty smartly , but still our population is but thin , and we are all poor , we have no army , but few arms , and little ammunition to help ourselves with . You know our men had better be at work , and raise corn , and get meat to keep their families from starving , than to spend their time in building forts and going on scouts , and campaigns , this is not the worst , more than one half of our people will leave the country . Strike this blow , immediately every road leading to the mountains and over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your residence Capt . is not among us . You can easily return home , and there you will be out of danger . Will you light up the flames of war and then leave the few who either can not , or will not leave the country to contend with it ? Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso Do you suppose I am afraid of danger ? I shall be amongst you . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus That may be ; or may not be . To tell you the honest truth , I think but little of the bravery of any man who can every harbor a thought of commiting murder in cold blood . At all events , the man who can kill a woman or child , must be a coward . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso Do you mean that I am a coward , and that I intend to commit murder ? Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus I do not intend to retract any thing I have said , take it as you like . I had much rather risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you intend , if I could prevent it . I have but one life to lose , and you may as well take it , if you can , as that I should lose it in a war which you are about to bring on , and this will likely be my fate , as I intend at all events , to abide by the stuff . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant No more of that we have other matters on hand . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus I know very well that I am in no danger from you , say what I may . But I feel for others . What torrents of blood must be shed in consequence of what you are about to do this day ! On you , and your party , be the blame of the widows , and orphans , whose husbands , and fathers , must soon perish by the savages , in revenge for their relations , and friends , whom you are about to slaughter . Their sighs , their tears , and their poverty , will be laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be stained with blood . You will be regarded as cowards , and murderers , who have involved your country in a destructive war , without provocation  --  Would to God the Indians were acquainted with your design , that they might give you the reception you so richly deserve , and prevent the bloodshed of innocent people . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso You had better give them notice then . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus Were it in my power I certainly sould do so ; but you know it is not . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso Let us put the matter to vote at once , we have talked too long already . If any thing is to be done , let us do it . Call in our men . SCENE II . Enter a number of Militia , dressed in their habit , with rifles in their hands . Capt . Fur . Captain Furioso Men what have you to say about those Indians along the river ? shall we kill them ; or let them alone ? Omnes . Omnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . Let us not leave one of them alive . 1st Lieut. 1st Lieutenant The majority governs . Our resolution is taken . To work then my brave boys as speedily as possible . Exeunt omnes . Capt . Pac . Captain Pacificus Oh ! Lord what is man ? Is he thine image here below ? Is he the son of reason ? Why then is he the victim of the vilest passions ! He boasts of a revelation of thy divine government , teaching him to be the good Samaritan ; yet he is a fury . With all the rewards of a good conscience and the divine favor before him , he riots in the blood of his fellow man with savage brutality . What is there of justice on our side in the contest which must follow the deeds of this day ? We have ravished their country from these sons of the forest , and now slaughter them without provocation . What is the life of man ? It is like that of the frail mushroom , short in itself , yet liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! my country what a waste of life is soon to take place among our people , who although poor , were ' till now , peaceful , and contented . God of justice ! I call thee to witness that in the murderous deeds of this day , I have had no participation , and I invoke thy protection for me , and mine , during the storm of war now impending over us ! ACT II .

Tawa . Tawasta For some time past I thought we should have war . Footnote : 1Kb We have seen great lights in the north . The owls have been very plenty , and the pidgeons scarce . I have seen a great many strange sights , and heard strange noises in the air ; Yet I have always rejoiced in the sun beam of peace . Kuhn . Kuhn The life of man is a life of war . The wolves can not eat grass , Something must die before they can eat . The fox kills and eats the harmless birds . The rattle snake has its poison , and its teeth .

These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have dipped their hands in the blood of our people , and we must do so with theirs . The great father of the white people over the great water is angry with his children and will soon make war upon them , to punish them for being too proud , and we must join the great father . He has guns , powder , and lead for us , in exchange for our skins , and fur ; but his children are poor , and have nothing for themselves . Sha . Shahillas Let us not be too fast . This news has come to us like a bolt of thunder . The news has made our ears deaf , and the flash has blinded our eyes . We are like a man just awaking out of sleep , at the dawn of the morning , while the light is not yet clear , and his eyes not yet quite awake . He thinks he sees a bunch of large trees ; but they are nothing but a bunch of bushes . He sees , as he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hill .

The long knives have killed twelve of our people at Yellow creek . Kuhn . Kuhn They are for war . They are in earnest . Log . Logan Can you tell me what has become of my people ? Nes . Messenger They are all dead . Some of them at Captina , and the rest at Yellow creek . In the morning the captain of the white men came over to our camp , and looked very sharply about . I believe he counted us . Your sister told him to go away . That the Indians were angry , because their friends down the river had been killed . He went away . Afterwards your brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house where they sold rum to the Indians  --  but they took no guns with them . After they had been there a while , the white men killed them all . Several more were killed in a canoe as they were going over the river to see what had happened . Log . Logan Logan is left alone ; but he will not weep . he will think only of revenge . What think you brothers , must we not cover the blood of our people ? Kuhn . Kuhn The red hatchet must be lifted . Our arms must be strong for war . Call in the peace chiefs . SHENE II . Footnote : 1KbEnter Wingemind , and some other peace chiefs , Taw .

The snake before he bites , rattles , and coils himself up . Taw . Tawasta We must have war . The bones of our friends must be covered . Sha . Shahillas Must they be covered with the war hatchet ?

Logan The spirit of our friends will never rest until we have revenge on the whites . They have killed my people and I must kill too . Sha . Shahillas My heart is sorry for you , brother Logan . You have no brother to hunt with you , you have no wife , and sister to take care of your cabbin , and plant your corn . Were I angry at Logan I would say that he , as well as his grand father , Shikellemus has been too fond of the white skins ; but we all do wrong sometimes . Logan is our brother , and his people were ours too . We must take part in his revenge ; but brothers , I think we had best wait for a better opportunity . Kuhn . Kuhn What better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger than we are now ? Will the great spirit put the thunder , and lightning into our hands , and tell us to dash them upon the white skins ? will he turn rocks , and bushes into Indians , to help us in the war ? He has not told us so . We must have revenge , or give up , and say that we are squaws . Now is the time to strike , unless brother Shahillas knows something we do not . Sha . Shahillas It takes time to prepare for war . We might now strike a blow , and kill a great many before these white men would be ready for war . Yes brother Logan might have revenge for the blood of his people in a short time . His bullets , and toma hoc might soon cover their bones deep in the ground ; but brothers listen ! Our squaws must first be taken to a safe place , or the scouts of the white people would soon reach and kill them all , and where shall we put them ? would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? would they not sooner find them at all these towns ? Taw . Tawasta I am for revenge at once . The bones of our people must be covered . I am not afraid to die . I can die but once , and no matter how soon if I have made satisfaction to the spirits of my murdered friends . The large snake rattles , and bites , altho ' he knows he is to be killed the next moment ; but he dies contentedly , because he has struck his enemy the first blow , so will Tawatwees , if the great spirit says it shall be so . Kuhn . Kuhn The white people have already drove the red men from the long shore of the great water , where the sun rises , across the Allegheny mountains , and now over the Ohio . Many nations on the other side of the great mountain who used to count thousands , have vanished from the earth like the fog along the rivers in a summer morning . Others not quite gone are now small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . They are not satisfied yet . They must have our country too . Do we not see the marks of their hatchets on the trees ? their honey flies have come among us , and we shall see them with their non strings , Footnote : 1Kb measuring off our land for themselves . Brothers , if the white people must have our country , let us make it cost them as much of their blood as we can spill . Sha . Shahillas Brother Kuhn has said that the white men will not be long at peace . That their great father is angry with them . This I believe from things I have heard among them at Detroit . There will be but one car of corn , and one snow more before they will lift the red hatchet . We will then join our great father . We shall then be like a little bush under the shelter of a large tree , whose great arms cover it from the storms . By ourselves we are like a boy whose arms are not yet strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great father , we shall be strong enough for the white men . If we should strike now they will come from the other side of the great mountain where the sun rises , like swarms of locusts . They will cut roads through our country for the carriage of their big rifles , which make thunder , and lightning ; and they will fall on us with their long rows of men with coats all of one colour , with one horned guns in their hands . Shahillas is not afraid ; but he wishes to wait ' till he becomes stronger before he strikes the blow . Log . Logan Logan has been called the friend of the white men : his great father Shikellemus taught him to be so ; but Logan is still an Indian , and he must have blood for blood .

Shahillas No Brothers we must make a good peace with them , or fight them to the last . If they must have our blood , we must sell it to them for as much of theirs as we can get . Brothers we must answer to our fathers for the deeds of our lives . Our misfortunes are not our faults . Ought a tree to be blamed when split to pieces by the thunder ? Is it the fault of the little fawn that he is eaten up by the wolf ; or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time makes , and destroys every thing . We see the big bones about our licks ; where shall we now find the race of beasts to which they belonged ? They are all gone . Do we not walk every day over the bones of a race of men who have vanished from the earth , like white clouds in the evening ? Who built the great graves and forts which are seen all over our country ? Perhaps they were killed by our forefathers . The whites will destroy us . We have had our day , our night is at hand . These white men will have theirs , and then some strong nation will bring the dark night upon them . So says the great spirit . His arm is strong we can not hold it . We have only to do the best we can , where he has put our feet . ( Several scalp-halloos at a distance . ) Taw , Tawasta Good news ! It is like the clear sun shine after dark clouds and heavy rains . Sha . Shahillas The news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us like the first morning light to a man sick of a fever , whose pulse beats too hard in his temples , he rejoices to see the light , but is still sick . It is like a good plaister on a spider . Footnote : 1Kb The pain is stopped a little time ; but his legs are too long to be pulled out , he holds fast , and bites ' till the man dies . ( The scalp halloos continue . ) Taw . Tawasta It is the voice of Logan . Kuhn . Kuhn He comes with his hatchet red with blood . His scalp son a large stick , and I hope with a prisoner for the fire . Taw . Tawasta ( Pointing thro ' a crack in the council house ) I see him yonder : he has a prisoner . Kuhn . Kuhn Thank the great spirit . SCENE II . Enter Logan with three warriors , bringing a prisoner , and three scalps on a pole . Log . Logan Good brother ( Shakes hands with all the Chiefs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( presents the prisoner and scalps ) . Kuhn . Kuhn Our hearts are glad brother , that the great spirit has given success to the red hatchet of war in your hand . You have been strong , though before now always the friend of peace . Log . Logan Logan was the son of peace ; but now he has tasted blood peace will never live in Logan 's cabbin again . Taw . Tawasta Young warriors take away the prisoner , make him run the gauntlet , tie him to a stake , make his white skin as black as a burnt tree , with powder and water , kindle the fire . We will then tell you what is to be done . Exeunt warriors with the prisoner , Kuhn . Kuhn Shall we burn the prisoner ? Taw . Tawasta I think so . It is now a long time since our old warriors have smelt the burning flesh of a white man . Our young warriors , have never seen a prisoner burned at the stake . They must see what their fathers have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made harder . Let them burn the prisoner , and let some of the old men shew them how to do it , that he may not die too soon . Sha . Shahillas What shall we gain by burning the prisoner ? I can not see that burning him will be of any service to us . He is a prisoner , and can not help himself , Shahillas is a warrior , and will never lay his hand on the helpless , and weak ; unless in mercy . He will give him food if he is hungry , and clothe him if he is ragged , but he will not kill him ; if he did he would shoot him ; but not burn him . Kuhn . Kuhn Shahillas is a warrior . In battle he is a storm , his heart is strong , death follows the blow of his hatchet , and the flash of his gun ; but when the fight is over he is as mild as the little winds in the spring . He can take a prisoner ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Shahillas is too good . Taw . Tawasta This war was made for revenge , and we must have it . If our lives should pay for it . War is not the work of kindness . We must shoot , stab , tomahoc , and burn all the whites we can catch . War is the work of death . So the long knives treat the red skins . The men , women , and children are all alike to them . If the little child cries , they do nt mind it , they break its head with the tomahoc . They know more than we do , and ought we be better than they are . Let us burn him . Sha . Shahillas This war can not last many moons longer . Burning this prisoner will only make it worse . This prisoner has friends , perhaps his blood runs in the veins of more than one hundred people , if we burn him they must kill too , and where will our murders come to an end ? This prisoner looks like a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man among his people . Kindness to him may be kindness to ourselves in the end . Let us not burn him . Kuhn . Kuhn Burning prisoners has been the custom of our forefathers from old times , and their spirit will be angry with us if we depart from their custom . Do we not see bones mixed with coals , and ashes on the graves . It was on the top of those little hills , which they made with their own hands , that they burned their prisoners , as offerings to the great spirit , and the ghosts of their friends slain in war . We must do so too . The spirit of our friends will grieve if he is not burned . The white men are as cruel as we are . They killed our friends and then burned them in the house where they were killed . Enter a young warrior . War . Warrior The prisoner is tied to the stake . He is made black  --  and the fires are burning . The warriors are waiting for the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner afraid ? Does he tremble ? Or is he a man ? War . Warrior He is a strong man . He is not afraid . He talks to the great spirit . Log . Logan Go back young man , and tell the warriors we shall soon let them know what is to be done . Exit warrior . Sha . Shahillas We must not burn the prisoner . We are mistaken about these white men . They have indeed killed our friends in cold blood , but who committed this murder ? The whole nation ? No ! Only a few bad men . All their great councils will condemn the deed . The names of their chiefs who committed those murders will be black while the world lasts . For the white men forget nothing . They write every thing in their books . Taw . Tawasta Must we then be better than the white men ? Sha . Shahillas Brother Tawatwees . Will it hurt our pride to be told that we are better than white men ? Thank the great spirit , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shall we burn the prisoner ? Log . Logan A prisoner belongs to the nation . And it belongs to the chiefs to say what shall be done with him . It may be I have done wrong and if I have I beg pardon . I have promised him his life , and Logan never told a lie . Taw . Tawasta Logan is a strong warrior ; yet he grew up in the sunshine of peace ; but Logan is too good . His heart is too soft . Will the spirits of his friends be satisfied if this prisoner is not burned ? Log . Logan The hearts of Logan 's friends were like his own , they were good , they were not hard . While living he was their chief . He is so still , and the last of his race . Their spirits are satisfied with what Logan has done . Brothers , I thank you for assisting me with the red hatchet , in taking revenge for the murder of my people . I beg the life of the prisoner . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must he say with his last breath that Logan has told a lie ? Taw . Tawasta Logan is a good man . He has promised too much to his prisoner ; but he must keep his promise . Let us give him his prisoner . Kuhn . Kuhn Our young men will be much disappointed . They are all anxious to put the fire to the white man . Log . Logan They are young men . They will soon forget the disappointment . Logan has had revenge . He has done his duty to his people . SCENE . III . Enter Queeta with her son Sheba a young warrior , and two daughters . Queeta . Queeta Fathers ! Queeta 's son was killed at the camp of Logan , at Yellow Creek . Queeta wants another son in his place . I will take the prisoner in the place of my son . Sheba . Sheba Sheba wants a brother . The prisoner is a strong young man . Sheba 's eyes would be full of tears if he should be burned . We will hutr hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner . Young Squaws . Young Squaws We want a brother . The prisoner will be a good hunter , and kill deer for us , and we will be kind to him . Good fathers ! do give us the poor prisoner for a brother . Exeunt Queeta and her daughters . All the chiefs . All the Chiefs Logan the prisoner is yours . Do with him as your good heart directs . Exit Logan . Sha . Shahillas We shall make our young warriors angry for a while ; but we shall stop the blood which runs so fast from the veins of both of the white , and red men , and this is best . Kuhn . Kuhn Tawatwees , and Kuhn are both for blood ; but Logan and Shahillas are great men . They are strong in war , and the light of their minds , is the light of the sun when he is highest in the sky . We agree , and hope it is for the best . SCENE . IV . Enter Logan with the prisoner , with a belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs shake hands with him , each calling him brother . ) Enter Queeta , with her son and daughters . Log . Logan Mother , I give yon the prisoner for a son , and you shall not pay for him . Poor mother you , like Logan , have lost too much already ! You have lost your son . The prisoner is now in his place . And now prisoner , Logan has something to tell you . When we were bringing you here , I promised you , that you should not die , and I have made my promise good . Now be a man . Here is you mother , she is a good woman . Here is your brother , he is a fine young man , and here are your two sisters , they are good girls . They will be kind to you ; they will not ask you to work ; but you must kill meat for them . Be a good man , prisoner . Do not run away . This war can not last always , the time may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your own people , with honor , and perhaps help to stop the blood which is now running . Logan returns to the war , and you may never see him again ; but whatever may be his fate , you will say that Logan has been your friend . ( Prisoner , attemping to kneel down . ) Log . Logan Do nt kneel . Stand up like a man . Logan is not the great spirit . Pris . Prisoner I thank you , good chiefs , for my life . I shall not run away , I shall always say that Logan has been my best friend . Queeta . Queeta ( Taking the prisoner by the hand . ) My son ! ( Wiping her eyes . ) Did you ever loose a brother by death ? Pris . Prisoner Yes mother , one of my brothers died some time ago Queeta . Queeta Did he come to life again ? Pris . Prisoner No !

Warrior I am one of the spies sent by the Tawatwees to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one moon . Sha . Shahillas And what have you seen brother ? War . Warrior Too much . They are coming upon us as thick as grasshoppers . Capt . Dunmore is coming up the Hockhocking , and Capt . Lewis lower down . They intend meeting in this town . Sha . Shahillas How do you know that . War . Warrior One dark night I got close to two of their men , who watch on the outside of the camp , and I heard them say that they would have fine fun , and plenty to eat in Chilicothe in a few days , and the great captain and their warriors would shake hands there . Sha . Shahillas Are you sure of this warrior ? Do you understand their talk ? War . Warrior Yes I do . Too much . Exit warrior . Kuhn . Kuhn The dark clouds are coming close to us . What shall we do brothers ? Shall we fight ; or make peace with the long knives ? We must do something very soon . Taw . Tawasta It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we drink too much of the strong water made by the white men , and because we did not burn Logan 's prisoner . Let us make him an offering . ( He clears away every thing from around the council fire , after which he and the other chiefs draw each an handfull of tobacco from their pouches , and throw it into the fire . ) Taw . Tawasta O ! Great Spirit ! We have made you an offering of tobacco . Now hear us , your red children . The white men are coming to kill us , and our squaws and children . Oh ! Great Spirit , make these white men sick with the fever , that there may be a great many new graves about all their camps , so their hearts may be made weak . Make all the deer and turkies go away from about them , that they may become hungry and go home . O ! Great Spirit , make the two great captains get mad , quarrel , and fight with one another and go way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hands of your red children strong to fight these long knives , and kill and drive them a way from our country . Brothers . Brothers We must remove our squaws and children to Lower Sanduskey , out of the way of the long knives , or they will kill them all . Then we must fight them and drive them away if we can . Sha . Shahillas Brothers , it is to late . The snow will soon come . If we take away our squaws and children they will starve ; for the white men will destroy all our corn . We can not fight . We have too little powder and lead . We must make peace . Kuhn . Kuhn Will they make peace with us ? I think they are too angry . They want to kill us all , and take all our land . We must fight to the last . Sha . Shahillas The long knives form Kenhawa are very angry , and would kill all our squaws and children as well as ourselves , if they could ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad . They will make peace with us . Kuhn . Kuhn How do you know that ? Sha . Shahillas It may be I have done wrong , I have sent a messenger to Capt . Dunmore to ask him if he would make peace . He says he will . His messenger with a white flag will be here presently . We must make peace with Capt . Dunmore , before the long knives from Kenhawa join them , Capt . Dunmore is not angry ; but the long knives are very angry . Log . Logan This war was made for Logan , and he had revenge for the death of his people ; but he is sorry that so many of our warriors have been killed by the long knives . Brothers you suffered too much for Logan ; he is but one man . Kuhn . Kuhn Brother , we have not done too much for you . We are all one , and we must help all our brothers . SCENE II . Enter a messenger from the camp of Dunmore , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your brother , Capt . Dunmore , sends me to the chiefs with this white flag . ( To Logan . ) Captain Logan , I am glad to see you Log . Logan ( angrily ) May be so . ( To the Interpreter , ) stand by me , ( reads . ) The Earl of Dunmore , Governor of the province of Virginia , makes known to the chiefs of the nations , now unhappily confederated in hostility , against the good subjects of his majesty the king of England , that , deprecating on his part , the bloodshed and miseries of war , he is desirous of entering into an honorable and permanent peace , with the Indian nations , now at war , and will gladly receive the chiefs at camp Charlotte tomorrow at noon , should it be their wish to enter into a treaty of peace . Exit messenger . SCENE III . Enter a young warrior . Kuhn . Kuhn What news have you ? War . Warrior Captain Lewis and his long knives are coming up the Scioto , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to kill us all , if they can . I heard their watchmen on the outside of the camp say so . They are very angry , because so many of their men were killed at the Kenhawa . Taw . Tawasta Did you hear them say any thing about Capt . Dunmore ? War . Warrior Yes . I heard them say that Capt . Dunnore is the biggest captain . They are afraid that he will make peace with the Indians , befor they can get to Chilicothe . They want to get here first and kill all the Indians , before , Capt . Dunmore makes peace . Exit warrior . Kuhn . Kuhn What shall we do ? Shall we take our squaws and children away from the long knives ? They will kill them all if they can . Sha . Shahillas We will not send our squaws and children away yet . We must send a messenger to the big Capt . Dunmore with the talk of the warriors , and he will send one of his captains to tell Capt . Lewis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move off our squaws and children as fast as we can , and then sell our wigwams and corn to the long knives , for as many of them as we can kill . Taw . Tawasta Call the warrior , and give him the white flag , to go to the big Capt . Dunmore . Enter Warrior . Sha . Shahillas ( Hands him a white handkercheif on a stick . ) Take this to the big Capt . Dunmore , and give him the same talk which you have given us . Exit warrior . Sha . Shahillas Who shall go to the camp of Capt . Dunmore tomorrow ? We must make peace , as soon as we can ; or we shall have bad times . Taw . Tawasta I am afraid of these white men . They are all liars . They want to get us into their camp , and they kill us all , like they did our friends at Yellow creek . May be , we had better move off first , and then make peace if we can . Kuhn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long knives are close to us , and we have a great many squaws , and children , and wounded men to take care of . Our people must begin to pack up to go away . Sha . Shahillas They may do so , if they choose ; but if they do so , it must not be told . It would make Capt . Dunmore very angry , if he should be told of our preparing to go away . He would say that we do nt believe what he says . We must appear to believe these white men ; altho ' we know them to be very great liars . Log . Logan There is no danger . Capt . Dunmore will make peace with us . The dark clouds are coming from the other side of the great water , where Capt . Dunmore lives . The great chief of the white men is getting very angry with his children here , because they do nt give him money enough . He will soon lift the red hatchet against them . Logan has had revenge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theres the leaves to the white men themselves . They will save Logan the trouble of killing any more of them . They will cut each others throats very soon . The great chief over the great water will want the red men to join him . Capt . Dunmore knows all this . He will make peace . He came here to save us from the long knives . Kuhn . Kuhn We must all go to the camp of the great captain to-morrow . Log . Logan Go brothers , with all our warriors ; but Logan will not go . Logan will never look in the face of a white man , with the words of peace in his mouth . Logan consents to bury the red hatchet for the sake of his brothers ; who have already suffered too much for him . Here interpreter take this talk to Capt . Dunmore . ( Reads the speech form a belt of white wampum , and then hands it to the interpreter . ) " I appeal to any white man to say , if ever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meat : if ever he came cold and naked , and he clothed him not . During the course of the last long and bloody war Logan remained idle in his cabin , an advocate for peace . Such was my love for the whites , that my country-men pointed as they passed , and said , ' Logan is the friend of the white men . ' I had even thought to have lived with you , but for the injuries of one man . Colonel Cresap , the last spring , in cold blood , and unprovoked , murdered all the relations of Logan , not even sparing my women and children . There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature . This called on me for revenge . I have sought it : I have killed many : I have fully glutted my vengeance : for my country I rejoice at the beams of peace . But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear . Logan never felt fear . He will not turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mourn for Logan ?  --  Not one . " Exeunt omnes
