txt ART . VI. - Memoirs of . llgernon Sydney , by George Wibwn Jileadiey , with an . ippendix . Svo , London , 1813 . No portion of English history presents stronger claims to attention than the last sixty years of the seventeenth century , a period in which that nation made the most rapid advances in civil and religious freedom . It is impossible to // Van . trace without lively interest the progress of the spirit of free inquiry to which the reformation gave birth , and the great change in manners and opinions which resulted from it . This tevolution in the minds of men was gradual , a ndforalong time unnoticed . The novel doctr*es of the rights of subjects and the duties and accountableness of sovereigns , began early in that century to be agitated , rather as matter of speculation than with any view to their practical application . These opinions , however , soon gained ground , and began to be openly advanced and defended , when an ill-timed and oppressive exercise of the royal prerogative roused the resentment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the overthrow of the monarchy , and the death of the sovereign . The reaction , which naturally succeeded to a revolution so sudden arid violent , had the effect to , replace his son on the throne , with a degree of precipitancy and imprudence which gave no opportunity to obtain any provision for the security of the rights of the subject . These rights were accordingly disregarded by a profligate and thoughtless prince , who forgot even the trifling stipulations on which his restoration depended . The spirit of liberty had now however proceeded too far to be extinguished ; the nation soon became sensible of its error ; this weak and unprincipled family was again driven from the throne , and the century closed with the accession of William Ill , and the establishment of the British constitution nearly in the form in of the most illustrious names in modern history . Of this number Algernon Sydney is one of the most conspicuous His noble descent , his ardent and lofty spirit , the boldness of his opinions , and the intrepidity with which he supported them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his untimely and cruel fate , conspire to excite an unusual degree of interest . As generally happens to those who fall a sacrifice to opinions , his memory has been cherished by his friends with the most enthusiastic devotion ; and we may add , what can be said of few martyrs , that those who have discovered the least indulgence for his political creed , have rarely denied him the merit of consistency and disinterestedness . The part he took in political affairs is well known to the readers of history , but we have been furnished , until the publication of the volume under review , with very scanty information respecting his private life . // N or is the deficiency so fully supplied by this work as we had reason to expect from the author 's preface , in which he mentions the advantages he derived from having access to the manuscripts at Penshurst , and other important papers . Although by no means a new publication *in England , Mr Meadley 's book is very little known in this country ; we shall therefore give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader to form a tolerably correct judgment of the author 's success . Algernon Sydney was descended from a line of ancestors equally distinguished by rank and merit . His great grandfather , sir William Sydney , was a favorite of Edward VI , who bestowed on him the park and manor of Penshurst in Kent ; sir Henry Sydney , who was viceroy in Ireland in the reign of Elizabeth , and the well known sir Philip Sydney , were his great uncles . His grandfather , sir Robert Sydney , governor of Flushing , was raised to the peerage by James I , as baron Sydney of Penshurst , and afterwards created viscount Lisle and earl of Leicester . From him the title descended to his son , who seems to have inherited with it no small share of the talents and virtues of his illustrious progenitors. lie married the lady Dorothy Percy , daughter of the earl of Northumberland . Algernon , their second son , was born in 1622 , and appears to have given early indications of uncommon powers . In 1632 , at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lord Lisle , accompanied his father in his embassy to Christian IV , king of Denmark . In 1636 his father was appointed ambassador to the court of France , and wishing to have his sons under his immediate inspection , he again took them along with him , and to his instructions , and the objects presented to the mind of young Sydney at that period , is in a great measure ascribed his early bias to political inquiries . On the return of lord Leicester to England , his son was sent to Italy , and resided some time at Rome during the pontificate of Urban VIII . On the death of the unfortunate lord Strafford , the earl of Leicester received the appointment of lord lieutenant of Ireland , ( June 14 , 1641 , ) but owing to some distrust of him , which the king had afterwards imbibed , he could not procure his despatch . He sent , however , his two sons into lreland , the lord Lisle being at the head of a regiment of horse , in which Algernon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Here both the brothers acquitted themselves with great honor against the Irish insurgents . Meanwhile the disputes between the king and the parliament had proceeded to an open rupture , and lord Leicester , notwithstanding his late disappointment , espoused the royal cause . Some jealousy however of his sincerity still existing in the mind o* the king , he was unable to obtain possession of his government in Ireland ; at which he was so much offended , that he soon retired to Penshurst , and seems never after to have taken an active part in politics . The two brothers quickly discovered that they had not escaped the suspicion that had fallen on their father , and in consequence obtained permission to return to England . They arrived at Chester , August 1643 , where their horses were seized by the royalists in violation of their father 's license , which induced them again to put to sea . On landing soon after at Liverpool , they were detained by the commissioners of the parliament till farther orders were received respecting them . A letter from Sydney to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horses might he restored to enable him to proceed to join the king at Oxford , and professing attachment to the royal cause , was intercepted , and in consequence himself and his brother were sent under guard to London . This circumstance tended to exasperate the king , who imputed it to an artifice of their own ; and from this time Sydney appears to have deserted his interest , for we find that on the 10th of May , 1644 , he was appointed a captain of horse in the duke of Manchester 's army , the parliament voting four hundred pounds for his equipments and arrears . In a few weeks he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel , and on the *d of July was seriously wounded , while charging gallantly at the head of his regiment in the battle of Marston Moor . When the army was new modelled ( 1645 ) Sydney procured the command of a regiment of horse in Cromwell 's division of the army under the command of sir Thomas Fairfax . He bore upon his banner the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10th of May , in the same year , he was appointed governor of Chichester , and soon after elected into parliament for the borough of Cardiff Although the royal cause in England had received a fatal blow at Naseby , ( June 14 , 1645 , ) and the king had surrendered himself to the Scots , his adherents in Ireland still kept the field in considerable force . Lord // Lisle was appointed lord lieutenant , in the place of lord Inchiquin , who had incurred the suspicion of the parliament , but who nevertheless , had sufficient influence in that body to prevent his successor from obtaining possession of his government until the year for which it led been granted had nearly expired . Sydney accompanied his brother to Ireland ; two thousand pounds were voted in payment of his arrears , ( Jan. 4 , 1646-7 , ) and he was appointed lieutenant-general of horse in that kingdom , and governor of Dublin . Their stay in Ireland was short , for the interest of the lord Inchiquin was sufficient to prevent the renewal of lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his post . In consequence , the brothers returned to England in April , and received the thanks of the parliament for their good conduct . At this period the contest between the presbyterians and independents was proceeding with the utmost violence ; the former endeavoring to preserve the ascendency they possessed in the parliament , and the latter , of whom the army was principally composed , strongly inclined to make use of the power they derived from this circumstance to put a stop to the arbitrary and selfish proceedings of their opponents . Sydney , who was entirely free from religious enthusiasm , seems not to have sided with either of those factions , but to have uniformly endeavored , by mildness and impartiality , to uphold amid the tempest of the passions the cause of rational liberty . This contest was soon terminated by the violent measures of the army , who obtained possession by force of the person of the king , and removed the last impediment to their views by violently expelling the presbyterians from their seats in parliament . They next demanded the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation to resist , and a commission was raised to sit in judgment upon him . Both Sydney and his brother were members of this court , and the former attended some of the preliminary meetings in the painted chamber . They were neither of them present , however , in Westminster Hall , but retired together to Penshurst , where they remained until sentence had been pronounced , and a warrant signed for the execution of their unhappy sovereign , it is difficult to account for the behaviour of Sydney at this momentous period , which seems not very consistent with his character or conduct on other occasions . That his declining to take a part in the condemnation of the king did not arise from conscientious // scruples , is plain from his political principles , as laid down in his writings , from his frequently expressing his approbation of that act , and from the consequence he seems to have maintained in the parliament , where we find him on the 15th of May in ear On a*ommittee for settling the and the same y succession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family appear to have fallen under suspicion ; for , although his father was obliged to sign the engagement of fidelity to the commonwealth , the duke of Gloucester and the princess Elizabeth were intrusted by the parliament to the care of lady Leicester , with an allowance of three thousand pounds a year . Sydney had been invested ( 13th of Oct. 1648 ) with the government of Dover castle . In the winter of 1650-1 he be-. caine involved in a quarrel with the officers of the garrison there , which gave rise to a court martial , whose report was unfavorable to Sydney . Thinking himself aggrieved , he applied to the parliament for redress , which he at last obtained , not without great inconvenience and delay . In the mean time , he went over to the Hague , where he had a quarrel with the earl of Oxford , whom he challenged , but the affair was settled W ) thout bloodshed . On his return to England ( 1651 ) Sydney was assiduous in attention to his duties in parliament , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous administration of affairs at home , and the great success of the fleet under Blake , had now raised the spirits of the nation to a high pitch , and Sydney , ever alive to the true interest and prosperity of his country , began to look forward with the most exulting hopes . These pleasing anticipations were soon blasted by the ambitious projects of Cromwell , who saw with the utmost concern the attachment of the nation to a republican form of government , which it was far from his intnution to establish . Failing in all his endeavors to bring the parliament to his views , he at length threw off the mask , and on the 16th of April 1653 dissolved that assembly by force . The conduct of Sydney on that memorable occasion is thus related in lord Leicester 's journal : It happened that Algernon Sydney sat next the speaker , on the right hand ; the general said to Harrison , put him out ; Harrison spake to Sydney to go out , but he said he would not go out , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Harrison and Worslcy put their hands upon // Sydney 's shoulders , as if they would force him to go out ; when he rose and went towards the door . ' The indignation of Sydney at this and the subsequent measures of Cromwell was so openly and loudly expressed , as to give great offence to his brother , who a*1hered to the general . Unable to endure so mortifying a change in*rtffairs , he sought at Pens- ' hurst , among the scenes of his childhood , to alleviate his chagrin in the society of his family . Here he remained until the restoration of peace with the United Provinces in 1654 , when he again went over to the Hague , where he contracted an intimacy with the celebrated John De Witt , for whom he seems ever after to have entertained the highest admiration . On his return to Erigla nd , Sydney again retired to Penshurst , where he devoted himself to literary pursuits . We find among his productions at this period an Essay on Love . ' On the 3d of Sept. 1658 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1659 , the Long parliament was restored , and Sydney resumed his seat in that body , as well as at the council board . He had , however , little opportunity to distinguish himself in parliament during the interval between the death of the protector and the restoration of the king , for on the 5th of June he was appointed a commissioner with admiral Montaga , Honeywood and Boon , to mediate , in conjunction with the States General , a peace between the kings of Denmark and Sweden . This negotiation Sydney at length succeeded in bringing to a happy termination , though greatly embarrassed by the defection of Montaga , the selfish policy of the Dutch , and the unreasonable demands of both the contending parties . Charles Gustavus , king of Sweden , died before the conference was brought to a close . Sydney had conceived a high idea of his opinions and character , and felt a warm interest in the affairs of his young successor , Charles XI , who , on his taking leave of the court , ( June 28 , 1660 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father in a case set with diamonds . On the 8th of July he joined his colleague at Copenhagen , and on the 21st of the same month took leave of the king of Denmark . In the mean time the restoration of Charles II had taken place , and Sydney , while Honeywood returned to Enola ceedings , thought it prudent to b ad to report their proretire to Hamburg , until he should be advised of the temper of the court , and the situation of those , who , like himself , had borne a leading part in the service of the commonwealth . He at first entertaint*4 hopes Se*u Series , . Mo . 9. 9 // from the intimate connexion of Monk with himself and his family , and from some favorable expressions that had been reported to him from that minister , that he should be permitted to return to England on the honorable terms , on which alone be would consent to it . He was 5OO* convinced by the treatmeat of his associates , and the tr*ttchery of Monk , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions which he considered disgraceful ; He rejected with disdain the splendid offers made him by Monk ; and to a friend , who had expostuhated with him on his inflexibility , he vindicates his conduct in a letter , which , as the author justly observes , would have done honor to the noblest characters of Greece and Rome . We would gladly lay it before our readers entire , but its length obliges us to confine ourselves to the following extract : I confess we are naturally inclined to delight in our own country , and I have a particular love to mine . I hope I have given some testimony of it . I think that being exiled from it is a great evil , and woul ( l redeem myself from it with the loss of a great deal of my blood . But when that country of mine , which used to be esteemed a paradise , is now like to be made a stage of injury ; the liberty we hoped to establish oppressed ; luxury and lewdness set up in its height , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we hoped God by our hands would have introduced ; the best of our nation made a prey to the worst ; the parliament , court , and army corrupted ; the people enslaved ; all things vendible , no man safe but by such evil and infamous means as flattery and bribery ; what joy can I have in my own country in this condition ? Is it a pleasure to see all that I love in the world is sold and destroyed ? Shall I renounce all my old principles , learn the vile ct ) urt arts , and make my peace by bribing some of them ? Shall their corruption and vice be my safety ? Ah ! no : better is a life among strangers , than in my own country on such conditions . Whilst I live , 1 will endeavour to preserve my liberty , or at least not consent to the destroying of it . I hope I shall die in the same principles in which I have lived , and will live no longer than they can preserve me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as I think , of no meanness . I will not blot and defile that which is past , by endeavoring to provide for the future . I have ever had in my mind that when God should cast me into such a condition , as I can not save my life but by doing an indecent thing , he shews me the.time is come wherein I should resign it : and , when I can not live in my own country but by such means as are worse than dying in it , I think he shews me I ought to keep myself out of it . ' // 1822 . Ljfe of Algernon Sydney . The conduct of Sydney was conformable to the sentiments here expressed . Conscious of honest intentions , he had nothing to repent of ; having , as he supposed , supported the rights and liberties of his country , and consulted her best interests , he could not make concessions to men whom he looked upon as her enemies and oppressors . He &amp;*d not take the least pains to conceal his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Copenhagen , he wrote the famous lines in the Album : Manus ha*c inimica tyrannis Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem ; ' which Terlon , the French ambassador , on hearing it translated , for he did not understand Latin , indignantly tore from the book , as an insult to his sovereign . When it was observed to him in company at Copenhagen , 1 think you were none of the late king 's judges , nor guilty of his death ? ' He instantly replied , Guilty ! do you call that guilt ? Why it was the justest and bravest action that ever was done in England or any where else . ' As might have been expected from such a course , Sydney was excepted from the general amnesty , and his application for an assurance of safety during a residence of a few months at Penshurst , for the arrangement of his private concerns , was refused . Sydney was more and more convinced by the fate of the republicans who had trusted to the king 's promises , and the profligacy and perfidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not with safety return to England . Hopeless and deserted , he was at a loss what course to take . After remaining some time at Hamburg , he wandered , apparently without an object , into Germany , and passed through the territories of Lunenburg , Brunswick , and Hesse , where the poverty and desolation of the country , and the fierce manners of the inhabitants seem to have had no very favorable effect upon his agitated mind . On reaching Frankfort on the Mayn , he found a milder and more fertile climate . Here he received intelligence from England , which was not calculated to remove the melancholy that had taken possession of him . He seems to have incurred the displeasure of his father , though we are not distinctly told on what account ; his pecuniary circumstances were embarrassed , in consequence of advances he had made to lord Strangford , his brother in law , a vicious and prodigal man , as well as by the expenses of his late employxnent. // In these distressing circumstances he had thoughts of offering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the Turks . This design he soon relinquished , and pursued his original intention of proceeding to Italy . Meanwhile , the persecutions against the republicans proceeding with great rigor , in open *olation of faith and honor , Sydney had reason to congratulate himself on the state of ecnparative security he enjoyed at Rome , where he arrived late in the autumn ( 1660 . ) Alexander Vii , who then filled the papal chair , was a pontiff of a mild and gentle character . His prime minister and favorite , cardinal Pallavicini , was no less remarkable for his learning , than for his political sagacity and personal merit . With him Sydney soon contracted an acquaintance , and through him became known to several other members of the Sacred College , particularly to cardinal Chigi , the pope 's nephew , Francesco and Antonio Barberini , Sachetti , and Spada , of whom , as well as of the prelates generally , he spoke in terms of respect . I do not find , ' says he , that they want any quality that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looseness of life , of which they have been formerly and ordinarily accused , that I have not seen any of that order do an indecent thing ; and yet I mark them as narrowly as 1 ' In such society Sydney found some alleviation of his misfortnnes . The only inconvenience he suffered was in consequence of injurious reports that were spread respecting his religious principles by some of his own countrymen . These however , ' he says , are but slight vapors ; and if nothing comes from England to my prejudice , I can easily blow them away . ' During the three years that Sydney passed in Italy , he was no inattentive observer of the political occurrences of that period , nor of the manners and customs of the people . The following is a curious specimen of the habits of the court of Rome : The skill of preserving health , he says in one of his letters , is in great perfection in this place , exercised most upon old men . Little physic is used , things that are cooling and desiccative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two principal heads , a slender diet , and much exercise . An old cardinal the other day told me that in other places exercise was good citra sudore ? n , but in Rome , by reason of the grossness of the air , it must be used usque ad sudorem . Besides the natural desire of living long and well , they are invited unto a more thin ordinary // care , by hopes of advancing their fortune , few attaining unto any great matter here until they come to be old . Cardinal Sacchetti is now in his seventy-fifth year , and doth ordinarily walk three or four miles without resting , by which means he enjoys a prosperous health , and preserves his wits fresh and clear as in his youth . ' During the summer , several of*he most distinguished persons in Rome invited him to accompany them to their villas in the neighborhood of the city . He availed himself of the kindness of prince Pamfili , nephew of the late pope Innocent X , who offered him apartments in his villa of Belvidere near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his situation at this charming retreat : Whilst every body at Rome is panting and gasping for life in the heat , which they say this year is much greater than ordinary , 1 enjoy so fresh an air as to have no reason at all to complaiii of the sun . Here are walks and fountains in the greatest perfection , and though my natural delight in solitude is very much increased this last year , I can not desire to be more alone than t am , and hope to continue . My conversation is with birds , trees , and books : In these last months that I have no business at all , I have applied myself to study a little more than 1 have done formerly ; an ( l thougl* one who begins at my age can not hope to make any considerable progress this way , I find so much satisfaction in it , that for the future I shall very unwillingly , though I had the opportunity . put myself in any way of living that shall deprive me of that entertainment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , I have now intention of seeking little more than quietness . ' In a subsequent letter , lie adds : Nature , art , and treasure can hardly make a place more pleasant than this . The description of it would look more like poetry than truth . A Spanish lady coming not long since to see this house , seated on a large plain out of the middle of a rock , and a river brought to the top of the mountain , with the walks and fountains , ingeniously desired those that were present , not to pronounce the name of our Saviour , lest it should dissolve this beautiful enchantment . We have passed the solstice , and I have not yet had occasion to complain of heat , which in Rome is very excessive and hath filled the town with sickness , especially that part of it where I lived . Here it is that I look for health , quiet , and solitude . I am with some eagernc*s fdllen to reading , and find so much satisfaction in it , that though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad until six or seven of the clock at // Life of . tllgernon Sydney . Jai. night ; yet I can not be so sure of ' my temper as to know certainly how long this manner of life *vil1 please me . I can not but rejoice a little to find , that when I wander as a vagabond tI*rough the world , forsaken of my friends , and known only to be a broken limb of a shipwrecked faction , I yet find humanity and civility from those who are in the height of *rtune and reputation . ' This grateful tribute to the hospitality of Rome has been uttered by a long succession of illustrious exiles from Sydney to our eloquent and lamented contemporary , Madame de Stael. in Rome the outcast and the friendless have ever found an asylum . She does not boast of toleration , but the sufferer for conscience ' sake has rarely been driven from her walls . She does not hold herself up as the refuge of the oppressed , and call upon them to fly to her for protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persecuted and unfortunate , almost as numerous , and far more honorable , than the deputies who crowded the courts of her most powerful emperors . The abdicated queen of the north , the fugitive princes of Britain , the fallen dynasties of France and of Spain , have successively found a shelter , and learned a lesson of resignation , among the ruins of her imperial grandeur : the insulted advocate of popular rights reposes in honor and in peace with the kindred ashes of her Scipios and her Catos : the reviled and deserted sufferer for the cause of truth may tread with safety on the spot that is sprinkled with the blood of apostles . Apud ignotos , apud barbaros , apud homines in extremis atque ultimis gentibus positos , nobile et illustre apud omnes nomen tua* civitatis profuisset. ' - Though Sydney found here the repose of which he stood so much in need , he could not forget that he was in a state of dependence , and strove in vain to banish from his mind the recollection of his former hopes , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same letter from which we have before quoted , lint I. do also well know I am in a strange land , how far those civilities do extend , and that they are too airy to feed or clothe a man . I can not so unite my thoughts unto one object as absolutely to forbid the memory of such things as these are , to enter into them : but I go as far as I can , and since I can not forget what is past , nor be insensible to what is present , I defend myself reasonably well from increasing or anticipating evils by foresight . The power of foreseeing is a happy quality unto those who prosper , and can ever propose to themselves something of // greater felicity than they enjoy , but a most desperate mischief unto them , who by forseeing , can discover nothing that is not worse than the evils they already feel . He that is naked , alone , and without help in the open sea , is less unhappy in the night when he may hope the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not , and that there is no possibilit* of safety . ' The unrelenting severity with which those individuals of the republican party , who had fallen into the king 's hands had been treated , and the unworthy means that were made use of to destroy such of them as still eluded pursuit , began to alarm Sydney for his personal safety . One or two of his party had already fallen by the hands of assassins , from which no asylum can afford a perfect security . He therefore returned to the north of Europe , that he might not be wanting to his public duty , whilst he was more conveniently situated for the management of his private affairs . He left Italy in 1663 , and in his way through Switzerland passed three weeks with Ludlow and his companions in exile at Vevai , assuring them of his friendship and affection , and in no respect declining to own the cause for which he suffered . From thence he proceeded through Germany to Flanders , and established himself in September at Brussels . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by Van Egmont , and is still preserved at Penshurst . In this perplexed state of his affairs , Sydney 's active mind was on the stretch for some honorable occupation . He accordingly seized with avidity a proposal to engage in the service of the emperor in Hungary , with a body of troops raised among his old associates , and wrote to his father to ascertain how far the government of England was disposed to countenance the design . If there be any thing of reality in the proposition , says he , I can ascribe it only to the desire that those in power may have to send away those who are suspected by them . They shall have their end : I will serve them in it if they please , and upon more easy terms than will be expected by others . I will undertake to transport a good strong body of the best officers and soldiers of our old army , both horse and foot . Though obtaining of this would be a very considerable advantage unto me and some of my friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know neither they nor I shall receive any thing upon that account . The first that I ever did ask , and the least that I ever can ask , I mean the assurance of being permitted to live quietly at Penshurst , not having been granted , I am like to make few requests for the future . But as I // think that the advantage which the king expects by ridding the land of those persons , is the motive upon which the offer was made , I believe it to be a very considerable one ; for they who find themselves suspected may possibly grow unquiet ; the destroying of them will be a work of time , and not without difficulty and danger ; and it can not be exp*ted that they will of their own accord leave their country , unless it be with some man of whom they have a good opinion , and all those are as little favored as I am . If it be granted , I hope to carry those who will gain honor unto the nation , wherever they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt your lordship will be unwilling to propose this , lest it should make the king or ministers believe that I am upon better terms with my old companions , than you would have them think me . I desire your lordship to waive that scruple ; 1 have credit enough with them for such a business as this is ; and , if I were not thought at court to have far more than I have , they would not trouble themselves with me as much as they do . Whatsoever it is , I desire to make use of it to carry me , and a good number of those in the same condition , so far from England that those who hate us may give over suspecting us . ' This application was without effect , and Sydney had soon after additional reason to complain of the malice of his enemies at Augsburg , where he narrowly escaped assassination . Such implacable persecution drove him to the highest pitch of resentment , and disposed him to take advantage of any occasion that might offer to relieve himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country from tyranny and oppression . On the breaking out of the war between England and the United Provinces in 1664 , the English exiles looked forward with the most sanguine expectations to a cooperation in their favorite project of restoring the commonwealth . These hopes were encouraged by Dc Witt ; and afterwards , when the United Provinces were joined by France , they made use of the exiles , by holding out the pretence of an invasion , to promote divisions among the English . Sydney and Ludlow were invited to Paris to conclude , under the auspices of the French government , a treaty for the restoration of the commonwealth , which had been already projected at the Hague . Sydney accordingly went to Frankfort , where he had a conference with the French resident at Mentz , who had repaired thither to meet them . Ludlow distrusting such allies , whose treachery towards his friends was still fresh in his recollection , declined any participation in the scheme . On being assured of personal // safety , Sydney proceeded alone to Paris , where he laid before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demanding at the same time one hundred thousand crowns for that purpose This the French government were not disposed to advance , until some disposition was shown on the part of his countrymen to concur in the *dertaking . They however offered twenty thousand crowns , with the promise of further assistance when it should be thought necessary . This he declined , and , taking leave of the court , retired under a promise of security to the south of France . This chimerical project ended as might have been foreseen . The treaty of Breda was signed , ( June 29 , 1667 , ) without any provision for the unfortunate and deluded exiles . Sydney remained a long time in retirement , and very little seems to be known of him during the interval between his unsuccessful negotiation with the French court , and his return to England . lie made known however the place of his retreat to his family , through sir William Temple , the English resident at Brussels , and son of his old friend and correspondent , sir John Temple . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colbert do Croissy , the French ambassador , that Sydney was at Paris , proposed that a pension should be allowed him by the king of France , and that the king of England consented to it . There is no evidence however of its ever having been paid . Indeed Sydney appears to have been still an object of great jealousy to Charles II , who frequently expressed his dread of his determined principles and courage . During his residence in France an anecdote is related of him , which is so characteristic , that we shall insert it , though we do not know that it is supported by very good authority : The king of Fra*nce having taken a fancy to a fine English horse on which he had seen him mounted in a chase , requested that he would part with it at his own price . On his declining the proposal , the king , determined to take no denial , gave orders to tender him money or to seize the horse . Sydney on bearing this instantly took a pi*toI and shot it , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , bad served a free man , and should not be mastered by a king of slaves ! " ' He is supposed , in the long season of leisure which this seclusion afforded , to have digested and composed his essays on government , for which he afterwards suffered most severely // and unjustly . In 1677 the health of lord Leicester rapidly declined , and he became very desirous to see his son Algernon once more before he died . Through the influence of his grandson , lord Sunderland , and the intercession of the French king , this request was granted , and Henry Savile , the British ambassador at Paris , succeeded in*rocuring an assurance of safety . Sydney accordingly came over to England in the autumn of 1677 . On the 2d of November lord Leicester died , at the age of eighty two ; and Sydney , after giving a discharge to his lordship 's executors for the legacies bequeathed him , amounting only to five thousand two hundred pounds , intended to have returned immediately to his retirement . This he was unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brotber had commenced against him , for some portion of his father 's property . The conduct of Sydney during the remainder of his life is involved in great mystery . He still continued the same bold and decided opposition to the arbitrary measures of the court , and was regarded by them with great suspicion . When the nation , soon after the marriage of the princess Mary with the prince of Orange , was very eager for a war with France , Sydney discouraged it with great vehemence , by which he subjected himself to the imputation of being pensioned by a foreign power . He however declared his disbelief of the king 's sincerity , who was known to have discovered a most disgraceful subserviency to the French court . The parliament , which had originally shewn the most servile devotion to the wishes of the king , beginning to assume a tone of independence and decision , it was dissolved on the 24th of Jan. 1678-9 , after an existence of eighteen years . A new parliament was soon after called , and Sydney , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borough of Guilford in Surry . He was warmly supported by the popular interest , but was defeated by the influence of the court party . Among his most zealous adherents was the celebrated William Penn , whose treatment on this occasion is thus related in Collins ' Memoirs : ' One Mr Penn , a quaker , appearing for the colonel , was called into the court , and hindered from encouraging such as were for the colonel ; and told by the recorder that he was a jesuit , ( in affront to the colonel , ) to whom the recorder would have tendered oaths , ( at that time contrary to law , ) and at last the mayor turned him out of the court , and forbid him to appear amongst the colonel 's party , to the great discouragement // of them ; and more particularly such as were of the same persuasion with Mr Penn ; amongst which party the colonel had several voices . ' Sydney , at the instigation of Penn , presented a petition to parliament against the validity of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less inclined than the last to favor the views of*e king . The duke of York , who was under banishment , was forbidden to return to England , and a bill was passed excluding him from the throne , as a papist . These measures so alarmed the king that he prorogued the parliament on the 27th of May , without the consent or knowledge of his council , and , at the instigation of the duke of York , dissolved it in the following July . When the election for the new parliament took place , Sydney again offered him self as a candidate for the borough of Bramber in Sussex , where Penn exerted himself in his behalf with no less ardor than before . He bad also the support of sir John Temple* younger brother to sir William Temple , and flattered himself with hopes of success . He was disappointed however by the exertions of his own family , who either dreading the impetuosity of his temper , or what is more probable , his firmness and decision , made interest for his younger brother Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean time continued to be watched by the court with the utmost vigilance . He was accused to the l*ing of being concerned in a plot of the nonconformists , which however , in an audience with his majesty he succeeded in explaining . He was near being involved in the meal tub plot , which , added to other persecutions , fixed him in the resolution to return to France , and the termination of his lawsuit removing the only obstacle , he went so far as to purchase in a friend 's name a small estate in that country . Mr Meadley here takes notice of a charge which has been brought against Sydney of a mercenary intercourse with the French government . It is certain that when a project was in agitation of a league with the United Provinces against France , soon after the marriage of the prince of Orange with the princess Mary , Barillon , the French minister in England , entered into intrigues with the popular party for the purpose of preventing that measure . The correspondence between that minister and Louis XIV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact beyond a doubt . Barillon in his letters mentions the individuals with whom he has intercourse , and the sums of money he has paid to each . Among these are the // Jaii. duke of Buckingham , lord Hollis , Mr Beber , Mr Harwood , AIr Montagu , lord Russell , and Mr Sydney . The two latter are mentioned as acting from the highest principles of honor , and the views of them all as having been to throw difficulties in the way of Charles ' projects by the ajd of France . Mr Meadle y , aware of the imputation to which4he character of Sydney is exposed , if the fact of the receipt of two sums of money with which Barillon has charged him he admitted , endeavors to make it appear that this minister deceived his master , and pretended to have advanced to the English republicans the sums that he actually put in his own pocket . In order to support this supposition , he adduces some expressions of Madame dc Sevign* , from which it appears that Barillon amassed a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the extreme improbability of his resorting to a deception which could hardly fail to he discovered by his government , is not sufficient to sustain such a presumption . It must be conceded that the friends of liberty , alarmed and terrified to the last degree by the violent and despotic measures of the king , were driven to the necessity of opposing him with his own weapons . The servile and disgraceful manner in which the king and his ministers had sold themselves to France is well known ; is it then surprising that these patriotic individuals should avail themselves of an opportunity to draw the means of serving the true interest of their countr ) r , from the same source to which their unprincipled monarch had resorted for the purpose of enslaving it ? That most of them had any other motive in these negotiations is extremely unlikely . With regard to Sydney it is hardly credible , when his character and the circumstances of his connexion with Barillon are taken into consideration . He speaks of that minister in his letters with the greatest contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself does not mention Sydney , as one with whom he is in habits of intimacy , much less as one whom he considers as his creature . Mr Algernon Sydney , ' he says in one of his letters , is a man of the most enlarged views , and elevated designs , all of which are directed towards the establishment of a republic . ' In another letter he observes , that many of the opposition , particularly Mr Sydney , had endeavored to convince him that it was a great error to suppose that the interests of France were necessarily opposed to the existence of a republican form of government in Eng .. // land , and adds some of the reasons which were urged by them with that view , it seems therefore certain that if Sydney did receive assistance from France , it was with the intention of aiding the attainment of this darling object of his life . This presumption is confirmed by the difficulty of reconciling any other conclusion with Sydney 's 6*icunistances and previous conduct . Though not rich , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he driven to the necessity of resorting to such means of support . If he had been desirous of bettering his fortune , he had let slip many opportunities of doing it , much less exceptionable than this . Is it credible that a man , who at an early age had quitted the service of his king , in whose army he held a respectable rank , and entered into that of the opposite party , who again deserted Cromwell , and gavel up his hopes of preferment , because he would not bend to his views , who rejected the tempting offers of Monk , and submitted to exile and want , rather than abjure his principles , should in his old age , when he had little to enjoy and less to hope for , degrade himself into the hireling of a foreign court ? This may he true , but it requires stronger proof than has yet been produced to convince us of it . To return , the king on the dissolution of the parliament convened at Oxford in March 1681 issued a Declaration , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . To this an answer appeared , entitled , A just and modest vindication of the proceedings of the two last parliaments . ' The first sketch of this answer was from Sydney 's pen , although it was afterwards redrawn by Somers , and finally corrected by sir William Jones . Meanwhile the rapid strides with which the court was proceeding in the course of despotism , in open violation of justice and decency , filled the popular party with alarm , and induced them to cast their eyes on the duke of Monmouth , by favoring whose pretensions to the throne they hoped to avert the threatened danger . The leaders of that party accordingly entered into an intimate connexion with that nobleman . Sydney for some time declined all participation in their measures , principally from his aversion to lord Shafisbury , who took a leading part in their counsels , and fcw whose character and conduct he entertained the greatest contempt . In Novearber , 1682 , lord Shaftsbury died , and Sydney was soon after prevailed upon by his friend , the earl of Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobleman , the duke of Monmouth , // lord Russell , and the younger Hampden , on the situation of public affairs . The lord Howard of Escricke , an unprincipled but insinuating man , was by Sydney 's persuasion admitted to their confidence . He had not long before been committed to the tower for a treasonable libel . Sydney on that occasion had interested himself wa*nly in his behalf , which led to an intimacy between them , that proved fatal not only to Sydney but his unfortunate associates . What was the nature of the measures agreed upon at these meetings we have no means of knowing , but by the declaration of lord Howard on the trials of Russell and Sydney , which is liable to great objections . That they were desirous to devise measures to guard against the arbitrary proceedings of the court , and to protect themselves land their country from impending ruin is very probable . The following is the account given by sir John Dalrymple of the characters and views of the associates . Russell , Hampden , and Essex , intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix the barriers of the constitution with precision . Sydney aimed at the destruction of monarchy , and on its ruins to found that republic which in imagination he adored . Monmouth hoped amid public distractions to pave the way for himself to the throne . Howard , with luxuriant eloquence and wit , adopted the views of each particular person and incited all to vigor and action , feeling for moments what they felt through life . ' The proceedings of such distinguished persons were not unobserved by the court , who waited only for a pretence to fall upon them with the whole weight of its vengeance . Such an occasion was not long wanting . The Rye house plot , which was an extravagant project of certain deluded madmen to assassinate the king and the duke of York on their return from Newmarket , was the pretext laid hold of to get possession of the victims . Rumsey , one of those who were implicated in the assassination plot surrendered himself as a witness , and Sydney had many intimations from his friends of a design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had retired , Sydney protesting his innocence , took no precautions for his safety . On the 26th of June , whilst at dinner , lie was arrested by an order from the privy council in the king 's name , and in the course of a few minutes a second messenger arrived with an order to secure his papers . Finding nothing concealed , the messenger took possession of some manuscripts which lay upon the table , // and packing them in a trunk which stood beside it , desired . Sydney to affix his seal . This he declined doing , as he was ignorant what had been put in . The messenger then affixed his own seal , promising that the packages should not be opened except in Sydney 's presence . He could never afterwards how-. ever obtain possession of them . When brought before the privy council , he prudently declined answering most of the questions that were put to him , well knowing what advantage would be taken of any unguarded admissions . Although nothing appeared against him to justify his detention , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely rigorous . His money and bills in the hands of his banker , and all his other property , even to his wearing apparel , were seized . His friends , and even his servants , were denied access to him for the purpose of carrying him a change of linen . It was not till after repeated applications to the king and council , that Ducasse , a Frenchman in his confidence , was permitted to attend him . Lord Russell was already in custody . Howard , who was still at large , was continually pro . testing his disbelief of a plot and his ignorance of the alleged conspiracy . He applied to Sydney 's servants to be intrusted with their master 's plate , declaring his conviction of his innocence , and expressing his own great obligations to him in his imprisonment . He evinced nevertheless the greatest consternation , and was advised by his friends to keep out of the way . On the eighth of July , however , he was taken in his own house while endeavoring to conceal himself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower , lord Grey of Wark , who was one of the association , having effected his escape , and the duke of Monmouth still evading his pursuers . On the 20th of July three persons , convicted of a treasonable design to assassinate the king , suffered death , protesting , however , their entire ignorance of the crime for which they died . Lord Essex was found in his apartment in the tower with his throat cut . As he was supposed to have died by hi* own hands , this circumstance was made use of to produce an tiinfavorable influence on the minds of the jury against lord Russell , whose trial was hurried on that it might lose none of its effect . The principal evidence against him was lord Howard , who owed his own life to the sacrifice of his associates . Lord Russell was convicted of treason , and executed on th' // twenty-first of July , discovering the greatest firmness during his trial , and the most dignified composure in the hour of death . In the mean time the court was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lord Howard was ready to swear to th*same facts against Sydney , which he had stated on the trial of lord Russell , hut as the statute 25 Edward III , on which alone Sydney could he indicted , required two witnesses to an overt act of treason , it became necessary to procure a second . For this purpose the prisons were ransacked in vain , nor was the court more successful in an attempt to derive matter of accusation from himself . When a committee of the privy council were sent to examine him in the tower , he treated them roughly , observing , that they seemed to want evidence , and were come to draw it from his own mouth , but they should have nothing from him . ' But the crown lawyers having gotten their prey within their fangs , were not to be disappointed . They accord-* ingly resorted to other means to make up for this defect of testimony , and to counteract the talents and intrepidity of Sydney . The chief justice of the king 's bench being lately dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had distinguished himself by his violence at lord Russell 's trial , was promoted to the vacant seat , ( Sept. 29 , 1683 , ) and joined with three colleagues of similar principles and views . As a warning to all other judges , sir Francis Pemherton , who had conducted himself with some regard to decency at lord Russell 's trial , was removed from his seat at the privy council , and his office as chief justice of the common pleas . It is known that Jefferies even consulted with the crown lawyers on the means of compassing the prisoner 's death . At the same time two individuals entirely devoted to the service of the crown were appointed sheriffs of London and Middlesex , by a commission under the great seal , who selected for under sheriffs two others of the same character . These preliminary steps being taken , Sydney was informed by the lieutenant of the tower on the 6th of November , that he had received orders to bring him before the court of king 's bench , by a writ of habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster early in the morning , before the grand jury were assembled , or any bill of indictment had been exhibited against him , and // detained about an hour at a tavern , till the bill was found . On its being presented , he was hurried to the bar through a guard of soldiers and immediately arraigned . The indictment was long , confused , and perplexed , setting forth no overt act of treason precisely , nor any person with whom he had conspired . To this bill he excepted as vicious and erroneous , and desired to see the record , which was peremptorily denied by the chief justice , who insisted that he must either plead to the indictment or demur , which amounted to a confession of the fact . He then offered a special plea , quoting the three acts of treason , and desiring that the separate charges might be distinguished ; which was also refused , unless waving the fact he would rest the case solely on that plea . Sydney then attempted to make some remarks in his own vindication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , that unless he pleaded in the usual form , sentence should be instantly pronounced . He was thus obliged to abandon every advantage which the law allowed him , and by pleading not guilty to come to a general issue on the merits of his cause . A fortnight was allowed him to prepare for his trial ; but a copy of the indictment , and the assistance of counsel , unless he should assign any particular point of law which the court might think proper to debate , were refused . The indictment was then read to him in Latin , but all information respecting the statute on which the attorney-general intended to proceed against him was refused . When the day of trial approached , Sydney petitioned the king for a copy of the record of lord Russell 's attainder , and of the indictment against himself , as necessary to his just defence ; but his petition appears to have been disregarded . When Sydney was furnished with a pannel from which the jury was to be drawn , lie found that it consisted chiefly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeholds , and chosen expressly by the solicitors of the crown . When Sydney appeared before the court , on the 21st of November , a copy of the indictment was again peremptorily refused to him , although he produced a transcript of the statute by which it is expressly allowed in all cases , and to all men . The jury being called , he excepted against several persons as being in the king 's service , wanting freeholds , or having exposed themselves to infamy by some specific misconduct . But every special objection being overruled , he was forced to challenge peremp* // Jaix torily those whom he knew to have been chosen for his des. - truction , and thereby when his challenges were exhausted to admit of others of the same cast . After a speech from sir Robert Sawyer , the attorney-general , detailing the heads of the accusation , West , who havip.g confessed many treasons was still unpardoned , Rumsey and Keiling were examined as to the design of a general insurrection , and although totally unconnected with the prisoner , were allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king 's counsel had not the effrontery to pretend that this was competent evidence , but it was artfully introduced to influence the minds of the jury , and to prepare them for the testimony of lord Howard . His evidence did not materially vary from what he had deposed at the trial of lord Russell . He gave a detail of two conversations which had passed between that nobleman , the duke of Monmouth , lord Essex , Young Hampden , the prisoner and himself , on the most effectual means of defending the public interest from invasion , without involving them. * selves in the obloquy of entertaining any selfish designs . Nothing , however , of moment appeared to be agreed upon at these meetings , excepting the necessity of settling an understanding with the earl of Argyle , and also of communicating with sir John Cocbrane and some other leading whigs in Scotland , when Sydney recommended Aaron Smith as a person whom they might safely trust , and afterwards pro-. vided him with money for his journey . Of this last circumstance , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers being obliged to rest their case on the unsupported assertions of lord Howard , who had testified nothing of a treasonable nature , ventured to supply the defect of a second witness , by producing some papers found in Sydney 's study , and supposed to be in his handwriting , in which the paramount authority of the people , and the lawfulness of resisting an oppressive government , were ably and eloquently maintained . A few passages best suited to their purpose being read at the request of the attorney-general , Sydney complained of this partial proceeding ; when the chief justice , intending to entrap him , slily asked to what heads he would refer . Perceiving the drift , however , he calmly answered , let him give an account of it that did it . ' He afterwards requested , that as parts of the writing had been quoted the whole might be read , but this was refused . The earl of Anglesey , lord // Clare , lord Paget , bishop Burnet , and two gentlemen of the Howard family , were called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord Howard , who all deposed either to his solemn asseverations of the prisoner* s innocence , or to his repeated disavowal of all knowledge or belief of the supposed plot . Blake , a draper , testif*d to his lordship 's saying , that he must not have his pardon till the drudgery of swearing was over . ' Ducasse and two female servants gave evidence to his denying all communication with their master on this subject , and applying to them for the custody of his plate and goods . Lord Howard admitted a debt to Sydney with which he had been charged ; and some other witnesses did not appear . Sydney , though unassisted by counsel , defended himself with great calmness and ability , in which he was aided by notes handed him by several gentlemen of the bar , who , though not allowed to speak in his behalf , had the spirit and courage to stand by him . He commented with great ingenuity on the evidence , exposed the incredibility and inadequacy of lord Howard 's testimony , and the absurdity and illegality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aught appeared twenty years before , as evidence of a conspiracy against the life of the king . The court , aware of his hasty temper , endeavored by frequent interruptions , to provoke and embarrass him . Sydney , however , bore it all with an admirable coolness , never suffering himself to be driven from his point . Finch , the solicitor-general , closed the prosecution . when Sydney attempted to add a few words , but was interrupted by Jefferies , who , in his charge to the jury , sanctioned all the principles of law advanced by the king 's counsel , and artfully endeavored to blend the consultations in which Sydney had been implicated , with the other supposed conspiracies for an insurrection , and attempt upon the life of the king . The charge of Withens , one of the judges , is so extraordinary , that we shall give it at large from the state trials . Gentlemen , it is fit you should have our opinion ; in all points of law we agree with the lord chief justice . Says colonel* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of it . Who must we thank for that ? None but the Almighty Providence . One of themselves was troubled in conscience and comes and discovers it . If Keiling had not discovered it , God knows whether we might have been alive at this day . ' Jefferies fol // lowed the jury out of court , tinder pretence of taking some refreshment , and when they were consulting about their verdict , gave them more particular instructions . In about half an hour they returned with a verdict of guilty . Sydney desired , before the verdict was recoided , to examine them by turns , whether every one of them tad found him guilty , and more especially , whether they had found him guilty of compassing the king 's death , of levying war against the king , or of any treason within the statute 25 Edward III , or of any proved against him by two witnesses , but the chief justice would not allow him to proceed . Three days after the trial , ( 24 Nov. ) the duke of Mon .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a full pardon for his share in the supposed plot . This circumstance revived the hopes of Sydney 's friends , and he was persuaded to deliver through Lord Halifax a petition to the king , staling the irregularity of the proceedings against him , and praying an audience with his majesty . This , through the influence of the duke of York , was denied , and Jefferies declared in his furious way , that either Sydney or himself must die . ' On the 26th , when he was brought up for sentence and asked what he had to say in bar of judgment , Sydney again urged the extreme injustice with which he had been treated . While insisting on the rejection of his special plea , judge Withens who seemed to be drunk , gave him the lie ; on which he calmly observed , that having livefl above three score years , he had never received or deserved such language , having never asserted any thing that was false . ' Finding all that he stated in arrest of judgment thus violently overborne by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and the world , I am not heard . ' The chief justice , after declaiming on the prisoner 's guilt , his obligations to the king , and the treasonable nature of his writings , proceeded to pronounce sentence of death in the usual form . Then , 0 God , O God , ' said Sydney , with an unaltared mien , I beseech thee sanctify these sufferings unto me , and impute not my blood to the country nor the city through which I am to be drawn . Let no inquisition be made for it , but if any , and the shedding of blood that is innocent must be avenged , let the weight of it fall upon those that maliciously persecute me for righteousness ' sake . ' Lord chief justice- ' I pray God work in you a temper fit for the other world , for I see you are not fit for this . ' // Colonel Sydney , ( stretching forth his hand , ) my lord , feel my pulse , and see if I am disordered . I bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . ' The friends of Sydney still made great efforts to save him , and persuaded him , although he entertained no hopes of success , to present a second petition to the king , that his punishm*nt might be changed into perpetual banishment . This had no greater success than the first , and Sydney , resigning himself to his lot , employed the interval allowed him after sentence , in exercises of religion , and in drawing up an appeal to posterity on the injustice of his fate . When he saw the warrant for his execution , he expressed no concern , and amazed all around , by his calm demeanor . On the morning of the 7th of December the sheriffs again proceeded to the tower , and about ten o'clock receiving Sydne y from the hands of the lieutenant , conducted him on foot to the place of execution on Tower Hill . He was attended only by two of his brother 's servants . He ascended the scaf* fold with a firm , undaunted mein , worthy , says bishop Burnet , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave a paper , containing.a manly vindication of his innocence , to the sheriffs , observing , that he had made his peace with God , and had nothing more to say to men ; ' but he declined either reading it or having it read to the multitude , and offered to tear it if it was not received . He then pulled off his coat , hat , and doublet , saying , that he was ready to die , and would give them no farther trouble . ' He gave three guineas to the executioner , and perceiving the fellow grumble as if the sum were inadequate , desired a servant to give him a guinea or two more . He then kneeled down , and after a solemn pause of a few minutes , calmly laid his head upon the block . Being asked by the executioner if he should rise again , he replied , not till the general resurrection-strike on . ' The executioner obeyed , and severed his head from his body at a blow . His remains , being placed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following day interred with his ancestors at Penshurst . Powerful as the interest of the court was at this time , it could not stifle the voice of the nation , which cried out against the violence and infamy of these proceedings . The time was not far distant when the memory of Sydney was to receive from his countrymen the only reparation in their power to make for his cruel fate . By a bill brought into parliament April 24 , 1689 , which passed both // houses , his Conviction and attainder are declared wrongful and unjust , and all records and proceedings regarding them are ordered to be cancelled , that they might not be visible to future times . The memory of such iniquity was not to be so easily effaced , and the characters of Russell and Sydney , and their prosecutors , have been hande* down together to posterity , who have awarded the retribution they respectively merit . It was the fate of Sydney , as it has been of many great men , to be superior to the age in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigotry of one party in the state , and the profligacy and corruption of the other . He was enlightened in an age of prejudice , disinterested in an age of venality . He is one of the few men , who have followed steadily in practice the principles they supported in their writings . His discourses on government , which appeared soon after his death , were generally read and admired , but as mankind has advanced in the science of government and civil liberty , this treatise has been gradually neglected . What was considered by Sydney 's contemporaries as a fanciful theory , has long been matter of experience . From this circumstance , some persons in later times have been led to treat his political writings with a degree of contempt they by no means deserve , not reflecting that he had to contend against doctrines , which , at the present day , can hardly be mentioned with gravity . Sydney has the merit of having been one of the first to discover and defend the maxim , that the true and only basis of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles have since been recognised in England , and are adopted and acted upon in their fullest extent , in our own admirable constitutions . Mr Meadley deserves the highest praise for his manly and able vindication of the character and opinions of Sydney , at a time when such sentiments are by no means the surest passport to favor in his own country . Such examples can not be too often held up or too strongly recommended . To us , as republicans , they are invaluable . The integrity , the virtue , the constancy of Sydney should animate us to hope and to struggle , even in the darkest times ; while the arbitrary and detestable measures resorted to for his destruction , teach a lesson which should never be forgotten by the citizens of a free state ; that the only support of an equal government is the virtue of the governed , for when that fails , the very institutions that are established for the protection of life and property , may be converted into the most dreadful engines of oppression and injustice .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
