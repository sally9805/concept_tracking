Main text Scene Scene  --  a Chamber . Time  --  Midnight . Chlorine Chlorine  --  Solus . With what a silent tread the feet of Time , Steal on their restless journey  --  yet , how slow ! I 've watch 'd the parting cloud , that lay dissolved By yonder silver crescent , as it rose Like a pale ghost , by day unused to walk , And gliding through the night o'er scenes long loved . How sweet her ray is edging yonder cloud , Like the rich sables of a mourning Prince : Darkness is lost , and her intenser light , So circumscribed in its first ascent , Now penetrates , the whole wide firmament ; Reflected thence to earth . I can not sleep , And why I love to gaze on thee , I know not , But ' t is not love ; and when I look on thee , My heart , grows sadder , lonelier than before ! Perchance , I gaze with thee , since like my own , Thy fortunes seem assimilar :  --  to watch When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of agony ! and have no claim To kindred fondness ; when the meanest boor , That earns his coarse brown bread , by coarser toil , Can solace him with thoughts of fellowship ; Of genial fellowship , that would requite Kindness with kindness , love with deeper love . No claim did I say , no claim ! forgive me heaven , That in its kindness , gave so dear a claim , My infant Claudio ; let me look upon him :  --  But no , I will not ; when I gaze , I weep , And then my mad heart mingles with its tears , Such thoughts of him , my husband , Claudio 's father , That stays me now ! Ha ! what noise is that ? My heart , Oh ! flutterer still , ' t is he , thy lord , Would I could sleep , and never see him thus ! ( Enter Ghiraldi , intoxicated . ) Ghiraldi . Ghiraldi I have been drinking , Chlorine . Chlorine . Chlorine My Lord ! Ghi . Ghiraldi Why that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must need be broken , and thou'st none , Of the rich blessings that I have enjoyed , To compensate thee for thy want of slumber . Chl . Chlorine I have not , true , Ghiraldi , but I have A greater bliss , a rich , more dear enjoyment , To pull aside this little screen , and hear The parting lips of Claudio , like the bud , Bursting its leafy mansion , as the south-wind Glides over it , whispering Ghiraldi 's name :  --  Then I can press them closer with my own , And still the discontent that he would feel , To know , Ghiraldi came not to his call . Ghi . Ghiraldi A pretty office truly  --  fit for women  --  I have been mingling , with the high , and great , In such communion as makes equals all , Exalting men to Gods , which nought can raise So , equalizing Heaven and Earth . Chl . Chlorine What mean you , now Ghiraldi  --  Oh ! forbear  --  ' T is blasphemy ! Ghi . Ghiraldi I tell thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rich , as the fabled nectar , and will steep , The brain , like Lethe , in such fond oblivion , That I forgot even thee , Chlorine , even thee , Whose looks , far more than words , afford me such Good cause for ' membrance Chl . Chlorine Ghiraldi . Ghi . Ghiraldi  --  Ay , Ay  --  There was my Lord of  --  what 's his name , He of the quick conceit , and gaudy fancy  --  I marvel , he did make me laugh so much As made the tears come , not that I could weep , I had no cause then . Chl . Chlorine And have you now , Ghiraldi . Ghi . Ghiraldi Yes , but I do not weep you see , Oh ! no ! That Lethe , ' t is most potent ! if ' t is true , That Gods claim credit for the rich invention , I will become a convert to the creed , That is most popular , it is but gratitude ! Chl . Chlorine Ghiraldi , will you look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , before he slept , Look here Ghiraldi , stay you must not kiss him , Not now . Ghi . Ghiraldi Fear not I did not purpose it ; Get thee to rest , Chlorine , why talk of children , When I converse of Gods , and nectar , and  --  Get thee to rest . ( Throws himself in a chair . ) Why , what a senseless dog , was he of yore , Who gave and sacrificed the world for woman , When wine was to be bought ! I 've bought my evil , Which grows more evil , as it grows less current , The features of the coin , being much effaced ! She says , by tears , I would not deem it true , For I would never wrong her ; but , no more . That wine , what an absorbent ! what a loss Of feeling  --  and not feeling , is the feeling Which most accords with happiness . How now Chlorine ? Chl . Chlorine Ghiraldi , will it please you to retire , You speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghi . Ghiraldi Now curse the brat , since I must study how To nurse his fancies , not endure my own ! Why woman , you would make a servitor , To bribe me with a force into compliance ; Talk of my will , yet force me to your own , Contest each point , and make a howling cause Of every nothing , not within the scope Of your inquiring reason ; thou wert not wont To school me thus ' till now , and by my faith , ' T is a most premature season ; get thee hence , And if the imp should cry  --  ( Child cries . ) Chl . Chlorine  --  Now , now , Ghiraldi ! The Gods do well inspire thee , so superior , Thou seemest now to all of earthly suffering ! Why even the brutes that thou hast drunken with , And the curst liquor , with which thou art drunk , Had fail 'd in thus inspiring thee . Go , emulate The higher Beings , thou would'st now consort with , And they will laud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ghiraldi , my lord , When we were wedded , I was the heart 's pride , Of an old doating father . Sixteen years Brought evenness and pleasure , which is Time 's will Seldom to bring to one , and I was bless 'd With all that kindness , in its purest form , Could fancy or anticipate . There came ( For I was early thought to own some beauty , Tho ' less my father thought of that than me , And what he lov 'd me for ! sought to be Uncaring for aught else , ) a lover fond , And owing all of grace of person , heart , And rich endowed mind , well stored , Original by nature , and by man . Progressive subsequent . He wooed , he won , And would have wedded ; but another came , And when the former had on business gone , To visit foreign countries , so he filled My father 's ears with poisonous discourse Of him , I was betrothed to , with such art , And link of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . I became The reward , of perfidy , whose best reward , Had been his labour ; speak I not the truth ? Ghi . Ghiraldi You do , Chlorine , a mournful truth indeed ! Chl . Chlorine Was it for torture , that you claim 'd my form ? Our hearts ne'er mingled then , they were two links , Which this succeeding one ( pointing to the child ) hath now united . I loved him , loving him , could I do else Than give his father , love 's remaining store ? Ghi . Ghiraldi You now regret our union . Chl . Chlorine I do , I do , most deeply I regret it ? My father gave the fatal affirmation , It was my father , said the cold response , My heart ne'er utter 'd it , and all the care , That now I have for being , is this boy ; Love 's pledge for love that never did exist , Creating love himself ; our fates are join 'd , And when you spurn 'd , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus you call 'd my son , your son , Ghiraldi , I spoke , but for myself spoke nothing ! Days , nights and hours have glided on in tears , Reproaches , scorn , then hatred , was my lot , I bore it uncomplaining ; but that boy , His spirit , ' t is his father 's , fill 'd my own , And bade me curse thee for his infant tongue , He bade me curse thee for his infant life , Thou , giver of that , that hatest thine own gift , For which he too may hate thee . In his name I curse thee , Heaven ! forgive me , I do not curse my husband , but his father ! Now go , Ghiraldi , spend your nights in revels , Your days in sleep , your time in fell reproach Of her whose sole misfortune is to be Your wife , but cast no scorn upon this boy , Thy son and mine ; for Heaven , or whatsoever lent , That spirit which did make mine own lips utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , thy wife , will all perforce be doom 'd T'instruct thine own child to detest the blood , That curdles in its veins , thy blood and mine .
