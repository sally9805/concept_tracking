THE volume , whose title we have prefixed to this article , contains a complete code of our army legislation , from the commencement of the government , down to the present time . As this code exhibits the best history of our military policy , which can be attained , we have thought that a rapel review of the various acts it embracee would be neither uninteresting nor uninstructive . The mere fact , that our military establishments have been the result of popular legislation , has a novelty in it , which should command attention . In the older countries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal authority , and is often augmented or dimioished without reference to the wishes , ability , or wants of the gaople . Our venerable fathers , in framing the constitution of the United States , reversed the principles upon which military- establishinents had boon founded for ages . They acted upon the // conviction , that the power of declaring war , and of creating the means of defence and offence , those high attributes of sovereignty , upon the due exercise of which depend the welfare and often the existence of nations , should reside with those , who have the ( deepest interest at stake , and who are the least likely to abuse it . Accordingly they placed it in the hands of the representatives of the people , that so the military force of the country , instead of being the creature of an arbitrary and irresponsible will , should he the offspring of the same popular and deliberate legislation , which o4ginates every other measure connected with the general good . Jealousy of military power has ever been a practical feeling in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the exciting causes of the Revolution ; and it required all the difficulties , and even occasional desperation of the struggle , to restrain it from emharrassing all the measures of the war . The continental Congress , it is true , standing on high and central ground , and comprehending the full responsibility of the cause it was directing , often gave signal proofs of an elevation above all narrow prejudices , when the fate of that cause was in jeopardy ; and once or twice confided to General Washington an almost dictatorial power . The war of the Revolution ended in 1783 . In April , 1785 , the military establishment of the United States was fixed at one regiment of infantry , and two companies of artillery , or about 800 men . Thus the nation , two years after a protracted and exasperated struggle with one of the most powerful kingdoms of Europe , while most important relations were still unsettled , and with a host of unquiet and formidable nei0hbors upon its interior frontiers , whose excited spirits could not subside into peace , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treaty , stood nearly divested of every means of organized defence . While we recognise a strong cause of this abandonment of self protection , in the exhausted condition of the country , we may likewise discern in it that cautious policy , pushed somewhat to an extreme , which rebarded soldiers as useless and even dangerous , when not required for immediate service . About two years after this period , the military establishment was augmented by 700 men , and remained thus until 1790 , when , under the new constitution , it was fixed at one regiment of infantry , and one battalion of artillery , embracing 1216 men . The President was at the same time authorized to call into service // such militia , for the defence of the frontiers , as he might deem necessary . In 1791 the establishment was again increased by the addition of another regiment of infantry , and the President was empowered to raise 2000 levies , as they were termed , in lieu of the militia he had before been authorized to call out . In 1792 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments , one of which was so organized , as to embrace a squadron of four troops of light dragoons . In 1794 eight hundied men were added to the artillery , which was thenceforward to be styled the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers . These several additions to the establishment fixed in 1790 , formed a force of about 6000 . They who are familiar with the history of those times , will recollect , that it was a period of constant and increasing hostility with the Indians , who , as we have before remarked , did not bury the tomahawk , at the general pacification which terminated the Revolution . Our frontiers were drenched w ith the blood of our unprotected settlers . General Washington , then President , at each session of Congress , reiterated his strong and eloquent representations of these barbarities , and urged the necessity of investing the Executive with power to protect the defenceless and chastise the aggressors . But a distrustful and improvident policy , which seemed to perceive no danger so great , as that which might arise from placin* an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of defence with such a sparing hand , that it was not until one or two abortive campaigns , and two or three defeats , marked with unprecedented carnage , showed the irresistible necessity of more liberal and vigorous measures , that the President was enabled to bring the war to a successifil close . But it was not from the Indians alone that we at that time had danger to apprehend . Our seaboard was not secure from insult ; and the angry reelimination , which then marked our negotiations with Great Britain , whose navies governed tim ocean , admonished us that we were too vulnerable on that frontier . The President was accordingly directed by the act of March , 1794 , to fortify the principal ports on the coast . Twenty different points were indicated by the act , among which , it appears , 350 pieces of ordnance were to be distributed . The President was about the same time directed to establish three or four arsenals , with maga* zmnes and armories connected with them. * // In May , 1796 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillerists and engineers , two companies of light dragoons , and four regiments of infantry , or about 3000 men . This establishment continued the same throughout the remainder of General Washington 's administration . Mr Adams came to the presidency amid the groxving troubles with France , and his administration was marked from its commencement to the termination of these troubles , with frequent and extensive augmentations of the military force . The alarm of the nation was doubtless great ; and the confidence of Congress in the Executive appears to have been in proportion . It was a striking conversion from the chary and mistrustful policy of 1792 and 1793 , when an enemy , covering our very thresholds with slaughter , could induce only tardy and scanty measures of defence , to the confiding liberality of this period , when , in order to resist an enemy , not yet openly declared , and separated from us by the Atlantic , the nerve and strength of the nation were placed at the disposal of the Executive . In April , 1798 , an additional regiment of artillerists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President was invested with power to raise , during the recess of Congress , 10,000 men for the term of three years , and to accept of any company or companies of volunteers , which might be offered for service . The latter clause would appear to have conferred a power commensurate with the force of the entire militia , provided the spirit of volunteering had prevailed to that extent . About one year after this , the President was conditionally authorized , in the language of the act , to organize and cause to be eleven national arsenals . The armories are at Springfield , Massachusetts , and at Harper 's Ferry , Virginia . The arsenals ard at Watertown , Massachusetts ; Watervliet and Rome , New York ; Baltimore , Maryland ; Washington , District of Columbia ; Richmond , Virginia ; Augusta , Georgia ; Frankford and Pittsburg , Pennsylvania ; Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; and Detroit , Michigan Territory . Arms and accoutrements are manufactured at the two armories , 79,259 of the former having been made in the course of the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at many of the arsenals , while some of them are used merely as depots . There are no public founderies for ordnance , the supply being obtained by contracts from private founderies , of which there are a sufficient number in the United States to answer all demands . Lead is obtained in ample quantities from the public mines . // raised , ' * an additional military force , to consist of twentyfour regiments of infantry , one regiment and one battalion of riflemen , a battalion of artillerists and engineers , and three regiments of cavalry . The same act limited the number of volunteers which could be accepted by the President under the indefinite act of 1798 , to 75,000 . The amount of force , including regulars and militia , which the several foregoin* acts empowered President Adams to raise , under certain exigencies , supposed no doubt to exist , considerably exceeded 100,000 men . The difficulties with France were adjusted in 1800 , when this formidable army was reduced to four regiments of infantry , two regiments of artillerists and engineers , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the pacific auspices with which Mr Jefferson had begun his administration , the military establishment was still further diminished , being fixed at one regiment of artillerists , two regiments of infantry , and a corps of engineers , or about 3,000 men . By the same act , the engineers , being formed into a separate corps , were stationed at West Point , and made to constitute a military academy , thus laying the foundation of that excellent institution , which is now flourishing with so much credit and usefulness to the country . We shall not now pause to indulge ourselves in such remarks , as this allusion to its origin might naturally suggest . No change was made in the force of the military establishment from 1802 till nearly the close of Mr Jefferson 's administration . In April , 1808 , our disputes withlGreat Britain having become aggravated by several incidents , which particularly affected the interest and honor of the country , an additional military force was authorized , to consist of five regiments of infantry , one regiment of light artillery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot by about 6000 . The act creating this augmentation , contained a clause , which required that every officer , appointed under it , should be a citizen of the United States , or , ' as it adds with superfluous precision , one of the territories thereof . ' Previously to this time , many foreigners had been introduced into our service , some of whom , it is believed , had not even taken the oath of allegiance . The recruiting under this act was suspended about a year after * The inversion of phraseology here exhibited , is one among the many proofs , which might be selected , to show the great looseness of the language used in our military legislation . // ward , in consequence probably of the arrangement with Mr Erskine , the British minister , and was not renewed , although this arrangement was soon disavowed and annulled , until within about six months before the declaration of war . Shortly after this renewal , early in 1812 , Congress passed an act , authorizing an additional military force of 25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two regiments of artillery , and one regiment of light dragoons . In the beginning of 1813 , twenty additional regiments of infantry , or 20,000 men , were authorized ; and in the beginning of 1814 , three additional regiments of riflemen . No further augmentations were made to the regular force during the war . It would appear from the foregoing acts , that the nominal regular force on foot , during the war of 1812 , was between 60,000 and 70,000 . It is not probable , however , that the establishment ever approximated to an efficient fulness . The recruiting service held out powerful inducements to enlist , the bounties having been enlarged , until the recruit , besides his monthly pay of eight dollars , was offered fifty dollars when enlisted , an additional fifty when mustered , and txventyfour dollars and 320 acres of land at the expiration of his term of service ; and we believe there was no want of men ; but the pressing exigencies of the war , transferring the raw soldier immediately from the rendezvous to the scene of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , which gives cohesion and permanency to a body of men . Hence battalions , which marched from the rendezvous complete as to numbers , before they reached the frontiers were often reduced to meagre detachments . Peace was ratified with Great Britain in February , 1815 ; and among the subjects which first engaged the attention of Congress , was that of reducing the army to the proper standard of peace . Accordingly , on the third of March following , the military establishment was fixed at 10,000 men . Again , in 1821 , it was still further reduced , being diminished to 6000 , which is the number on foot at the present time . Such is a brief sketch of the legislation , which has affected the numerical force of our army , from the commencement of our It is day statement , but it suo*crests some in- government , a teresting reflections . The manner in which the country threw off its armor at the close of the Revolution , and stood among the nations of the earth , probably a solitary instance , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamblance // of a high degree of self confidence and moral energy , yet was doubtless more the result of a weak and exhausted governr . ent , and of a deep rooted aversion to mijitary establishments in time of peace , than of any sound calculations of economy , or just notions of national defence . The wisdom of that enlightened period could not have been deluded by a belief , that the causes of hostility among states had ceased to operate upon earth , or that the mere reputation of having struggled , however nobly , for independence , would be a sufficient panoply of strength . We soon had abundant proofs , that we were liable to collisions and injuries . But it required time and experience to correct that tendency to extremes , which marked many of the strong and salutary prejudices of the Revolution . Perhaps a more imposing array of national defence might not have averted the troubles which gathered about us ; but we may he allowed to suppose , that manifestations of greater vigor , and an attitude more likely to command respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insult and aggression , which visited us with wrongs from the close of the Revolution down to the late war . The reluctant and tardy grants of military force , during the administration of General Washington , may be said to have cost the nation much blood and treasure ; and to have inculcated a lesson , which appears to have reached with jcat force the policy of the succeeding administration . We have already had occasion to remark upon the liberality , with which Congress called out the force of the nation under President Adams ; an ( l there is no doubt that this liberality produced a new reaction on the policy of his successor , who came into power over the prostrated and unpopular measures , which had distinguished this agitated and eventful administration . Mr Jefferson 's policy was preeminently pacific . The small military establishment fixed in 1800 , was still further reduced in 1802 ; and the system of Mr Jefferson 's measures appears to have aimed at practically proving , that the objects usually sought for by an appeal to arms , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this illustrious republican calculated too largely upon a self denying patriotism , which probably never existed in any nation . Had his expanded and philanthropic designs been faithfully seconded by every class of citizens , the final result , as it respects the security of rights and the redress of wrongs , might have been as favorable , as that which followed the subsequent war . To have severed all connexion with the belligerents of Europe , and withdrawn // for a season from the ocean , would have involved immense sacrifices of national xveahh ; but the alternative of war could hardly encourage a hope of less sacrifice , independent of the waste of human lives . As the experiment failed , it was doubtless an injury to the country . it did not avert , it only postponed a war , while it greatly diminished the resources esseutial to its prosecution . Besides , it may he questioned whether , among the jostling nations of the earth , such a noncombatant system ever can he successful . The nation , that should always he found , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuits of commerce , rather than defending them by the sword , would , we apprehend , become the common mark of insult and cupidity . Prudence would be mistaken for pusillanimity , and , in the end , either the ocean must be abandoned , or the common right there maintained in the usual way . There is no axiom better settled , than that a nation , in order to prosper , must he respected ; and , in order to be respected , it must be determined and prepared to defend itself . The want of due preparation , before the commencement of the last war , has been the subject of much animadversion . If the preparation to meet the anticipated conflict of 1799 , under Mr Adam3 , was more than commensurate with the danger , that for the war of 1812 would seem to have fallen into the other extreme . And there was less excuse in the latter case , as the time of opening hostilities was chosen by ourselves . We are not unmindful of the often alleged unfitness of a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war . Compared with monarchical governments , it is , in these respects , far behind ; and it is no doubt true , that in proportion as a government recedes from despotism , it loses in a degree its military efficiency . But this applies to preliminary movements . and more particularly to the power of masking them from the public , than to operations subsequent to declared hostilities . It is certain , that nothing can be done secretly in this country , and we could never expect to find an enemy unaware of our force and general intentions ; but we can perceive no obstacle to any extent of open preparation . At the crisis we allude to , every fort could have been forewarned of the expected contest , and prepared to meet it , as we had a respectahle force on foot , well oflicered and disciplined . Both upon the maritime and interior frontier , the rust of a long peace could have been rubbed off ; and a spirit infused into the garrisons , suited to the approaching // change . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times , and that every post rested in Undisturbed repose , until awakened by the President 's proclamation of war , perhaps conveyed through the same channel , or commumcated by the enemy in a summons to surrender . The military establishment recommended by the Executive , at the peace of 1815 , to be reserved out of the army then on foot , was 20,000 men . It will be recollected , that the war had disturbed nearly all the Indian tribes on our interior frontier ; and that , through the agency of the British , or from their native proneness to war ( the United States having at first refused to accept their services ) , most of them were actively engaged against us . The peace with Great Britain had only nominally pacified many of her re* allies , and it was believed , that nothing but an imposing force in their neighborhood would restrain them within the bounds of peace . Under these considerations , the above force was not deemed too great for the security of the country . But Congress determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not proved that their estimate was wrong . In 1821 , our relations with the Indians , as well as with the European nations , having become settled , and confirmed by a peace of some duration , the same authority determined , that 6000 men were an establishment adequate to answer all the demands of the public service , simplifying the organization by suppressing the light artillery and riflemen , corps which served rather to diversify , than to improve our means of defence . This establishment , although small for our widely extended frontier , is probably sufficient for the purposes of peace , and may be made to embrace within itself the power of expansion , to meet even the exigencies of war . In 1812 , we had a force on foot of about the same numbers as at present , many of the officers of which had been in commission since the formation of the government , and most of them had the experience of some years ' discipline . Had an additional force been ingrafted on this establishment , thus diffusing the existing science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt have begun hostilities with greater chances of success . Our present army is susceptible of great enlargement , without any increase of regimental officers , or losing much of its immediate efficiency . But an additional army , organized in any manner , would not now be subjected to the disadvantages which existed in 1812. // At that time it may be said there was no established system either of tactics , discipline , or administration . Steuben 's work , the manual of the Revolulion , had been suffered to sink into disuse , and its place bad been supplied by such a selection from more modem systems , as suited the taste or caprice of any officer . And the regulations were lex non seripta , founded only in usages , or orders , which were no longer accessible . Thu the officers of new regiments raised in 1812 were left almost entirely to conjecture , as to every point of duty . Two attempts were made early in the war to introduce new systems of infan-* try tactics , both of which appear to have been only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , requiring a military system of discipline for the infantry of the army and militia of the United States ' to be prepared . A board of officers was constituted , which compiled a system of infantry Tactics , from the most modern and approved works , which was adopted , and has since been the guide of the army. * But this was not supplying all the desiderata of the army . The artillery , a most important branch of our national defence , was , and , it is believed , always had been , without any established guide ; and , as we have before remarked , there was no system of police and general regulations . Both these deficiencies were supplied in 1821 . A Treatise on Artillery , by General Lallemand , an officer of distinguished reputation from the French service , was then adopted by the President for the service of the United States ; and during the same year , a System of General Regulatiorts* was compiled by Major General Scott , from the French and English services , which has since been enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various branches of our service may now be considered complete , and , whatever may be their minor defects , they must , if properly enforced , produce uniformity and comparative efficiency . In looking over these Military Laws , it is impossible not to be struck with the want of re*ularity and congruity , which prevails throughout our army legislation . There are scarcely any two laws , although they have precisely the same objects in view , which are alike . This irregularity is particularly conspicuous in everything that relates to organization , in which , above all other things connected with the army , a sameness , so far as is compatible with the service , should be preserved . If it were a crude sub // ject , on which innovation might exercise its caprice , in the hope of improving upon the past , there would be a better excuse . But the orgaization of companies , regiments , brigades , divisions , &amp;c. has been long settled by experience , and in all its essential parts has taken a permanency of character , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of arming troops obtains ; and any un*forrn organP*ation , which adheres to established principles , is good . In i lust ition of the fore*oing remarks , it is only necessary to cite the hist**ry of any one corps . For instance , the followin' are the mutations and permutations of the artillery . In 1790 , it was ci anized is a battalion of four companies , commanded by a m*jor in 1494 , it was enlarged , became denominated the corps of ai till rists and engineers , and had one lieutenant colonel , four minors , and sixteen captains ; in 1798 , another regiment was adden having however only three battalions ; in 1799 , a battalion was added ; in 1802 , the whole was consolidated into one regiment , having one colonel , one lieutenant colonel , four majors , and twenty captains , the engineers forming a separate corps ; in 1812 , two additional regiments were raised , differing from the one already on foot , in having two lieutenant colonels each , and only two majors ; in 1814 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having six lieutenant colonels , six majors , and fortyeight captains ; and again in 1821 , it underwent its last transformation , being once more arranged into regiments after the usual mode . We do not pretend to determine which of the various organizations exhibited in the course of these shiftings was the best , but we presume an adherence to the principles of any one of them , would have been preferable to such capricious changes ; and we certainly can see no excuse for allowing different parts of the same corps to present the absurdity of dissimilar organization . The increase and the diminution of an army are perfectly feasible , without disturbing the principles of uniformity . Forbearing to adduce the instance of other corps , which exhibit nearly the same incongruities , we will only advert to the general organization of the army at the beginning of the late war . To pass over the artillery , of which xvc have already spoken , we had two regiments of light dragoons , one of them consisting of one colonel , one lieutenant colonel , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one colonel , two lieutenant colonels , two majors , and ten captains . In the infantry , there were seven regiments , each having one colonel , one lieutenant colonel , one // major , and ten captains ; and ten other regiments , each of which had one colonel , two lieutenant colonels , two majors , and eighteen captains . This discordant and unmanageable organization was corrected in some degree , a few months afterwards , by dividing the unwieldy regiments of the new establishment . It is difficult to account for such eccentricity of legislation , except by supposing that , in framing a new act , no reference was ever made to older acts ; or , that harmony of organization was deemed of too little moment to merit attention . It has been considered important to the effective cooperation of the militia with the regular troops , that the former should assume an organization as conformable as possible with that of the latter . But which of the Protean shapes , in which our army has appeared throughout the lasi thirty years , should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could justly be applied to all the other branches of our army legislation . No fixed rules or established principles appear to have been adopted in any case . And we were not without standards and precedents , for the war of the Revolution had introduced the most approved modes of military service , and ingrafted them upon our country . Baron Steuben was a thorough bred disciplinarian of the Frederick school , and through his useful agency , and by an association with the French army , the best practices of Europe had become familiarized to General Washington 's army . Many improvements have been made since that period ; but these relate to armament and evolutions , rather than to or6anization . The division arid subdivision of troops , best suited to their mobility and the convenience of command , the proportion of officers , and their relative rank , the separation and arrangement of staff duties , have all remained essentially the same . A consideration of the foregoing subjects naturally leads our attention to the present system of fort'Jications , which is essentially connected with the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few fortifications upon our maritime frontier . Castle William , in Boston harbor , was doubtless in good condition when it fell into our hands ; and it was probably the only work , that could be of much service to us , for which we were indebted to the mother country . Early in 1776 , the necessity of an increased maritime defence was felt by the continental Congress , and in March of that memorable year , a committee was appointed , to consider of the fortifying one or more posts on the American coasts , in the strongest manner , for the // protection of our cruisers and the reception of their prizes . ' XVe have not ascertained which of the humble works , that afterwards became distinguished for the gallant defences made in them , were erected in pursuance of this resolve . It is not probable that many of them remained at the close of the war , or if they did , that they could be regarded as any security to our coast . Before the peace , the British had made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston ; and that place was probably indebted for its protection , more to 1 he temporary presence of the French fleet , than to its castle , or even to its celebrated heights where the hasty works had 0 Wove like a diadem their tracery round . ' Our seaboard continued in this naked condition until the year 1794 , when acts were passed by Congress , directing the principal ports in the United States to be fortified under the direction of the President , at such time or times as he might judge necessary . ' There is a peculiar feature in these acts , which shows the scrupulous precision with which power was meted out to the Executive in those days . Each of them specifies , with an explicit minuteness , which implies that the power was not deemed to result as a matter of course , that the President should be authorized to employ , as garrisons , in the said fortifications , or any of them , such of the troops on the military establishment of the United States , as he might judge necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calibre of the ordnance , and the number of shot to be provided . We do not know what works were immediately undertaken in execution of these acts , but , as the first appropriations for this purpose appear not to have been made until about three years afterwards , it is not probable that much was done previously to . that time . The more modern mode of legislation in such cases , which begins with an appropriation , seems not then to have been adopted . The amount of the appropriation made at the time alluded to , and the year following , to fulfil the projected plan of fortifyi% twenty different harbors , or inlets , was three hundred and sixtyfive thousand dollars , being about the cost of some one of the forts belonging to the present system . The residue of the funds was to be supplied by debts due to the United States from individual states , which were to be credited for such labor as they might perform upon works , erected for their own defence , provided that the expenditure did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . Thron 6h these united means a few imperfect and perishable works were erected* for the protection of the principal seaports . The subject of fortifications does not appear again to have attracted the attention of Congress , until after the lapse of ten years , during which time our country had suffered severely in its wounded interests and wounded honor . In the beginning of 1808 , an appropriation of one million of dollars was made , to enable the President to repair and finish such works , as had already been completed or begun , and to erect such others , as might be necessary , in the language of the act , to afford more effectual protection to our ports and harbors , and preserve therein the respect due to the constituted authorities of the nation . ' Under this act , most of the harbors in the United States , of any importance , became fortified . There was much energy and promptitude in the execution of these works , and , as they had been deferred until the moment of urgent necessity , such despatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ive in proportion to this despatch . Time and deliberate calculation are perhaps more requisite in establishing a system of permanent defence , than in any other connected with the welfare of a nation . Haste is utterly incompatible with such a system , which should be founded upon previous surveys , comprehensive and minute , and executed in the most skilful and careful manner . At this time , no general survey of our coast , with a view to a system of defence , had been made . In most instances , such sites were occupied , as had been selected for such purposes in former times . In other cases , slight local examinations determined the choice . These works were generally planned without much regard to the rules of fortification , and constructed of perishable materials . They are now mostly in a state of dilapidation , or have been kept from falling into that state , by frequent and expensive repairs . There may be many causes assigned for the defects of the system of 1808 . It was adopted at a time when probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast against an enemy , and that of enforcing a series of restrictive measures , which were then operating upon ourselves . Guided by the latter consideration , many works were perhaps erected , which would not have entered into a mere system of external defence . The sum appropriated , likewise , although considerable , yet when divided among so many works , left but a small portion for each . // There was an urgent nece*sity , however , that the works should be completed ; and of course each was made to correspond , not to the natural demands of the site , or the linportance of the place to be defended , but to that portion of the million which fell to its share . But these works , imperfect and insufficient as they were , afforded much protection to the country during the subsequent war . Few of the harbors , which had these defences , were entered by the enemy . Spoliations and conflagrations , which might else have visited our principal towns , were generally confined to xveak and insignificant villages . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as showed the utility of strengthening those , whose slight defences had already proved so beneficial . Under the influence of this experience , soon after peace had been established , a plan of surveys was settled and put in operation , embracing a complete examination of the coast , so far as it could enter into a general system of national defence . Each harbor and bay was accurately and deliberately explored , in regard to its capacity for defence both by land and water ; all the advantages and disadvantages of localities attentively compared ; the magnitude of both the immediate and remote interests to be protected was brought into consideration ; and afterwards , the whole combined into one view , in order to produce a general result . Upon these surveys and calculations a general system of national defence was formed , which was submitted to Congress in 1819-20 , and , after a thorough discussion of its merits , approved . An immediate appropriation was made for its commencement . The number of works proposed to be erected , their position , their dimensions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reports of the engineers , however , in all their details , although laid before Congress , have never been published . They appear to have been accessible to those , who are called upon to give the system legislative support ; but it has been determined , that they contain much information , which ought not to be spread before the public at large . There can be no mystery with respect to the number and sites of public works , nor could the power of their armament long be concealed ; but there are many other facts connected with a fortification , such as the most accessible points of approach , the nature and resources of the surrounding country , having relation to the attack and defence , which are ascertained only by such topographic*4 // surveys and minute calculations , as men of professional skill and experience alone can make , and which would be invaluable to an enemy , that common prudence would withhold from publicity . From such parts of these reports as have been published , we are able to gather the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , than by giving the following extracts . A defensive system for the frontiers of the United States is therefore yet to be created ; its bases are first , a navy ; second , fortifications ; third , interior communication by land and water ; and fourth , a regular army and well organized militia ; these means must all be combined so as to form a complete system . ' The navy must , in the first place , be provided with proper establishments for construction and repair , harbors of rendezvous , stations and ports of refuge . It is only by taking into view the general character , as well as the details , of the whole frontier , that we can fix on the most advantageous points for receiving these naval depots , harbors of rendezvous , stations , and ports of refuge. * On these considerations , Burwell 's Bay , in James river , and Charlestown , near Boston , have been especially recommended by the commission , as the most proper sites for the great naval arsenals of the South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief rendezvous , and Narraganset bay as an indispensable accessary to Boston Roads . ' It is also from an attentive consideration of the whole maritime frontier , of the interior , and of the coastwise navigation , that Mobile bay , on the gulf of Mexico , St. Mary 's , in the Chesapeake , the Delaware , New York bay , Buzzard 's bay , New London , Marblehead , Portsmouth , Portland , the mouths of the Kennebec and Penobscot , and Mount Desert bay , have been fixed upon as stations and ports of refuge ; as necessary and essential to our merchant vessels as to our navy . ' Smithville and Beaufort , North Carolina ; Annapolis , Maryland ; New Haven , Connecticut ; Salem , in Massachusetts ; and Wiscasset , have likewise been examined with attention , with a view to secure them from attack by sea and land . ' St Mary 's river and Savannah , in Georgia ; Beaufort , Charleston , and Georgetown , in South Carolina , will be examined in the course of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system is founded upon full stirveys , and the most comprehensive considerations . // It is in the strictest sense a general and national system of defence ; and the public may now feel an assurance , that all future expenditures will be applied in the most beneficial manner which science and experience can devise , in fulfilment of this system . The works are in a course of gradual completion , their progress being regulated by the resources of the country , and the necessity of a careful and proper execution . It is a season of peace , and there is no urgency for greater despatch than is compatible with these limitations . By the documents whose title we have prefixed to this article , it is seen that the works proposed by the plan are divided into three classes , corresponding with their immediate and more remote importance . The works embraced in the first class , which are recommended to be commenced as soon as possible , and to be completed as fast as the resources of the country will admit , appear to be twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recommended not to be commenced until a later period , probably not until those of the first class are completed , are twenty in number ; the third class embraces seven works , to be postponed to a still more remote period. * Some of the works embraced in the first class have already been finished , and others are in the progress of construction . They are intended to protect the principal seaports and avenues of the country ; they constitute the cardinal points of defence , includh*g Boston , Newport , New York , the river Delaware , the Chesapeake , Mobile , and the mouths of the Mississippi . Some works in North Carolina , by the decision of Congress , and not , it appears , by the recommendation of the board of enoinee same class . * rs , belong to the The Delta of the l*Iississippi , being almost destitute of defence , and concentrating , as it were , the co. imercial interests of the numerous and populous states , which are watered by the wide spread arms of this mighty river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ivtobile point , forming a subsidiary part of the same defence , was of contemporaneous commencement . The importance of securing this extreme and vulnerable point of our Union , was suggested by every sound *onsideration , and not a little strengthened by recollections of * In the Revised Report of the Board of Engineers in Narcim last , afourth class is proposed , containing such works as xviii be necessary only conditionally. ' // the late war , when invasion approached that quarter with nO fear of repulse , and when probably the genius of one man saved the Western country . These fortifications will protect New Orleans , and all the multitudinous interests connected with its safety , from similar invasions in future . Had such defences existed in 1814 , it can hardly he doubtod , that such an attempt would not have been made . Its weakness , combined with its importance , induced and encouraged the enterprise . We can not pretend to state the expense attending the defence of that country at the time alluded to . Such a calculation would be imperfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lost on the occasion by sickness , as well as by the more ordinary cause of mortality in war . It is not improbable , however , that the mere pecuniary loss resulting to the country from this invasion , would have nearly defrayed the cost of the works , which are now erecting for the defence of the Mississippi . It will be recollected that Congress decided against one of the works , proposed by the report of the board of engineers as a part of this defence . There may be an appearance of arrogance in doubting the wisdom of this decision , but we are inclined to believe , that , at some future time , the works on Dauphine Island will he resumed . It was never , we presume , regarded as an immediate defence of any channel or passage , and the depth of its surrounding waters was well ascertained . But in determining the facilities of attack and defence in the gulf of Mexico , the engineers could not have been unmindful , that , to leave a large and salubrious island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , open to the occupation of an enemy , would be voluntarily relinquishing a point d'appui , whence a whole coast might be kept in a constant state of alarm ; and whence expeditions might move with equal ease and promptitude , against any of its assailable points . The deleterious climate of the gulf of Mexico , when operating upon masses of men crowded in ships , is one of its best protections against an invasion of any duration . But leave a healthy and centrally situated island as a place d'armes , as a place of rest and refreshment for an invading force , and this safeguard is rendered almost nugatory . The other works belonging to the first class , also claiming the earliest attention , were those which defend Hampon Roads , the Delaware , New York , and the harbor of Newport . The high importance of Hampton Roads , which , besides being the outlet of an extensive and valuable local commerce , are the central ren // dezvous of our merchantmen and navy , has never been misunderstood ; but , under systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain populous places , they have always been left open and free as the common highway of nations . During the late war , however , the advantage of having had a secure place of refuge , in this broad and excellent roadstead , were made too manifest , not to suggest greater precautions for the future . Its accessibleness at all seasons , and with the same wind which wafts a vessel into the mouth of the Chesapeake , combined with its central position upon the Atlantic coast , renders it now , and will render it through all future time , of great moment to the country . Throughout the late war , the enemy held undisturbed possession of these roads ; thus excluding us from the best port of refuge which the country affords , where be could ride securely through all the vicissitudes of the seasons , and whence he could detach an armament , with the greatest facility , to annoy any part of the coast . The two works now under construction for their security will , in all probability , deter any enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and after the additional interior works , proposed in the third class , are finished , the roads would be untenable even by those who might succeed in forcin* the outer defences . One of these forts , which is built in the sea , can not be besieged ; and the other is capable of resisting any force , until relief could arrive . The defences of the Delaxvare and of New York , which have in view the protection of two cities of great importance , need no comment . The propriety of arranging them under the first class , and of giving them the earliest attention , admits of no question . The harbor of Newport , with its ample anchorage and easiness of access at most seasons , is second only to Hampton Roads , as a port of refuge and of rendezvous . Hampton Roads and Newport are the two points which an enemy would choose to seize upon , in order to carry on the most effectual war against us . Such a defence of them , therefore , as may render any enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a system of national defence . The works proposed for the defence of Boston harbor , which cuter into the first class , have not yet been commenced , unless it be so far as to secure the islands on which they are to be founded , from the encroachments of the sea . The fortifications already // there , although imperfect and misplaced , yet , assisted by the defensive character which nature has given to the harbor , afford a better protection than was possessed by any other place of equal importance . Of the works proposed in the second class , some appear to be only subsidiary to those of the first class , intended to render them more effectual ; others are of an independent character , such as those which are to be at the mouths of the Potomac and of the Patapsco , those on the coasts of Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Maine . These works , though secondary in importance , form essential parts of the general defence . The system having been established on minute calculations , the armament required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man them , both in peace and in war , have been accurately determined . The number of the latter has been fixed at rather less than five thousand men in time of peace , and not quite thirtyeigbt thousand in time of war . The garrisons , in time of peace , will doubtless always be formed of regular soldiers ; but in time of war , a part of each will of course be supplied by the neighboring militia . It is the opinion of General Lallemand , that if half the number of artillerists in the field are old soldiers , it is enough ; ' and the remark would still bold good as to garrison service . These small and well disci ) lined garrisons will be centres around which the irregular force of the country may gather in a season of danger . During the late war , the country being comparatively without defence by fortifications , the enemy was able to carry on against us , what Mr MeLane very aptly termed , a war of threatenings ; ' that is , by keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places within striking distance , he kept the whole country in a state of alarm , and immense bodies of militia constantly under arms . Whenever the present system of fortifications shall be completed , all the principal avenues to the country will be strongly guarded . The mass of the population may rest in quietness , until certain demonstrations indicate the point of attack . If this point prove to be any of the fortifications , the siege that must take place will afford ample time for adequate relief . Should more exposed quarters be the object , the force of the country may be directed thither , without any apprehension of danger to more important places , that may be left behind . The estimated expense of completing the proposed system of // fortifications is about seventeen millions of dollars . It is not improbable , that the expense incurred on account of the militia during the late war , which such a system might have left undisturbed at home , may have nearly equalled this amount . But , if a proper condition of defence were not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and prescient policy would not hesitate to make the appropriation , keeping always within the resources of the country . It is not likely that the most impregnable state of defence would at all times avert a war . But war nowadays is not waged without calculation . Caprice and passion have less influence over these great questions , so momentous to the human race , than formerly . A nation that appears able to defend itself is respected ; its rights are not likely to be trampled upon . Hence it is not too much to say that the expenditure of fifteen or twenty millions upon fortifications may avert many wars , each of which might cost , like the last , a hundred millions . In reviewing the legislation relating to the army , we purposely omitted all remarks upon the Jllilitary wlcctdemy at West Point , believing that a subject of so much interest as this favorite institution of the nation , demanded a separate and more enlarged consideration . The importance and necessity of some seminary of this kind , where the candidate for a commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been acknowledged in all*countries , where the military service has been guided by the scientific rules of war . They have long been established in France and in England , and the most distinguished warrior of this or any other age , as well as his fortunate conqueror , were both d%es of military schools . Our fathers had had some practice in war previously to the Revolution , but they understood little of its science . The propriety , however , of establishing some school , at which the rudiments of an art , every day becoming m*ore important to the cause at issue , could he early infused into the commissioned ranks of the army , did not escape their observation . In October , 1776 , the continental Congress resolved that a committee should be appointed , to prepare and bring in a plan of a military academy , at the army . ' It does not appear that any successful result followed this resolution . The bustle and trying exigencies of such a war as we were then waging , were not propitious to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from // the phrase , at the army , ' that it was designed to connect it with the camp , we apprehend the intended plan could not have borne much similitude to more modern academies . An ambulatory academy does not accord with our received notions on this subject . The next attempt to introduce any thing like science into our army appears to have been made in 1794 , when , in forming the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers , the President was authorized to provide ' the necessary books , instruments , and apparatus , for the use and benefit of the said corps . ' But as these articles were for the use only of officers already commissioned , and engaged in the active duties of their profession , they must have been intended rather as the auxiliaries of practice , than to establish a course of instruction . Indeed , as no point of concentration was fixed for them , such an application of them would have been impracticable . In fixing the peace establishment in 1802 , at the commenceinent of Mr Jefferson 's administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed into an independent corps , having attached to it ten cadets . The law further enacted , that the corps should be stationed at West Point , and constitute a military academy ; that the principal engineer , and , in his absence , the next in rank , should have the superintendence of the said military academy , under the direction of the President of the United States ; ' and the secretary of war was authorized , under the President , to procure the necessary books , implements , and apparatus , for the use of the said institution. * By the same act , two cadets were allowed to each of the twenty companies of artillery retained on the peace establishment ; and although no provision appears for attaching these cadets to the Military Academy , yet , it is believed that such of them as were appointed , were sent for instruction to that institution . This is the more probable , as , while the law continued the same , many graduates were appointed to the artillery , and some even to the infantry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of the appointment in 1803 of a teacher of French and another of Drawing , until 1812 . About ninety cadets had been graduated and commissioned previously to this time . Among these are to be recognised many officers , who were conspicuous during the late war for their skill and gallantry , and who fell honorably in the field of battle , or still live in the service of their country . // In 1812 , just before the declaration of war , the corps of en gineers was somewhat enlarged ; the Military Academy was at the same time greatly augmented , and much improved in its organization. * The academy was still made to embrace the corps of engineers ; and at the same time received , in addition to the teachers of French and of Drawing , a Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy , a Professor of Mathematics , and a Professor of Engineering , who were to be taken from the corps of engineers , or not , at the discretion of the President . The number of cadets for the different corps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to two hundred and fifty , which , joined to the ten cadets allowed to the corps of engineers by the law of 1802 , made the full complement two hundred and sixty.t As this law of 1812 is the basis upon which the academy now stands , we shall quote a few of its leading provisions . The said corps of cadets shall be trained and taught all the duties of a private , noncommissioned officer , and officer ; be encamped at least three months of each year , and taught all the duties incident to a regular camp ; that the candidates for cadets be not under the age of fourteen , nor above the age of twentyone years ; that each cadet , previously to his appointment by the President of the United States , shall be well versed in reading , writing , and arithmetic , and that he shall sign articles , with the consent of his parent or guardian , by which he shall engage to serve four years , unless sooner discharged ; ' that when any cadet shall receive a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , he shall be considered among the candidates for a commission in any corps , according to the duties he may be judged competent to perform . ' In 1818 , a chaplain was added to the academy , who was likewise to be Professor of Geography , History , and Ethics . The foregoing are the main provisions relating to the Military Academy which we gather from the volume of laws before us . They do not descend to the minutim of interior arrangement , aqd of course leave much to be done by those , who have the management of the institution . Such an establishment , upon an extended scale , was a new thing in this country , and we were * Law of Congress , April 29 , 1812. t As we hav'e now only three corps , in service , namely , of engineers , artillery , and infantry , *Cll the graduates are commissioned in those corps. // either ignorant of the highly improved models of other countries , or did not choose to adopt their improvements . For four or five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cadets had been much increased , there appears to have been no established regulations as to the time of admission , or the length of the term of instruction . In 1817 , or the year following , many improvements were introduced ; and the academy assumed that interior arrangement , as to classification , discipline , division of studies , &amp;c. which has since given it such a high character for utility , and made admission into it a matter of competition throughout the United States . The time of entrance became fixed , as well as the term of in-. struction , and each candidate was required to pass through , not only an initial examination , but a probation of six months ( at the end of which he is subjected to a second examination ) , before he could be entitled to receive a warrant . In the law requiring that each cadet should engage to serve for five years , four of these years were allotted to the term of instruction at the academy ; and the whole number of cadets being divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , to fill the place of the graduated class . Regulations were likewise established , determining the nature of the studies and the mode of ' instruction ; each year receiving such allotment as best suited the classification , and the scale of improvement . Another regulation was likewise adopted , perhaps in a subsequent year , which has tended to make known more widely the merits of the institution , and has given the examinations a public and national character , greatly enhancing the value of the honors awarded . We allude to the Board of Visiters , constituted of ' a number of gentlemen , not less than five , distinguished for military and other sciences , ' who are selected by the secretary of war , and who attend , at West Point , each annual examination . As the documents , which we have quoted , contain an able report from the board of visiters , who attended the examination of 1825 , we shall avail ourselves of its interesting details , to present a brief view of the system of instruction pursued there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the order observed in the report , the first branch of study noticed is Engineering , in its two branches , military and civil . The highest commendation is bestowed by the board upon the proficiency evinced in these branches . When it is recollected , that the primary object of the institution was , and // probably still is , to make accomplished engineers , such high attainments in these respects furnish evidence that its first purposes are fulfilled . As we have now begun an extensive system of national defence , upon the proper accomplishment of which depends the economical expenditure of millions , and the future security of the country , it is all important that the best skill should be possessed by those , to whose charge the work is necessarily confided . But the demand for talent is not confined to military engineering only ; the spirit of internal improvement , which is now awakening our whole country to enterprise , opens also a scope for civil engineering , whose limits it would be difficult to define . The large and complicated operations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will require a range of science , which even this institution is not likely to surpass . The next branch of study mentioned in the report is . /Vlineralogy . This , however , appears to have been but recently introduced , and not as yet to have been pursued with much advantage . it is only a subordinate branch of the professorship of chemistry , and is without any public cabinet of minerals . The report most justly remarks , that mineralogy , connected with geology , is of great practical importance to the corps of engineers . Indeed , we should suppose that an acquaintance with these two sciences would more frequently enter into the operations of both the milifary and civil engineer , than that of chemistry , though all three are of unquestionable importance . We hope the recommendation of the board , with respect to the establishment of a cabinet of minerals , will meet with attention . Such a deficiency in that study defeats all useful purposes as much as if the chemist were without his crucibles and retorts . The law would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The next branch embraces Geography , History , and Ethics . As these studies are all annexed to the office of chaplain , the incumbents of which had been changed during the year , no examinations were submitted to the board . It does not appear that these studies are largely attended to at any time . They form essential elements of a well instructed mind ; so does literature in general ; but as they are acquirements which can be made at all times and in all places , unassisted by professors and teachers , they can claim only subordinate attention at an institution , intended more particularly for those severe sciences and difficult arts , which are seldom compassed by unaided exertions. // We have not space to follow up the remarks of the board upon the departments of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry . It is well known that they are confided to professors of high reputation . Drawing also forms an essential part of the instruction at West Point . Where natural aptitude assists the teacher , the greatest proficiency may be expected from the opportunity there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The topography of our country is yet in its infancy , and there will long be abundant employment for this talent . Of the branch of .1'Jathernatics the board remarks , that the condition of this department leaves nothing to desire . ' This is bountiful praise , but no more , we presume , than is deserved . The rare degree of excellence attained by many of the graduates , in all the ramifications of this study , has been frequently attested by the most competent judges . It has , we have understood , been the opinion of some judicious men , that mathematics have occupied too much of the attention of the cadets , to the exclusion of studies of more practical importance . This question may be best settled by bringing into consideration the main objects of the institution . The primary object , as we have before observed , is to make accomplished engineers , and likewise to diffuse through all the departments of our military establishment those sciences , which are necessary to its effiejency and proper administration . If the mathematical proficieiicy , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to fulfil these purposes , then the surplus time might be better appropriated . But this may well be questioned . The reach of science demanded by our engineering operations , both military and civil , for ascertaining boundaries , and making surveys , can not easily be circumscribed . In the Polytechnic school in France , the cadets , being designated at their entrance for a particular branch , were instructed accordingly . But this is not the case at West Point , and any such distinction of studies there , would carry an invidious discrimination with it , that might operate very unfavorably upon the spirit of competition , which now pervades the whole body . This preliminary designation , while it offers some advantages , has many o*jections , which probably has prevented its introduction at West Point . The bent and power of the mind can not easily be ascertained beforehand ; a course of study alone brings them out ; particularly the latter . Under the French rule , the range of selection is limited , and talents may often be mi*di // rected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of emulation is open to all ; the designation does not take place until after a full developement of the various capacities and tastes of the students ; and the best genius , and the most successful application , are thus likely to receive those appointments which are deemed the most honorable , and for which these prerequisites render them the most fit . The French language is taught at the academy , and made , as it ought to be , an essential branch of instruction . Much weight should be given to the reasons advanced by the board , in favor of adding an assistant teacher to this department , who should be acquainted with the Latin and Spanish languages . If there are those in any of the classes , whose greater proficiency in all the prescribed studies leaves them leisure for attention to these additional studies , thereby preserving a previous knowledge of the Latin , and acquiring a new language which prevails over more than half our hemisphere , we should hope that the trifling increase of expense it might cause would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the board speaks in terms of high commendation . This embraces the system of infantry tactics established for the army of the United States , commencing with the elementary drill of the soldier , and including the school of the company ; school of battalion , and evolutions of the line ; the exercise and manoeuvres of light infantry and riflemen ; the duties in camp and garrison , of privates , noncommissioned officers , and officers , including those of guard and police . ' * All those who have seen the military exercises of the battalion of cadets , will bear testimony that this regulation is well fulfilled . It is scarcely possible for any troops to attain the power of mancrnvring with greater precision . The course of . drtiliery instruction embraces the nomenclature of the different parts of cannon , gun carriages , caissons , and their implements ; exercise and rnnmnuvres of field artillery ; exercise of siege artillery , including the mortar and howitzer exercises ; mechanical maneuvres ; target practice with the gun , howitzer , and mortar ; duties of the laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interesting subject . The institution has acquired a wide and honorable reputation , and is deservedly in favor both with the people and // the government . We shall finish with an extract from the report of the board , ihat gives some of the causes , that have produced this high character . The duty of the board of visiters , as prescribed by the fourteenth paragraph of the regulations of the academy , has seemed to demand of them some inquiry into the general system of means , by which the honorable and gratifying results , disclosed in the examination , have been attained . Much , no doubt , is to be ascribed to circumstances , in a high degree peculiar to this institution ; its immediate connexion with the Government of the United States ; the moral influence which this connexion imparts to the officers of instruction ; the natural situation of the academy on a spot extremely favorable to its purposes ; and the national spirit and character which pervade the institution . While , however , their due influence is ascribed to these causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cadets to the skill and fidelity of the teachers , and to the judicious mode in which the classes are divided for instruction . As it would be impossible , on account of numbers , to teach a whole class collectively , each of the four classes is divided into convenient sections , according to the talents , previous acquirements , and ambition of the cadets . Whenever justice requires it , cadets are transferred from one section to another , and continual al ) plication is thus necessary , to maintain a distinguished character and place . To perfect the system of generous competition , the cadets , after each semiannual examination , are arranged on the roll , and take their seats , according to merit . In doing this , general conduct is considered , as well as progress in knowledge , so that every one , who aTires to distinction , is led to be vigilant over his daily deportment . It is-also the custom each week to make a report of the best and the most deficient , in each section , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a semiannual examination , any are found grossly deficient , they are turned back , to go over their courses again ; and if , at the next examination , they are still found wanting , they are dismissed from the institution . Great justice and impartiality are exercised , as far as the board could judge , in making out the Roll of Merit . The rank assigned to each cadet is the result of a trial publicly conducted , and the greatest publicity is given to this result , by printing and distributing the roll of cadets arranged according to merit . The influence of such a system , in exciting to honorable exertion , needs not to be enforced . The board are therefore of opinion , that the system of dividing into sections , according to // the relative capacity of the members of the classes , is practically excellent , and worthy of being carefully and vigorously maintained ; and that public gratitude is due to the Superintendent of the academy , and to the Academic Staff , for having introduced so powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which requires only to be better known , in order to be universaily adopted in our establishments for education . ' * We have thus passed in rapid review the history of our army ; our present system of fortifications ; and the Military Academy at West Point . They are essentially connected and form parts of the same whole . Our national defences are no longer regarded with the prejudiced feelings of past days ; they are not now looked upon as the creations of particular administrations or parties , arising out of a temporary policy , which is expected to change with the change of power ; but as a settled system , founded on a true estimation of the permanent security and welfare of the country . It was said on the floor of Congress by an eminent member , that the system of national defence was as much an institution of the country , as the constitution itself . ' It is no doubt true , that a proper and necessary degree of defence , as justly and imperiously demands the support of every patriot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present few intelligent persons , who , whatever may be their wishes or hopes , can persuade themselves , that a nation , being in any degree tangible by its position or external relations , can maintain its interests , its honor , or its rights , without a proper system of general defence , or frequent wars . Our present army is divided into artillery and infantry , and assigned for the protection of the maritime and interior frontier . * The whole number of cadets who have been graduated at the Military Academy since its first establishment in 1802 , up to July , 1825 , is 428 , of whom 338 have been graduated since 1812 . Of the whole number , 261 are now in the army , forming more than half the number of its officers ; 3 are in the civil service ; 9 have been killed in battle ; and 33 have died in service ; - 45 of the whole number have been attached to the corps of engineers ; 249 to the artillery and ordnance ; and 134 to other corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , embracing the most approved works , both in French and in English , on fortifications , artillery , pyrotechny , the military art , military history , memoirs , campaigns , civil engineering , mathematics , natural history , astronomy , navigation , chemistry , mineralogy , the arts , geography , topography , history , biography , travels , miscellanies. // The artillery is necessarily broken into small detachments , corresponding withthe number of fortifications . But it is the nature of that branch to act in detachments ; and there can be no obstacle to its acquiring the utmost skill requisite in garrison service ; and it will rarely be called upon to perform any other . Should the approach of war render it probable , that portions of it might be wanted in the field as light artillery , a few months ' drill with horses would superadd the qualifications of that species of service , and give adequate efficiency for active operations. * The infantry , from the different nature of its service , can be , and is , more concentrated . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than by many detachments . The policy of Mr Calhoun , in advancing far within the Indian country our cordon of posts , has been approved by experience ; and had his scheme been carried more fully into effect , the only indian conflict we have since had , would probably have been avoided . The time has past in the United States , when any just fears are entertained of such a standing army , as may be required by the present system of general defence . It is a gratuitous t*ssumption , that the officers of the army are less identified with the country , have less interest in its institutions , and are less desirous of maintaining them , than any other class of citizens . The military establishments of most countries form an appendage of the crown ; and even in England , where they might be supposed to have a somewhat more popular character , foreign and colonial stations give the officers a peculiarity of feeling , which separates them in a degree from their fellow countrymen . But in our country , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is mingled with them ; it participates in the same habits , imbibes the same sentiments , and regards itself in every respect as a part of the great community . * An artillery school of practice was established about two years ago at Fortress Monroe , Old Point Comfort , Virginia , for the purpose of practically instructing the four regiments of artillery , successively , through a course of two years , in all the duties belonging to that branch . Like most of Mr Calhoun 's plans , this had great utility in view . But there was not sufficient attention paid to preliminary details . The local situation of the school was ill chosen , or , at least , occupied too soon . It has resulted in a double interference ; the school interfering with the progress of the fortifications , and the progress of the fortifications interfering with the school . //
