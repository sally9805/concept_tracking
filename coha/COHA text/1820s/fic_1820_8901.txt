Lady Jane Gray , was the eldest daughter of Henry Gray , Marquis of Dorset , and Duke of Suffolk , and great grand daughter to Henry VIII of England  --  " Lovely in her person "  --  says her biographer , " gentle , modest , and amiable in her temper , endowed with a superior capacity , and powers of application uncommon for her sex and age , she was educated with the young king , Edward VI . whom she emulated , and even surpassed , in every liberal attainment . She had , at a very early age , applied herself to the acquisition of the Greek , Roman , Arabic , Italian , and French languages ,  --  and was conversant both with ancient and modern literature . She was acquainted with the sciences and arts , and also excelled in the customary avocations of her sex . Possessed of great sensibility of temper , with a devotional turn of mind , she had , on investigation , imbibed the principles of Reformation "  --  Humble and unassuming herself , this lovely assemblage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early sacrifice to the fallacious projects of ambitious parents  --  The Earl of Northumberland , ( whose fourth son , Lord Guilford Dudley , the Lady Jane espoused in 1553 , ) prevailed on the young monarch a few months previous to his decease , to declare his sisters Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate , to reject the claims of the Queen of Scotts , and appoint the Lady Jane his successor . On the death of the young king , Jane absorbed in her studies , her mind devoted to elegant literature , and her heart full of tenderness to her husband , is said to have received the news of her advancement , with astonishment , terror , and grief  --  But it was not until the aggrandizing views of the two Earls , Northumberland and Suffolk were defeated , when the former had paid the forfeit of his crimes , with his life ; and the latter was condemned , with his lovely daughter and her unhappy husband to the scaffold ; that the Lady Jane appears in that noble light , which claims all our love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unrelenting Mary , we love to repeat the lovely martyr 's name .  --  During her imprisonment , the greatness of her superior mind , shone in unconquered beauty  --  She remained firm and unshaken in her religion to the last , though assailed by flatteries , arguments and threats , from the church of Rome  --  On the scaffold , she met her fate , with heroic meekness and resignation , at the early age of 17 years  --  The writer of the following lines , has endeavored to keep in view the character , which history has ascribed to this interesting female  --  Though she can not expect to add one flower to the wreath , which an admiring posterity has twined around the urn of exalted virtue !  --  yet she offers it as an " effusion of her heart " to the memory of one , whose superior and true greatness she has ever loved to contemplate . Main text Scene SCENE ,  --  THE TOWER , IN LONDON . Lady JANE and Lord GUILFORD . Lady Jane Lady Jane  --  Why weeps my Dudley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terror to thy soul , appear ? Would Jane , with England 's crown , more lovely shine ? Than , when aloft , she joins her voice with thine , To sing in strains of love , the Prince of Peace , Who kindly gives his youthful saints release , From pain and woe ,  --  as witness Edward 's doom ,  --  Our dearest monarch , call 'd in early bloom . Dudley Lord Dudley  --  Think not my Jane , thy Dudley weeps the loss , Of Fortune 's gifts , and all her shining dross  --  Think not I wish Ambition 's fatal lure , Think not a crown , to me , call peace ensure  --  I 'd smiling view these banbles fade in air , Would the proud queen , thy youth and beauty spare . I weep to view Religion 's lovely child , On whom fair Science and the Graces smil 'd , Crush 'd by a tyrant 's power , a bigot 's wile , And fore 'd to suffer for another 's guile .  --  Lady Jane Lady Jane  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is God decrees  --  and sure his ways are wise  --  What if those scenes of bliss , our fancies drew , Are fled , my Dudley , from our anxious view , What if our learned visions fade from sight , Domestic joys , and Science ' dear delight ?  --  Yet these , were earthly dreams , soon shall we range , Through fields of glory , which can never change . Dudley Lord Dudley  --  Alas , I fear to try a world unknown , And leave those joys , I fondly hop 'd my own . Who knows my Jane , if e'er these eyes shall trace , Again , the beauties of thy faultless face ? Yet well thou know'st ' t was not thy matchless form , Which did , with love , thy Guilford 's bosom warm ;  --  ' T was not the speaking lustre of thine eye , Which drew his soul , and form 'd affection 's tie ;  --  No ' t was thy spirit pure , thy noble mind , Thy genius great , by learning well refin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Whose smile could lead me , and whose counsel mend , I fancied bliss ,  --  no glided joys were there  --  But Love and Learning drew the prospect fair , Of some sequester 'd , some delightful spot , Where we could live , by pomp and pride forgot ,  --  Books our companions ,  --  Elmer Footnote : 1Kb for our guide  --  These were not hopes , to royalty allied . Oft have I thought , were mine the peasant 's home , And thee a partner , thence no wish should roam  --  Deluded parents ;  --  O how vain the art , Of royal birth , to sooth the dying heart  --  How have your wild ambitious projects crush 'd , Each dear delight , and hope forever hush 'd !  --  Lady Jane Lady Jane  --  Are these my Guilford 's thoughts ? dare he complain , And thus in weak repinings , God arraign ?  --  And does he fear to try a world unknown ? And are his pleasures built on earth alone ? Are there no hopes , to true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Heav'n ? And dest thou hope no more , the joys , to find , Which flow from converse with a kindred mind ? O hush thy doubts , nor think that guilty man , Can know God 's will , or all his judgments scan  --  Blame not the dead , thy father 's dreams are o'er ,  --  And Suffolk hopes for power and thrones no more  --  Our parents crred , yet we were weak as they , Their plans are o'er , our 's also fade away  --  We heirs of Heaven , had fix 'd our home below , As if ' t were holy and eternal too .  --  Our bless 'd Redeemer calls us to his arms , Lest we , too much , should love these gilded charms , To teach us too , true Knowledge never dies , But lives eternal , in its native skies . Death has no terrors , yet I turn and weep , Where royal Edward 's honour 'd ashes sleep  --  Not for his fate , but England 's fearful doom , Whose dearest hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Religion pure and true , Would yet arise in beauty to her view , And driving darkness from our native shore , Should walk , with Science twin 'd , to part no more . But those dear truths our blessed Saviour spread Can ne'er be join 'd with Superstition dread , Soon Mary 's power will hurl the dreadful brand Of persecution , ' round our mourning land ; Many in Virtue 's cause will then expire , May holy love each martyr 's breast inspire ,  --  May Guilford 's bosom feel that flame divine , Then will his heart sincerely join with mine . Dudley Lord Dudley  --  Dearest of women ! how thy words impart , Sweet consolation to my fearful heart  --  No more I 'll doubt , but fondly kiss the knife , Which gives , not death , but everlasting life  --  For sure ' t is bliss to emulate thy fame , And give ( with thee ) to worlds unborn my name  --  I read thine eye ,  --  thou thinkst the glory more , To gain His love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy Dudley feels thy thoughts are true , And much he longs , those blessed realms to view , Where the first saint we meet , thy brow shall grace , With golden crown , and in thy hand will place , A harp of love , whose high melodious strain Will only wake , to praise its Maker 's name .
