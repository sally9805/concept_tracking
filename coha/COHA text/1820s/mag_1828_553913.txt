txt Awr . VIIL. *-Persona1 Sketches of his Own Tim*es4 By Sir JONAH BARRINGTON , Judge of the High Court of Admiral .. ty in Ireland , &amp;c . THE entertaining character of these Sketches ' has been suf- ' ficiently evinced by their wide circulation , and the Jiheral ex* tracts from4hem into the newspapers and other jouraals* It is evident , therefoi*e , that we are not introducing a new book to the notice of the public . The freedom of Sir Jonah 's pencil , and the extravagance of his coloring , have certainly not diminished the popularity of his pictures , though they may have lessened the faith of his readers in their perfect fidelity . They would have been deemed , perhaps , less veritahlestilW if they had not related to a people whose national characteristics are as eccentric as their political and social condition is singular and unhappy . After all that we had read or heard of Ireland , however and though prepared to find in Irish society more than the usual ill results of misrule and oppression , - we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sorrow . Even the wretchedness of the lower orders will not strike his readers so much , as the state of social intercourse among the higher* Those portions of the book , especially , which relate to Due1*. hug , with- anecdotes of which , both - ludicrous and melancholy , it is abundantly seasoned , excite a horror . - which is- not lessen ed by the levity with which the subject is treated by the - ai*- * thor . The madness of private brawl pervaded all classes and professions , and would seem to have been regarded as an essential part of Irish gentility . A time will come , it can hardly be doubted , when the bloody code of honor which our author-has been at the pains to record , the thirty-six com. * mandments , ' as they were irreverently called , established by a convention of polite duellists , will be regarded as the - last inspirations of madness in men made desperate by misrule and anarchy . Even making large allowance for a caricaturing pencil , what we find in the Sketches ' may create a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than . to fancy any connexion between the , existence of this usage , and . the courtesy and refinement of our modern manners . These are qualities less valuable than are supposed , if they can be imagined to have flourished in Ireland at the era in // question . Yet there was evidently no lack of these champions of good manners , the most pacific professions having contributed their quota ; but , as has happened to other martyrs , in cases of like dubious merit , with no sensible benefit to the public . We must take the occasion presented by these Sketches , ' to say something on a subject which our readers may perhaps think already over trite . There are too many fatal examples to the contrary , to permit us to doubt , that in the present state of public opinion on this point , a f*lse honor may drive indh*iduals of both sense arid virtue , to the commission of this modifitation of murder* Yet do we confidently predict , that civilization will not be long in exploding it ,  --  as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fain to think that common sense has in this matter more adherents than openly avow themselves , who wait , as it were , some convenient time .. and some note - of concert among themselves , to revolt against this tyrant of society , which may be truly called bloody without a figure , and to . set up the lawful ruler instead . If one did not daily see innumerable prejudices persevered in by mankind , for which they have long ceased to pretend any sound reason , this revolt of the friends of good sense would - seem near at hand For though some persons , pressed , we suppose , for a reason , - very gravely tell us that the duel is a remnant of that right of private war which was abolished by the institution of society ; left us for the revenge of injuries which social laws can not reach ; the thing seems , by the better opinion , to have just so much foundation in - t'eason , as is - included in the customary reply to grave casuists who cavil at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd enough ;  --  but it is a necessary evil ; ' or , This is a matter about which it is quite useless to reason ; ' which last seems true enough indeed of one side of the question . - - Au ancient custom is , however , like an old tree , - which may stand upright a long time after the roots that nourished it . are decayed . A sort of vis inertie influences our moral nature , which , like that of material bodies , seems  --  to fix it in an old habit of- thinking , or , if the philosophical reader pleases , makes it run on in an old course of error , long after  --  the impression of the - - original - impulse . Most : of the xnonstrbus absurdities which men have at length seen fit to- reform , have even been lamented as lost benefits ; - from the motlinitic institu // 500 April , tions which once fed , in the most industrious of modern states , a lazy and vicious population , down to the law of primogeni-* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . There are some worthy persons , and judicious thinkers too , who yet fancy they see in the abolishment of this last , the end of all legitimate gentility ; on no better grounds of belief , we hope , than of those 6Uves of the old school , who lament the disuse of hair-powder , not on the score of ornament merely , but as the removal of another patrician distinction ; and who not long since regarded cropped hair as an infallible mark of Jacobinism , as their fathers saw , in the disappearance of the hoop , the removal of one more entrenchment of modesty . But as these extravagances of superstition , pride , and dress have vanished one after the other , it is perhaps no folly to expect a time when the fashion we have borrowed from a fiercer age , of spilling blood on frivolous and fantastic pretences , will seem as strange and unreasonable , as if a modern English peer were to fortify his villa , and sally out against his neighbors , in imitation of the warlike barons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the influence ascribed to it , in dispelling the lingering fooleries of knight-errantry , what a noble object awaits genius in the composition of a work of like avail against a fashion of like origin and like absurdity ! An old usage , nevertheless , is not to be dismissed merely because it is old ; and as the extraordinary pretension to violate , in this particular matter , the laws of God and the dictates of reason , has obtained widely in Christendom , our readers might suppose , from the very singularity of the thing , that it rested o* deep and stable foundations . They may , at any rate , think the case entitled to a hearing ; from which no worse consequence can follow , than that we shall at least be furnished with reasons for what to many seems a remarkable absurdity in modern manners , and likely to lessen the opinion of posterity of our sober sense . We shall even throw out of view any obligations which may seem to arise out of the law of God , as an argument which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy left to sleep in the controversy . Nor are we so idle as to address ourselves to all sorts of persons indifferently ; neither to them whose vivacity , finding no vent through the apertures of wit and fancy , necessarily flames out in the grosser element of animal courage ; nor to those impatient aspirants after fame , who delight to think themselves , as // it were , within pistol-shot of her citadel ; nor to those who have no reasonable expectation of achieving notoriety by any other path than this of the duellum . But as the sage consoled himself , that however the world might go wrong , there would always be a corner in it where a philosopher might hide ; so may we suggest to these last , that there are always fastnesses enough of rudeness and barbarity , where their single talent , now useless , nay inconvenient , in the busy mart or the polite saloon , may find its proper use in quelling spirits one degree fiei*cer than themselves ; and where they may brawl , at the worst , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is another large class of readers , to whom , though for an opposite reason , it must be equally needless to address ourselves . Many , we hope , there are , who own themselves , without shame , of too feeble or too sober a temper , to seek the bubble , reputation , ' in the pistol 's mouth , though , on proper occasion , they might in the cannon 's ; and who , regarding the fanaticism of honor as no wiser than that of religion , would think as little of building their reputation on a good shot , ' as their faith on The holy text of pike and gun . ' As their blunt perception sees not how a man 's good name is set up by his falling in his private brawl , and a corresponding soberness of fancy lays them less opeii to the accesses of jealous and fantastical punctilio , * we may reckon on them as our allies of course against the . Mouomacldsts ; ( we want a name , and this may serve as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Our concern is chiefly with that middle party , who , though they pursue not the duellum as a business , and still less as an amusement , persuade themselves that it is what they are pleased to call a necessary evil ; a bulwark between the gentleman and the rufflan ; a vindication of offences which , through the halting of justice , can not otherwise be overtaken ; and , at all events , an . ordeal that , as opinion now runs , must he undergone by every one who would keep his honor , or ( what they choose to regard as the same thing ) his courage unblemished* Though oftenreluctant champions of the point of honor , they are still less ready to be martyrs in the cause of true morals ; to which , however , it is the more important to gain them , not only as a party whose considerable numbers // would weigh down the scale in favor of good sense and public quiet , but as comprehending no small amount of virtue and just feeling . Nor were it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most painful to a good mind ; that of fighting in a cause when scarcely half convinced of its justice . As the equally valiant , and hardly less wise Sir Hudibras exclaims ; What rage , 0 citizens ! what fury Doth to these direful actions hurry ? Whatcestrum , what phrenetic mood Makes you thus lavish of your blood , Which ye are bent to throw away In vain , untriumphable fray ? ' Our barbarous ancestors themselves , from whom we derive this venerable abuse , might smile at the foolish pertinacity which retains it in circumstances so different . We do them , however , great injustice if we imagine that , in resorting to the duel , they had any view to our fantastical notion of the point of honor . ' Instead of being an offence as with us , that , notwithstanding its reception with the polite , scarcely escapes unwhipt of justice , ' it was originally ( and before chivalry had arisen to show us how symmetrical an edifice Folly can sometimes build up ) only one of the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at the truth , which , however absurd in itself , was natural to a fierce and ignorant people . A Goth or Burgundian , observing the ponderous structure of our jurisprudence at this day ; the solemn courts , the astute advocates , the thousand tomes of learning , the exquisite logic of evidence ; all adapted or intended to protect property , life , and honor , by extorting truth from its most perplexed combinations ; - would doubt whether it was in madness or in ridicule , that in questions confessedly the most delicate , we resorted to that rough trial of arms by which he had been wont to invoke the award of Heaven , in despair of eliciting truth by any process of his own . His amazement , again , would not be less , to hear that this happy method of adjusting differences was not , however , a mode of trial sanctioned by the laws , but a sort of customary privilege of flying in the face of them , in injuries of particular enormity ; especially if he learned that this vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life , was thought to prescribe no adequate penalty for a chance blow , or an opprobrious word . // If our barbarian looked a little farther into the structure of society , his astonishment at this singularity would be proportionally increased . In the same degree that he admired the diffusion and the preeminence of the arts of peace , he would be perplexed to see the worth and honor of their cultivators referred to so rough and so unapt an arbitrement . Consider , ' he might say , in how many particulars my age differed from yours , and thus conceive my surprise at their coThcidence in this . Mine was ignorant and rude . Perjury flourished at a great rate among my barbarous contemporaries ; and any caitiff might find some twenty compurgators to swear away the most notorious crime , with as little remorse as oaths , in your day and with some nations , are taken at the custom-house . On the other hand , we were busy with war , and skilless in all the arts of peace , especially in the intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought , to Heaven the discovery of truth , at least avoided confounding it by any ignorance of ours . This appeal , besides , was not quite so much an affair of chance , nor altogether so absurd as you imagine . Every one who esteemed reputation in my day , must , of necessity , seek it in war . He would therefore be familiar with the exercises of arms , and capable of defending his good name much in the same proportion that he valued it . Hence his success in combat was in some sort an evidence of his honor and his virtue ; because these among us consisted principally in bravery and skill in arms , as imbecility and cowardice were the greatest vices . Among you I perceive a quite different condition of things ; all your policy tending to peace , and the most eminent honors being reserved for the successful in its arts . Your intellectual habits , your elegant pursuits , give force to the mind at the expense of the body . Your very courage is rather civic than warlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor or virtue is called into question , instead of expecting him to establish it by a personal combat with his accuser , it might be rather less absurd that they should contend which could produce the best poem , or make the best speech , or invent the best labor-saving machine . Nay , the very selection of your weapon in such cases , betrays a certain inelegance and brutality , since skilfulness in the use of it implies neither graceful exercise of the body , nor acuteness of eye , nor presence of mind , nor , lastly , any display of courtesy and humanity in the encounter itself . The fatal bullet may be sped with the same deadly aim , against the // lightest offender in a mere punctilio , and the most culpable assassin of your happiness or fame . You therefore , in this appeal to a yet blinder chance , ought to be counted more barbarous than we ; as you must seem also more absurd , to abandon the award of laws designed with so much art and care , for the rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might our observant barbarian continue , supposing him to know something of our complex modes of trial , the giving of the lie was like your putting in the plea , and nothing more , and the ordering of the combat was like joining the issue . But if a fact were notorious in the eyes of all men ; if a man had been openly assassinated in the marketplace ; or if another had been appealed of murder , and the supposed victim presently appeared in public ; or if one challenged for a crime , visibly showed that it had been committed by the appellant himself ; in these cases our judges , though they wore no ermine , and were not the profoundest of casuists , naturally concluded the combat to be useless , and would not suffer it to proceed against the evidence of their own senses . But these wholesome and essential limitations seem quite to have slipped out of your modern code of honor . Flagrant crime may neither disqualify the criminal to challenge , nor exempt his accuser from answering his defiance . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be notoriously divorced from truth ; yet your code of honor allows him to vindicate a reputation thus certain and established , by appeal to the uncertain issue of a combat , though no one in his sober senses would trust or believe him , and the fruits of his fraud may rise palpably in brick and mortar in the streets . Nay , a man shall one day pronounce a fellow to have neither conscience nor character , and , the next , stand on points for him as his second , and hear no question of the honor of his friend . Your absurdity goes one step farther yet , in requiring a man of the most unblemished fame , if he chance to have his toes trodden on by one of these convicts by common consent , to demand of him what he is plainly unable to give , " the satisfaction of a gentleman . " These inconsistencies make me repeat involuntarily what one of your philosophers has been pleased to say of his ancestors , my contemporaries , and retort with fresh force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should rest the honor , fortune , and life of a citizen on a mere hazard ; and should resort to proofs so incapable of convicting , // that they have no connexion whatever with either inno* cence or guilt . ' " * These are the reflections of a barbarian ; but they may be worth pursuing a little farther . You would be more excusable , ' he might add , if you could plead your superstition in your behalf , and if you really believed that chance would befriend the right in these murderous encounters . You might then claim to be on a level with my barbarous predecessors , the Germans , who in their civil wars regarded the event of the first single combat , as the actual decision of Heaven ; or with your modern barbarians , the Turks , who respect as such the first victory achieved . But the codes of my own day were in other respects preferable to that by which you are pleased to regulate your concerns of honor . By the law of the Thuringians , an adulteress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ( another test of truth , which I wonder you have not retained ) , only when she could find no one to defend her . This shows that a reputation served a better purpose among them than with you . At a later day , among the Franks , a man who was weak in body , or had no taste , perhaps , for the battle , or was much occupied with affairs , might hire a champion to fight all his causes to issue , or take care of his reputa-. tion , for a time certain , and for a stipulated sum ; just as he hired a bailiff to take care of his feud . For the very reason that this was thought a bad custom among us , it would be an excellent one among a peaceable people like you . So if a criminal accused his judges of false judgment , he was obliged to fight them all . Lewis the Fat , who thought the exertion too great perhaps , even for a criminal , reformed this rule , I hear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain reputation , it might give them as much fighting as they could do in their whole lives , and make them perhaps less eager to begin . What surprises me not the least , is the importance you attach to a blow . We ourselves were not insensible to pain , and therefore punished a blow by the fine of a sou , two blows with two sons , and so on according to the extent of the injury . With you , I learn from the philosopher I have quoted before , one blow is equivalent to a hundred thousand ! This strange mode of valuation it is , no doubt , which explains the contradiction , that while you sometimes kill a man for jostling you at // the play , you think you sufficiently punish him for propagating against you the vilest slanders , by lightly laying a whip across his shoulders . ' Our observer would be hardly the wiser , at least not the better convinced , were he told , as he might be by some grave antiquary , that these niceties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin in the chivalrous age ; that as he who had once engaged his word , was not allowed in the judicial proceedings of the barbarous times , to retract it without a penalty , so , in the fantastical period which succeeded , to be even accused of what was in fact a legal offence , might well be accounted a gross insult . That anciently only villains fought on foot , and with a batoon , instead of on horseback , and with a lance ; hence to be struck with a stick , or on certain parts of the body , came afterwards to be deemed an especial affront to gentility . The like exception was taken to a box on the ear , because a knight never fought with his face uncovered . This , ' he might reply , explains well enough the origin of these punctilios , but seems no just excuse for sustaining them by such disproportionate penalties . Besides , the age you appeal to , was as fantastical as yours is sober . A knight-errant would now be encaged in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken to have lost his wits ; even a tournament would be likely to be dispersed by the peace-officers , with " the power of the county . " At least limit this peculiar privilege of the gentleman to such as , by the more ancient rules of chivalry , would have been entitled to the honors of the tourney ; to him that is of gentle blood by four descents at the least , and can display a legitimate coat-armor , not placed at random on the pannels of his coach by his coachmaker . Deny it , by the same rule , to any that has blasphemed God , or offended the ladies ; is wanting in courtesy , or is false to his word , to gratitude or honor ; has deserted his comrade in a difficulty , or assailed his enemy without warning , or by indirect means despoiled him of his estate . Put all these without the pale of the field of honor , and the enviable privilege of jousting in it , might safely be entrusted to those who would remain . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the code of honor , as it subsisted in the high and palmy state ' of its empire , it is but fair to inquire how far it consists , as now reformed , with the peace and dignity of society . We shall be pardoned for pursuing this inquiry somewhat discur // sively , for the same reason that regular tactics are laid aside in a guerilla warfare ; as , to say the truth , we hardly know on what point of reason our antagonists make head , or on which to direct our attack . Yet as we may daily observe many otherwise judicious persons running the risk of being shot through the body , or actually losing their lives , to the great detriment*f their affairs , and the yet greater discomfort and grief of their families ; it were unfair to set them down for mad , without some formal inquest of the motives which prompt them thus to set their lives at a pin 's point . ' If our men of honor , in shooting an adversary through the head , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something in this passion quite inconsistent with the generosity we are wont to ascribe to a gentleman , we might set down the usage to the account of this , one of the blindest and most headlong of our propensities . But that this were an error as regards a great portion of them , may appear from the great placableness of the combatants , who , on the least blood drawn , and often on the expenditure of a certain amount of gunpowder , are seen to forgive imputations which ( had they been better marksmen ) might have been washed away in blood ; to say nothing of those , who , the usage apart , are heartily disposed to let pass both the affront and the revenge . The generosity evinced on these occasions may indeed be deemed excessive . For as in polite society , all who are admitted are , for the time , on a footing of equality , so among such as are admitted to the privilege of the duellum ( as the worthy Baron of Bradwardine calls it ) , considerations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain or compromise , seem to be wholly lost sight of . Thus he who , with the loss of life , would lose , at the same time , the highest fortune and the largest honors , is no more considered than his antagonist , who may have nothing to lose in this world , either in fortune or good name . We submit to our court of honor the hardship of this case . In this wager of baftle , the stakes should be equal ; and though for ordinary purposes a good appearance and a polite address may well enough pass a man for a gentleman , some stricter qualification might seem not unreasonable , to entitle him to draw blood in these honorable encounters . But were one ever so blindly intent on revenge , he could not be quite insensible to the treacherous part , which the world // plays on these occasions ; first , like the author of all eiril , seducing him into the mischief , and then abandoning him without consolation to its bitter fruits . For however tyrannical it be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this martyrdom in what it calls the cause . of honor and good man-. ners , we do not find that it reserves for the zealots *f its faith any of the honors of the martyr* Instead of payi* the price of blood with extraordinary suffrages of its respect , thus applying those outward unctions by which the inward smart of conscience is sometimes appeased , it plays the part of a great personage to his bravo , whose mercenary murders are rewarded with ill dissembled aversion . In this point of view , the wholesale murderers of the species , soldiers of fortune and conquering kings , are many times more fortunate and prudent , as they either bind the vulgar opinion to their victorious car , or defy it in the insolence of power . Our . Jlionomachist , on the contrary ( and the better man he is , the more inevitable is this result ) , pines through the world , with the mark of blood on hisbrow , **39;310;TOOLONG life . The bloody passage in his history is indeed , by the common consent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , not oblivious . The very caution with which all allusion to it is avoided , awakes the jealous remorse , which slumbers , another Argus , with open eyes in his bosom . The ignorant regard him with such superstition as they feel near the ruin which tradition has stained with crime ; the wiser , with such ; a respect at best , as the ancients attached to spots which had been stricken with thunder . The warmest defence that is made of him ( for an apology is no less required by the inconstancy of opinion , for having struck the blow , than for failing to strike it ) seldom goes beyond what is to be found in the common turn of expression ; If ever a man was justified in. fighting , it was he ; ' a dreadful doubt indeed , in a case which is irreparable . The wretch , who can be callous to these significations of the natural sentiment , must be left to the scourge of a more awful tribunal . We will not ask what part conscience takes meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secret chest , she consoles the martyr for the censure of the populace ; * or , her whispers growing more audible as the voice of the world is remote , she plays through life the per // plexed casuist ; weighing the extreme revenge against the frivolous provocation , the code of honor against the law of God and of the land , the breath of opinion against the stifled sighs of remorse . But we have insensibly grown serious . This examination might turn out more satisfactorily to our casuist , if he could always array some substantial wordly good gained , against this unquietness of his conscience . But it happens strangely and unluckily , that while he may , nay , often must incur this bloodguiltiness for some light punctilio , he can not decently nor safely either , by means of it , protect his estate , or rid himself of an inconvenient rival , or revenge even the more serious injuries to his good fame . This summary justice may indeed fur ever put it out of a rude fellow 's power to jostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the play ; but he must betake him to the vulgar tribunals of justice to exculpate himself from a charge of overreaching in a bar .. gain , or forging a deed , or making way with a will . As it seems , then , that our law of honor either goes too far , or not far enough , those that feel themselves under compulsion to obey it , ought to bethink them of extending its jurisdiction to more important matters . The professed Fire-Eater himself might bave some reason for his taste , if by a fortunate kit he could regain the reputation , which no other known act of his life has perhaps given him the least claim to ; or by taking the life of one man of probity , could win or enforce the opinion of the rest . But it is the defect of this sort of argument , rigorous as it may appear , that though sometimes necessary , it seems , to support an established reputation , that indeed to reason requires no such supererogatory proof , it is never imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The common understanding is not so depraved as to give him credit for more than hardiness of nerve and precision of eye . The most it can do for an infirm character , is to stifle the loudness of reproach , and give a conscious scoundrel the satisfaction of knowing , that all people think him a dirtier fellow than they care to express . We have seen some of these bullies in our time , walking like the pestilence at noon-day , ' and reading contempt and hate so much the more visibly in the eyes of all , for that they forbore to give them tongue . But nothing shows this folly in a stronger light , or more forcibly displays the tyranny of opinion , than a reflection vOL. xxvI. - NO. 59. 65 // 510 Duelling . April which must occur to every wise observer of life . How few of the best of us can hope to unite all suifrages in our favor , or have our . actions justly scanned , much less our sentiments truly appreciated ! And as this arises not seldom out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause of the crowd is often as little to be desired as to be hoped . A man of sense and spirit , therefore , may sometimes , without either insolence or pride , take no displeasure from knowing that he is obnoxious to the vulgar censure , and might doubt the reality of that virtue which found no enemies . I hate him because he is just , ' is no paradox to him who has observed how . constantly vice feels itself , as it were , reproached by virtue . From what weakness , then , or inconsistency in our nature is it , that a man , thus careless of the censure of the million , shall sometimes go to buffets with a single slanderer from the crowd . Yet this same individual , should he happen to be eminent in power or place , or to lead the front of party , or to embark on the fret*-ful sea of a political canvass , endures with wonderful fortitude all the slanders against his patriotism and his honesty , and hears himself , with a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our modern history furnishes some iilstances , indeed , where those , who , at the same moment , were shaking Europe with the terror of their arms , or wielding it by their policy , have descended to play the champion in this lesser field ; which seems about as ridiculous , by the way , as if Cicero had challenged a conscript father for reflecting on his birth , or Mark Antony had sent a card to the author of the Philippics . ' If there is a conspicuous absurdity in these pugnacious ebullitions of the great , who , confiding to the judgment of mankind the higher acts and motives of their lives , can descend to settle points with some obscure antagonist ; the folly of those is not less , who , in a lower sphere of action , have the wit to estimate justly the opinion of the crowd , without the civic courage to resist , in this matter , its fantastical requisitions . From all these inconsistencies one would really be tempted to conclude , that the punctilio , which we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of thinking , retained because men have not yet been at the pains to reflect on its whole absurdity , is a kind of maniacal infusion into the otherwise sober temperament of the age ; such as is sometimes seen in the constitution of individuals , and is depicted in the worthy // knight of La Mancha , the last specimen of a like folly , a little more preposterous . That ingenious refiner , the author of the Spirit of Laws , ' informs us , that honor is the principle of monarchies . That honor , as he describes it , is somewhat fantastical , mixed up , if we understand him , of artificial punctiliousness , ambition of dignities , and jealousy of personal bravery ; all admirably adapted to make subjects revolve round the sovereign as the fountain of honors , and join cause with him against the plebeian orders of the state ; tomake the gentleman a creature of modes and caprices ; and sustain a warlike nobility , always prompt for the schemes of ambitious conquest . To encourage , at least not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sort of wisdom in kings , who thus regard their subjects as so many pageants in the array of pomp , or so many brute instruments in the mat&amp;iel of war . But as our institutions require no such artificial distinction of the gentleman from the commonalty , nor the training of a mere soldiery , it is the less necessary to abuse and distort reason , with any view of policy , or foster a sentiment which has no true foundation in nature . Better and nobler that sentiment of the . Romans , which decreed a crown to him , who had saved the life of a citizen ; a sentiment yet more just among us , where , . by the spirit of our laws , he is part of the majesty of the state , and where , through the happiness of our circumstances , it is his rational , not his brute properties , that are required for its service . If European rulers look on government as a game , played for their diversion , and where all the pieces are of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher combinations of chess , where their values are different , and where they should be sacrificed with some reference to these respectively . Now our code of honor listens to none of these distinctions ; but absurdly proceeds as if all men were rationally as well as politically equal . This leads us to say a word to the gentlemen of our army and navy , whom we can by no means except from the influence of these considerations , nor hold excused for risking , in private brawl , the life which belongs more peculiarly to their country . Courage is not , as it might have been considered in a barbarous age , so exclusively the praise of a soldier , that it must be demonstrated at all risks , even at the expense of patriotism and conscience ; and that it can not be let to sleep , // 512 April , in scorn of the silly or the brawling , till , like my uncle Toby 's , proper occasion calls it forth . ' It is not in peal*e , that the sword is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be drawn , at any rate , on every light occasion , any more than a man of breeding thinks of disturbing the current of social discourse , with trenchant arguments and sturdy logic . Yet if the raw recruit , whose sword is yet unfieshed , persists in re*. ferring his courage to this doubtful proof , the veteran of many battles has no such excuse ; for at least the ambition of acting on this poor field , ought to be understood as an acknowledge. * ment , that the combatant has never had and never expects to have the honor of acting on a better . We shall here conclude with some suggestions for the con* consideration of those especially , who honestly think this barba .. rous usage is in some strange manner one of the guards and defences of our modern refinement ; a class of thinkers the more likely to perpetuate the abuse , for the reason , that the errors of a man of virtue are always of the most dangerous example . It must be allowed , in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser morals , that it gives the . advantage precisely to those who most require to be awed into civility . The temper which is prone to insult and outrage , has thus the farther satisfaction of making amends after its own fashion , and of blowing out a man 's hrains as a compensation for having trod on his toes . The sensibility , in the other hand*r which most avoids contention , brawl , and contumely , must find/ the least pleasure in exacting this rigorous penalty . Thus the absurdity is involved , of making champions for decorum out of the very persons most likely to violate it , which is not much wiser than making the town-watch out of the thieves and vagrants . How apt these Pratorian bands in the empire of honor are to turn their arms against their own sovereign , needs no better proof than what our author has furnished us in his sketches of Irish society , where the order seems to have been less , as the champions were many . Nor , perhaps , will some parts of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve our argument less ; where not only these conservators of social quiet are more numerous , but the arms they carry are more effective . It should follow that our civility ought to increase as we travel towards the frontier , and the pistol gives way to the musket or the rifle . // It may , in the next place , strike the observant , that the affairs of honor have by no means increased , but greatly diminished in Christendom , during this age . We have the can dor to own that this is susceptible of two explanations ; first , that we are in reality , as our grandfathers assure us , much behind our predecessors in all the courtesies and arts of life ; or , secondly , that by the excellent practice of duelling , the world is at length so reduced into politeness , that fewer occasions now offer for its exercise . This last reason seems the more agreeable of the two , as it holds out a hope of our presently dispensing with it altogether . It is certain , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen of that day oftener whipped out their blades in coffee-houses , as they were also more used to put modest women out of countenance , and stagger drunk into their presence . Such a revolution , like all others , must be supposed to have cost as much blood as wit . At present , too , the most delicate affair ' may be settled by the principals alone . A century ago , the seconds were expected in courtesy to take part ; and in an age yet ruder , before the duellunz had yet time , we suppose , to display aH its benign effect , whole families , Montagues , and Capulets , on both sides , were fairly engaged on these honorable occasions . Again , as it is the aim of the courteous Monomachist to draw the least possible blood that will satisfy his honor , the greatest civility and good manners ought , by this rule , to reside in those baser classes of society , who practise a more bloodless monomachy , stripping on the instant insult , and boxing their antagonists into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this mode of combat gives the advantage to the strong or active pugilist , instead of the skilful marksman , since of the two , the former art is the more promotive of health and beauty in its possessor , and less apt to be fatal to his antagonist . Our polite neighbors , the English , are so sensible of this , that gentlemen of condition promote pugilism by all means , and even learned judges look complacently on a mode of reasoning which Cicero , in his Roman rudeness , thought proper to beasts . Even assassination itself may be thought to have this advantage over our honorable murder , that it is obliged to go covertly like a villain in the dark , instead of assuming , as it were , the port of a gentleman , and stalking , like the latter , in open daylight . We have never heard , for instance , of any law among the Italians or Portuguese , enjoining on their dignitaries // to swear , that they had never committed an assassination ; whereas some of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial of murder ; as at a Botany Bay assembly , as the jest runs , it is the rule , that none shall cbeat at cards , or pick any of the company 's pocket , for that time . Lastly , we should be glad to know by what change of the principles of human action it falls out , that the forbearance which we heroically applaud in a pagan , we treat as cowardice and dishonor in a christian . The Strike , but hear , ' not only reads as well in English as in Greek , but seems no more out of place in a modern than a classical republic ; besides according with a christian maxim which may be known to some readers . Moreover , it consists entirely with the sentiments of that common reason , which still breaks out from the deepest and most fantastical clouds of popular error . But whether our readers shall agree with us or not , that the sort of honor we have been considering , is , like Falstaff 's , a mere scutcheon , ' our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . '
