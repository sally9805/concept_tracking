txt /q/ Happily , however , these times have now passed away , never again to return . We now hear of no odious distinctions between one set of our citizens and another . The second war with Britain had the happy effect of uniting many , who before . were , divided , flu#l at the last treaty of peace , all good men were as astounded , as they were /z/ delighted , at the unexpected and abundant harvest of glory which was gathered for us in that war , and party and political animosity , in the aggravated forms in- which they once existed , to the reproach of our country , has ever since gradually subsided and settled down into better feelings . The last Presidential election was of a character to revive and to excite party feeling , and the approaching one indicates , that there will be abundance of it brought to the contest . But yet it is not the envenomed feeling which once divided our people ; and when we consider the , magnitude of the contest and the exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is not more of excitement . To us , in South-Carolina , it is an especial cause of congratulation , that on the subject of the last and the approaching Presidency , we have been nearly unanimous , and that we are able , for the first time in our history since the inauguration of Gen. Washington to the first honors of the Republic , to view men and measures with a dispassionate and an ' unprejudiced eye . The present is an era amongst us , in which we are all satisfied to forget and forgive our old bitter dissentions as Federalists and Republicans , and to regard merit and long services as the only legitimate claim to the favour and patronage of the people . It is in this delightful , and comparatively calm state of the public feeling , as calm as it can ever be expected to be , consistently with the freedom of our institutions ; when we are in the full enjoyment of the blessings of peace , and with no prospect of their being inter* rupted from abroad ; when each State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when men are more disposed to look rationally and dispassionately into every subject connected with the welfare of the State ; it is this period which I seize to address you on subjects of most vital importance to you as citizens of South Carolina , and to arouse you to a just and lively sense of the dangers that threaten your temporal prosperity and your domestic quiet . And in so doing , I ask of all who may peruse this and the succeeding numbers , to believe me sincere when I say , that 1 am not hitched to the car of any one set of politicians . At the last election , I was the advocate neither of Adams , or Crawforu , or Clay , and when I gave my free and unbiassed vote for the hero of New- Orleans , it was not because J thought even this man , who has so " nobly filled the measure of his country 's glory , " as likely to avert the dangers that have long thickened around South-Carolina ; but my vote was on political grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain at the present moment . But I beg in the outset to repeat , that as clear and as distinct as is my preference for Gen. Jackson , yet my honest conviction is , that it will make no difference in the deplorable situation and prospects of the Southern States , whether Jackson or Adams shall be called to preside over us . The dangers that threaten us are not attributable to Mr. Adams . They come from a period more distant than the recent era of his inauguration into power . They are dangers Which will approach nearer and nearer to us , under every future Administration , and unless we take some decisive measures to shield ourselves , they must , in due time , bring us to ruin . In my remarks on this subject , I shall fearlessly speak the truth and the whole truth  --  I have no motive beyond my county 's good . I never did , nor do I now seek office or honors . My feelings , I confess , are more sectional than they are national . " Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not , because I am insensible to the glory and the proud distinction of the American name , but because I believe that to the predominance of these feelings above all others , we are in future to look for the preservation of . Southern interests and Southern safety . no. 2 . The subject which ought at this moment , to claim the attention of Yery South-Carolinian , is the tendency of the government to wards a firm consolidated national government . This is no idle speculation . It is not a phantom which exists in the distempered minds of the weak , the timid , or the suspicious . It is not even the cry by which aspiring demagogues would climb into popular favour . But it has been for years past , the rational and the well settled apprehension of sober and reflecting men amongst us ; of men who soar far above the unworthy , and the selfish motives of office hunters . It will be found to exist in the minds of some of our best and wisest men , and daily becomes to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Congress claims and exercises powers , nev  --  r contemplated by the framers of the Constitution of the United States , ' they are alarmed , and justly alarmed for the situation of the Southern country , whose safety they feel to consist in the thtegrity and sovereignty of the individual States . And well may they be alarmed . Within the last six or seven years , Congress has made more rapid strides towards consolidation , than in the thirty previous years During the whole period of the Federal Administrations , and of the Administrations of Messrs . Jefeebson and Madison , nothing ever occurred , of a nature similar to the attempts now made , to extend the powers of Congress , to almost every subject , which relates to the internal order and government of the States . Anxious as were the Federalists , to give strength and efficiency to a government then in its infancy , and to diminish the embarrassment which they erroneously thought it would experience from the State sovereignties , yet no decided system of measures was ever brought forward , threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued by Congress . When the Bill to establish the first Bank of the United States , was before Congress in 1791 , and the implied powers of Congress in relation to this subject considered , there was then no settled design amongst its friends , to lay a foundation , upon which they were to commence and continue to raise , great and extensive powers to the government . Had there been any such design , the manner in which the subject was discussed , and the great division of sentiment in Congress and in the Cabinet , was of itself sufficient to forbid a hope of continued and constant success . There were specious arguments to shew the expediency , at that time , of a Rational Bank , and the necessity of such an institution , ' as a meaMfe /z/ adapted to the end of the government in the collection and distribution ot its revenue . The decision , however , has been a most unfortunate one for the country ; for thus was the foundation laid for augmenting , by construction , the powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstructure of implied powers been recently commenced , not by a Federal , but strange to say , by the Republican Administration of Mr. Monroe , which , if continued to be carried on , with the spirit and the industry manifested within the last five years , will very soon place our National Councils on an eminence of power , that will cause the Southern States to tremble for their safety . It is here to be remarked , that in the long interval between the establishment of the Bank , and the accession of Mr. Monroe to the Presidency , there were occasionally , exercises of power by Congress which were not constitutional , but they were not of a nature to alarm . The most prominent of these for its unconstitutionality , and about which there was no difference of opinion , was the remarkable vote of $100,000 for the relief of the distressed inhabitants of Caraccas , after its earthquake . No man would now rise in Congress , and say , that this appropriation was for " the general welfare of the people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done without reflection , and sprung from that laudable warmth of feeling and sympathy , which we all , in and out of Congress , possessed at the time the news of such an overwhelming calamity reached us.  - -  There were also in the Administrations of Mr. Jefeerson and Mr. Madison , appropriations for roads in the Western country ; but with the exception of that for the great Cumberland road , these appropriations were trifling . Upon the last mentioned road , upwards of a million of dollars had been expended . It was in Mr. Jefferson 's Administration , that this road was proposed to be opened , but the manner in which that measure was recommended by that statesman , evinced that he doubted the constitutional power of Congres to construct it . I pass over the sedition law  --  it caused the downfal of the men who passed it . But it was during the Administration of Mr* Monroe , that a bold and decided system was determined on in our country The subjects of tariffs and internal improvement being earnestly recommended by the President to Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation , for which the Constitution had provided , and having , in fact , little or nothing to do , being in a state of peace and friendship with all nations , was glad to hear , of new subjects , on which to exercise its powers , and at length resolved , that it could construct military and other national roads , make canals , improve inland navigation , promote manufactures , and appropriate money to any extent , for . the purpose of promoting , what they would call , the general interests of the States . A new field of power has thus been opened to Congress , as boundless as space itself . Alt the guards which the framers of the Constitution , and the State Legislatures had cautiously provided , to keep the General Government within its prescribed and limited powers , have been discovered to be utterly useless . There is na /z/ Measure which concerns the general Welfare , immediately , or most remotely , which Congress does not feel itself at liberty to adopt . To many it may appear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions on the constructive powers of the government first commenced in Congress in 1791 , the opposition was not confined , as at present it is , to any particular section of the country . The solution ; however , is not difficult . The new constitution at that time , had not long been in operation . Its adoption , it is wejl known , had been most zealously opposed in every part of the union , and particularly by the largest States in the North and in the South . The two parties which had divided the country on the question of the constitution , had not then entirely died away , but from them were furnished those elements , which , in connection with the effect of the French Revolution upon the public- feelings of our citizens , gave rise in a very short time afterwards to those twopolitical parties , the Federalists and Democrats of the United States . Distributed as were the friends and adherents of one or other of these parties , which were then in their infancy , but which afterwards became so distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was natural that the advocates and opponents of the Bank , or of any other national measure , should come from every quarter of the Union . But now that these political parties have passed away , and the people of each State begin to think of their own affairs , and in what way they can best promote their local prosperity by improvements amongst themselves , we observe , that in the Northern , Eastern , Middle , and Western States , the people have no fears whatever from the exercise of the implied powers of Congress on any subject ; but it is in the South alone where uneasiness begins to manifest itself , and a sensitiveness prevails on the subject of consolidation . The cause is obvious . The more National , and the less Federal , the Government becomes , the more certainly will the interest of the great majority of the States be promoted , but with the same certainty , will the interests of the South be depressed and destroyed . Seeing , as we all do , the subject at this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animosity , but through the medium of truth , we must perceive at a glance , that the interests of the North and West , are diametrically opposed to the interests of the South , and that to this cause and this alone , are we to ascribe the general acquiescence of the great body of the people of the U. in the alarming progress of the General Government to con* solidation. wo . 3 . With all the advances of the government to consolidation , there is no man who at present apprehends , that it would venture , in our day , to encroach upon any of the acknowledged rights expressly reserved to the States . It would not presume to claim the appointment of the officers of the militia ; or the authority to train them ; or to infringe upon- the right of the people in any state to bear arms ; or to make any law respecting an establishment of religion , or pro- /z/ faibhing the free exercise of religion ; nor would it attempt to abolish the trial by jury On these and other subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present danger of encroachment* The people of the North as well as of the South , are materially interested in . the preservation of all these essentials of liberty , and in the present state of society and of public opinion , it would be difficult to conceive that the government could even feel the desire to encroach upon the rights of State sovereignty , expressly reserved . The flame that would instantly be excited from one end of the Union to the other , by the undivided feeling of the public , is the surest pledge for the security of all these . But far different will be the public feeling , where no vital principle of State government , or individual liberty , is involved in the measures of Congress , however clearly unconstitutional such measures may be . Should it happen that the usurpation of the government solely operates upon great and important pecuniary interests , and is founded on no open , palpable breach of an article in the Constitution , forbidding the exercise of the particular power claimed , but claimed merely as a power naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , the public feeling in each State will be formed and fashioned exactly as the measure shall affect its puculiar interests . If , by the usurped power , any new stimulus will be given to the internal commerce , enterprise or industry of any one State , or number of States , or great local interests are thereby to be promoted , their statesmen and politicians will not be astute to inquire , whether the measure will be in strict conformity with the acknowledged principles on which the compact of the States was founded , or within the clear intent and meaning of the compact itself , but will rather be disposed to overlook all considerations of the kind . The States , on the other hand , whose prosperity will be retarded or impaired by the contemplated measure , will be found in opposition to it . In the measures of the Congress for many years past , the people in some sections of the Union , indeed the majority of the people of the United States , have perceived a system of policy , which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular States , and to carry them forward to aggrandizement , and to wealth . In another portion of the country , it promises to dry up the sources of their prosperity , and to bring on premature decay . For a discordance in the public sentiment so unhappy , and in a conflict of paramount interests so serious , I know of no peaceable remedy , unless Congress shall magnanimously retrace its steps and consent to carry on the government in future , upon the principles , and in the spirit in which it was so happily formed . But is this probable ? Let us not , my fellow-citizens , indulge in a hope which , however pleasing , must in the end prove fallacious . Let us only look to things as they are . To the North of the Potomac , and to the East and West of the Alleghany , what cause have the people to tremble at , or what possible motive to change , the measures or the policy of the government ? What constructive power /z/ can Congress claim to exercise , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury 1 I can conceive none . In domestic manufactures and in monopolies , they see their local interests cherished and fostered by the protecting and the powerful influences and resources of the whole nation . In internal improvements , they see that obstructions in their rivers are about to be removed , and new means of communication proposed , which are to open to the Middle and the Western States new and most profitable channels of commerce , and the cost of which is to be defrayed from the National Treasury , whilst we in the South , who furnish such means and such a revenue to the government , are to enjoy from that government no other advantage than protection from an external enemy . The interest of the North and West consists , therefore , in Usurpa* Hon , and a departure from the social compact . The interest of the South , in the preservation of that compact . The interest of the . North and West , is , that the government should become more and more National . The interest of the South , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of expediency and self interest , must for ever support every inordinate exercise of power , on the ground of construction or implication . The South , from considerations of primary interest and of safety , must for ever oppose the implied powers of Congress . But the North and the West constitute the majority of the nation . That majority must increase with every new census , and with the prospect of its being at some future day overwhelming , where shall we look confidently for the hope , that the government is to be arrested in the unconstitutional and arbitrary exercises of its power , when such exercises of power serve to gratify the feelings and promote the interests of that majority . In the claim to do any act , which in the opinion of Congress , can " piomotc the general welfare , " can it be conceived ; how , or in what way , the general government cuii ever come in collision with Northern views and Northern interests . Not , certainly , by a mode of taxation , by which we in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we buy or when we sell . Not , certainly , when their rivers are to be opened , and canals cut in every direction through their Stales , without any expense to themselves . Not , certainly , by the enormous expenditure and circulation of money , which is to arise from the appropriations which are constantly making for some new purposes , unknown to the constitution . Not , certainly , by any interference in their domestic and internal policy , to which the e never cau be a possible inducement . But how different is it with , the South . We hear of no project in Congress to tax the manufactures of the North , to support the agriculture of the South- We , indeed , aTe told of internal improvements , but to witness them we must travel Northwardly . We annually throw into the Treasury of the Nation from our Custom House , hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars , to be distributed and disbursed for the benefit of all the States . But for this rich remittance we receive nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no Navy Yard to repair the smaller vessels of the Navy , to which we contribute so much , and when we ask for one it is refused . If a ship 's boat is to be built , or a sail repaired , neces* sity alone would cause it to be done here : all must be done in Northern ports . We know the general government , not by the kindnesses which it practises towards us , but by the taxes and the tribute money , that it incessantly demands of us . Whilst we are at peace with all the world , and with no rational prospect , that there ever can be madness enough again in any foreign power to meddle with us , we are told of the preparations and measures " to provide for the common defence . 9 ' We are reminded by Congress of the facility which ought , in case of war , to exist for the transporting of troops and munitions of war , and that these facilities are best promoted by great National and Military Roads and Canals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , where the population is compact and dense , and where invasion is impracticable , we do indeed sec United States ' Engineers every where at work , and busy in their attempts to take summit levels , even on the Alleghany Mountains , and mighty projects are every where on foot . But , if we turn to the Southern Border , which is the weak and the vulnerable point of attack for a foreign enemy , easiest of access in time of war , with bad roads , and no facilities , but with every difficulty as to the transportation of troops , and artillery , and heavy ordnance : we shall there see no Navy Yards , no Military Roads , no Canals . What has brought about all this ? The answer is  --  Usurpation and Consolidation . Congress is exercising powers which belong ; not to it , and if the Southern States continue to acquiesce as they ; hitherto have done , in the Tariffs , Internal Improvements , and other schemes of the Northern People to improve their country at our expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " hewers of wood and drawer- of water , " and we may discover that under the phraseology of the term " general welfare " in the Constitution , Congress may be propelled by the public opinion of the North , to regulate our domestic policy . Let the People look to it . This is not fancy  - -  The idea is serious with many and the time perhaps is not very distant . It rests with ourselves only to place it at what distance we please . By firmness we stand  --  by concession wb pall . jvoT* . It is not only on the subject of Tariffs andjnternal Improvements that the people in the four great divisions of the United States are divided in sentiment . It is our misfortune that we differ on points ten thousand times ten thousand more important , than all that has been discuesed in Congress . We are , and we must be , in perpetual conflict with our Northern friends , on a point of most vital importance to our security and comfort as a society , to our prosperity as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To believe that this conflict of feeling can ever cease , is egregiously to deceive ourselves ; and to conceal our opinions , when we do not believe it , is to deceive other ? . Nature , education , prejudice and feeling , have /z/ drawn . a strongly marked line of distinction between the North and the South . It may be delightful for us , to talk of our being as one family , the members of which are mutually affectionate and kind. - frThe patriot may dwell with extacy on the thought , and our orator* ; and poets may make it the constant subject of their themes and qC their songs . But the idea exists , only in the imaginations of those who Jove to indulge in the pleasing illusions of fancy . It is notfounded in truth We are an united people it is true  --  but we are , family united only for external objects ; for our common defence , and for the purpose of a common commerce ; sharing , in com mop , the daaigers and privations of war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been crowned , when wielded in the defence uf our liberties and our independence . The wise framers of our Con*- , stitution , never designed or contemplated more than this . When they met together in convention , they brought with them opposite sentiments , and they represented a people , whose pursuits , occupations , and interests varied , according to the section of the country in which they lived . They were aware of a substantial distinction as to interest between the States . It was in Convention that Mr. Madison declared , that " the great danger to the general government , was the great Southern and Northern interests of the continent being opposed to each other . Look to the votes in Congress , and most of them stand divided by the geography of the country , not according to the size of the States . " As opposite too as were our feelings , yet as regards these , we were then in our Halcyon days . Though our sentiments and our policy were not in accordance with the views of pur Northern friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fanaticism , that morbid sense of humanity , or that vituperation and constant vulgar abuse of Southern institutions , which now prevails .  - -  Judging of the future by the past , and one and all believing that the Constitution would bind us together in firmer friendship , and cause us to approximate in kind feeling , rather than to diverge , we con-. sented to the Union upon terms , which time and experience , and the decisions of the Supreme Cou it of the United States , daily prove to be disadvantageous to us in the extreme . We have been deceived in all our expectations on this head . The good feeling upon which we then relied , has vanished . Instead of approximating in a friendly and liberal feeling , as we advance in our history , we approximate only for conflict and collision . Year after year , Congress proclaims its omnipotence by some new usurpation ; year after year , new presses vomit forth their anathemas against our systems , and their reviews and periodical journals , edited by the first talents of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Insurrectionary doctrines are promulgated in a thousand ways , even from the Pulpits of the Ministers of the Gospel of Peace . Our jealousy of the North has , in consequence , been augmented ten and an hundred fold to what it was ; and considering , the present stte of the world , and the unceasing extravagance and tenden cy of public opinion , to interfere with the policy which , feeds and eus- /z/ / tains us wild Wegrets thrit there is such a jealousy t Wnatf can preserve us ' but constant jealousy ? What but a sensitiveness on ' the subject of these our rights ; so acute , as Jo burst forth into a general flame of excitement and indignation , the moment these rights are touched by unhallowed hands : what but this can save us from the ? mighty arm of such a destroyer , as the Congress of the United States must and will be , with no other limitation to its powers than its will , and with no restraint but its discretion ? Will confidence in our Northern friends give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tame and a quiet submission to usurpation upon usurpation , give us any- claim upon Congress ? Will it exempt us from further tribute money ? Or will it lessen the perpetual disposition which ex* ists to interfere with our peculiar policy , as evidenced by such constant expression of the public sentiment of the North , in and out of their State Legislatures ? No , my fellow-citizens , no ! It is the apathy and indifference of our citizens , on the subject of the encroachments of Congress on the rights of the States , which has invited the aggressions already made upon our rights of property , and it is apathy on our part , which will strengthen the unceasing efforts of the Northern folks to tax us still more , and in due course of time to extirpate from the body politic , what is regarded by them as a crying evil and as a canker . It is apathy that will tempt them more and more to trample to the dust the Federal Constitution , and with it the hopes and the safety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nourished the avarice and false philanthropy and fanatacism of the North . Apathy , in a word , must ultimately lead to events , that will dissolve the Union : but firmness and con* Stant jealousy in the South will preserve it . 1 am not insensible that these sentiments , and this train of feeling , may hot be approved by all . It may well suit such passengers on board , as have no interest in the cargo , and whose hopes and fears are not identified with the perilous ship , to rely upon their own activity , and their ability at any time to seize upon the boats , and secure their safety . It may suit such as these , not to be alarmed at the present aspect of affairs , and to denounce as alarmists , those who would warn their fellow-men of their danger . But to many of us , whose property and whose helpless fsmilies are all embarked , and who have no means of escape , and no hopes of safety , but in the prudence and skill of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully watch the coming and the howling of the tempest . It is the misfortune of South-Carolina , that there are too many amongst us already , who do not feel on this subject , as the crisis demands-* too many politicians who feel it their policy and their interest , to frown , down any thing in the nature of sectional feeling , as if our existence as a State , does not depend upon sectional feeling alone , and that of the most ardent kind . I am not one of those desponding mortals who think , that the system of the South must ultimately , and as a matter of course , give way to the daring attacks in preparation against them ; and I envy not those , who by instilling in conversation such sentiments into the /z/ common mind , would unnerve the public arm . I fear nothing from Without  --  the enemy is amongst ourselves , and let us only discover and remove from our confidence the promulgators of such opinions , and I think I know enough of my fellow-citizens to believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to their common sftfety and their dearest interests , our neighbours , the people of the North , will discover , that we are not like dependent West India Colonists , with no arm to lean upon , but that of an unnatural parent  - -  but , that we are amply furnished with the means of protecting ourselves , and of perpetuating our policy under any emergency , and without needing any assistance from them . svoTa . We have seen , that the people of the North and the South are influenced by interests and feelings as opposite in their character as the two poles are asunder , and the motives which would incline the former to support the general government in all its advances to usurped power by means of construction or implication , must compel the latter as a matter of necessity and self-existence , to resist it . The idea of resistance of any one State , or number of States , to the acts and the measures of the government , is a measure that can never be contemplated but with pain . It is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the expectations of the patriots who founded our Republic ; so repugnant to the feel* ings of every lover of his country , and of every friend to the civil liberties of mankind , which seem to hang upon the destinies of these States , that there are few of us , who would not be willing to ekhaust to the dregs , the cup of remonstrance and conciliation , rather than put at hazard the peace of the Union , if by reasonable concession we could preserve it . The union of the States is the prosperity and safety of the States . It is in Union , that our agriculture flourishes , and our commerce $C enlivens and whitens every sea  --  it is by Union , that we take our high rank among the nations of the earth . In Union has our army , in the two Punic wars , gathered its harvest of laurels ! and in Union has our star spangled banner waved our fame into every land , and our brave tars wrested the trident from the proud Mistress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious hope of perpetuating those principles which have been , and will continue to be a light to lighten mankind to their rights and to their liberties . But Union , with all its blessings ; with the protection it gives to agriculture ; wth the riches that it brings to our commerce ; with tht defence it provides for our country ; and with the deeds that it records , and the achievements it emblazons on the proud tablet of our history  --  - these , and all these , can not be dearer to us , than those great and fundamental principles of American libegy , for which our lathers toiled and bled . The usurpations and tyranny of GreatBritain were not resisted , that the Colonies might be United ; bus that the Colonies might be free . A common danger inspired the illustrious Patriots of the Revolution , with a common and a cerre*- tf6 ' ponding feeling , afod wfcen before the Supreme Judge of the world they resolved to dissolve the political connection with the mother country , they solemnly declared , that they were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Confederation recognized each State as " retaining its sovereignty , freedom and independence ; " and in entering into the present ' Federal Union , great as are the powers delegated to the Federal Government , yet the sovef reignty and independence of the States is still preserved . It has been well remarked , that the present Union " is distinguished from the Confederation , not so much the increase of powers conferred on it , as by the in vigor ati on of those before possessed . 1 * With the exception , indeed , of the new power to regulate commerce , there is no material new power conferred by the people on their rulers . The Confederation , it must be remembered , had been formed in a time of war , and for a state of war and danger . No fixed principles of Union had been agreed on till nearly two years after the Declaration of Independence . The defence of the States against the common enemy at that time , was the sole motive to the Union of the States . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrust the sword , but the purse was substantially withheld . It had no revenue , and it had no power to collect one . It had been proposed that the Congress should be invested with the power to lay an impost of 5 per cent , on foreign merchandize , and this failing , it was content to ask for a grant of this power for a limited period , and this also failed . It was not until the war was ended , and the great object of the Confederation attained , to-wit , the independence of the States , that its inadequacy to the proper government of the country in a time of profound peace , became evident . How could it be otherwise t There was no system of general revenue which the Congress could succeed in putting into successful operation . The public debt was to be paid , but the States could not agree as to the best mode of apportioning their debt . There were . importing States , and there were consuming States . There were jarring interests , which in various ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , the violation of the public faith , and the consequent depreciation of the public debt . But among all the causes which in those days embarrassed the United States , there were none which brought upon the country such a deluge of evils , as the obstructions which commerce received* To commerce , every State looked , as the source of its future and its permanent prosperity . But there was no common head to regulate commerce . Each State having exclusively the right to regulate its trade , there was of course no uniformity of action as regarded foreign nations . When foreign governments laid heavy restrictions on our trade , there was no general power to counteract the effects of these restrictions , by retaliatory laws , so as to meet the views and interests of all the States ; arid when to this was added the evil of the consuming States , being obliged to submit to the exactions and heavy imposts laid on foreign goods by the importing States , the . distress became general . Hence , a general anxiety and /z/ It deaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ge " neral commerce of the country in a state of peace , aa well as ttf defend it in a time of war . Thus arose the present Union of the States . The sole motive to ; this Union was first COMMERCE , and secondly , the COMMON DEFENCE . The Constitution of the U. States never would have existed had it not been that the States sorely felt the evil of not having a head to regulate commerce . The old Confederation had been rapidly passing away by the disregard of many of the States to its recommendations . It was the common and the severe pressure of an obstructed , ill-managed , foreign trade upon the States , which was about to involve the whole country in accumulated distress and ruin , which formed the great inducement for a firmer and better Union ; and it is not hazarding too much to say , that had it not been for this pressure alone , the present Federal Government would never have been called into existence . It was called into existence to regulate commerce . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days know it ; and , let the compact itself be looked into ; let it be analyzed with care ; let the proceedings of the Convention be referred to , and it will be seen that the Constitution of the United States is a government of specified or enumerated powers , expressly provided not for internal , but for external objects , viz :  --  the purposes of defence and commerce . Any construction , therefore , which would extend the powers of the government to the encouragement of domestic manufactures , and the construction ' of ' national roads and canals , is to extend its sovereignty to objects ' which are not within the proper sphere of its action , and therefore illegitimate , and all the acts of the government in the exercise of these powers , is Usurpation  --  and must be put down by the Southern States , if , as will hereafter be seen , it is not their determination to be put down themselves . - xroTe , It can not be too strongly impressed on the minds of our citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government institute for external , and not internal objects . This is the language of the Federalist , which is the best commentary on the Constitution , and as such , its authority is acknowledged in our courts . " The powers ( says the Federalist ) delegated by the Constitution to the General* Government , are FEW and defined . Those which remain to the State Governments are numerous and undefined . The former will be exercised on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign : commerce , with which last the power of taxation will , for the mostr part , be connected . The powers reserved to the States , extend to all the objects which , in the ordinary course of affairs , concern jthe lives , liberties and properties of the people , and the IJVTERNAl* order , IMPROVEMENT , and prosperity of the State . " % ' Thus we see , how exactly this exposition of the Constitution , , coin* cides with the history of the times , in which it was framed , as noticed* irr my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the /z/ States , as I there stated* was defence and commerce . On " tw , peace* negotiation , and commerce , ( says Mr. Hamilton , ) the few and thedefined powers of the government are to operate* " But do they , my fellow-citizens , operate on these subjects , and these alone 1 Let us look at the government as it has been administered since Mr. Monroe 's accession to the Presidency , and ask ourselves , if Congress has not been in the exercise of some of the most important of the numerous and undefined powers , which , according to this commentary , are reserved to the States 1 Has it not extended its power to the " interned order , improvement , and prosperity of the States 1 What are its roads and canals , but measures of internal improvement and prosperity of particular States ? Are they called at Washington by any other names than " measures of internal improvement V What are its tariffs ? Are they measures of general interest to all the States or are they schemes for employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus promoting the " internal prosperity of those States ? And what will be the appropriations out of the National Treasury for the Colonization Society , when they shall be made , of which there can be no doubt ? Will these appropriations be referred to the objects of " war , peace , negotiation , and commerce r " Or do they naturally belong to the objects which con " cern the " internal order " and government of the black population of the United States , and the LIVES , liberties and properties " of the WHITE people of the Southern States ? To all such questions there is an easy answer . The above picture-given us of the Constitution of the United States , as it was in 1787 , when it was presented to , and accepted by the States , is precisely the reverse of that , which is now held up to us as the rule and guide for our conduct . It is for Congress that are now reserved , those " numerous and undefined powers whilh concern the lives , liberties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States ; " and to the sovereign individual States , belong the few and the defined powers of legislating on all subjects of ordinary interest , as long as such legislation shall not clash or interfere with any act or measure which Congress shall , at its discretion , deem as a means most immediately , or most remStely , connected with the regulation of commerce , or the promotion of the general welfare of the United States . And is this state of things to continue ? Are the great and vital interests of sovereign States to be in danger of being swept from their foundations by the furious tempests of construction and implication , without one single effort to save them 1 Let us hope not 1  - -  Let us believe that when our citizens shall see the subject in its true light , and shall test the meaning of the Constitution , by the plain rules of common sense , and call to their aid all the circumstances which are connected with the rise , progress and perfection of the federal Constitution , they will see at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a government for defence and commerce , and that it has no power to promote this or that particular interest , or regulate This or that branch of domestic industry , or to legislate on any sub- /z/ ject whatever , in which every State has not an immediate and a direct interest . It is a government instituted expressly to do : that , to which each State is separately incompetent , to wit , the regulation of trade with foreign nations and between themselves , for their mutual benefit , and to the defence of all the States against a common enemy . This being the legitimate end of the government , any act passed by Congress , which is not naturally connected with the defence of the country , or the regulation of its trade , beneficially for every part of the Union , is ( with one or two trifling exceptions , provided for by the Constitution ) an usurped power . But Congress is not at liberty , arbitrarily to assume , as a pretext for exercising any particular power , that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the connection between the means and the end , be not a real and a natural connection , it is still an usurpation . It is conceded on all hands , in and out of Congress , that the Federal Government is a government of limited powers , and that " every sovereign power not delegated , is retained by the States or the people . " It results then , that before Congress can exercise any great substantive powers , it must place its finger upon that clause of the act of enumerated powers , which clearly confers the grant of power contended for , or it must shew , that the particular power claimed asincidental , is a mean so necessarily and so properly adapted to the end , for which the sovereign power was given , that without its exercise , the grant itself would be nugatory and void . If it can not do the one , or the other , it usurps the power lam sensible that this is not the doctrine of the Supreme Couit of the United States . But I hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to shew that it is the doctrine of plain sense ; and moreover , that this was the sense of those who framed the Constitution , and of those who accepted'it from the hands of the Convention . If I can satisfy my fellow citizens , as to the true and unequivocal intent of that instiument in 1787* my purpose will be answered , for the meaning of the people of these States , as collected from the proceedings of the Convention , must , and will prevail , over the sophistry and ingenuity of the Bar , or the metaphysical learning of the Bench , and particularly when vital interests are at stake . Where can Congress look for the power to construct national roads and canals , and to impose upon the Agriculturists of the South perpetual tribute and extortion . If we look to the enumeration of power , as set forth in the Constitution , we look in vain for powers of such magnitude . The power to tax indefinitely being first given , there is not one of the seventeen enumerated powers , with theexception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia , and that of the power to give patents and copy rights , which does not relate either to commerce or defence ; thus confirming my position , that it is a government for External objects alone . Looking at this list of specified powers , it is preposterous to say , that in any other wants , than the necessity of a Federal head to regulate our commerce , and a Federal arm to defend us in time of war , did the present government originate . It is absurd to say , that the people ever did want , or ever can want a general government for any other purposes . These are the only wants common to all the people of the United States : In Commerce , we are all equally interested , and we all stand in need of defence/ But on every other subject , be that subject what it may , /z/ the waqts , the feelings , the interests of the people - of the United States are substantially opposite and dissimilar , and to the end of time , id all probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , therefore , with a power to legislate at its discretion , upon any subject , which it might conceive would promote the general welfare , excepting in the modes spe-. cified , would have been to confer on it a most tremendous power of legislation  --  such a legislation as never could be a safe or a just one in their hands . The Sages who penned the Constitution , were aware of this . They no doubt contemplated , that the legislation which might promote , the interests of one section of the country , might operate to the injury of other States . They probably were aware , that the time would come , when the surplus capital of the Northern and Middle States might be profitably employed in Manufactures , and that if there was not a limitation to the power of Congress , the people of those States , who would , in time , constitute a great majority , would promote their local interests at the expense and the ruin of the Southern States , the people of which had no interest but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of legislation , in which all the people had not an undivided interest , was their care ; and it is impossible to look at their work , ( the Constitution of the United States , ) without being struck with the circumspection , with which power is dispensed from the States , and from the people , to their rulers , and without perceiving with what a free and liberal spirit , they dispense every power necessary to defence and commerce , and withholding , at the same time , every thing else . And yet this government , whose limits of power are so plainly marked , and so precisely defined , that he who runs may read them , is now in the exercise of some of the greatest powers that belong to a Sovereign unrestricted in his views , and unlimited in his will . What power , I ask , can be more substantive , primary , or paramount , - than the power to construct national roads and canals . If to cut up the country in every direction , by works of this nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 know not what is meant by dominion .. Can a power which involves jurisdiction over the territory and soil of our citizens , be claimed as incidental to , or as derivative from enumerated powers , none of which are greater than the power in question ? What power again , indicates more complete sovereignty , than that , by which , at the will of the Sovereign , the paramount interests of one part of an Empire , can be prostrated , in order that extensive immunities and monopolies should be conferred on particular classes ? Can it be possible , that the some body of men , who seriously and soberly thought , that a specific grant of power was necessary to enable Congress to exercise jurisdiction over its forts , magazines and dock yards , could intend to give them the unlimited jurisdiction which the opening of roads and digging canals naturally confers on those who have the power to construct them ? Can it be true , that the same body of men , who believed , that Congress could not " promote the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a copy right , unless there was an express grant for that purpose ever contemplated , that they should promote the progress of manufactures , which rank foremost amongst the " useful arts ? " Did these men ever dream of Congress having its committees on the useful arts , Us committees on agriculture , and on manufactures , or that it would contemplate a colony on the /z/ 2i Coast of Africa ? rfo , my fellow citizens : No more did they contemplate* it , than that Congress should establish a national university , or a national observatory , or have its academy of fine arts , or its gallery of paintings , or its own national museum . These subjects were before the convention but so far from the power being given , it was refused* All the late measures of Congress therefore , whether in the shape of appropriations for roads and canals , or in the still more odious shape of tariffs , are neither more nor less than so many schemes devised by the people of the North . for improving , enriching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neral treasury , or for giving employment to their own people at our cost and charges . They are the devices resorted to by the majority , to live by the labour and industry of the minority . They are the acts of those , whose interest it is to extend the government beyond the limits for which it was created , regardless of all consequences to their Southern brethren . A gov ernment which , in the days of its purity , never has been as protecting and as paternal to us in the South , as we had a right to expect , considering the contributions it levied upon us , but which , in these later times assumes an undisguised hostility to our dearest interests . The General Government imparts to us none of that genial warmth , which brings into life and vigour , the industry and enterprise of the merchants and agriculturists of a country ; but it is about to dry up , by the scorching fires of construction , all those sources of our prosperity , which , under any other system , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy State . Our trade is diminished , real property is depreciated our mechanics are without employment  --  many of them emigrate to the North . Confidence is lost , and despondency and gloom universally prevail . With resources that few countries can boast of , we are , nevertheless , becoming to the North , what Ireland is to England . Capital is removed from us ; our incomes are spent abroad , and our great export trade in cotton , and rice , the only hope of our planters , the bread that is to sustain us all , even this trade , so important to us , to protect which was the very end of the Union , is now first to be interrupted , and next to be annihilated , that the Websters and the Cveretts , the Tythe men , the worse than Tythe men , the Tariff men of the North , may riot and fatten upon our substance . What is the cause of all this ? It is consolidation  --  it is usurpation . The enemies of the confederacy and of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chambers of the senate and of the representatives , and will continue there . They possess the entire capitol . woTy . The subject of the constructive powers of Congress , is one of intense* and increasing interest , to the people of the Southern States . It comprehends , in its consequences , not merely the welfare of all , but the safety and existence of many of the States . To South-Carolina , and to the other great cotton growing States , it is peculiarly interesting , and speaks its own importance . If it has not hitherto occupied our serious attention , it is full time , that every citizen should bestow on it , that share of his thoughts to which it is so justly entitled . Our planters especially , may be assured , that they can not be better or more profitably employed , than in contemplating the measures of the General Government , in all their bearings and tendencies , to the interests of Southern agriculture , and to seek for all the /z/ 2fc lights , which can conduct them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire policy of the State . Fortunately , the subject is not without its lights . It has been discussed with ability , in and out of the halls of Congress , and I do not know that I can refer my readers to a better defence of the rights of the States , than to the celebrated report of Mr. Madison , to the Virginia Legislature , in 1799 , and to that of Mr. Giles , to the same body , in 1827* If the reasonings contained in these reports , be not sufficient to satisfy them , that @#@ ' ongress is in the exercise of usurped powers of a most dangerous character to us , 1 can have but little hope , that the views which , I may , from time to time , add to what are there so luminously given , can effect any change or conviction in their minds . By the debates in Congress at different periods , and other discussions elsewhere , it would seem that the advocates of tariffs and internal improvements , have not been generally agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. that they derive the authority of Congress to adopt these measures . Whilst some few would contend , that under the first enumerated power , to " raise taxes , to provide for the common defence , and the general welfare , " &c.; an authority is given to provide for the general welfare , as well as to raise taxes , and that Congress can accordingly , adopt any measure of general interest , to which there is no express prohibition in the Constitution ; by far the greater portion of persons more cautiously maintain , that it can only provide for the general welfare , under this clause , as far as an application of money can promote such an object , and no farther . A third , and a numerous class of persons again contend , that it is under the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and between the States , ' 7 that Congress can construct roads , and make canals for facilitating commerce , and can encourage domestic manufactures by protecting and prohibitory duties . The first of these opinions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second was asserted by Alexander Hamilton , in his celebrated report on manufactures , in 1791* The same doctrine was advanced by many Southern members in Congress in 1824 , and even by some of our own statesmen , but they have lived , I hope , to see the error of opinions most honestly formed at the time , and without the most distant expectation that they would be productive of the abuses which have followed their promulgation . The third or last opinion , was , at the same time , urged by Mr. Clay , and also by Mr M'Lane ; who , as far as the power to make canals was claimed , agreed with Mr. Clay on this ground . But we can not turn to the masterly productions of Madison and Giles , without being forcibly struck with the facility with which men , wielding the weapons of constitutional rights and state sovereignty , can put down their antagonists , who can scarcely agree amongst themselves , as to the particular clause in the Constitution , which gives a power , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is in the celebrated report of 1799 that the Committee demonstrate , that any other construction would be to convert the States into a consolidated government , the inevitable tendency of which consolidation , would be to transform the republican system of the United States , into a monarchy . Arid j it is true . Who can doubt for a moment , that when the General Government shall go on , step by step , in its exercise of that greatest of /z/ all powers  --  the power to raise money for any , and every purpose , which it shall pronounce to be for the common defence or the general welfare , it will not extend the sphere of its legislation , to almost every object of civil government  - -  *to all the numerous and undefined objects , in fact , which were reserved for the States to act upon  --  thu3 making the individual States , as petty corporations , and conservators of the peace in their respective com* Riunities , and repairers of parish roads and bridges ? Who can say , that with the patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hereafterj to give an hundred offices where it now gives one  --  with its army and its navy officers and contractors  --  with its custom houses and their collectors , clerks , and dependents  --  their tax collectors  --  their excisemen  --  their judges and clerks , and marshals  --  their commissioners of bankruptcy  --  their contemplated colony on the coast of Africa , vith their colonial governors , judges* and retinue of servants and dependents  --  their brigade of civil and military engineers and surveyors  --  their post offices , and their thousands of contractors  --  their land offices  --  their seminaries of literature  --  - their national institutes , and their universities  --  their academies of the arts , and their galleries of paintings  --  their national museum , and Mr. Adams ' light houses in the skies , their national observatories  --  their military and naval schools  --  their hundreds of professors  --  their astronomers royal , and their expeditions to the poles  --  their missions to Panama  --  their public institutions , rewards and immunities for manufactures  --  their pecuniary bounties  --  - their premiums  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first talents of the country  --  and last though not least , their command of the American Press , that shall cry out sedition and treason , and disunion , and come down as with a giant 's blow upon the patriot , that shall dare to maintain the cause of the sovereignty of the States , of the republic , and of the world . Who can say , that with these , and a thousand such means of patronage , that the Government shall not attain a moral power , aye , and that soon , and put out such roots as to enable it to withstand all efforts to keep it within its bounds . This is no exaggerated picture . The limits prescribed to the legislation of Congress are passed . A boundless field lies open before it . The government feels itself without restraint or limitation . It has dared , even in our day , to talk of putting down a State , by the bayonets of its soldiers . But we are told by the Tariff men , that under every Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the basis of those measures , that now divide public opinion in these States . We will examine this  --  The first exercise of any important power by implication , was in the case of the Bank in 1791 , as I have already stated in a former number . But this power was not pretended to be derived from that chuse in the Constitution , which enables Congress to appropriate money for the general welfare . It was claimed merely as incidental to some enumerated powers , and particularly as a means of collecting and distributing the revenue , and borrowing money for the purposes of war and defence : and the opponents of the Bill resisted it , on the ground , that though a convenient , it was not a necestary means , and therefore , not within the letter or spirit of the Constitution . The whole ground of dispute was as to incidental powers . It was . Alexandcr Hamilton , as I have already stated , who first advanced the doctrine , that as far as an appropriation of money could promote it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he r olecting and proi Wer , was never at ts taken , and no h and it does see iued until 1800 , n fiends.  --  Hisrepi to sleep , and rein * by the Tatiff i i already ii abuses of power t iticing.  --  They p - lutes was affected , r . . It is clear , then , that with the exceptions nientioned , the Government of the United States did not , within the lirst iltirty years of its existence , make any inroads on the Constitution , and certainly during the same period , no such advances to usurpation , as seriously to affect the paramount interests of particular States . It was reserved for Mr. Monroe to commence that system of policy , which the present Administration is now pressing upon the Southern States j and which , if persiveted in , will convulse the Union to its very centre . It was during Mr. Monroe 's Admintsttalion , that a bold , a decided , and a systematic plan of constructive and usurped powers , was determined nn by Congress , It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of Alexander Hamilton , which had slept in their graves for a tliiid of a century , and proclaimed such a devastating and such an overwhelming i-irine , as that of " Me general welfare . ' ' Did the Southern advocates of this system reflect , thai their doctrines would serve as a foundation , on which Congress would build , in after periods , scheme upon scheme , fur enlarging its legislation , increasing iis occupation , and for converting sovereign States into petty municipalities ? Did they reflect , that in less than five years from the time that we were furnished with this exposition of the general phrases in the Constitution , that even the American Colonization Society , a disorganizing body in the midst f the Stales , " a nucleus around which , are daily forming all the worst elements of discord ' '  --  did they reflect , that this Society too , would demand the aid of the National Treasury , to enable it the better to disturb the peace of the Southern Slates ?

Was It for purposes like these , that South-Carolina entered into the Union , and gave up such an active portion of her sovereignty ? Must her Representatives stand by , and see Committees fmm Abolition and Negro Societies , crowding the lobbies of the House , soliciting , and provoking the discussion i.f subjects , which , to us , in these States , will be producjjve of evils , which language is inadequate to descrilie ?

States , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as  --  Enemies in War , and ENEMIES IN PEACE . " /z/ I now propose to give some popular views , on the question of the constructive powers of Congress , which , in my humble judgment , are not without weight . I am aware , that they are opposed to the opinions of men of no ordinary minds , and that they are even repugnant to the doctrines of the highest tribunal in our land  --  the Supreme Court of the United States . This circumstance , however , does not discourage me . . I reverence as much as any man , the decisions in general of this Court , and 1 as far as these decisions determine questions of ordinary interest between one State and another , or between a State and the United States , I yield to them my perfect homage . The Supreme Court may give to Congress the power to have a National Bank . It may decide that the insolvent laws of this or that State , interfere with the general power of Congress on the subject of Bankruptcies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving to its own citizens , the exclusive right to the navigation of its own rivers by Steam Boats Were I to differ with such a Court , on these and other subjects , yet as a good and virtuous citizen , I would be governed by their opinions . By so doing , I yield none of my privileges as a freeman . No vital principle of individual liberty is involved In the decision  --  no right of State sovereignty taken away , and no important State interests impaired or destroyed . But far different will be my feelings , when the question becomes one of disputed sovereignty ; and the contest involves the great interests , and the existence of States . I should then feel myself at liberty , to canvass the opinions of these Judges , as freely , as if they had been delivered elsewhere , and by other men . I have the less reluctance too , when I consider , that it is natural , that on questions of disputed powers of sovereignty , between the United States and an individual State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the General Government . It is the General Government that appoints and maintains them , and to that Government they must look for their promotion and their honors . To expect that such a tribunal will not extend the powers of the Government , where they can do it , without a flagrant violation of some express provision in the Constitution to the contrary , is to betray an ignorance of human nature , and of what has been passing in our own country for the last ten years . To the Supreme Court of the United States , it is , that we ate to look , as the source , whence the extensive implied powers of the Government have flowed , and will continue to flow . It is the Chief Justice of* that Court , who is the Master Architect of the extended Government of the United States . It is he who has already built up , and is constantly building up , a superb national Government over the heads of our citizens . In the memorable words of Mr. Jefferson , " the JUDICIARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without intermission , is to press ' os at last , into one CONSOLIDATED mass . " This was not an opinion* ' pronounced in a period of embittered political feelings , but they are the - entiments of the Sage of Monticello , pronounced in his retirement from busy life , and when every thing that came from him , might be considered " in. its nature , as testamentary . " The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Bank , would have been unimportant to us , were it not , that the principles upon which that decision is founded , must encourage the government to believe , that it can do any act it pleases , which it is not expressly forbidden by the Constitution to do . The field of constructive power opened to Congress , is no longer susceptible of definition . The talent too , the incomparable talent , displayed in this decision , a decision , which I acknowledge for strength apd acuteness of intellect , and force of argument , will for ever remain a master piece of judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to force from us , at first , the confession , that Congress could establish a corporation . But the decision , I maintain , is not in consonance with the views of those men who framed the Constitution . Sound as is the reasoning of the Chief Justice , in the abstract , it is nevertheless clear , and there are abundant evidences from which we can be assured , that no such construction could have been anticipated when the Constitution was formed If I can shew this , my purpose will be answered . When States differ as to the true intent of a league er compact , involving a deep question of important sovereignty , they are not to seek for the aid of black letter lawyers , who merely look at the instrument as they would at a deed , but they must go into all the motives to the compact , and collect from the particulars of the negociation , what the objects and views of the contracting parties were . It is from the history of the proceedings of the Convention which formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular clauses . Fortunately for us , such sources of safe interpretation are within our reach . These , and these alone , are to be resorted to . Should the parties , with all these advantages , still unfortunately differ , I know of no tribunal that can decide between them . When the States agreed to that article in the Constitution , which provides that the Supreme Court should take cognizance " of all controversies to which the United States is a party , " it can not be conceived , that more was intended , than to provide a tribunal to decide cases of ordinary interest , or cases of disputed territory , which all the parties might be disposed to leave to such a Court . It can not be believed , that any State would submit a question of vital sovereignty or interest , to any arbiter on earth . No sovereign has a right so to do , without violating his obligations and his duties , to his own subjects . Inherent rights upon which the safety and existence of the people depend , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must be adhered to under all circumstances . If any other doctrine than this were admitted in South-Carolina , what might not be'the consequences . Congress , some fifteen or twenty years lience , may , for aught we know , think proper to decide that the gradual emancipation of the slaves in the United States ought to take place , as essential to " the general welfare " and the public safety , and they may begin to pass laws on the subject . Is there any son of the South , who would be willing to submit to any judges , much less the judges of the United States , whether such a law was constitutional or not , and to stand pledged to abide by their judgment ? It would be madness . The decision of a bench of judges might be by the casting vote of a single judge . What ! a single judge to decide , whether the fundamental policy of one /z/ State , immemorially established , shall be altered or subverted ? Shall the voice of one man  --  poor , imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , the people of South-Carolina , shall remain undisturbed in our domestic quiet , according to the usages of our fathers , or be harassed to the end of time , by the interferences of the National Legislature  --  a Legislature , in its feelings , as decidedly foreign to us , in a matter of this kind , as is the Parliament of England ? But some may say , this is an extreme case . I reply it is not an extreme  --  it is a probable case . The firebrand resolutions of Rupus Kino , which he laid on the table of the Senate , some few years since , are but pioneers to other propositions which will be made , if no resistance is anticipated . But if the case be possible , my end is answered . There may be a case then , in which the sword alone shall be the only argument . But let us take the instance of the Tariff . Our citizens generally believe , that the system of the " American policy , " as it is termed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , will bring ruin upon our country , if it is persevered in . Who is there then that would leave it to any judge to decide , " whether Congress can impose such a system of tribute upon our citizens ? Let the question of the Tariff come when it will before the Supreme Court of the United States , it must be decided against us ! The question for that Court will not be whether Congress can " promote the growth of domestic manufactures , " but whether the National Legislature can pass a law , which , however , obviously designed for other purposes , yet purports in its name , provisions and language , to be merely a means of raising a revenue . The Tariff Bill is in its form and colour , a revenue bill . In substance , it is a bill for rendering the South tributary to the North . The Supreme Court will not , and can not with propriety , inquire into the motives of those who passed the bill , and therefore will and must decide , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing additional duties upon woollen goods . " But to us it is really immaterial , in what shape such a question may come before the United States ' Courts . Let the odious measure throw off the garments in which it is disguised , and appear in its true and proper character . Let the question come fairly and openly before the federal judges , whether Con* gress can promote domestic manufactures , and the probability , the certainty is , that it will be decided against us . The Supreme Court , if it remains true to the principles it has already promulgated on the Bank question , must support the authority of the National Legislature in this particular . Those principles , we shall see , are not in consonance with the views of those who framed the Constitution , or , of the States who accepted it from the hands of the Convention , and therefore ought never to be recognized by a South-Carolina Legislature . /z/ The great basis upon which the Supreme Court places the authority of the Federal Government , to exercise its constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that every power vested in the United States Government by the people , is , in its nature , sovereign , and involves &; power to employ " all the means which are appropriate , and which are plainly applicable to the attainment of the end of such power , and which is not prohibited by the Constitution ; and if a certain means to carry into /z/ effect any of the powers of the government be appropriate , the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion , and not of judicial in- quiry . " Let us examine this proposition . It is a proposition , I confess , which at first rapidly sweeps away the mind to a conviction of its undeniable soundness . But , formidable as it appears in the abstract , it will nevertheless be found to fall before the irresistible power of truth and of common sense , when subjected to the severe test of the plain letter and spirit of the American Constitution . The proposition , if it means any thing , goes the length ( from the reasonings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there be any relation whatever , between the measure and the end , the discretion of the Legislature is to be the supreme law , and the Court will not interpose its authority , and thus tread upon legislative ground . This construction of the instrument , I conceive , is wholly repugnant to the views of the sages who framed the Constitution . That these men never designed that Congress should be left at liberty to range at large into the boundless fields of implied powers , is evident from several considerations , which I shall notice in this , and some succeeding numbers . In the first place , they judiciously restricted the National Legislature to the enacting of such laws as were necessary and proper , for the execution of the delegated powers . The words necessary and proper , in the Constitution , have a peculiar force . Ingenious men may amuse us with their nice and their subtle distinctions  --  Philologists may puzzle us with their varied criticisms  --  but there is no need of skilful critics or refined reasoning , in a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant use among men . They have a plain and obvious import , and a popular signification . They are no sooner pronounced , than they strike us like a sensation , and that sensation instantly excludes from the mind , the idea of an unlimited choice of means . The means to be adopted by Congress , must not be simply appropriate , or fit , or adapted to the end , but they must be necessary , as well as proper . The words are not necessary or proper , but necessary and proper Had it been the intention of the Convention to have given Congress unlimited discretion to have selected from the vast mass of incidental powers , any and whatever means it might decide to be proper , such an intention to confer a choice , might have been better expressed , and would have been expressed in other words .  - -  They would have said , and " to use and exercise all other powers incidental to the foregoing powers . " But the clause as it stands , is clearly a limitation on the implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks not . He decides , that the clause is sufficiently explicit , and gives the National Legislature the most ample powers to accomplish the ends of the government , by any means which have a relation to the objects entrusted to its management . In fact , he is of opinion , that this power , " to make all laws , which shall be necessary and proper , to carry into execution " their other powers , was designed to enlarge , and not to abridge , the discretion of the Legislature . His reasons are , First  --  That it is placed amongst the powers , and not the limitations of the powers of Congress : and , secondly  --  That its terms purport to enlarge , not to diminish the powers of the Government . " No reason , " adds he , " has been , or can be assigned , for thus concealing an intention to narrow the discretion of the Legislature , under words which purport to en /z/ M These are the words of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this opinion is supported by the proceedings of the Convention . The journal of these proceedings , it is well known , has been published under the authority of Congress , since this opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered , and published no doubt , with the intention of shewing , the " rise , progress , and present condition of the Constitution of the United States . We can , there ? * fore , resort to no higher source , nor to a more indubitable authority , for expounding ambiguous passages in the Constitution , if there be any , than this journal . What then is the history of the clause in question ? The first notice we have of it , is , in " a proposed draft of a Federal Government , " submitted to the Convention , as soon as it was ready to proceed to business , by Mr. Charles Pinckney , on the 29th May. * The clause , as it stands , at the end of the enumerated powers , in Mr. Pinckney 's draft , reads thus :  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers into execution . " The committee of detail , to whom this draft was referred , together with Mr. Randolph 's plan or resolutions , ( after those resolutions had been the subject of daily debate for about two months , in committee Of the whole and in convention ) on reporting " a draft of a Constitution , " agreeably to the resolutions as amended , on the 6th of August , t altered this clause so as to read  --  " Add to make all laws , that shall be necessary and proper , for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution , ift the Government of the United States , or in any department , or officer thereof . " Now , if the addition of the words , " necessary and proper " to Mr. Pinckney 's clause , did not abridge the discretion of Congress , there certainly is no meaning in the English language , or in the acts of the Convention . Mr. Pinckney 's proposition was as unqualified as words could make.it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment of the committee , is to make " all laws that shall be necessary and proper , " Does not every man , who is blessed by his Creator , with plain good sense , perceive at a glance , that the words " necessary and proper , " here introduced , control the general sentence ; that they are altogether used in a restrictive ILpd not an enlarged sense ; and that the plain , unequivocal intention of the Convention , by their alteration of the clause , ' was to narrow the discretion of Congress , as to the selection of its means in exer.eising its enumerated powers . Can any man in his sober senses , be lieve , with the Supreme Court , that the terms of this clause , " purport to enlarge , und not to diminish the powers vested in the Government/ ' ofthat.it was not " a restriction on those already granted . " In the words of the Supreme Court , I say , " it is too apparent for controversy . " But that it was understood in Convention as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  The draft of the ConstUutiok /z/ qwq hti nugatory , if it did not involve the power to pass laws , to appoint Mil ' - officers , and to regulate the mode of collecting those taxes , and to punish individuals for the infraction of revenue and other laws . All this is too plain to require illustration . The insertion , therefore , of Mr. Pixckxey 's clause , " to make all laws , " &c.; was not an act which either enlarged , or diminished the powers which preceded it ; it was simply a declaratory clause .  --  It was declaratory of that authority , which in the absence of such a provision , Congress would have possessed . Congress without it , would have had precisely the same powers which , by some , the clause is supposed to give . Even Mr. Hamilton , in his Federalist , ( No. 33 ) in defending this- part of the Constitution , does not agree with the Supreme Court , that this clause enlarges the powers of Congress . Such an admission would havf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls it " a declaratory clause , " and says , " that the introduction of it , could only have been done for greater caution , and to guard against all cavilling refinements in those , who migh* feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the Cnion . " Mr. Pinckney 's clause then. , being declaratory , stood iu its proper position in the Constitution . /z/ With all due deference to the Supreme Court , I maintain , that the proper place for a clause , declaring the sense of the Convention , as to the powers which are to result from other powers , expressly and previously given , is at the end of the enumerated powers so given ; nor , could the restricted sense , in which the Convention would have its views expressed in such a clause , make such an essential difference , as to have warranted the transfer of the clause from its position , to be placed amongst the limitations on the powers of Congress  --  some of which limitations , annihilate their powers on certain sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was , not so to restrict as almost to annihilate the rights of the National Legislature , as to its means of executing its powers , but simply to declare , that in the choice of its means , it must prescribe to itself , necessary and reasonable bounds . The clause is declaratory , and is in its proper place Had the original clause of Mr. Pinckney been adopted without alteration or amendment , there might have been some ground for the broad principle laid down by the Supreme Court , that " let it the endj be legitimate , and within the scope of the Constitution , and certain means designed to be used , be appropriate , that the degree of the necessity is a question of legislative discretion alone . " But , even then , I would submit , that the true exposition of such a clause , in reference to certain amendments in the instrument , and to the peculiar circumstances which gave rise to the Constitution , and which are anomalous in the history of the world , would have been , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a direct , a natural , and an obvious relation to the subjects on which they were to legislate ; a relation , so plain , as to be generally acknowledged ; not such a relation as is to be established by an ingenious construction . It can not be conceived , that under a general authority , to pass laws for executing certain delegated powers , it was ever designed , that powers should be used as means , . bet ween which and the end proposed , there is a connection it is true , but the connection distant and not immediate , remote and not simple or direct . The construction must be such , as not to divest the States , of those numerous undefined powers , which they reserved to themselves , when they entered into the compact . But no sooner does Mr. Pinckey 's proposition come from the hands of the committee of detail , than the character of the declaratory clause becomes changed . It is not an immaterial change in phraseology  --  it is not a bare transposition of words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is here introduced* It is an alteration in substance . It alters and controls the sense of the whole clause . It causes that declaration which might have been taken in an unqualified , to be used in a restricted and a qualified sense . As largely as Congress might before have claimed the liberty of ranging in the wide and extensive fields of construction and implication , culling and gathering for the use or the ornament of the Government , their choicest fruits and fairest flowers , yet , now it is cautiously forbidden in its rambles , to touch any but those which , whilst they are essential to nourish and sustain in health , thegreat /z/ *m9*r. *-. - body politic of the General Government , jet do not diminish the supply , which is to keep up the same healthy action in every individual member of the confederacy . The Chief Justice ad ui its , that had the clause been in another place , and worded , " In carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all others , &c.; no laws shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that in such , case , the clause would have unquestionably been restrictive in form , as well as effect " Now , in the name of common sense , my fellow - citizens , where is the difference , between the case put by the Chief Justice , and the case , as it actually did occur in the Convention . A. in the Convention , proposes that Congress , in executing its powers , " shall pass all laws whatever . " B. objects to it , unless the words necessary qndproper " be substituted . The amendment of is adopted . Is not this precisely the same thing , as if the Convention had said , in executing your powers , you may pass laws , but such laws must be neassary and proper . Let us not quarrel about words , but ' look to the plain intents of men , as evidenced by their acts . The clause is a restriction , both inform and in effect . If there be any distinction , it is a distinction without a difference . The decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the rights of sovereign States are to be wrested from them , and the supremacy of the General Government , to rest on principles , with nojraore solid foundation than those promulgated by the Supreme Court , there is an end of the Feral Union . If Congress can create so great a corporation , and so tremendous a monied engine , in the hands of any Government , as a National Bank , and call it " a necessary . and a proper law " for " collecting taxes " it will be in vain for us to say , that internal improvements and tariffs , and other systems of extortion and tribute , are not necessary and proper laws " to regulate commerce . " If our people , acquiesce in this , as sound law , there is no course left for us , but to submit and to be ruined . /z/ The Supreme Court , in contending for its extended construction of the Constitution , would draw a distinction between that instrument and the old confederation , which certainly can not be maintained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the exclusion of the word " expressly " in the one compact , and the insertion of it in the other , included or excluded in either , the idea of implied powers . The words of the 10th amendment to the Constitution are , " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . " In the confederation , it is thus expressed : " Each State retains every power , jurisdiction and fight , not expressly delegated to the United States . " Let me here premise the distinction , which must forever exist between the case of a people emerging from a state of revolution , without any government , and assembled to form one ; and a case , where the people already are associated , in so many independent political communities , each having its own regular government . In /z/ the one case , it is intended , ex necessitate ret , that all powers Bhould he vested in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here reserved as a bill of rights to the people , is clearly designed to be given . But , in the other case , where the people are governed in so many distinct sovereignties , and are willing to divide the sovereignty with a common head to direct the whole , it becomes necessary to state , not what powers are withheld , but what powers are given . In the first case , the powers given are general , with certain , exceptions  --  in the second case , the powers are altogether special . In the one case , every thing that is not retained is actually surrendered  --  in the other , nothing can be claimed that is not clearly given . The tenth amendment , therefore , to the present Constitution , and the second article in the confederation , already quoted , were only declaratory clauses . To the States , or to the people , were reserved , as : i matter of course , all powers which were not surrendered . There is no deed to distinguish here between express and implied powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power to make the laws necessary to execute that power , is also surrendered . To these positions all men must give their unqualified assent . In point of construction then , the Supreme Court is in error when it supposes , that had the word " expressly " been inserted in the tenth amendment to the Constitution , that any difference whatever could have been created in the relative tights of the parties to that compact ; and in point of fact it is equally and most egregiously wrong , in asserting that the insertion of that word in the old confederacy , caused embarrassments to the old Congress " by excluding incidental or implied powers . " The Court might to have known , that the confederation languished from time to time , not from any want of power , over the subjects which were entrusted to it ; but because for the execution of those powers in practice , it was made , by the terms : of the compact , to depend too much upon the individual States ,  - -  Though their power to raise money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they had no power to enforce their requisitions , , when the States were backward in complying with their quotas , except they were to do it by the sword . The confederation failed , not because it was deprived of power by implication , ( for the fact is otherwise ) but because it had no power of direct legislation upon the people . But the Old Congress did possess implied powers , ( that is as far as language could convey such power , and exercised them too , ) and in a much greater degree than is given to Congress under the present Constitution . It had the " sole and exclusive right and power " of determining on peace and war : the sole and exclusive right and power , over the post-office , and over the regulation of coin , and every other subject confided to its government , without one single exception . In the present compact , there are no such words in the enumerated grants of power , excepting in that clause , which gives to Congress exclusive legislation at the Seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.; Were it not , that there are express limitations on he power of the States in other articles of the instrument , /z/ who can doubt but that the power of the States , as to raising 1 armies in peace , issuing coin , and laying impost and export duties would have been concurrent with Congress , on account of the grant of power in these cases not being " sole and exclusive " Even Mr. Hamilton does not doubt , but admits it . Fed . No. 32 . The power of the States , at this moment , to tax indefinitely , by excise , by stamps , or by any other duty , . provided it be not on imports or exports , ) though such taxes might even interfere with , and greatly embarrass the fiscal operations of the General Government , is according to the expositions in the Federalist , as unimpaired as ever . The decision of the Supreme Court admits that there is a concurrent jurisdiction in the States , in the article of taxation , though not to the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hamilton tells us Fed . 33 that " though a tax for the use of the United States , would te supreme in its nature , and could not legally be opposed or controlled ; yet , a law , abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of a State , unless upon imports or exports , ) would not be the supreme law of the land , but an usurpation of a power not granted by the Constitution . " The State of Maryland no sooner taxed the Bank of the United States , under the above exposition , than the Supreme Court decides it to be unconstitutional .  --  A memorable triumph this of metaphysical learning over the plain intent of the Constitution . But I am digressing . If there be a difference between the old and the new compact , the difference is in favour of the confederation , and destructive of the reasonings of the Court . The confederation , I repeat , had implied powers . If , for instance , a surrender of the " sole and exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this compact , did not deprive the States of a concurrent power , in any way , over such particular subject , to what intent is language taught ? If the States are deprived , from the words of the grant , of all power over the subject matter , do not the minor or implied powers go from them , as well as the original and substantive powers ? To whom else could the minor powers belong , if they belonged not to the Old Congress 1  --  They must belong to the States or to the Congress . To the States they could not belong ; for they surrendered all jurisdiction whatsoever over the subject .  - -  The Congress , on the contrary , shews a grant , in such words , as . embrace the incidents as well as the power itself . Hence , the weakness of the argument , that , because the States under the old compact , retained every jurisdiction and right not expressly relinquished , that the Old Congress had no implied powers . The Congress could pretend to no implied powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the States retained , without dispute , all implied , as well as original powers , Chi subjects not given away by them . But the Old Congress did exercise implied powers . It is not necessary to cite the instances  --  one will be sufficient . It created and incorporated the Bank of North America , and as a measure indispensably necessary to the exigencies of the Union ; and it passed , I believe , with /z/ but one dissenting vote . The Supreme Court would not say was not an implied power ; nor can any one pretend that there was not a greater necessity for it than the present Bank . The indubitable fact is , that the Confederation would have died a quiet and a natural death , whether this magic word of the Supreme Court , this word " expressly " had been omitted or retained . In all the addresses of the Old Congress to the States  --  in all its appeals to their patriotism for a change of the articles of Confederation , ( the last appeal , 1 believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of its embarrassment , or its difficulties , as proceeding from the want of implied powers . Its powers on the parchment , were as great and as paramount , as it could desire them to be on such subjects* But it wanted that , which gives life and vigour to every other power , and without which no Government can go on , to-wit  --  the power of raising money by taxing the people , instead of depending upon the States to raise 4 its ways and means . This power of taxing it could not possibly exercise as an implied power , because , in the eighth article of the compact , there was an express provision that the States should supply the National Treasury . It was the want of a power to lay imposts of which it complained . It had no power to regulate commerce . It solicited over and over again , that the States would permit it to lay certain imposts for a limited time , so as to produce some little certain revenue .  - -  Some consented , and others fettered their grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the power useless . It Was in the situation , of the famous Confederacy of 1570 between the United Provinces , or rather in a worse situation , for there a small power to raise imposts was given . In that Confederacy , the States were not ' punctual in obeying the recommendations of the Common Council . Holland bore the burthen of that league , and so here some States paid three or four times their quotas . Two States , it was said , paid nothing . Holland settled her business in part , by inarching an army into one of the provinces to compel payment .  - -  Our 0d Congress had not the power of settling matters by the sword . It wanted money , and it had no power to tax , ' and had . it taxed , it would not have been paid . The want of a power to regulate commerce , was the sole cause of the inefficiency of our old Government , and not the want of implied powers , as is asserted by the Supreme Court . This is history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court say , that there is that in the articles of Confederation , which excluded incidental or implied powers ? And whyjin the second place , does it assert , that it is the omission of this word " expressly " in the tenth amendment " that have the question 4pen % whether the particular power which may become the subject of contest , has been delegated to the one government , or prohibited to the other V* The question , I aver , is not more open by the omission , than it would have been by the insertion of the word . The Court might have known , that even if the powers of the Old Congress were not sole and exclusive , and , that the phrase there might have been so expressed , as to exolude the idea.of impJ ied /z/ powers ; jet , that its omission in the present compact , could not even in that view % give to the present Congress , any powers which it did not possess without it . There is a distinction which is manifest upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Constitution , there is an express clause , giving to Congress the power of making the necessary laws to execute its powers ; and therefore recognizes , thus far , implied powers . In the old Confederation , there is no such express provision . How , therefore , the Court , which rears its whole superstructure of implied powers upon this express clause in the Constitution , which it regards as designed to enlarge the powers of Congress , can condescend to lay any stress upon , or even to notice the omission of a most insignificant word is most extraordinary . Could such a word , if it were inserted , strip the government of its powers , when , according to the Chief Justice 's exposition of the phrase , " necessary and proper " the Government has an unlimited choice of means under an express power  --  unquestionably it cannot. 1 have said that the word is insignificant . It is a word in my view , so harmless , that whether it be inserted or excluded frorti the tenth amendment , no possible alteration can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. to say to B. -* The power I do not give you is retained by me , " is certainly as strong and as expressive for all purposes , as if he had said , what I do not expressly give you , I retain  --  The first phrase is the bettcrof the two  --  it is more simple and expresses as much . In a deed of conveyance of land , would the grantor give more , or the grantee receive more , by using the words " doth absolutely and expressly , and clearly , arid unequivo catty gfant , bargain , sell and convey , " than if the words Were , " doth grant , bargain , sell and ' convey . ' *  --  It is too tilain . When the State Legislatures sent in their ratifications of the Constitution , and proposed their amendments , they expressed , their sense as to implied powers , in various ways  --  Massachusetts , NewHampshire , South-Carolina arid Rhode Island , used the words " all powers not expressly delegated "  --  Virginia and North-Carolina left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all powers not clearly delegated ' *-r-Rhode-Island in the Bill of Rights has it , " not clearly delegated , 9 * and in the amendments ' proposed by the same Stated we find the word " expressly " used . As soon as the first Congress was convened under the Constitution ; it considered all the amendments proposed by . the States  --  it took the substance of them , and made out from the whole , twelve amendments to be submitted to the State Legislatures , ten of which were accepted , and two rejected . At a subsequent period , two more were proposed and adopted , and thus stand the twelve amendments to the Constitution , In submitting the tenth amendment in question , it was submitted as it now reads , omitting the word " expressly . "  --  A motion was made in the lower House of Congress to reinstate the word , but lost  --  ' Only seventeen votes in the affirmative . A similar motion was lost in the Senate . The omission of this word could not , and did not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the States ; hiid it by lar. /z/ iidemal powers , ' Tbid.  - -  The dea restrictive phra is from ess lias not sover jus are the mean niplet* restraint , . m. nee use 01 any , and every measure , which bareconvenience may suggest , and where the unlimited discretion of the sovereign is the only rule , and his will the only law  --  Congress is not that sovereign . The principle of the Supreme Court is true at a general proposition , that the grant of a sovereign power include ! the grant of all sovereign means , applicable to the end of such power  --  but it is not true in the cade before us . A restriction has been placed by the Convention , upon the implied powers of Congress . It is not simply a restriction according to the plain and obvious import of the words , but it is . a restriction in fact , the evidence of which fact , is to be found in the journals of the Convention . What then becomes of the decision in M'Cullock , vs. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the declaratory clause enlarges rather than abridges the powers of Congress hae Ailed , and thus must fall to the ground , that huge pile or pyramid of constructive powers , which the industry of the Chief Justice , with the aid of all his transcendunt powers of reasoning , has been rearing to throw into the shade the sovereignty of the States . The Court , too , is wrong , decidedly wrong , when it pronounces , that such a liberal construction as its own , to the clause in question , " the Constitution would be a splendid bauble . " Experience and fact boldly contradict this assertion . Abolish the Bank to-morrow , as it was abolished once before . Call in the brioadb of Civil and Military Engineers , who have been taking their summit levels all along the great Alleghany ridge of Mountains , with a view to defend us against the British .

Put out of Congress , all the petitions and memorials of Judge Washington 's Colonization , or Insurrection Soci ' /z/ ety . Cast into the waters of eternal oblivion , the speeches of some of our own Statesmen on Internal Improvements and Military Roads ; and all the ultra and sweeping doctrines of the " general welfare , " Repeal the Tariff Laws , and disclaim all pretence to the exercise of great substantive sovereign powers , under the flimsy pretence of their being implied means of carrying into effect other powers . In a word , proclaim from Passamaquoddy to Cape Florida , that the " means to an end , " aud the whole decision of the Supreme Court is an absurdity  --  and who besides the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a power to do all these things , our Constitution would be a bauble . No , my fellow citizens , the Government for thirty years was respected at home and respected abroad . Without a National or other Bank , we achieved our independence . Without a Bank , and Military Roads , and Canals , and Tariffs , we waged a successful war a second time against the greatest power in the world , and we have arrived to our splendid rank amongst the nations of the earth , by the exercise of powers , which we all agree the Government possesses , and about which , there never was , at any time , the least difference of opinion . If an adherence in good faith , to the true principles and spirit of the compact , ( with but few exceptions ) from the foundation of the Government , ( to the accession of Mr. Monroe , and the introduction of the " AMERICAN POLICY , " ) was upon that construction of the instrument , which would make it a mere bauble , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we in the South want , aud ought to have , and MUST have .

Bat the doctrine of the Supreme Court , was not the doctrine of 1787 . The Constitution speaks no such language . On the contrary , the instrument abounds with examples* which clearly indicate an opposite purpose . Where can it be manifested more strongly , than when it confers , as distinctly enumerated powers , those powers , which , throughout the world , are understood and acknowledged , as only means for executing other powers already given . For example :  --  Let us take the power " to make war . " Are not the " raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " the power to call out the militia of the United States , " all incidental to the waging of war What , in the language of the Supreme Court , can be more requisite , and " more fairly and plainly applicable to the end of war , " than the means just stated ? All of these are every where , the usual and acknowledged means of war . According , then , to the decision of the Court , the power to declare war , carried with it every other power having a relation to war . But , the members of the Convention did not think so , for it appears , that they gave a distinctly enumerated power  --  1st , to raise armies ; 2dly , to provide a navy ; and 3dly , to call out the militia . Again  --  let us take the two enumerated powers to raise an army and a navy , would we not suppose that such powers as these , would give also the power to discipline the army and navy ? Ind yet the Convention give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulation of the land and naval forces . " What makes it stronger , is , that this clause was not in the reported draft of the Constitution , but afterwards solmnly introduced as a seventeenth power . Again  --  what can be more necessary to war , and to armies and navies , than for the Government which possesses the sovereign power on such subjects , to possess , at the same time , " exclusive authority over its forts , magazines , arsenals , dock yards , &c."; and yet the Convention did not think that the power to the one , necessarily gave the power to do the other , for it confers this power by a separate article . Let us go farther , and take the power " to coin money . " Would not , nine men out of ten , pronounce , that according to the decision of the Supreme Court , the power " to protect that coin from counterfeits , " was necessarily and naturally implied ; but the Convention did not think so , for it gave a distinct power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin of the United States . " Take the power to u borrow money on the credit of the United States "  --  what power is there , that can be more incidental to this power , as a means to an end , than to protect Government securities from discredit by forgery , by punishing those who counterfeit them . Ask the Chief Justice , if the Government , which is so sovereign as to borrow money , and bind the people , to any extent , can pass a law to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities of the public debt , and he would smile at your ignorance ; and yet , the sages of 1787 , were so ignorant , that the one power naturally gave the other , that they unnecessarily provided for'buth . Let us take the power to  --  regulate - commerce with foreign nations , " &c.; Here is a general /z/ power susceptible of an extensive definition , if we choose to plunge bead and hears into implication . Few of us , however , can differ as to what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , it is universally admitted , embraces every subject connected with the arrivals and departures of vessels , such as imports and exports , navigation laws , tonnage , pilotage , light-houses , ( not " of the skies , V ) &c-; But that the States did not , by the power to regulate commerce externally and internally , intend to surrender to Congress , a legislation over every subject connected with commerce , directly or indirectly , i  --  evident , from their deeming it necessary , to confer distinct powers on some subjects , which are manifestly commercial . What subject , for instance , can be more purely commercial , than the subject of Bankruptcy . But that the States did not consider a Bankrupt law as incident to the regulation of commerce , appears by their providing for such a law , by a separate power . Coining money , and regulating its value , both domestic and foreign  --  fixing a standard of weights ; nd measures  --  defining and punishing piracies and offences against'the law of nations  --  establishing and regulating a post-office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulation of commerce : and yet , there is to be found in the Constitution , a separate power for each . Now. , who can doubt , but that if none of these last enumerations of power were to he found in the Constitution , and the Supreme Court had been called on to decide , whether under the great sovereign power to " regulate commerce foreign and domestic/ 9 Congress could establish a post-office , or a Bankrupt law , or have a national coin , fix a standard of weights and measures , or punish pirates , &c.; : but that the Chief Justice would be astounded , that the power of a Government so sovereign , should be doubted in these instances . If I have ten grains of sense , or if my readers have as many , they must forcibly see , that a post-office , or a bankrupt law , or a standard of weights and measures , has an affinity to the regulation of " commerce between the States , " as a means , fully as close as that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a plain reason . Taxes were gathered before the Christian era ; and were collected in our country , as they now are in some countries , without the aid of Banks . But it would be difficult to find a country strictly commercial in the modern sense of the term , in which there is not a bankrupt law , and a post-office , and an uniformity in weights and measures . ' To say , then , that the people of the States , when they were conferring sovereignty on their new rulers , entertained the opinion , now ascribed to them , by the Supreme Court , viz ?  --  That " every power given by them was intended to be so sovereign , that it necessarily carried with it , every other appropriate power , which , in the discretion of Congress , it should regard as applicable te the end of such power , " is not true . Had such been their meaning , there would not bo found the useless provisions , with which , in such a view , the instrument must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , magazines , and dockyards , and coining and borrowing money , &c.; are all the acknowledged means of making war upon foreign States , /z/ and as such , naturally involved in such a poorer . And yet the people made these and others , so many distinct powers , thus inumfesting , as clear as the Sun is in the Heavens , that they did not intend the Federal Government to exercise any important power , as a means to other powers , which was not expressed in the enumeration I am not sensible that the foregoing view of the subject can bs eonfuted , unless it be urged , that the use of surplus clauses , or language in the Constitution , or the circumstance of giving as special grants of power , those which necessarily were implied , from what was already given , or as resulting naturally from the whole mass of powers , ought not to be opposed to the plain axiom , that the United States Government was to be as sovereign , on every subject entrusted to it , as the States were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is this  --  it would be idle , worse than idle , to talk of surplus clauses in the Constitution . The men who framed it , were not ignorant or illiterate men , who in expressing their intentions , are apt to use more words than are necessary . On the col . rary , the sages who deliberately discussed and considered every article and line of this charter , were fully aware of the import of words . Amongst them , were unquestionably the first Statesmen and Orators of our country . Very many of them were professional men , and it would be a reproach to such men , assembled as , they were for months and months , to mature and perfect one of the greatest works ever entrusted to men , to imagine that there is in that instrument , called ths Constitution of the United States , so many clauses , that were not designed to have a full and an explicit meaning . If there be any one important state paper , or public document , in the world , which , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its subjects , and the exactness , with which it defines the power which it intends to confer , is more distinguished than all others , that document is the Federal Constitution . There is in it , nothing of redundancy , of prolixity , or of circumlocution . For brevity and perspicuity of expression , it is unrivalled as a composition . There pro* bably is not a sentence in it , which was not , amongst the members the subject of conversation without , or the theme of debate within the halls of the Convention . There is certainly not a clause which has been retained , in which , by striking it out , a material alteration might not be produced , in , the sense and meaning of those who penned it . When , therefore , these sages were so precise in enumerating the powers they designed to confer , some of which are so plainly in- volved in , or incidental to others , it was not because these persons were ignorant that armies , and navies , and a national mint , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was not because they believed , that the power to coin money , and to borrow money , did not carry with it a power to protect their coin and their securities from debasement or counterfeiting , or that they believed that post-office &,; and bankrupt laws , and weights and measures , were not connected with commerce , that they provided separate powers for such subjects  --  but it was , because they wished to inculcate , and to have it clearly understood , that they designed , that no power should /z/ be . exercised for which there was not a specific grant . They designed , it is true , that all the necessary and proper laws should be passed , to execute those powers ; such laws , in fact , without which the power would be nugatory , and they added a power for such purposes : But they did not mean , that a power , as great as any of those enumerated , should be claimed , under the power to make necessary laws ,  - -  Their object was , to leave little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be no necessity , or excuse , on the part of Congress , for passing the limits of power assigned to it , great and uncommon diligence , seems to have been used , not to omit any thing , but to provide every power , which could possibly be necessary , to regulate the two great objects for which the Government was established , to wit , COMMERCE and DEFENCE . Had they been less precise , they foresaw that the Government could not proceed in the exercise of some of the most necessary powers , without feeling the want , of an express warrant of authority in the Constitution , and that it would be induced to resort to usurpation from necessity . To guard against its early resorting to constructive powers , which they must have dreaded , and to which , as wise men , they saw , there could be no end , they judiciously conferred on Congress , an express warrant for every material power which the Government could possibly need , in all time to come , out of mind , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fellow-citizens  --  I call upon the members of the Bar , to look at the instrument , and to designate , if they can , what power it is , that any Government can want , for the purposes of those great objects , WAR , NEGOCIATION , and COMMERCE , which has been withheld from the Federal Goverment by the States . What power is there , I ask , and I ask it triumphantly , the want of which , to render us an happy and an united people , is not to be found writ " ten down in the Constitution ; or , who cau say , that this Government , in its experience of forty years , ( during which time it has been at war twice , and in peace has conducted us to the most unexampled prosperity ) when it was about to use a power for objects , in which all tie people are interested , to wit , defence and commerce , could ever point to the Constitution , and shew , that for this or that power so about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can say it ; and this circumstance alone evinces the wisdom , the consummate wisdom of the men who framed the Constitution . Such a fact is worth a million of arguments to strengthen my position , that the new Government was never to be carried on by implied powers . The enumeration of so many powers , which are bqt as means to other powers , is TOTALLY IRRECONCILEABLE with the principle , upon which is founded , at the present day , under the sanction of the Supreme Court ; all those implied powers , which are now exercised by Congress . Our sages having thus granted every necessary power , and placed at the disposal of the Congress , all the means which it could possibly need to administer the government , to the happiness of the people ; and having withdrawn every pretext , for the resort to usurpa* Hon from necessity , which would have been the case , had they been /z/ less precise , the State .

" The enumeration of certain rights/ ' says the Constitution , " shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . " And again  --  " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people /z/ ' What is the meaning of these clauses in the Constitution , connected with the enumeration of powers and the history of the times ? It is this : We , the people of thirteen States , desire a Federal HEAD to regulate our commerce , and a Federal ARM to protect us . On no other subject are our wants common , or our interests the same . To this end , and this end alone , we need a General Government , and for these two purposes , the power we give , shall be exclusive .

To confer power on you in general terms , would be to give you , with the sword and the purse in your hands , power to destroy the States , and to consolidate our people into a nation . ' In this Charter you will find yourselves called upon to regulate commerce , and provide for the public defence . It contains every substantial power which you can possibly need . As strange as it may seem to you , that when we give you the sovereign power , for war and foreign negociation , and commerce , we should specify the obvious means which such powers necessarily involve ; yet we have a design in this  --  we intend , that in your progress onward as a Government , you shall be provided with means for your journey , and use none but what we shall give you  --  and that you may not reproach us with carelessness or negligence in the supply , we have made it 3 lost ample ; and that you may not wander from your path , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way . Is not the idea an absurd one , that the same men who deemed it necessary to give to Congress by a special grant , the power to give a patent for an improved Cotton ( fin , should intend that it should exercise powers , not only not named , but not even hinted at  --  powers which belong to undivided sovereignty t The words u Canals " or ** National Roads , " or " Internal Improvements , " are not to be found in the Constitution ; or , any words which ingenuity can torture to mean any such thing , and yet Congress is projecting national works , which , whether we regard their SCALE and immensity , at to the territory upon which they are to be spread  --  the TIME in which they may be executed , or the COST at which they are to be completed , would not shrink in a comparison with many of the great enterprises of antient and modern times . Vast extents of roads are to penetrate our forests  --  an extensive peninsula is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversed with canals , and all the elements of power about to be de- /z/ veloped , of which Imperial Rome , in her proudest days of conquest and dominion , has left us so many monuments  --  on which , even a Napoleon might employ his genius and his care  --  and which belong only to those States and Kingdoms , and those alone , which have exclusive dominion over the soil and territory , as well as over persons and other subjects , which are the objects of Civil Government . It is too monstrous , that a Government , so limited by the Constitution , that it can not , without the EXPRESS consent of a State previously obtained , purchase and exclusively hold land for its Forts , Magazines , Dock-yards , &c.;  --  shall dare to claim such a paramount authority , as to have national roads and national canals , which involve the right of territorial jurisdiction , over every portion of twenty-four Sovereign States . Against such doctrines , and such foul usurpations , I protest . As acute as may be the intellects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sit upon the judgment seat of the highest tribunal in our land , yet I would not give the unsophisticated , and the patriptic , and the honest views which may be taken of the Constitution , for all their decisions , were they ten times as learned as they are . No intelligent man , can impartially read the decision of the Supreme Court , and contemplate the proceedings of Congress of late , without pronouncing that the Constitution is A DEAD LETTER  - -  It may mean ANY THING , or it may mean NOTHING . If my views of the subject are unsound , and my fellow-citizens shall pronounce that Congress is in the prescribed limits of its powers , adieu , a long adieu , to the interests and the SAFETY of SouthCarolina. wo . in . Let us continue our subject . Amongst the enumerated powers in the Constitution , is the power " to borrow money on the credit of the United States . " This is a power unlimited in its extent , and embracer every possible mode known , or to be known amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To have affixed any limitation of such a power , would be , according to the general views of the Supreme Court , to tie down Congress to provide for the public safety , not only in this , but in after ages , and to deny to them a power commensurate with the great object , to- wit , the liberty of accommodating its means to the vicissitudes , which are constantly taking place in the affairs of a country Had , therefore , the question before the Supreme Court been in 1819 , whether Congress could " emit bills of credit/ ' or in other woids , resort to the " paper emission " of the revolutionary war , - who can doubt , but that the Supreme Court would have then decided , that the Legislature had inch a power .  - -  What , " shall a Government ( to use the language of the Court ) which has the great powers to fay and collect taxes ; to borrow money ; to regulate commerce ; to declare and conduct a war ; and to raise and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purse  --  all the external relations , and no inconsiderable portion of the industry of the nation "  --  shall it be pretended , that such a Government , ( should the public exigencies demand it , ) has not the power , to issue continental , or paper /z/ money ? But why do we reason about it ? On such a question , had #@# it occurred at that time , I would have asked no favours of the Court . I would have demanded of ( hem to decide , that Congress could issue continental money . I would have adduced to the judges , the case of M'Culloch vs . The State of Maryland , where they decide , that a corporation is but " a means to an end/ 7 and that a National Bank - is a means necessary and proper to the " collection of a tax ; " and I would have insisted , that were such a bank an appropriate means for such a purpose , that bills of credit , were a still more appropriate means , and more plainly applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States/ ' and of tha power to declare war , and other enumerated powers in the Constitution .  - -  That the one , had but a distant relation to its object , whilst the other , had a direct , and an obvious connection  --  that the latter had been the means , by which we had conducted a successful war for our liberties and our independence , and that it is a means , to which every government must resort , when it can not raise money by other expedients . I would , moreover , have reminded the Court , that such a power must have been intend* ed to be involved in the other powers , inasmuch as an express limitation is to be found in the Constitution , that the States shall not emit bills of credit , but that no restriction of the kind , is to be seen amongst the limitations on the powers of Congress . The Court , under such a view , to be consistent with itself , must have decided that Congress could issue paper money . But fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a question never came before the Supreme Court , and that such a decision was never made . Had there been a decision , it would have established the extraordinary fact , that the Supreme Court gave to the Congress of the United States , a power which the framers of the Constitution had determined , that they ought not to possess . The fact would thus appear . In the reported draft of the committee of detail , presented to the Con* vention , the clause in question stood thus : " To borrow money , and emit Bills , on the credit of the United States . " On the 16th of August , when this /clause was under consideration , a motion was made , to strike out the words " and emit bills " which motion was carried  --  nine States in the affirmative , and two against the motion . Had this been a mere motion to strike out these words , there might have been room to suppose , that the opinion of the Supreme Court , prevailed amongst the members , to-wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the reverse of this is the conclusion . Mr , Luthbr Martin , from Maryland , and others , urged , " that it would be improper to deprive the Congress of the power to issue paper money ; that it would be h novelty unprecedented , to establish a government , which should not have such authority . That it was impossible ' to look for ward into futurity , so far as to decide , that events might not happen , that should render the exercise of such a power absolutely necessary . " I will not quote the rest of his arguments ; but , says Mr. Martin to the Legislature of Maryland :  --  " A majority of the Convention being willing to risk any political evil , rather than the idea of a paper emission , in any possible case , refused to trust this authority to * Government , to which they were lavishing the most unlimited powers of taxation , and to the mercy of which , they were willing to trust the liberty /z/ and property of the citizens of every State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system , " * The lesson here inculcated is a most salutary one . It ought to teach all judiciary tribunals , and particularly the Supreme Court , that on all questions of constitutional law , unaided by the journals of the Convention , or dther lights , the best rule of interpretation is the plain letter of the Constitution . That to travel beyond this , is to enter a boundless field of conjecture , in which there is always danger of giving to the Constitution a inearring , which the framers not only never had , but to which , perhaps , they would have given their most zealous opposition . In the instance before us , we have a most illustrious example . In the history of the clause just referred to , there is the most abundant evidence , that implied powers , as they are called , were never in the contemplation of the Convention The supporters of the motion , to strike out the power to issue paper money , must have been well assured , in their own minds , ( and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not included in the list of enumerated powers , with the exception of the power to make the necessary laws to exe ute the particular power , could be claimed . Had they not thought so , it would be difficult to account , for their omitting to prohibit Congress from the exercise of the power in question , by adding it to the other limitations , on the powers of Congress . Their not providing for such a limitation in express terms , is conclusive , that they deemed it unnecessary . It is much to be lamented , that the debates of the Convention preserved by Chief Justice Yates , do not extend to the later periods of the session of that body , when the enumerated powers were under discussion , as in that case , we should have known distinctly the views of members , as to the insertion and rejection of particular passages . Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing , both deputies from New- York , left the Convention in disgust , as soon as the great outlines of the Government had been agreed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some important materials , as to the rise and progress of some of the powers of Congress . The first step taken by the Convention was , as to the outlines of the Government ; for the members had no sooner met , than it was discovered that there were amongst them three parties of opposite views . The first party , Mr. Martin informs us , wished to annihilate all State Governments ) and to establish a General Government in nature of a limited monarchy . This party was small , but several belonged to it who did not openly avow their sentiments . The second party was " not for the abolition of the State Governments , nor for the introduction of a monarchical Government under any form ; but they wished to establish such a system as would give their own States undue influence over the other States . " A third party " was truly Federal and Republican , and nearly equal in number with the other two . " In order to test the opinions of members , as to what the new Government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered his fifteen resolutions , and upon these resolutions , did the members debate and differ , in committee of the whole , and in convention , for about two months ; when , together with Mr. Pinckney 's diaft of a Constitution , also early submitted to the Convention , though not taken up , they were both referred /z/ to a committee of detail , to report a Constitution , agreeably to the resolutions as amended . There is no need for our purpose , to refer to any of these resolutions at amended by the Convention , excepting the sixth , as it is this resolution alone , in which we are to look for the nature and extent of the legislative powers to be vested in Congress . It is in these words :  --  " Resolved , That ! the National Legislature ought to possess the legislative rights vested in Congress by the Confederation ; and moreover , to legislate , in all cases , for the GENERAL interests of the Union ; and also , in those , to which the States are separately incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation . ' 9 ' This resolution was the basis , to which the enumerated , and other pow ers of Congress , were to be conformed by the committee of detail . " The general interests of the Union , " was not a new phrase . It is used in the 5th article of the old Confederation , and is there synonimous with the term " general welfare , " used three times in that instrument , to wit , in the third ) eighth , and ninth articles . The committee , therefore , could be at no loss to understand what was meant by the term " general interests . " It did not mean such interests , as a majority of the States might possess , as con* tra-distinguished from different and opposite interests , possessed by other States , which composed the minority , for it was not used in that sense in the Confederation , that body having no specified power on any subject whatever , in which one State was not equally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederation operated , were those of WAR , PEACE , INDUN TRADE , and Foreign N EG OCIATION . The old Congress , could not meddle with the navigation interests of the New England States , nor with the great agricultural interests of the South . These were the local interests of the States , over which they had no power , by any grant from the States , general or special . They had the charge only of general interests , strictly and truly so called . But there was one general interest , on which the Confederation could not legislate , and that interest was commerce with foreign nations . This was a paramount general interest of the whole Union , not an interest of a majority of the States , but the direct interest of every State  --  and the want of a common head to direct which in each State , was about to involve the whole in distress and ruin . The meaning of the word " general interests of the Union , " becomes now to be obvious to the reader . The committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , in drawing up the Constitution , was plainly marked . Their enumeration of powers , was to embrace , ac* cording to the resolution , first  --  The powers granted to the old Confede* ration , already referred to . Se ondly  --  The general interests of the Union , amongst which , foreign commerce stands pre-eminent . In fact , it comprises almost every other general interest , not provided for in the Confederation . Thirdly  --  The cases , to which the States are separately incompetent to legislate with effect . Amongst these , is the power to grant patents and copy rights ; defining felonies on the high seas , and offences against the law of nations  --  for which the articles of Confederation had made no provision Under this head , may properly be included , the power to declare the law and punishment of treason , and some others . Fourthly  --  The cases ) in which the harmony of the States might be interrupted by indi- /z/ vidoal legislation ; such as , the regulation of the intercourse between the States ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers also , the Confederation had not provided . The reported draft of the Constitution , by the committee of detail , it will be seen , is in consonance with the sixth resolution , and with the outline of power , fixed by the Convention . That the committee of detail did not regard Agriculture , or Manufactures , or Internal Improvements , as a general interest of the Union , appears from their reporting no specific power , in relation to these objects  --  - nor are the words to be found either in the reported , or amended draft of the Constitution . Indeed , how could they provide for the interests of Agriculture  - -  Though each State had its own agriculture : yet , in those days , the States designated as the Agricultural States , were the Southern States , whose interests were diametrically opposite to the growing Navigation interests of the Northern and Eastern States . It would have been as wrong to provide for Agricultural , ( there were then no Manufacturing classes ) as for Navigation interests  --  But as Navigation interests might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it became the care of the committee to provide a limitation on this general power , and hence arose that clause in the reported draft , which says , that " No Navigation Act shall be passed without the assent of two-thirds of the members present in each House . " This clause was afterwards stricken out  --  by which erasure , the great Eastern Navigation interest , which is decidedly a local , and not a general interest of the Union , is the only local interest which Congress can , at this day , promote , under the Constitution . It has the unlimited and the undoubted power . The manner in which this local interest came to be protected , is this  --  The staple and commercial States , as the Southern States were then called , wished to retain this clause , " lest their commerce should be placed too much under the power of the Eastern States  --  but which these last States were as anxious to reject . The Eastern States , however , notwithstanding their aversion to Slavery , were very willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecute the Slave Trade , provided the Southern States would , in their turn , gratify them by laying no restriction on Navigation Acts . " The matter being difficult to adjust , it was referred to a large committee , consisting of a member from each State , and it resulted in this compromise  --  Slaves were not to be prohibited to be brought into the United States by Congress , before 1808  --  and the above restrictive clause relative to Navigation Acts , was to be omitted . ( See Yats ' debates . ) Thus it is , that an Eastern and a local interest , is in the power of Congress to promote  --  But it can foster and encourage no other , . under the Constitution . /z/ The report of the committee of detail , as connected with the basis previously fixed by the Convention , on which the enumeration of powers was to be made out , is worthy of considerable notice , and I may be pardoned , if I dwell longer on the document , even if I be chargeable with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shew , that they considered the " general interests of the Union " precisely in the sense in which I have used it , to wit , interests , in which each State directly participates- and ' not those interests , in which a majority of the States , or orthe people of the United States , are /z/ solely or principally concerned , and in which others ; at the same time have no share . The evidence of this their construction , is very ample in their own work , submitted to the Convention . In reporting the subjects , or cases for national legislation , there is not one , which is not undeniably as much an object of g-eneraZ-concern in the South , as well as in the North ; in New- Hampshire , as well as in Georgia . All wanted a disciplined militia , an army , a navy , a national coin and currency , public credit , and other means of defence  --  all were directly interested in foreign commerce , and in foreign negotiation  --  all needed some provision to regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . If there be in the reported , or the amended draft , a single subject for their legislation , which is not strictly a " general interest , " in our sense of the term , ( except it be the power to pass navigation laws , now included in the commercial power , which we have seen was agreed to by compromise ) let the advocates for an extended government point it out . It can not be shewn . It would have been unwise and dangerous to invest Congress , with a power to legislate on subjects , in which eight States might be interested , and in which , the other five might have no interest , directly or indirectly . It would have put the minor States in the power of the larger ; it would have invested Congress with a power to legislate unequally upon the States , a species of dangerous legislation , up n which the Convention designed to exclude it . Nature , in forming these States , has not been blindly partial to any one . If she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valuable products , she has not been wanting in her magnificence to the North . They have their advantages too , which are obvious to all .  - -  To put it in the power of Congress to legislate upon any subject , in which there is not an interest in common , between North and South , would be to suffer the majority to enjoy all the blessings given them by nature , and to take , by their influence and their power , from their weaker neighbours , all others , so as to aggrandize and build up , the prosperity of the larger States , upon the ruins of the weaker . The whole scheme and theory of the Constitution , is directly opposed to this , and the construction that would put five States , or a smallpr number , so much in the power of the other nineteen , as to force them to contribute by money , or otherwise , to foster and raise up a manufacturing , or other prominent interest , of those nineteen States , is the construction of a TYRANT and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , In the reported draft , the words " common defence and general welfare , " are not attached to the " taxing power , " nor arc such words to be found ift any part of the draft . How they came to be inserted , will be hereafter explained . In the Committee 's draft of a Constitution , the word " canal or military roads , or manufactures , " is not mentioned , though , as will be seen , in due time , these words were in familiar use at the time , in the Convention .  - -  Even the word " post roads , " is omitted in this draft . It stands , " to establish post offices , " not " Post Offices and Post Roads , " as it now reads . This is the more extraordinary , as in Mr. Pinckney 's draft , referred to the Committee , there was a power " to establish Post and MILITARY Roads , " and also , a power " to establish and provide for a N A TION AL University , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the Committee reported against Post Roads , Military Roads , and against the Uni- /z/ versity . How could they do otherwise . The construction of Roads was a matter to which the States were separately competent ; though they were not so for a Post Office . The establishment of an University , was for the interests of science . This formed no motive for the States to enter into Union , and to give up so much of their sovereignty In fact , these propositions did not fall within the meaning of Mr. Randolph 's sixth resolution . The power to establish Post roads , was afterwards restored , six States in favor , and five in the negative . If considered , it is an harmless power .  - -  Probably , the opposition arose from the fear that it might be regarded as a power to construct roads , and such actually has been the case . Mr. Clay and others , are of this opinion . But the construction is a wrong one . To establish a post road , is nothing more than to designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail is to be carried . If there be any doubt on the subject , the acts of Congress , relative to Post Roads , from the foundation of the Government to this day , incontrovertibly establish this construction . When Congress usurped its powers in making the Cumberland and other National Roads , the phraseology used in the acts , was peculiar .  - -  It is remarkable . In the one case , the title of the act is , " An act to estab lish certain Post Roads . " The enacting clause is , " The following Post Roads shall be established , viz. from Passamaquoddy , in the District of Maine , to St. Mary 's , in Georgia , by the following route f* and then follow the names of cities , towns , and villages  --  thus establishing the principle , that to establish a post road , is , to fix upon the posts , where the mail is to be stopped and opened . But when the national roads were ordered , the titles of the acts are different , and the words are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated for the work . There being no appropriation when the acts passed , " to establish certain post roads , " and upwards of a million of dollars , when the national roads were opened , shews the substantial difference between establishing a road , and constructing a road . Congress itself , having admitted this distinction , by its own acts , and thus shewn its own sense of the meaning of the power to " establish roads , " it would be a waste of time in me , to say more on this point . The University was several times proposed . First , by Mr. Pinckney , in his draft , but never reported on , and at last , finally rejected in Convention , on the 14th September , on a motion to insert a power for the pur* pose . The proposition for " military roads , " was never renewed . When the Post Roads were only squeezed in by one vote , there could be no hope of military roads being acceptable . The proposition was put to sleep , by /the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thirty years , the dangerous elements of power , buried by the Convention in 1787 , are all carefully disinterred ; and , to provide for their removal , in due and solemn state , they are placed in that splendid sarcophagus , the memorable report of Mr. Calhoun , the then Secretary of War , " on Roads and Canals . " If there are amongst us , those who take any delight in grand Military Roads through our country , which the Government may , from time to time project and construct , let them be told , that these roads will only augment the patronage of the Government , and diminish that of the States , and that they must be constructed at an enormous expense , the principal burthen of which we must bear , and that the day may possibly come , though not in this generation , when these roads and canals , may become the mcans , as they will the monuments , of the subjugation of the South . /z/ The vestiges of ancient ' toads in many parts of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans . For my part , feeling and speaking as a Southerner , and situated as we now are , if I have any wish on the subject of roads , it would be , that the great Alleghany Ridge should diverge from our North Western limits Westward ly , until it should intersect the Western boundary of Louisiana , thence along that boundary until it reaches the Gulf of Mexico ; and that it should again be extended with its spurs along our Northern boundary , until it reached the Atlantic ; that the five plantation or cotton growing States , those States which are bearing , and are yet to bear , the brunt of the evils of a consolidated and an usurped Government , might be the SEA and MOUNTAIN girt States of the Confederacy . We want no military roads from North to South . If the roads will enable the North Carolina and Tennessee men to bring us their cotton , and their hogs , and their corn and bacon , I shall be satisfied . As to enemies , Europe has no motive , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not its rivals in agriculture , trade , or manufactures . Now , that we are independent , Nature has bound us together in cords of perpetual friendship . We raise the raw material , and they manufacture it for us . It is the people of the NORTH , I fear . When their industry begins to languish from the competitors they have in Europe , they would involve us in their disputes , arising from competition , this prolific source of wars and contention , and they would make us the ASS that is to bear all the burden and expense of the contest . It must not  --  it can not be endured . The power to create a corporation , is not in the reported draft of the Constitution . It would have been a departure from the outline agreedupon . It was not in the enumerated powers of the Confederation . It was not a case of " general interest , " nor was - it " a case of legislation to which the States were separately incompetent . ' ' So far from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say , that the exercise of such a power , by a State , is a case in which the harmony of the Union can be interrupted by State legislation . But there were not wanting efforts , to give to Congress this power , for on the 1 8th of August , a motion was made , to add to the enumerated powers , a power " to grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them , and the authority of a single State may be incompetent . 71 Another proposition ? was general , and made on the same day , ' ' to grant charters of incorpoiation . " If the powers to establish a National Bank was not the design of these propositions , and seen through by the opponents of the measure , whV 1 were they introduced , and particularly the first . That corporation could be , for no other than a national purpose ; to the creation of which , so as to answer all its purposes , " the authority of a single State would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bank . A State might create a Bank , and upon a most extensive scale as to capital ; but a State could not direct that its notes should be received for taxes , or duties out of its own limits . No State could create a Bank to answer the exigencies of the General Government , as well as a Bank created under the au thority of such a Government . The United States , upon an emergency , might restrain a Bank of its own creation from paying out specie . It might possess many advantages , of which it would be deprived , if confined to the use of a local Bank . Under this power to create corporations , might be in- /z/ eluded the erection of a great East-India or West-India Company , ' or a Company to promote manufactures . But what was the fate of these propositions ? They were referred to a committee , but never reported on favourably . On the 14th of September , when the Constitution had been revised , and almost ready for engrossing , the subject was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , a power " to grant letters of incorporation for canals , " &c.; which motion was negatived , eight States to three .. Here we have a FACT , and an INFERENCE , which no ingenuity can put aside . The fact is , that a proposition was made to add to the enumerated powers of Congress , a power to create corporations for national purposes , which proposition was rejected . The inference is , that the Convention was opposed to a National Bank in any shape ; for a National Bank is most prominent , amongst corporations for national purposes . With such evidence as we have on this subject , it would be but a poor reply to say , that the Convention , like the Supreme Court , regarded a corporation as a means to an end , and not a substantive power  --  and that this consideration alone might have caused its rejection . The reasoning in my eleventh number forbids this idea .  --  What a solecism in politics , that an assemblage of the wisest men in the nation , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds and ends of power , and that they should , at the same time , intend that powers ten times as great , should be used as means to other powers . A National Bank , with a capital of one buqdred millions of dollars , is a means to " collect a tax , " and a WestIndia Company by charter , may also be means . The present British East India Company , I believe , keeps in pay 250,000 troops  --  decent meant tftcse , with a vengeance ! This ( Joctrine of a " means to an end " may be the doctrine of the Supreme Court , and of the Manufacturers at Washington , but it will as certainly be a means to the END OF OUR PROSPERITY in the South , as that the sparks will fly upwards . The word Bank is not to be found in the journals of the Convention , nor in the secret debates . Canals , and military roads , and manufactures , universities and seminaries of knowledge , all were thought of : Even a power " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed  --  and yet no one proposed a Bank by that name . Can any one believe , that a National Bank was not as much in the minds of the members as a National University  --  doubtless it was . It was , designed to be concealed in the proposed power to create corporations  --  and the reason , probably , of its not being introduced more openly , was the conviction that such a proposition , would , with certainty , be rejected by the People , if not by the Convention . In the state of jealousy , which existed in the Convention , and out of doors , on the subject of the powers , which were to be conferred on the new Government , there is no saying , what the consequences would have been , had such an engine in the hands of government , as a National Bank was considered to be by the people at large , been added to their powers  --  As it was , such was the difference of opinion in the Convention , as to the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of Mr. Luther Martin , " they were for near two weeks , on the verge of dissolution , scarcely held together by the strength of an hair , though the public papers /z/ Were announcing their extreme unanimity . " * Had the Convention not debated secretly , we never should have bad the present Government . We are , however , wise beyond the Convention . We have discov ered , by the keys furnished us by the Supreme Court  --  powers which these men never dreamed of our possessing . There was a , time , when Congress traced its steps on the ground of usurpation , with considerable caution . There is a remarkable instance of this in their usurped power in opening roads . When the first Act passed to open the great Cumberland Road , there was an express provision that on the surveys being completed , and the expence estimated , the President should not . commence the work , without first obtaining ; the consent of the States through which the road was to pass . But , becoming bold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed , and they have been opened under acts of Congress , in which there is no stipulation for the previous consent of the States . They open roads now without leave or license . It might be gratifying , if we could compare the cost of the national roads and canals on the North , and to the South of the Potomac . But , after all , what , are these roads and canals to us ? What is it to us whether the Androscoggin and other streams be examined or not examined , witji a view to a communication with the St. Lawrence ' ? Will a market that shall thus be opened for some of the most valur able productions of the State of Maine benefit us ? What is it to ui whether the great Cumberland Road be kept in repair or not ? -r r whether the Sandusky Turnpike , and the other Road Companies fail for want of funds or not ? What is the . Delaware and Chesapeake Canal Company to us , that the money of the Nation should be appropriated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriching the citizens pf he North , at our expense . Has the . Government subscribe/ ! tt our SANTEE CANAL COMPANY ? Think ye , that they will ever open a Canal from Winyaw Bay to Wandb River , or aid a company for that purpose ? . Will they ever dig this Canal  --  a Canal , that , in tiwe of war , would be so important ? ' . Do we hear of their extending our State Road through the Saluda Mountain , to the Western country , which will benefit five States ? ' , 1s not this aq much national , as the improve.meni of the , navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers ? It is only the other day that the Governor of Boston asked the Secretary of War for the United States Engineers , to assist , in surveying the Canal from Boston to the Hudson ; but the answer is , they are all so busily employed , that they can not be spared . Where are they employed ? Are they in South-Carolina , or are they located North of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for FURTHER DEFENCE AGAINST THE BRITISH ? Why not augment them , to three or four brigades of Engineers , and thus empty the National Treasury into the laps of the Northerners ? 1 We are not yet sufficiently fleeced . The GREAT SOUTHERN GOOSE will yet bear more PLUCKING. /z/ We do not find in the proceedings of the Convention , the worf " Manufactures , " or any motion relative to the encouragement of them , until the 18th of August . The Convention , having at that time , disposed of most of the clauses in the reported Constitution , as far as the end of the enumerated powers , many additional powers , were on that day proposed to be vested in Congress . Amongst them , was a g power " to establish public institutions , rewards and immunities* for the promotion of AGRICULTURE , Commefce/Trades , and MANUFACTURES . " On the 20th of August , another proposition was made , to wit , " that a Council of State should assist the President , to be composed of the Chief Justice , and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The duty of the Secretary of DOMESTIC affairs , was , " to attend to matters of general police , the state of AGRICULTURE and MANUFACTURES , the opening of ROADS a'nd NAVIGATION , ( internal improvements ) and the facilitating communications throughout the United States , and to recommend such measures and establishments , as might tend to promote suck objects " I do not discover in the journals , any thing else relating to Manufactures , eo nomine , excepting the above . Both of the above propositions having failed , we might reasonably conclude , that the Convention , refused to give to Congress tbe power to promote Domestic Manufactures , as well as internal improvements . But it is not from the mere failure , to have these clauses inserted in the Constitution , that we would infer a clear and unequivocal intention , that to the States alone , were to be left the regulation of the different branches of internal industry . There are other considerations which establish the fact beyonil doubt . The above propositions , made on the 18th and 20th of August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , together with sundry others ; some relating to public seminaries of learning ; some to the unappropriated lands of the United States ; some to the government of the new States to be created ; some to authorize the President to hold landed property for the use of forts and magazines ; and last , and not least , as , we shall hereafter see , was a proposition to restrain Congress from establishing a perpetual revenue under its taxing power , pn the 22d of August , the committee made a short report , proposing , inter alia , that a seventeenth enumerated ' power , be added to the sixteenth clause , in these words , " and to provide , as may become necessary , from time to time , for the well managing and securing , the common property , and general interests and welfare of the United States , in such manner , as shall not interfere , with the governments of individual States , in matters which respect only their internal police , or for which their individual authority may be competent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one thing is clear , that under so genera a power to provide for the general welfare , Manufactuies could as well be promoted , as could any other act be done , for which there was no previous provision . This part of the report , however , was not acted upon , and on the 3 1st of August , we find , that all such reports as had been post* /z/ f oned , " and such parts of reports as had not been acted upon , " were referred to a committee , to be composed of a member from each State . The next day , the 1st of September , this grand committee 44 reported partially " but did not touch the subject of science , trades , canals , or manufactures . On the 4th , the committee again " reported partially " but said nothing of manufactures . On the 5th , the committee " reported further and finally " recommending alterations and additions , in five instances . The last is , to insert this clause  --  " To pro* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by securing , for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . " I ought to have mentioned , that in their report of the previous day , to wit , of the 4th , this same committee did propose to add to the taxing power , these words : " to pay the debts , and to provide for the common defence and general welfare . It was necessary that they should make some report on this head , because many motions had been previously made , as will be seen hereafter , to restrain the taxing power , one of which was so rigorous , as to confine it to the debts and . the necessary expenses of the United States . I hope to shew in my next , that these words were intended as a limitation , and not an enlargement of the appropriating power . The above clause , " to promote the progress of science and the useful arts , " was , as I conceive , a report of the grand . committee against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposition of the Constitution , this clause has been relied on , as restraining the power of Congress , on the subject of Manufactures . In my view , it is ery important . It is important , if considered in the abstract but when taken in connection with the above proceedings of the Convention , I do regard it as conclusive . And first , let us consider the clause as it stands in the Constitution . What does it amount to ? It is a power to promote science and the useful arts . What are the useful arts ? They are those arts or occupations , which are carried on , with a view to profit in contradistinction to such as are pusued for pleasure , which are called the liberal or polite arts . Are manufactures to be classed among the useful arts ? Throughout the civilized world , Agriculture and Manufactures , stand at the head of the useful arts . All men musttassent to this . Here then , is a clear power vested in Congress by the Contitution , to promote Agriculture and Manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is a limited power . How is it limited ? It is limited , inasmuch , as the mode by which these arts are to be encouraged , is not left to construction , but is expressed in words , which have a clear and a definite meaning . They shall promote the useful arts , BY securing to ingenious men patents for their inventions . " Now , if a power to promote a specific object , by a prescribed mode , does not exclude , the power to . promote it by a different , or other mode , there is no truth in the law maxim , " expressio untus est exclusio aUerius . " Let us familiarly illustrate this . When the old Congress found itself inadequate to carry on the Government for the . want of a direct legislation on the people , it re* /z/ peatedly and earnestly solicited the States , at different times , for a power to raise a revenue by small imposts , to be limited in amount , as well as duration . Had an amendment been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Congress , " to regulate commerce by the imposition of certain duties on West India produce , surely , no one could contend , that the words of the grant , would not exclude the power to regulate commerce , by duties on European goods , and by the various modes practised by the present Government , whose power over commerce is exclusive . ' So , a power to raise a revenue by a capitation or other direct tax , would certainly exclude the power to lay imposts , or to come at a revenue by any means , but a direct tax . In the clause before us , as in the instances just cited , the mode of expression is indubitably exclusive . Manufactures are to be encouraged , but they are to be promoted in one way only , to wit  --  by the reward of an exclusive right , to the use of a new machine or invention . The grant of power in question , is , what lawyers would term an AFFIRMATIVE PREGNANT , that is , an affirmance of one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of Congress , to promote the progress of science and the arts , by patents and copy rights , and a negation of their authority , to encourage them in any other way . There are in the Constitution , other articles of a nature allied to this . For instance  --  Congress shall have power ' * to define and punish felonies on the high seas . " The power here given to define a felony at sea , implies an admission , that if such a power were not given , Congress would be excluded the use of the power altogether ; and it further implies , that the power of defining felonies on land , solely and exclusively belongs to the States . There are , it is true , two cases in which it can define or punish felonies on land ; but in these cases , there are two special grants of power , by two separate clauses in the Constitution . It can " provide for the punishment of counterfeiting its current coin and securities ; " and it has " the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be found NEGATIVES PREGNANT , as well as affirmatives pregnant . The prohibition to the States laying any " duties on imports or exports " is one of this kind . The restriction which prevents them laying any " duty on tonnage " is another . The prohibition to their keeping troops or ships of war in a time of peace , is a third . The prohibition of any interference as to the slave trade , is a , fourth . In all these cases , though the restrictions amount to a negation to do the particular acts mentioned , yet there is an affirmance of the authority of Congress in the last instance , to prohibit the slave trade after 1808 ; and in the first instances , of the States to lay a land tax , an excise , a ' stamp duty , or any other tax , ( provided it be not an impost or export duty , or duty on tonnage ) ami ' there is the same authority to_the Hvy troops or equip frigates , during u period of war . ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ! ' . ' ' : i * * . The clause far promoting manufactures by patents , is ( hen clearly an affimqttoi pregnant . Under its peculiar mode of expression , it /z/ oannot be conceived , that the Convention could deem it necessary to give Congress the power to promote the arts by a particular mode , if it designed to give the liberty of adopting any , and all other modes , of effecting the same object . If the meaning was not , to exclude Congress from any general power of encouraging the arts and sciences , why mention the words at all . There certainly was no necessity for it . These words , are not to be found in any of the propositions , which were submitted on the subject of patents and copy-rights . One proposition was , " to secure to literary authors their copy-rights for a limited time . " A second , " to grant patents for useful inventions . " A third , " to secure to authors , exclusive rights for a certain time . 9 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , to have reported the amendment to read , " to secure for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries , " leaving out the first part of the sentence " to promote the progress of science and the useful arts . But the reason of the committee 's using the words last mentioned , is manifest . Manufactures and the sciences had been talked of  - -  various propositions in relation to them , were before the committee ; and a previous committee , had reported a specific power , to provide for the general welfare , so as to reach these cases . The report was not acted upon , and the subject afterwards falling into the hands of the present committee , it became their duty to report for or against science and manufactures . They do report , and recommend a power for this purpose  --  not , however , by seminaries of learning  --  not by public institutions , rewards , or immunities* as proposed , but simply by encouraging inventions to facilitate labor  --  as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To promote the arts and sciences , in this way , was to confer a benefit , not upon one portion , but upon every part of the Union . It is for the benefit of each , and there fore , to the advantage of all the States , that authors and ingenious mechanics , should receive in this way , the patronage of the Government : But to give premiums and pecuniary bounties , or to prohibit the export of any material of manufactures  --  or to restrict the great import trade , of which the Southern States , even at that day , were so jealous , was not the intention of the Convention ; it did not choose to leave the question open , whether Congress should do what it is now doing , to wit  --  to restrict our trade by Tariff duties , almost amounting to prohibition . As the subject was before the Convention , the members of that body , took the opportunity to express themselves , that they were averse to any national encouragement of science or manufactures , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the friends of science in the Convention , considered this clause , as exclusive of any power to promote science in general  --  and that they , moreover , could not afterwards seek for it , in the appropriating power " for the general welfare , " would appear , by their solicitude upon the subject . On the 14th of September , as the Constitution was about to be finished and engrossed , the motion was renewed for the third time , to add a power , to estaYAV &Yt; Yttsre x /z/ which motion was lost , six States to four , and one divided  --  there not being in the Convention , the same interest for manufactures , as there was for science  --  there being no calico printers or woollen weavers , occuping the benches of the Convention , as is the case in the present Congress ; the Convention , in fact , being composed of men , more literary than they were avaricious , is probably the reason , why the manufacturers , like the University men , did not come again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They , however , did not . They quietly submitted to that article in the Constitution , which limits the national protection , only to patent* and copy-rights . Three dear propositions result from what has been said : First  - -  That there was an attempt made in Convention , to give Congress , i power to promote science , agriculture , and manufactures . Secondly  --  That a committee reported , a specific power for that purpose , to be added to those already enumerated  --  which report was not agreed to . And thirdly  --  That an express provision was made , to protect these objects , but only to a limited extent . These propositions being established , upon what grounds , can a general power over the subject of manufactures , be assumed ? " Prohibitory " duties by Congress , was a word not mentioned in Convention . The only encouragement asked for , was , public rewards and immunities Had they proposed protection by prohibitory duties , the Southern States would have taken the alarm , and expressed the same desire for a positive limitation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation interests of the Eastern States : a great manufacturing interest to rise up in the States , was in truth , not much thought of in those days . But the navigation interests of the Eastern people , were before their eyes* It was this growing interest in the Colonies , of which England was so jealous , and her restrictions on which , no doubt , contributed to the - revolution , more than any other cause . These local interests we have seen , by a former number , the Southern States consented to be provided for , by a special compromise . xroTis . It appears by the acts of the Convention , that though it was deemed unadvisable to entrust Congress with a power to promote any great local interest of particular States , yet , that it was considered , that there would be a manifest impropriety , in depriving any one - State , which might choose to encourage its own Manufactures , of the means of doing so . The usual mode , by which Domestic Manufactures are encouraged , we all know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fry duties ; but all other modes are inexpedient and inefficient , when compared with prohibition . If Congress could " not lay prohibitory duties , except for the general purposes of the Government , and the States could not impose them , to protect Manufactures , one great motive to the Union , would have been defeated , which was , that the States should not , as regarded their internal relation , or their power to regulate their own industry , be in a worse  --  jmation than before . Hence , it became necessary , that the State 's /z/ should not be deprived of the power of laying prohibitory duties for the convenience of their imports or exports , or for the purpose of protecting their own Manufactures . When* therefore , that clause in the Constitution came to be considered , which restricts the States from laying duties on imports or exports , the subject of Manufactures directly came into discussion . As this clause originally stood in the reported draft of the Constitution , the restriction was , only as to imposts , not exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall lay imposts or duties upon imports . " By this partial restriction , each State still possessed the power , to encourage its own manufactures , by duties , to prohibit the exportation of its wool , or other raw material . On the 28th of August , a motion was made to extend the prohibition to exports , which was carried ; six States to five , a bare majority . The discussion on this article , brought forth Luther Martin , the deputy from Mary laud , who strenuously opposed the article in all its shapes ; but he could not succeed . So determined was the Convention , that the power of the States , as to import and export duties , should not be concurrent with that of Congress , and that the General Government should exclusively possess this source of taxation , that instead of softening , it was disposed to make the prohibition more rigorous . On the same day , therefore , an additional restriction , was introduced into the clause , nine States to four , that even with the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxed by the States , but " for the use of the treasury of the United States . Thus stood the clause in the revised draft of the Constitution , presented to the Convention , on the 12th day of September , five days before its adjournment . On the 13th , an amendment was proposed and carried , " that no State should be restrained from imposing the usual duties on produce , exported from Buch State , to pay the charges of inspecting that produce . " But , on the 15th , a substitute was moved , and after two other motions for amendment , the substitute was put aside , and the clause finally agreed to as follows :  --  " No State shall , without Ike consent of Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws ; and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State , on imports or exports , shall be for the'Hse of the Treasuty of the United States , and all such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Congress . 9 ' Were an hundred men , to read this clause in the Constitution , I would venture to say , that'ninety and nine for a while , would be ignorant of the true design of its introduction . The question , had over and over again occurred to my mind , ' what could the Convention intend ? Mr. Hamilton , in his Federalist , is almost silent on the subject . His reason may be conjectured from what is to follow . That the framers of the Constitution , who ' disputed so much as to the phraseology of this- clause , intended something more , than to give the States the power to impose trifling duties to execute ; their inspection laws for cotton , tobacco , &; &; : is too evident ; because , independently of the power to lay dutto* : for their inspection laws , . i /z/ which may be done , without the consent of Congress previously tained , there is a clear and a distinct provision , that the States may , on applying for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other purposes . What purposes can these be ? Can it be , to give the States now and then , a chance of some little revenue . The clause itself , decidedly gives the answer . The produce of the duties , when laid , is to go into the National , and not into a State Treasury . Then , what does it mean 1 Abstractedly considered , it is inexplicable , and tome , and perhaps to others , would have remained so , had not the subject of domestic manufactures , come into discussion . The design of the clause is now at * seen . A satisfactory explanation is instantly within our reach .. It was inserted , for the purpose of enabling such States as were desirous of protecting their own manufactures , either by export duties on their raw materials , or by imposts on foreign fabrics introduced into their limits , TO DO SO , WITH THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS . No other solution is admissible . If this was not the intent of the provision , I defy the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , it is an useless and a stupid clause of the Constitution . It is however , most fortunate for us , that the debates of the Convention , are at hand , to rescue us from further doubt , or difficulty on the point . Let us hear Mr. Martin , bitterly complaining to his own State of the total injustice , in his view , of this clause . " By this same section , " says he , " every State is also prohibited from laying any imposts or duties on imports and exports , without the permission of the General Government . It was urged by us , that there might be cases , in which , it would be proper* for the purpose of encouraging manufactures , toiay duties , to prohibit the exportation of raw materials ; and even in addition to the duties laid by Congress , on imports for the sake of revenue , to lay a duty , to discourage the importation of particular articles into a State , or to enable the manufacturer here , to supply us on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign market But the Ynost we could obtain , was , that this power MIGHT BE EXERCISED by the STATES with , and onlf with the consent of Congress , and subject to its control . And s6 anxious were they , to seize on every shilling of our money for the General Government , that they insisted , even the little revenue that might thus arise , should not be appropriated , to the use of the respective State 's where it was collected , but should be paid into the Treasury of the United States ; and , accordingly , it is so determined . " ( Secret debates , page 1. ) i Thus , we have all . out doubts dissipated as to this otherwise singular provision in the instrument ; and thus too , we have a fresh instance of the wisdom ! of the Convention . A mode has been provided , by which , at any time , the people of any one State . or number of States , may protect theit manufactures , without charging the cost of such protection , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous acts of the Convention , we must confess , that it eouldnot have done otherwise , than to make the provision referred qwq rented , as the duties would still have been paid , t into the National Treasury ; and 1 am certain , the Southern members of Congress io those three different years , would cheerfully have indulged these folks , and will still indulge them , with a protection in this way , as long as it will not too seriously affect the revenue . Whether Congress will now , or at any time hereafter , give up to the States the least atom of their power over imposts , I know not : But this 1 do know , that in refusing to give to the States , a chance now and then , of protecting their Manufactures in this way , ( if the States choose to ask it , ) Congress would not honestly execute the trust , reposed in it by the Constitution .  --  That , however , would not be our look out. * I am not ignorant , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of any one State , New-York for instance , to join in any such application ; for , whilst such a scheme would suit the Manufacturers , it ftvould interfere with other important interests : All persons in such ft* State , connected with commerce , such as merchants and traders , shipwrights , cordwainers , sail-makers , &c.; would be seriously injured . The importation of British goods into New- York would be diminished , on account of the high and double duties , and the Custom-Houses of Charleston , and other ports , where only the national duties were to be exacted , would be filled to overflowing , to say nothing of the ruinous effects upon the overgrown commerce of New-York , to be produced in various ways , and particularly by the British taxing their produce , and exempting ours .  - -  But the manufacturers will say , what then are we to do ?

But to cease with familiar illustrations , there certainly does arise from this view of the subject , a pos ion which is impregnable , to- wit :  --  If in any one State , or any number of States , in which there is a clamor for protection , there can be such a diversity of opinion or of interest , that the manufacturers , can not in any one instance , ( which I do firmly believe to be the case ) succeed in a Legislative application to Congress , for leave to lay imposts , and thus to avail themselves of that article in the Constitution , expressly provided to enable such State or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , that in such State or States , the MANUFACTURING interest is not the predominant l , or PARAMOUNT interest .

It is only on the ground , of its being a general inter- /z/ est in the United States , that a National protection can he advocated . and maintained . What is not a general , or a paramount interest in , any one State of the Union , can not , by any process of reasoning , be decided to be a general interest of the twenty-four States .

She would have to do , what all other nations have done before her . She would have to compel her citizens to wear the home made fabrics , by imposing high duties , so as to exclude the rival foreign articles .

If ' Massachusetts then , will have manufactures , Massachusetts must be content to have them upon the usual terms . Her own citizens - must pay the cost , whether it be , directly , by taxes for premiums , or pecuniary bounties , or indirectly , by a tax upon consumption of the home fabric .

LOCAL interest , not half so important , as the Cotton Planting interest of the South , in which there is a far greater capital embarked , than there is in manufactures . Congress can not promote , the great Cotton Planting interest of South-Carolina , nor can it encourage the manufacturing interest of the North . And why 1  --  Because these are local interests of the States , and not the general interests of the Union . Congress can lay its imposts for revenue , and if in laying these imposts for revenue , it can at the , same time encourage this , or that branch of local or internal induff* /z/ W* fSkv iXk &; atone time a little advantage to the Sugar Planters of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North , there is no harm in this .

On this principle , manufactures were judiciously encouraged , till 1812 , inclusive . Commerce , thereby , was- , not shackled or interrupted . But , since 1812 , all the Tariffs have ? been gross usurpations of power by Congress . xroTie . I proceed to say something on the subject of those general phrases in the @#@ ' constitution , which constitute in the hands of the General Government/ , the great lever by which the State Sovereignties are ultimately to besubverted from their foundations . Congress it seems , has power " to lay and coflect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States . " It is from these words , " general welfare , " that a power is claimed to open navigation between the States , to dig canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose Tariffs , to the extent of a total prohibition of the valuable commerce of . the Southern States . It is under cover of these words that the ( Society , with Judge Washington at its head , with the sanction of some State Legislatures , and with the prayers of many Societies and Conventions , is to march to the Capitol in December next , and to demand the aid of the Government for our flourishing and favorite Negro Colony at Liberia . It is under these same words , as the present President contends , that Congress can adopt any measuie whatever , which it shall judge necessary to promote the general welfare . And also under this exposition is it , that the ultra fanatics and abolitionists of the North contend , that Congress can alter , whenever it pleases , the whole domestic policy of South-Carolina . In this view of the subject , these words " general welfare " are becom- - ing every day more and more important to the folks , who are now so peaceably raising their cotton and rice , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be recollected , is not simply , whether we are to have a foreign commerce .

It is not whether we are to be taxed without end . It is not whether we are to have our Northern brethren , as our task masters , and to make bricks for them without straw . But the still more interesting question is , whether the institutions of our forefathers , those institutiops under which we have been born , and under which all of us , bondmen as well as free , have enjoyed in the whole , as much of happiness as generally falls to the lot of any one nation on earth , are to be preserved according tp ancient usage , free from the rude hands of innovators and enthusiasts , and from the molestation or interference of any legislative power on earth but pur own ? Or whether , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the WestIndies , we are to drag on a miserable state of political existence , constantly vibrating between our hopes and our fears , as to what a Congress may do towards us , without any accurate knowledge of our probable fate , and ' without a hope of successful resistance ? l /z/ : This , my MloiMcilfflWis , is an awful question , bat awful as ft is it is c question on which , sooner or later , we must all pass a final judgment  - -  We deceive ourselves if we think , that there can be any evasion .

No clause in the Constitution , in my view , has been more perverted in , : its meaning than this . But it is not surprising . When the Sup rem* Court of the United States solemnly adjudges that the power given tCy Congress to pass the " necessary and proper laws , " to execute its enume-v rated powers , is an enlargement , and not a limitation of those powers ( the contrary of which . I have demonstated to be the fact , from the jour- , nais of the Convention , ) is it to be wondered , that the same mistake* should occur in the interpretation of the clause in question ? The term w general welfare , ' ' I contend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of Congress to the enumerated objects . Should I fail in my proof , J hope I shall have given as good reasons for my constructions , as those on the opposite side , can for theirs . If 1 adduce facts which even render the interpretation either way , as not conclusive , I *hall have rendered some service to ray country . South-Carolina is not to pay tribute money , or have her domestics insubordinate , under a disputed , and doubtful construction of the Constitution . When the draft of the Constitution was reported to the Convention , onj the 6th of August , it was generally understood , as being in conformity with the outlines agreed upon in the amended resolutions of Mr. Randolph , If the committee did deviate , from the letter or spirit of the outlines sol given , it could only be , from misconception of their instructions . It does/ not , however , appear , that they did in any one instance , misunderstand them . In . their enumeration of powers , tbey were , by their instructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of general interest . They did so as well as they could . What escaped their notice , was afterwards provided for , by additional enumerated powers . That this Cora rait te ever intended , that the legislation of Congress should extend over any subject , which was not particularly provided for in their enumeration of powers , is contradicted by the important fact , that they used , in their reported draft , no general phrases , under which might be concealed a - single latent power . The words " common defence , " or " general welfare , " or any words of similar import , are not to be found in any part of the reported draft of the Constitution , not even in its preamble ; and it appears further , that those words are not , up to that date , in any part of the- journals , neither in Mr. Pinckney 's draft , nor in Mr. Randolph 's resolutions . In the Constitution reported by the committee of detail , the /z/ toeing clause stood thus : u The Legislature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises . " In Mr. Pinckney 's draft , referred to the committee , the words are the same* When this clause , on the l6th of August , was in its turn , called up for consideration , a motion was made for a proviso " to restrain Congress from taxing the exports of a State . " The consideration of the proviso was postponed , almost unanimously . It was an unnecessary amendment , because there was already amongst the limitations on the power of Con* gress , the same provision . Be this as it may , we may presume , that the clause required consideration , and that this may have been one reason for its postponement On the 18th , we find this motion , " that a ' clause or clauses be prepared to restrain the Legislature of the United States , from establishing a perpetual revenue " the meaning of which I understand to be , that no money should be raised by taxes , unless it should be needed for the common purposes of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to extend the appropriating power of the government . The committee , to whom this proposition was referred , must have understood , that there was a disposition in the Convention , to limit the appropriating power , for on the 22d , they report , that the clause should read  --  to lay- taxes , &c.; for the payment of the debts , and necessary expenses of the United States , provided , that no law for raising any branch of revenue , except it be specially appropriated for the payment of . interest on debts , or loans , shall continue in force more than  --  years . " This limitation of the committee , it is true , was not finally agreed to ; but I introduce it to shew , that there was a jealousy in the Convention , as to the power of raising taxes , without specifying the purposes #@# for which they were intended . It was to guard against useless taxation , which might be followed by waste and extravagance in the public expenditure . Between the time , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration , to wit , on the J 6th , and the time the committee of detail re* ported as above , on the 22d , Mr. Rutlkdge , the chairman of that com* fnittee , had moved , that " Congress should consider the necessity , and ex* pediency of the debts of the several States , being assumed by Congress , " and a committee of eleven was appointed for this purpose . This committee of eleven had reported on the 21st , " that the Legislature shall have power to fulfil the engagements , which had been entered into by Congress , and to discharge as well the debts of the United States , as the debts incurred by the several States during the late vrar 9 for the common defence and general welfare . " This is the first time ( the 2 1 st of Augusc ) that the words ** common defence and general welfare/ 9 appear on the Journals of the Conventions ; and no doubt it was this report , as to a provision for the public debt , which caused the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have just referred , to propose to add to the taxing clause ' the words , " to pay the debts and necessary expenses of the United States , ' r &c.; In this same report , on the 22d of August , was the specific power proposed , as a seventeenth enumerated power , ( alluded to in a preceding number ) to enable Congress to provide for the general welfare , &c.; which report I considered as made in favour of manufactures , but was never agreed to . This js the second time ( the 22d ) that the words " ge neral welfare , " are mentioned . On the 23d , when the taxing power was again called up , a motion was made to amend it , so as to read , " The /z/ Legislature shall fulfil the engagements , and " discharge the debts of the United States , and shall have the power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises . " This motion was carried . On the 25th it was reconsidered , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tiie payment of the debts , and for defraying the expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare ; " which motion was lost . Thus the limitation voted for on the 23d remained . But on the 4th , the committee made a report , and amongst other things recommended that the clause should read , " to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States ; " and it was thus finally agreed to . If there be one inference clearer than another , from the foregoing statement of facts , it is , that there existed in the Convention a clear intention , not to suffer th' appropriating power of the government , to remain subject to the possibly perverted construction , that it was to be indefinite as to purposk , as well as illimitable as to amount . Let us recapitulate : The amendment of the 18th was a limitation on the power to tax unnecessarily . It was to provide against raising a revenue which might not be needed . The proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confining the appropriation to necessary expenses . In that of the 23d , the purpose is first expressed , to wit , " to fulfil the engagements and discharge the debts ; " and then follows the power to tax . Here was a clear limitation again as to purposes . On the 25th , the taxes are to be laid to pay " the expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare . " This again is a limitation as to purpose . If such of the proposed amendments as limit the appropriating power as to its purposes , be attentively considered , it will be seen , that they are all more or less objectionable , and therefore were properly rejected by the Convention . For instance  --  1st . To confine the appropriation to the " neces* sary expenses " of the government , would be too rigorous . E very government must have some latitude of discretion , as to its expenditures for its enumerated , or legitimate objects . 2ndly . To have limited the expenditure to the " engagements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded the debts of the old Confederation , and the assumption of the debts of tht individual States . There existed moreover , another objection to this phraseology ; The taxes ' here , are made the means of executing this particular power , whereas the taxing power must be the great means of executing all the powers . Sdly . To have limited the appropriation to the " expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare , " might possibly imply a doubt , whether Congress ought to lay its taxes prematurely , or before the wants of the Government should be ascertained . These last , are the words in the old Confederation . I do not recollect what the practice was in the old Congress  --  but I do suspect , that the States were never called upon for their supplies in money , or in flour , &c.; until the expenses were ascertained , and the quota of each State adjusted . However , be the objection to this last amendment what I have stated or not , we must all agree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be words , shewing the restrictive sense of the Convention , as to the construction of the appropriating power , the clause is better expressed than it would have been , under any of the amendments . As it now reads , it gives Congress the necessary power to lay its taxes at its /z/ pleasure , by anticipation or otherwise  --  but judiciously confines ceeds , to the general purposes , for which the Government was establish*-ed , the public debt being provided for , by a separate article . Those who reject this rational constitution , that the words " general welfare " were intended to restrict the appropriating power of Congress ) to the enumerated objects , will find themselves reduced to the awkward dilemma , of maintaining a very absurd position , to wit  --  that when a power is given to raise money , without any expression of limits , as to amount , of as to purpose , it is an augmentation of such a power , as soon as the purposes of the appropriation are expressed . The case before us is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his draft , to give Congress a power ' ' to raise taxes , duties , impost and excises . " The Com mi nee report a similar power  --  This power , though apparently illimitable , as to purpose or amount , was not so in fact . Under a general power to raise taxes , Congress can no more appropriate money , to any purpose foreign to the wants of the Government , than any trustee who has an unlimited power to raise money by loans or otherwise , can legally appropriate the money when borrowed , to any other than the purposes of the trust which are expressed in the deed which confers the money-raising power . ' But , let us give the opposite argument every advantage .  --  Here is a power reported by the Committee , which is indefinite every way . It must occur to every mind , that to make any addition to a power to raise money , which already is so expressed , as possibly to be construed to be unlimited as to the purpose , as well as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that power . That which apparently is already unlimited , needs no additional words to strengthen it ; every amendment is likely to weaken it considerably . The history of the clause in question , shews this to be the case . In all the trials to which it was exposed , it was always weakened  --  sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the proposed amendments . As the clause originally stood , who can doubt , but that Congress might , under its phraseology , have pretended to more power than it now claims  --  though , substantially , there is no difference between the two clauses . Under such an unlimited power as the words convey , the vote for the relief of the distressed emigrants from St. Domingo , and that of 100,000 dollars to the inhabitants of Carracas , might have been said to be justified . When this appropriation was voted , it was unconstitutional , because it was not for the general welfare . of the citizens of the United States , to which the restriction confines the appropriations of the Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million of dollars might , under some colour of authority , be given to the Greeks ; as much more to the SouthAmerican Patriots ; millions might be voted to extend Christianity in heathen countries , or to civilize that quarter of the globe which is becoming so very interesting to an American Congress  --  the continent of Africa . But who would now contend , that we could give money to the Greeks , or to the South- American Patriots . And how is ' it , that we can not be thus generous , when there is no express prohibition in the Constitution  --  The answer is a plain one . It is the additional words " general welfare " to the original clause . If then it is the amendment to the original taxing clause , that prevents Congress from now doing , what it might have had a pretext to do , before such an amendment was made*- ; ! hat amendment ; must of necessity be a limitation on the appropriating power . Il is the lioiitattou /z/ ts to the purposes of appropriation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a power , which from its phraseology ) might have been assumed to be unlimited ) that restricts Congress to such appropriations only as can be referred to the common defence and general welfare of the States . If , then , the words constitute a limi* tation in this sense , they can not enlarge the appropriating power What is intended as , and operates as a limitation , can not be con* strued into an additional or a new power The words " general welfare , " were in truth added to the clause* not because the members of the Convention believed* that , without such a clause , the money appropriating power would in strictness and in truth , be without limits as to the purposes for which money might be voted away . They could not have thought so , for there Were amongst them too many sound lawyers . They could not be lieve , that the words conferred a right to give away money except for national purposes . The words were inserted , ex abundanie cautela . The same extreme caution here prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to pass the necessary laws to execute its powers , and which also induced them to give as sub Stantive powers , those which were incidental to the execution at other powers . There was a fear , that the clause would be liable to misconstruction , if some words were not added to it , to shew the restricted sense in which they would have it considered . The jour* nals of the Convention decidedly shew this . Had these words not been inserted , to a certainty , large sums of money , or frigates , would have been voted to the Greeks a few years ago , when there was such an enthusiasm on the subject amongst the influential members of Congress . And , to a certainty also , pecuniary bounties and pre* mi urns would , ere this , have been voted away by Congress , to ett% courage agriculture , trade , and manufactures ; and even money might have been voted . for State purposes. , As the clause noW stands , no appropriation can be justified , excepting it be for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. M'Duffie , who , in his exposition , of the general phrases itf the Constitution , agrees with Alexander Hamilton , and who , in the debate in 1824 , has gone so very far in his ideas , of the poWer of the Government , as to internal improvements , seemed to regard it as a matter of considerable triumph , when some of his adversaries in the debate , had incautiously contended for a principle , which t agree Could not be maintained , and which I regret was ever advocated .  --  * He thanked them for the admission , that the words , * ' general wel* fare , " were intended to limit a power , which , otherwise , would have been illimitable without them , because he thought , it led to the irre* sistible conclusion , that the discretion of the National Legislature was not to be restricted within any bounds , short of the " common defence and general welfare . 1 * Mr. M'Duffie 's argument in support of this doctrine , is so exces* sively refined , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hi* /z/ compeer in metaphysics , to enter the field of controversy with him* The danger is , that he may he blown " sky high , 9 ' from the ground that he occupies . Like the Chief Justice of the United States , he so states his propositions , that they seem to be almost self-evident . In an instant , our previous impressions vanish , and for a while , we acquiesce , without knowing why or wherefore , in doctrines , which our mature judgment had always regarded as unsound . The promptness too , with which Mr. M'Duffie seizes an advantage , incautiously given him by his adversary , and the dexterity with which he man ages his subsequent movements , is most remarkable . It is the novelty of his plan of attack , and the boldness with which he pushes forward his game , that gives him his superiority in debate . His speech on internal improvements , is a master piece of the powers of reasoning . It is by far the greatest effort which was made in Congress , during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this speech should have been so long considered , as settling the question in favour of the power of Congress to appropriate money for roads and canals . But Mr. M'Duffie 's doctrines , like those of the Supreme Court , have been orthodox , because they never have been thoroughly examined . They were promulgated at a period , when it was deemed a kind of heresy , not to fall into the general views of our politicians at Washington , as to the character which our Government ought to assume . It was to encourage a selfish and sectional feeling , to think of differing from men , who , so far from recollecting , that the General Government was designed to be a Government altogether external in its operations , conceived the enlarged and brilliant scheme , of making it a most splendid edifice , within and without , as calculated to attract notice from its ornaments , as well as its utility . Had Mr. M'Duffie 's antagonists joined issue with him on proper pleadings , they might have insured for themselves a successful competition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands ' of the strong . They did not meet him on the true battle-ground , or they might have wounded this Achilles in the debate , in more places than one . The campaign was badly conducted , both by his friends and his adversaries . Whilst his colleague , Mr. Clay , was employed in contending , that the power over Internal Improvements , might justly be referred to the power " of regulating commerce , " and Mr. M'Lane supported the construction , that to " facilitate " commerce , was substantially to regulate it : Whilst some would deduce the power in question , as a consequence from the right to make war , and others , from the " right to establish Post Roads ; " whilst in fact , all his colleagues were contending , that Congress could make roads , and exercise its sovereignty in this way legitimately , and whilst they were all occupying positions , from which they could easily be dislodged : Mr. Archer , from Virginia , on the other side , instead of contending for the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common defence and general welfare , " were declaratory , and inserted from extreme caution , rather to shew the restrictive sense in which the Convention would have the taxing /z/ power considered , than from any doubt , that in fairness , anjr power could be claimed to appropriate money , except for the enumerated obj cts , most unfortunately admits , that if the words had been omitted , the taxing power would have been unlimited in every way .  --  * Toe eagle eye of Mr. M'Duffie , who , ere this , had not made a single movement to the right or to the left , perceives the opeuing in the enemy 's line , and it is at this critical moment , that he advances with the whole force of his mighty intellect , and occupies a new position , only hinted at by his prototype , lexaxder Hamilton , presenting himself in such views , as to strike his friends and his adversaries with amazement , and with consternation . " As the power under consideration , would have bad no limit without the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity " says Mr. M'Duffie , " that we must look to these words alone , for the limitation "  - -  He therefore sets out with the proposition , that the discretion of the Legislature is within its bounds , as long as its appropriations are for the general welfare ; and , that he may not be in the difficulties of his colleagues , who , if they should fail to refer the exercise of sovereign power contended tor , to some or other of the enumerated objects , must surrender at discretion , he carefully disclaims all pretensions to construct roads and canals , as an ezercise of sovereignty : As a sovereign power , he considers the appropriating power as ending in tfself . When the money is raised and appropriated , sovereignty , he says , ceases ; and whatever else is to be effected , if it can not be done by the agency of money merely , it can not be done at all . If the aid of any sovereign power be at all necessary , to effect the object to which the money is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the appropriation can not be made , without such power is found amongst the enumerated objects . Mr. M'Duffie accordingly maintains , that the spending of the money , after it is appropriated by law , even if it be an hundred million of dollars , on roads to be opened with the consent of States , is no more an act of sovereignty , than the purchase of a horse , for a messenger of either house of Congress , would be an act of sovereignty , or the making of a road through a State by an individual , with the consent of the Legislature , would make that individual a sovereign . Now , to a man of plain sense , it would seem to be a matter of some consequence , as between a State and the United States , that when Congress opens a road through such a State , with its consent , it does not thereby exercise sovereignty , in that particular State , because no State would permit its sovereignty to be interfered with ; but really and truly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make no difference , if a hundred million of dollars is to be expended , whether the expenditure of this vast treasure on roads , is , technically speaking , an act of sovereignty or not , because , if the appropriation can be constitutionally made , the money must come out of their pockets , if it be forthcoming at all . But to spend a hundred millions , under a power to appropriate it for the very purpose for which it is actually expended , is , at any rate , to posses ? a prodigious influence , even if it be not sovereignty . Mr. M'Dpf- n fib 's node of stating the question , is therefore , most imposing ; and those who desire to combat him on the ground of metaphysics , or who would not yield to him this position , that to effect any object , however important , by money merely , even if it be an hundred millions , is not to exercise sovereignty , must expect to be horsdu combat . We must meet him then on other grounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a million of dollars to-* wards a canal in a State , and with the consent of its Legislature , is pot an exercise of sovereign power ; and let us further admit his grand position , that the appropriating power has no limits , but the common defence and general welfare . There is yet more than one sophism in his entire argument* The first sophism consists in his supposing , that an unlimited power to raise money for the general welfare , is honestly executed , if the money be applied to the pur* poses of the Government , and not to local or State purposes . The only answer to this argument which I have met with , is that given by Mr , Legare , in his speech on Mr , Prioleau 's resolutions , in our State Legislature , in 1825 . Mr. Legare demonstrates , that a Gov- , eminent of limited powers , has no greater right to divert the funds of the Government , beyond the enumerated objects , because it has an unlimited power to appropriate for the general welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deed , to raise money on the trust estate , can divert those funds to any other purposes of the estate , than are expressed in the different trusts . Every lawyer knows , that a trustee may , under a general power , in a trust deed for that purpose , sell part of the trust estate , and he may apply the proceeds , to purposes which he may deem generally beneficial to the estate . In such a case , though the legality of the sale , and the appropriations could not be disturbed , yet , in equity , the trustee would be adjudged to have departed from his duty , as having abused the trust , and would be compelled to refund . So is it with the Government of the United States . It is a Government of sovereign , but of limited powers . These powers are conferred on it , to enable it to perform certain trusts . These trusts are defined with the utmost precision , in an instrument culled the Constitution , but which is neither more nor less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . The Geuerai Government then , is a trustee , and the power which it receives from the States , is a power coupled with a trust . Weuld any lawyer say , ihnt in construing the power of the Government , unaided by other lights to guide us , all the rules for construing powers , coupled with a trust , should be put aside ; those rules , which are not merely the rules of common law , but of common sense . 1 should hope not . Is it recoucileable with commoti sense , that a power given by deed , by A to B. to mortgage the estate , and to apply the proceeds to the purposes of the trust estate , could authorise the appropriation to purposes , not specified or referable to any of the numerous trusts , with which the deed may abound . I should say not . Then , upon what principle , can a Government , instituted to effect certain national objects , which are clearly defined , appropriate the general means , placed in its hands , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side , has no relation tm any of those objects . Such a Government may think proper to as  --  ume the principle , that the Government being National , it may effect objects which are National , though not enumerated . What is this but to say , that when the Convention precisely defined the purposes , for which we should be National , the Congress shall undertake to say , we shall also be National for other purposes . To tax the people , that money may be appropriated beyond the enumerated objects , is a constitutional exercise of power , because the taxing power is unlimited . 80 is the sale of part of the estate by a trustee legal , because a power is given for that purpose . Im either case , the money once appropriated , must remain so appropriated . But equity will adjudge the misapplication of the money , as an illegal act . It is an abuse of the trust . It would be no answer in Mr. M'Duffie , to repeat what he has already said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must depend upon the discretion of Congress , and that we are uot more exposed , by Congress appropriating its money at its discretion , under the taxing power , than if it were wastefully expended , with reference to any of the enumerated objects , where the discretion is admitted to be unlimited . " The difference , however , is essential . A wasteful expenditure of money , in building fortifications , and raising armies and navies , when there may be no need of them , is not an unconsttn tutional act , any more than it is an illegal act , for a trustee , who i &; appointed to take care of an infant , to allow him so liberally , as to , enable him to run through his estate , and to come to ruin before he . comes of age . In these cases , there is no relief , because it is money expended upon the objects of the trust , under an unlimited discretion so to do . The manner of executing the trust , is here matter of dis- cretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion claimed : to be exercised , is not as to the quantity of money , which is to beapplied to a specific purpose , demanding such an application ofmo ney , hut to the purpose itself of the application . Congress can not promote objects which are not enumerated , even* where money alone can effect them . It is repugnant to the whole plan and spirit of the Constitution Is there no distinction between a discretion as to the quantity of means , or money , necessary to execute a particular trust , and a discretion as to the subject or trust , upon which money is to operate ? The distinction , in my mind , is ino*t manifest . The Constitution affords many examples of the one , but it furnishes none of the other . For instance , Congress can raise , money to any amount , by taxes or by loans , whether the public exigencies require it or not . It can , in time of peace , as well as of war , raise troops , and build and equip frigates , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It can appoint seven or seventy Judges of the Supreme Court .  --  - It may ordain and establish a hundred new inferior tribunals of Justice . All this Congress can do . But in doing all these things , it is still strictly within its own sphere . It may de wrong , but it does so at the expense of the people at large , considered as its constituents . It can not possibly impinge upon , or interfere with , /z/ or affect in any manner , the sovereignty or concerns of the State* , either directly or indirectly . Not only its powers are exercised within due bounds , and directed to their proper objects , but its influence too . Members of Congress are not forming schemes and pro* jects to meddle with the concerns , and disturb the peace of their neighbours , indirectly , when they dare not do so directly . In short , the General Government , in thus exercising its discretion , remains what it was created for , and does not become a pragmatical , offensive , and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Its discretion is the only rule of its conduct . Such a discretion is indispensable to it , and it has it by the terms of the grant . But who can point to any clause in the Constitution , which gives the least discretion whatever , as to the SUBJECT , upon which the national legislation is to operate . The bare idea of the Governments being a Government of limited powers of legislation , one would suppose , would be a sufficient discouragement to any one , from undertaking so arduous a task . If we look at the instrument , the objects or subjects of legislation , are all enumerated . The very specification of the objects , on which the legislative power is to operate , ez vi termini , excludes the idea of discretion , as to any object , not included in such specifiation . If there is to be discretion , the very object of the enumeration is defeated . It was wisely ordained by the Convention , that the subjects for the legislative powers of Con- , gress , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion in Congress , as to what subjects it should , or should not legislate on . For what is discretion 1 According to the opinion of one of the greatest men , who ever sat on the English Bench , - 'Discretion is the law of TYRANTS . " In the best of men , it is sometimes folly , oftentimes caprice . In the worst , it is every vice , and crime , of which human nature is capable . " But our Achilles must not be permitted to drag us along in triumph , as he would a vanquished Hector , by saying , that amongst the specified subjects for legislation , there is one , to wit , the appropriating power , in which , from its peculiar phraseology , a discretion as to the objects , ( as well as to the amount ) is implied , for that would " be to say , that whilst the whole instrument , clearly manifests a design , and studiously perfects a scheme , to exclude all subjects for legislation , which are not particularly specified , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State the numerous undefined powers of legislation , yet , that by certain doubtful and indefinite general phrases , the like of which , are to be found in the most common power of attorney , a power of appropriating money shall be claimed by implication , which , in its exercise , shall embrace almost every object of human legislation . What is this , but to say , in the language of Mr. Legare , " that whilst all other means , necessary and proper for executing the enumerated powers of the Government , are limited by the nature of those powers , the levying and disposing of money , the UNIVERSAL means , is to be restrained by no other condition , than that it should not be thrown into the sea , or bestowed on individuals who have no claim on the public . ' 9 Let us now show where the fallacy of this part of Mr. M'Dufffe ' s argument consists . /z/ aro. is . The fallacy of Mr. M'Duffie 's argument in this particular , lies , in hi* supposing , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by money merely , is the end for which the whole first clause was insetted . IT there was no discretion , he thinks , in Congress , as to the appropriation of its revenues beyond the specific powers , " there would have been no necessity for an express delegation of power , to raise and appropriate money ; because every one of the enumerated powers would carry with it as an incident , the power of appropriating the money necessary to its execution , " and that , adds he , " can hardly be a just construction which would thus convert the leading clause of the Constitution , into mere surplusage . " In this last position , we perfectly coincide . The construction , which would cause any one of the enumerated powers in the instrument to be mere surplusage , 1 agree , must be faulty . It is precisely on this principle of reasoning , that I have protested against the decision of the Supreme Court in vs The State of Maryland ) for I have shewn , in my eleventh number , that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , must be rank surplusage , if the position taken by the Court in that case , be a sound one . But whilst we so perfectly agree in a joint protestation against a rule of interpretation so unsound , yet 1 must now turn aside , and separately protest against our own statesman , for the unbound inference which he has drawn , to wit , that had the intention been , to limit the appropriations within the enumerated powers , the necessity of an express delegation of power to raise money , would have been superseded . With such an interference as this , it is not be wondered , that Mr. M'Duffie should fall into a snare . Mr. M'Duffie is now to be informed , that so far from the general power to tax , being inserted for the special purpose of enabling Congress to appropriate its revenues beyond the enumerated objects , the clause stood at the head of the enumerated powers in Mr. Pinckney 's draft , submitted to the Convention as soon as it was organized for business , and it stood also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general phrases were thought of or suggested . The words " common defence and general welfare " were not added as an amendment to the clause , until the 4th of September ; and then , as I alieady have stated in my sixteenth number , with a view to express , the sense of the Convention , that the appropriating power was to be limited to the enumerated objects . The taxing clause , was a clause , which the Convention would have retained above all other clauses in the instrument , and under every variety of aspect , of which its intentions might possibly be supposed to be susceptible . The taxing power was the principle , which was to give life , and health , and vigour to the new Government . It was the want of this vital principle , which caused the old Congress to possess an huge , but yet an useless mass of powers . The idea is perfectly inadmissible in any shape , that the Convention , with so much experience before its eyes , of the embarrassments which had been felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain the fabric of the Confederation , would have omitted to provide by an express grant , for the most paramount of all the powers which can be conferred by a people on its rulers , and have left the new Government to claim the money raising power , by implication of law . /z/ There is yet another reason , why in the enumeration of powers , such a clause could not be dispensed with  --  The States were about to part with a considerable portion of their sovereignty , and confer it on a Government , which , for certain purposes , was designed to be supreme . To avoid a clashing , or repugnance of authority in laying and collecting their respective revenues , it was most essential to state the subjects of taxation over which the General Government should possess authority . The taxing power , therefore , became of the utmost consequence ; it was a subject which w:is uppermost in the minds of the members  --  and it was a subject too , which did not admit of very easy arrangement . The Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , to separate the subjects of taxation , so as to give some to the Union , and the remainder to the States ; whilst the other plan prop srd , was not to separate the objects of Revenue , but to give the States concurrent jurisdiction , in general , in the article of taxation . Mr. Hamilton in his Federalist ( No. 35 ) justifies the position finally taken by the Convention , " that a concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation , was the only admissible substitute , for an entire subordination , in respect to this branch of power , o ( State authority to that of the Union . " We now perceive the indispensable necessity of the taxing clause , a clause so judiciously constructed , that whilst under its phraseology , no exclusive grant of sovereignty over subjects of revenue can possibly be claimed by Congress  --  there is at the same time a reservation of State sovereignty , under that NEGATIVE PREGNANT in the Constitution  --  to wit : the restriction on the power of the States to lay duties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , that a clause , which according to Mr. Hamilton , has the " merit of reconciling , an indefinite Constitutional power of taxation in the Federal Government , with an adequate and independent power in the States to provide for their own necessities , " is amongst the most important clauses in the Constitution , and that it justly merits the position it now occupies , to wit  --  at the head of all the other powers . Must he not confess his oversight , when he did not perceive , that the taxing power was indispensable , as the great sovereign meuns of executing al the other powers , and that he was greatly in error , when he imagined , that had the intention been , to apply the proceeds of the taxes to the enumerated powers , " there would have been NO NECESSITY , for an express legation of power , to raise and appropriate money . " Had Mr. M'Duffie not indulged in the Utopian scheme , that a fundamental dissimilarity of interests between twenty- four States , embracing a portion of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soil , and productions , and in their institutions and their laws , could ever be altered or destroyed ; but have contemplated all the schemes of internal improvement , as all rational men do , merely as calculated to add influence to the Supreme Government , and to take it from the subordinate sovereignty , and thus finally to merge the one into the other ; had he looked into the Constitution , not with the visionary eye of an ardent enthusiast , for a splendid Government , but with that of the calm and philosophical statesman , he would have known , that it is a work so admirably contrived , as to bear upon its very face and front , the irrefragable evidence , that its whole scheme and design is opposed to constructive powers  --  thatthe giving away Tittle odd parcels of power , which were the incidents to other powers be- rr fore given , was pufposely4o impress upon the minds of future generations ! that nothing was to . be - claimed which was not .. given ; and from this , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ; te wit , that the taxing power was given , not as he believes , to . accomplish the particular end of spending money towards the common defence and general welfare , beyond the enumerated objects , at the di8cretion , of Congress ; but that it was , of necessity , given . for other and higher purposes* to wit , the accomplishment of the enumerated objects , for which the Government was instituted . The fallacy of Mr M'Duffie 's argument being thus shewn , I pass over , those observations of his , in which he would shew , that if his view of the appropriating power of the Government be not correct , every Congress ; , has been guilty of habitual violation of the Constitution . No argument founded on precedents can have weight , where the question at issue is , whether the Government has , or has not usurped its powers . Mr. M'DuFr fie can not seriously believe , that in the instances which he has cited , of the appropriations to the St. Domingo sufferers , under Gen. Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carracas under Mr. Madison 's , there was an application of money to the " general welfare " of the people of the Ignited States . These were remarkable instances , of , the triumph of generous feelings , over sober legislative caution . But there is an argument , . drawn from , the precedent in the case of the purchase of Louisiana by Mr. Jefferson , which does merit a particular reply . Mr. M'Duffi* . would here exultingly ride oyer hi* opponents , by $UfK posing- them to take a ground , which , in my view is wholly indefensible .  --  * . " It will be said , " says he , " that the purchase of Louisiana , was made by virtue of the Executive power to make treaties , and what follows ? That there is an unlimited power in the Executive Government , not only to authorise Congress tp appropriate money , but to impose upon it ail the obii* gation , which cap grow out of the treaty , to make the appropriation. "  --  -o This , Mr* M'Duffie triumphantly exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits the power of appropriating money to the other specific grants to , Congress embraced in the enumeration of its powers ; * ' for , says he s " it would be an extraordinary supposition , that the framers of thft , Constitution intended to limit , by the most jealous restrictions , the power , of the . popular branch of the Government , in selecting . the objects , calculate ed to promote the . general welfare , and at the some time , to vest in the .. Executive Government , the most unlimited discretion on the same subi , , jeCt. i ; . . jj But the . whole of this is a fallacy . Mr. M'Duffik here makes up a. " roan of straw " that he might tear him into pieces . Who would contend* : that every treaty made by the President , and ratified by the Senate , is obr ligaiory upon the House of Representatives , or upon the States , . or the , people . A treaty stands upon no better footing than a law of Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Supreme law of the , Land , " when , made " in pursuance of the Constitution . " : If the President/ , and Senate ratify a treaty , in which there , are stipulations , which violate , any express atficl &; in the Constitution , Mr , M'Duf fib. ought to know , that , su , cfy a. tjreaty , would not be binding . Suppose a tteety , to be made in which the , United . States ae pledged to qn qfliance with . England or France , . oeimveand ) defo*8i9e*uct a treaty would be void , because it would eqahle the /z/ cutive , and the Senate to put the United States at war with a foreign powder , when it is ongress alone in which the power is vested , " to declare ' war . " Many cases might be put , where not only express articles of the Constitution might be violated , under such a construction as this but certain unalienable , though Undefined rights of the States may be impaired and surrendered . This was clearly illustrated some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the debates on Mr. Jay 's treaty , a treaty if Which it was hot pretended , that there was any violation of the Constitution , it was even there doubted , whether the House of Representatives wait bound to carry it into effect . The purchase of Louisiana , is not then to be justified , on the ground of its being made by virtue of the Executive power to make treaties . The President and Senate have the unquestionable power to make treaties , as far as those treaties relate to subjects , with in the scope of the enumerated objects , for which the General Government was established , but no farther . They have no Constitutional right , tV negociate to purchase territory for the United States , as territory merely . Because Louisiana l was purchased by Mr. Jefferson , Mr. M'Duffi* ' concludes , that the purchase was justified , under his favourite doctrine , of " the power to appropriate money for thegeneral welfare , as money merely . " I differ totally from Mr. M'Duffib , since the purchase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only ground of its being a war measure  --  most decidedly a war measure . 1 can - well recollect the causes which led to the treaty of cession : A right of deposit was denied Us at.New-i-OrleaflS , . by the Spanish authorities , and there arose from this aggression , such art eackement throughout the Western country , in consequence rif thts violation of subsisting treaties , that it became necessary , that the Gdvenvment should adopt immediate measures of negotiation , or war . There existed a powerful party in Congress , who were for taking New-Orleans by force , at the head of which were many distinguished members , amongst whorn was-Mr . Ross , from Pittsburg . In this critical posture of affairs , when war or submission was unavoidable , Mr. Jefferson , whose policy was that of - peace , conceived the sublime project of purchasing h , so as to avoid hostilities . But Spain , in the mean time , transferred the Province to France , and Mr. Jefferson being still unwilling to hav-ti : a collision with Bonaparte , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purchase was accordingly made . Had we gone to war , and acquired Louisiana 1 by conquest , and retained it after a treaty of peace , no one would have doubted our right to hold it , nor Can it be dented , but that it would have cost us some blood , and the expenditure of treasure fully eq /ivalent to the purchase money . It would be refining too much to say , that when we are on the eve of war with a neighbouring power , and negotiations are entered Into , and on the one side a cession of territory take* place , and an equivalent is stipulated on the other , that there is  --  ny substantial difference between such a case , and that , where , after actual war , the same treaty is made . I conserve the money expended for Louisiana , - as much applied to a purpose strictly national , both in its character atnd its Consequences , as if it had been invested in the armies , or fleets , or other warlike preparations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place . Instead of its being a cession , in a treatjf pfeace ; after an expensive war , it was a treaty before , and IN SUBSTI " - TU riON of WAli . It was a measure having a direct and natural rela- to lion to . war . It was theft substantially A WAR measure . It was cleariy . within the . enumerated objects in the Constitution , and therefore Constitutional ' I will close this part of my examination of Mr. M'Duffib 's doctrines , by inserting an extract from Mr. Madison 's celebrated report of il799t which . is so much better than any thing I can urge to the same point , 4bat , perhaps , I merit reproach for not inserting it earlier . Says Mr. Madison , " Whether the phrases in question be construed to authorize every vmeasure . relating to the common defence or general welfare as contended by some , or every measure only in which there might be an application of pioney as suggested by others the effect must substantially be the same f in destroying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For it is evident , that there is not a single power whatever which may hot have some reference to the common defence and general welfare ; nor ajwwej of any magnitude , which in its exercise , does not INVOKE or ADMIT an application of money . The Government , therefore , which possesses power , in either one or the other of these extents , is a Government WITHOUT THE LIMITATIONS , formed by a particular ENUMERATION of powers , and consequently the meaning and effect of this particular enumeration is destroyed by the exposition given to these general phrases .  - -  The true and fair construction of this expression , both in the original and existing federal compacts , appears to the committee too obvious to be mistaken . In both , the Congress is authorized to provide money for the common defence , and general welfare . In both , is subjoined to this authority , an enumeration of the cases , to which their power shall extend . Money can not be applied to the general welfare , otherwise than by an application of it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , money has been applied to a particular measure , a question arises , whether the particular measure , be within the enumerated authorities vested in Congress . If it be , the money requisite for it may be applied to it . If it be not , no such application can be made . This fair and obvious interpretation coincides with , and is enforced by the clause in the Constitution , which declares ' that no money shall be . drawn from the Treasury , but in consequence of appropriations by law 7 An appropriation of money to the general welfare , would be deemed rather A MOCKERY , than an OBSERVANCE of this Constitutional injunction. " /z/ Let us now meet Mr. M'Duffie on the true ground , upon which this , controversy must finally be decided . The taxing clause , it is said , gives the power to Congress , to appropriate its revenues at its discretion , " . to provide for the common defence , and general welfare of the United States . " Be it so . The expenditures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no other . It can not be pretended , that the clause , as it is now expressed , means either more or less than this . Indeed , Mr. M'Duffib 's reasoning completely establishes this , point . But here the question obtrudes itself upon , us . What shall we call a national purpose ? for until we can arrive at some precise definition of nationality , it will , be in vain to carry on the contest . I will , therefore , give my view ajs to what constitutes a purpose to be national in its character , as distinguished /z/ firbm brie trtiich is total , and I hope to 1 sustain my definition , upom the most solid of all - grounds , the grounds of the Constitution itself . " " We roust never forget , that there is a distinction between the term " national , " as it may ' be used in general , and the sense in which - it must be understood , with reference to American affairs . Were all the State sovereignties abolished , and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not possibly be a difference of opinion , as to what is meant by the term , " the general welfare of the United States . 11 But it is , because we present to the World , an anomaly in politics and in civil government , that the whole difficulty arises . We understand terms , in the sense , in which from time immemorial , we have been accustomed to use them , forgetting that , however correctly they may be applied in such a sense , to Governments in general , yet , that they can have no influence as regards a country , where has been introduced , an order of political institutions , totally distinct from any thing that ever did , or probably ever will occur again , in the history of the world . In England therefore , or in France , the term " national , 1 ' is correctly understood to be synonimous with the words " public " or " general . " There , any undertaking by the supreme authority , is called a national undertaking , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consitutes the appropriation to be " for the general welfare . " The general welfare of the British Isles , is the national welfare of Great Britain , for , let the public acts of the Imperial Parliament , be what they may , they operate upon the English , Irish and Scotch , as one entire people , and are properly regarded , and felt by them , as national acts . But when we come to speak of American affairs , where the same people are partly governed as one entire nation , and partly , in twenty four separate sovereignties or nations , terms , which hitherto have received an undisputed import , now begin not to be so definite , or so easily understood . To give a character of nationality to a measure in America , something more is requisite , than would suffice in England . To be general , or public as to its effects , throughout the United States , and to proceed from the supreme authority , the Congress , is not of itself , sufficient . It must also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own prescribed powers . If it be not done in the exercise of its lawful sovereignty , however the particular measure may serve to promote the genera welfare of the people , yet , in strictness and in truth , it is not a measure national in its character . It is an act of usurped authority , operating beneficially upon the great mass of the people ; and so far , - is a measure for the public and general welfare ; a case which sometimes occurs . A Despot may be so kind , and impartial to all his subjects , as to render his Government , a paternal and an happy one . The only mode by which we are permitted to test the character of any measure , as to nationality , is to bring it to the standard , provided by the people themselves . That standard is the Constitution To this , and this alone , we must all come , for a DESCRIPTION , of the objects and measures , which are national . It is in this great /z/ deed of covenant , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ONE ENTIRE nation , and do judiciary tribunal on earth , by any ' ingenuity of construction , - can lawfully decide , that the people of these States , are an entire nation for any other objects , than the deed itself specifies . If any one object , can be deemed a national object , which is not there expressed , any other may be equally deemed to be national , and the deed itBelf , becomes a piece of useless parchment . To abandon the description of the objects of the Federal Government , as set forth in the Constitution , and to take up any system of construction , and thence to deduce objects , and to call them national , is neither more nor less , than to make us a nation , not for the purposes agreed upon , but for any , and every purpose , which human ingenuity can suggest ; for who can affix limits to the imaginations of men 1 It is to be set adrift , on a perilous and boundless ocean , without a chart or a compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible , and a correct definition of nationality . A measure to be national , must then have a reference to the expressed purposes , for which the United States Government was created as a Supreme Government . If there be in the State Legislatures , ANY CONCURRENCE of jurisdic* tion , or authority over any one of the objects , to promote which , Congress has power to legislate , THAT object can not be a national object . To constitute any one object of civil government , in these States , to be national , it is indispensably necessary , that it be an object , to promote which , the States can no more exercise lawful au* thority , than could France or England . The MERE fact of the United States Government not being supreme as to that object , by the ternls of the grant , DECIDES IT TO BE LOCAL . It would be a manifest absurdity to maintain , that the same people , could de* Sire to exist as ONE nation , for an especial or a designated object , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the self-same object . I hope I am now fully understood . EVERY THING is national in its character , over which , by the terms of the Constitution , the United States Government can exercise eztlnsive sovereignty ; and NOTHING is national , which the States can legitimately make the subject of their legislation . It is impossible that any definition , more accurate than this , can be given of nationality . It is a definition* which results from the very nature of the anomalous structure of our civil Government . That it ' is truth itself , may be thus demonstrated . There is no one object , which can be mentioned , which we alt agree to be decidedly national , for which there is not a provision in the Constitution , that Congress , as to that particular subject , shall be supreme ; and , on the other hand , there is not an object which , with one consent in the States , we term local , over which the States do not exercise sovereignty , by the terms of the compact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , exclude the subject of " tocatioh " when I am considering the objects , for which the Federal and State Governments were created . This being the vital princi- /z/ pie of all Governments , must be possessed by the we , as well as the other , as a means to promote the objects of each ; and , hence , of ne-cessity , there must be a concurrence of sovereignty ove/ subjects for taxation in general . With . this qualification to my position , which .1 state rather to prevent cavilling , than from any fear , that any candid reasoner would avail himself , of what might appear to be an oversight , let us now proceed to test our definition , of nationality , by citing some few instances on each side . In ** declaring war " we constitute one consolidated nation . Why ? Because Congress has the power to declare war , and no State can even " engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are an entire nation . Why 1 Because , the States are expressly forbidden by the compact , to raise troops or build fleets , except in actual war . In " coining money , " we are a nation . Why 1 Because amongst the limitations on the power of the States , it is said , " No State shall coin money " In regulating foreign and domestic commerce , and our intercourse with the Indian tribes , we are one nation . Why 1 Congress , under the Constitution , exclusively possesses the- right . In " foreign negotiation " we are one nation . Why ? " No State shall enter into agreement or compact with a foreign power . 9 ' In the regulation of coin , foreign and domestic , in establishing uniformity in weights and measures , aqd in bankrupt and naturalization laws , and in conferring patents and copy-rights , we are one nation . Why 1 Because , the necessarily exclusive nature of the grants on the subjects , sweeps away the whole power , and precludes the States from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every object , universally admitted to be national , coincides with the definition we have given of nationality , which means an ENTIRE subordination of the subject , to thv.undimded sovereignty of Congress , by the terms of the Constitution . Let - as now cite , some instances on the opposite side , of subjects , which are confessedly local in their character . Let us begin with the numberless capital offences against the peace of society .  --  Here is a. subject of legislation strictly local . Why ? The States are in the constant practice of this species of legislation  --  and Congress , with the exception of cases provided for in the compact , can not define and punish felonies on land , its jurisdiction extending no further than to " define and punish felonies committed on the high seas . " , Why are all laws , on . the subject of free schools , descents , sale and transfer of property , of escheats , executors and administrators , , and guardians , and a thousand such  --  why is this species of legislation local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated-all such objects , and Congress has no specific grant of any such power  --  but on the contrary , " all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , - shall be reserved to the States , or to the people , respectively . " If there be now , one single object of Government , universally admitted amonsrst us to be local , or national , in its nature or character which will not readily fail in with , and sustain the definition /z/ herein given , of tiatie'Aaliry , let the ingenuity of the Bar point it  --  ut* I can not imagine it . i . . When I speak , however , of what is necessary , to constitute any measure to be national , I must not he understood to mean , that the particular measure , must be written down in the Constitution , as a subject for the exclusive sovereignty of Congress  --  and that , if it be not there found , it is not national . All I mean to inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such a direct relation , to some one of the enumerated objects , that in its absence , that particular object of the Government , could " not well be accomplished ; But even in this case , it is indispensably requisite , that the particular non-enumerated measure is one , on which the States can not act in any way whatever . For instance  --  The UNITED STATES establishment at WEST POINT , is a measure national in its charac* ter % though no power for such an establishment is to be found in the Constitution . Why is it national % For the plain reason , that though a State can promote military science , yet no State can establish a similar institution , conferring military rank , pay , and subsistence , bona fide % with a view to a regular army , without violating that part of the Constitution , which forbids the States from keeping up military and naval establishments , in time of peace . So the establishment of a NATIONAL MINT is not expressed in the Constitution . But it is national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 9 * So also , all legislation on the subject of privateers , fitting out in pur ports , to cruise against a belligerent with whom we are at peace , is not once mentioned in the Constitution . But it is nevertheless , entirely national* But what gives k this character of nationality f It fe the alienation of State sovereignty on the same subject , under that clause in the instrument , which gives to Congress , the power to " define and punish offences against - the law of nations . " A power , which , if it were led to the States to exercise , " might put it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the confederacy with foreign nations . 9 * - This is one of the cases , in which an authority is granted to the Union , *. * to which , a stimtar authority in the States , would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant " and which , according to the Fedesaiist , is sufficient to make any power necessarily ex elusive in its character  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court .

And the power was most properly* withheld , for , as undoubtedly necessary , as military roads and ca  --  - aols may be in Europe , where , if it were not for their fortified towns , at short distances , a kingdom might be overrun in a few days . '  - -  Yet , in a country like ours , where , in most parts , every tree is a for- : tification , and every hunting path a military road : for our militia , it would be premature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be 1 a waste of the public money to imitate Europe in this particular .  - -  The Convention was , no doubt , Well satisfied that the extent of our country , ' was a security against a foreign , enemy , , and that the prin- principal points of attack , ' would be the sea coast , in the vicinity of /z/ which , there would always be found roads , and that the country eould be sufficiently defended by armies and navies , forts , &c.; trusting , that as the settlements extended , and the country became more populous , the States would , from necessity , have sufficient roads and canals , for commercial purposes . But , the material objectiou at that day , no doubt was ( and a solid objection it was ) that , to grant a power to make roads and canals , even for military purposes , would involve , as a matter of course , a right of exclusive jurisdiction on Congress , over SOIL and TERRITORY , which the States were resolved not to permit , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could not be ignorant , that if Congress could construct , thousands and thousands of miles of roads and canals , it could exact tolls thereon , and pass laws to punish persons who should wilfully injure the public works , and thus exercise local do* minion in the States . It is absurd to believe , as 1 have already shewn , that Congress and the States , can be copartners in Legislation over any one object of Civil Government . It must belong en tirely to Congress , or not at all . Who can read the Constitution and say , that the States ever intended , that Congress should have exclusive jurisdiction , excepting at the Seat of Government , and in its forts , dock-yards , &c.; ? But the making of necessary military roads and canals , in actual war , is a very different thing . It is free from all these objections . At the conclusion of peace , it would be as strange for the Government to claim jurisdiction over such roads and canals , as it prepared for the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold jurisdiction over a citizen 's plantation , which its army occupied the whole war , as an entrenchment . The want of good roads , which was felt in the late war , as to the operations on the Canada frontier , is no reason , why the power ought to be claimed by Congress . Mr. M'Duffie 's argument here , if it means any thing , means this . That wherever an occasion has occurred , which proves , that the . Government , in any of its operations on that occasion , might have done better , if it had possessed certain , or more extensive means , that such means necessarily must belong to it .  - -  This might be an argument , . on a motion to amend the Constitution , so as to give Congress a power to make military roads ; but . it can have no weight , in any other point of view . Congress has limited powers . The power to make*military roads and canals is as SUBSTANTIVE a power , as that of raising armies and navies . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propositions herein laid down be true : lsU That money can not be appropriated but for national purposes ; and 2udly , That no measure is national in its character , which refers to a subject over which the States , under , the Constitution , can laiofully exercise their sovereignty , it will be for Mr. M'Dufflb now to explain , how Congress can legitimately take the subject of internal improvement , under its consideration . The error into , which Mr. M'Duffjk has unhappily fallen , is , that he has not been , fiareful to . distinguish those elauses in the Constitution , which declare the , . PURPOSES for which the people exist as one nation , from , the two first clauses , i /z/ the enumeration , which simply confer the POWER to eucute xhosti purposes . He has not been careful to distinguish between a POWER coupled with a TRUST , and A NAKED power . The distinction between the one and the other , is in equity , most marked and obvious . " A mere power is never imperative . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party to whom it is given , " and hence full discretion is implied . " A trust is always imperative , and is obligatory upon the consciences of the party entrusted . " But where trusts and powers are blended , as where a man may be invested with trusts to be effected by the execution of a power , as is the case where a power is given by a will to trustees to sell an estate , and to apply the money upon trust , here , though the legal estate , until the execution of the power is in the heir at law ; yet , on the power being defeated at law , by the death of the trustees , Equity acting upon the trust , will compel the heir , to join in the sale of the estate for the execution of the trusts . ( See Sugden on Powers . ) Mr. M'Duffie has lost sight of this , and strangely regards the levying and appropriating power of Congress , as one of the purposes or trusts for which the Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of " borrowing money on the credit of the U. States , " is not an end , but simply the great means , by which all the enumerated objects , or trusts , are to be accomplished . It is the Power coupled with the Trusts . To be asked to demonstrate this , is as if we were called upon to prove , that any one problem in Euclid is true . I will , however , endeavour to make it plain to those who are not lawyers . The distinction between the levying and appropriating power of the Government , and all the other enumerated powers , is most manifest . In the other enumerated powers , there is not a single clause , which does not contain within itself , some one of the many definite purposes for which Civil Government generally exists ; whilst in the two money raising clauses , there is no definite purpose whatever expressed . Nothing is easier , or more natural , than to imagine , that a people should desire to constitute ONE nation for war , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the trusts in the Federal compact may be included ) but it is extremely difficult to make a man'of common sense " believe , that a people already associated in thirteen regular Governments , should desire to be consolidated into one supreme sovereignty , merely for the pleasure of BEING TAXED ; and to possess the power to SPEND those taxes . The laying an appropriating power , is therefore no more , than the POWER- of the Government , coupled with the TRUSTS . It is only a MEANS . A means Can not be a purpose , or an end , nor can it be greater than an end . ' ' Suppose that Mr. M'Duffie , as a lawyer , was to have submitted to him a deed from A. to B ; in trust for ' various Uses , and with many limitations therein expressed , " and H is opinion . was solicited as to ( fie real intent of the dbhdr ; to what jihrt of the trtfet deed would he look , for the purposes for which he estate was created ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument , dectaring*the irv*ts , or would he read the getoeral power in the /z/ - 4eed , enabling the trustee to raise money without limit , for the general bene* &; of the estate , by sale or mortgage of the , estate , or otherwise ? The answer is , he would assuredly look to the trust clauses , as the only means , by which he could come at the objects , for which the estate wsjs given by A. and he would scarcely cast his eye on the general power to raise money , such a power being a matter of course . Precisely the same must it be with the Constitution of the United States , . If we would ascertain , for what purposes we exist as one nation , so as to decide , whether any particular object is a national object , or a local one , it would be as useless to look ( as Mr M'Duffie does ) at the two first clauses , giving the power " to raise a revenue by taxes and loans , and to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , to look at the general power in the trust deed above referred to . These two clauses in the Constitution must then be put aside . They actually ought , to have no more influence in an inquiry , as to the purposes which are meant to be embraced in " the general welfare , " than that clause in the Constitution , which says , that " each House shall be the judge of the elections of its own members . " Construe these clauses as we will , they speak no other language than that the Government shall raise money by taxes , and by loans  --  and that the proceeds shall be applied to the purposes , for which we became a nation , and , to no other . Where shall we seek for these purposes  --  In the brains of ingenious politicians , or in the enumeration of the specific objects or trusts . In the latter unquestionably . Id CERTUM est quod certum REDDI potest . No part of the foregeing view can be confuted , unless some reasoner more ingenious than sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the debts and provide for the general welfare " of the United States " give to this clause a character of specification as to purposes . The answer to this is simple . The words " to pay the debts ' 9 here , mean no more , than to pay the expenses of the government , or debts contracted by loans , &c.; to carry into execution the specified objects . Referring to the 6th Article of the Constitution , we shall see that provision is expressly made , that the new Government is to assume all the debts of the Confederation , and thus constitutes those debts , as one of the trusts to be executed . The trust being already created , and in its proper place , it would be strange to imagine that the words " to pay the debts " mean any thing more than the contracts of the Government . We are now to consider some of the extravagances and absurdities , to which any other definition of " nationality " than that herein given may carry us , and in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " general welfare , " and that used for the national welfare . /z/ Mr. M'Duffie , it must be remembered , contends , that the power of Congress , to expend money for the general welfare , beyond the enumerated objects , is unlimited . As he can not conceive " upon what principle , the judiciary can pronounce any road unconstitutional , " even if Congress , " under the pretext of making military roads and canals , were to make them for purposes not military , " though he " admits that " such would be an act of usurpation , " we are therefore to have , in the opinion of Mr. M'Duffie , no other security too , against appropriations manifest*- /z/ ly unconstitutional , than this*- ' * that the cohsciente  --  tf evtery member , ; Js to be the tribunal before which , he must justify bis vote , in each particular exercise of the power in question . Let us see how this doctrine ' would work . Say that Congress shall annually appropriate a million of dollars , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and for that of a College in every State . As much more for a deaf and dumb institution , and a lunatic asylum , in the capital of each State . The same , for a splendid hospital for in* valids , in each State , upon the plan of that in Paris , and for infirmaries for the diseases of the eye , and the ear . A million for churches and chapels , from Maine to Cape Florida , for the use of all religious denominations , without distinction . A million to increase the funds , and stimulate the efforts of associations , to suppress duelling , and of societies for the suppression of gambling , drinking , profaning the Sabbath , and vice of all kinds . As much more to philanthropic societies , whose objects are to improve prison discipline , and o restore drowned persons to life : and then an appropriation of four millions , to objects of general concern , which we have not here ' room to enumerate . According to Mr. M*Duffie 's exposition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Legislature , though they can not be referred to the enumerated objects of the Government . That tjiey are all measures , which promote the general welfare and the happiness of the people , no one can doubt ; and if we regard them , as to their effects upon the general community , they are unquestionably national in this point of view . But can Congress constitutionally make these appropriations ? Let those who , in this particular , agree with Mr. M'Duffie be told , that they maintain this most extraordinary of all positions ; that amongst the MANY purposes , for which a people , already governed in thirteen regular State Governments , covenanted , to become one entire people under a Supreme Government , ONE GREAT END to be promoted , was , that ten millions of dollars , or ten times that sum , if deemed expedient , should be annually TAKEN from their pockets , by imposts and other taxes , with no other view , than that it should be RETURNED to them again , and under an utter impoeibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was drawn from the several States ; and this too for the laudable purpose of accomplishing objects , to which the States wore SEPARATELY COMPETENT , if the money was kept at home . J Here is a most wonderful exposition of the Constitution . The Convention , after two months deliberation , as to . the great outlines of the Government , solemnly decides , in the sixth amended resolution of Mr. Randolph , that Congress is to possess legislative rights in cases " to which the States are separately incompetent . " A committee in detail forms a . Constitution under these instructions ; they exclude all such cases from the enumeration of the legislative powers of Congress . An effort is made to " give . additional powers to legislate , on the subject of agriculture , manufactures , science , and internal improvements . " Canals and Universities are proposed . All efforts to give jurisdiction over these subjects , so confessedly local , failed in the Convention ; and yet we are told AGAINST the internal evidence of the deed itself , AGAINST the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention , and /z/ AOIINST the writte* statement of Luthb* Martin , who may be veil compared , to a witness who sits at the bedside of a testator , and takes down his words in writing ; that though Congress can not dig a canal without violating the compact and the sovereignty of a State ; though it can not create a great manufacturing company , with exclusive privileges as to monopoly ; though it can not , even according to the decision of M'Culloch vs . The State of Maryland f incorporate and take under its charge , Free Schools , Deaf and Dumb Institutions , &c.; because they do not refer to any of the specified objects , which Congress are to regulate ; yet , that the great ends which the above are the means of accomplishing , may be promoted by Congress in other ways . Monopolies to the manufacturers can not be created by an act of Congress , without a departure from the Constitution , wn &yet; they may he given in the shape of protecting and prohibitory duties , because Congress " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dug in the States , or military roads construct* ed , because it is to exercise sovereignty over soil and territory , and yet money may he voted for the same objects , because Congress can promote the " general welfare . " National establishments of Deaf and Dumb institutions , with incorporated powers , are unconstitutional  --  and yet all such institutions may be most liberally endowed out of the National Treasury . What is all this but to say , that Congress shall be permitted to approach indirectly i a subject for its legislation , which it is admitted it has no power to approach directly , contrary to that most excellent maxim of the law  --  " Quandu ahquid prohibetur fieri Ex D1RECTO , prohibetur per /z/ The evils of such a construction as Mr. M'Duffie gives to the appropriating power , may be most tremendous . For instance  --  The writers in the Monthly Journal of the Colonization Society , admit , that a power in Congress " to emancipate and remove Slaves within the limits of a State , would be a most alarming interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , "  --  but yet they contend , ( and they entrench themselves behind Mr. M'Duefie 's exposition ) that an authority to create a fund , as proposed by Mr. Rufus King , to aid the gradual emancipation and removal of the Slaves in the United States , would be constitutional  --  be- , cause , say they , " the power of appropriation , is limited only by the general interests of the country ; " and the removal would not " interfere with the rights either of the States or individuals , " Not interfere ! The purchase of the Slaves , and their transportation to Africa , would not mere** ly deprive us of the only labourers , who can cultivate our soil ; but it would have the effect , of altering the Constitution of the United States , in a most material point . It would change the whole representation of the Southern States . Remove the Slaves from South-Carolina  --  threefifths of whom are represented in Congress  --  and South-Carolina instead of sending nine Members to the House of Representatives , will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other States will lose in about the same proportion . It is to me most amazing , that Mr. M'DupPie should freely admit , " that in determining what sovereign powers belong to Congress , Congress has NO DISCRETION , the Constitution being the inflexible land mark ; " and yet , that he should not himself perceive , that in selecting for the appropriation of its revenues , any object whatever , which it chooses /z/ i0 designate as an object of ' general concern , Congress does thereby exercise , that high sovereign power , not included in its grant of powers , to wit : of legislating indirectly upon subjects , and attaining objects , which belong to the States to regulate , and which , from the very nature of the subjects , the States are not only , " separately competent , " but more competent to manage , than the General Government . There is a strange fallacy 4n that reasoning , which would say , that Congress is limited as to the subjects , upon which it can exercise its utmost power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which its sovereignty is to be indirectly applied . I say sovereignty indirectly exercised , for according to the Constitution , the purpose- for which money is given , must be specified in the act of Congress , and this act of legislation , constitutes the sovereignty which is to accomplish the object . It seems then , according to this exposition , that the General Government is not Supreme within the sphere of its own powers , and when it is accomplishing the purposes for which it was created . If I understand the argument , it is substantially this . There are TWO kinds of purposes , for which we consented to become as one nation , as distinguished from twenty-four nations . First ; those which are agreed upon , and particularly specified . These we readily comprehend . And secondly ; those which are equally agreed upon , but not enumerated . This is . not so easy of comprehension  --  it requires explanation , how . a new Government is to be created , with undefined objects , though it is easy enough to understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which some powers are withdrawn . For the enumerated objects , and all measures thereto appertaining , it appears , that Congress is a Supreme Government . It can approach its objects , honestly , fairly and directly . But for all the undefined ( MOST WISE ) purposes for which we act as - one people , and which purpose are embraced in the appropriation power , - under the term " general welfare , " Congress has not the full power of a nation , over a vast variety of these , which it may choose to make the subject of its legislation . For instance  --  Roads and Canals . Congress Is not now Supreme . If it wishes Roads and Canals , it can not construct them  --  it is not sovereign enough for this , but it can bring its imperfect sovereignty ( something new ) to bear upon the measure , in some other way . Whatever is now to be accomplished , must be done , to use a vulgar adage , by whipping the Devil round the stump , unless , says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriating the money be necessary to accomplish the particular object , " in which case , I understand that partial sovereignty must not be resorted to , and the Devil is to be let alone , and the purpose can not be accomplished . According to this theory , what becomes of the States ? I always heard , - until now , that there were State Governments , as well as a Federal Government . That we existed as one nation for certain designated purposes , and that for all other purposes , ( and these are few enough , God knows ) there are two express articles in the Constitution , which say , that we remain twenty-four separate nations . But it seems that we are all wrong . Congress can lawfully take what belongs to it , under the express grant , and it may constantly be cribbing power from . the States , by imperfect sovereignty without committing a gross trespass on the rights of the people . There is no boundary line , it seems , between the defined , /z/ powers of Congress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reserved to the States , for Congress can accomplish both . The one by direct , and the other by indirect sovereignty . " The only two great safeguards , which we are permitted to have , for restraining and arresting the usurpations of the Government , and preserving the liberties of the people , " are'the positive restrictions upon power 5 and the responsibility of those who exercise power , to the people upon whom it operates . " Our security , as to any abuse of power in Congress , when it is ranging at large , and seeking its employment and legislation , in the field of the novel and undefined purposes of the Federal Government , is not to be found , even in the judiciary tribunals of the United States .  --  * We are not even to have , the slight chance of a decision of the Supreme Court in our favour . According to Mr. M'Duffie , " the conscience of each member of Congresses to be the tribunal before which , a vote " of an hundred millions of the people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Mr. M'Duffie , " Shew me , in any of the subdivisions of this comprehensive scheme of representative Governments , a power operating beyond its responsibility , and I will shew you a power unknown to the system . A cornet , let loose from the power of gravitation , which must inevitably destroy the planetary harmony by which that system is so admirably characterized . " That unknown power , I can tell Mr. M'Duffie , does exist ! It is a principle wholly unknown to our system , which distributes power between one common head , and twenty-four subordinate Governments , that there should be no other security against indirect legislation , and the consequent IMPINGEMENT upon the States , than the consciences of the national legislators . It is wholly unknown to our system , that the General Government should so legislate , as to gain by a monied influence , what it can not lawfully accomplish , by an exercise of lawful power . Influence is power , and whenever the State sovereignties are abolished , it will be accomplished by the mass of influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but constant accessions , in the exercise of its constructive powers . As to political responsibility of public servants , as a safeguard , it exists but in the imagination .  - -  There is a responsibility , it is true , of our own members of Congress to the people of South-Carolina . But these men can do no mofe than their duty . When once the people of the Northern and Western States , who constitute the majority , shall decide , that we shall pay tribute to them , what becomes of that safeguard called " political responsibility ? " Will this save ns , from the usurped dominion , of the men of Sagadohock , or of the Illinois ? No ! Mr. M'Duffie will find , that for relief against that odious Tariff , which he so fearlessly , so zealously , and so eloquently opposed , in common with the rest of his colleagues , it will be in vain ever again to look to the ballot boxes of any elections South of the Potomac To our State Legislature alone must we look , that by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us the evils which encompass us . On this subject of political responsibility , which is so dazzling in its theory , many of our prominent politicians in Carolina , the most of . them excellent men too , have been running into the wildest extravagances . Instead of looking at the Constitution , with the eyes of statesmen , and with a refe- ' rence to the peculiar circumstances which attended its formation  --  instead ef bearing in mind , that so far from there being any desire* in the great f ' fltt body of - the people , in those days , to have a National Government , with ' plenary and indefinite powers , and with increased and increasing influence , that the difficulty rather was , to get a Government at all , thee gentlemen take up the compact , and examine it in most of its provisions , as lawyers - would a deed , with no reference to such a thing as equity . Because it professes , in its preamble , to come from the people , and operates upon the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Government , to be the act of the people en masse , independent of the State Legislatures , and of its being responsible to the people , and not to the State Legislatures , as if those Legislatures had not the entire agency in calling the Convention , and , as if they could not ( had they so willed it ) have frustrated all the hopes of that Convention . Hence , it is , that when our Legislature shall raise its voice against any usurped act of the Government , they would protest against any such expression of the public opinion , the Legislature not being the proper organ , without , at the same time , telling us , by what other expedient , the General Government is to be kept within its own sphere of action and of influence . Should that day ever arrive , which God forbid , that it shall become necessary to resist the usurped power of Congress , how will the people be able to act , excepting under the authority of the State sovereignties ? Can the people act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a compact , between the people of the United States , as individuals . If it were , it would be on the plan of the State Governments . There would be no enumeration of powers . As is usual , in all such cases , nothing would belong to the people , but what is expressed in the limitations on the general power , or in a bill of rights . But it is , because the States , in their corporate capacities as States , are parties to the compact , that there is an enumeration of objects for the Supreme Government to operate upon . It is Mr. Hamilton who says , " it is neither a National or a Federal Government , but a composition of both . In its FOUNDATION it is federal , not national . In the SOURCES from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn , it is partly federal , and partly national . In the OPERATION of these powers , it is national , not federal 5 and in the EXTENT of them , it is federal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mode of suffrage there practised , demonstrates the impoitance of preserving the State Governments ; for , without them , the Government must stop . But who are to preserve the State Sovereignties , but the State Legislatures ? The federative principle is not destroyed . Let only the two Senators , from each State , represented during a session of Congress , be in their seats , and the result of the votes on any question , is precisely the same , as if the Senators voted by States , as was the case with the @#@ ld Qongress . When the States have not their veto upon every act of the House of Representatives , in the same manner as if they were assembled in the Common Council of a pure Confederacy of States , it is only , when some one State is deprived of the services of one of its Senators , by sickness or absence ; it is only at that time , that any difference exists between voting by States , and voting per capita . And what is more , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A majority of three-fourths of the State Legislatures , may adopt , at their pleasure , any amendment to the Constitution 5 but the equality of suffrage in the Senate , can not be taken away , to W by . the consent of every State in the Union . It is time , then , for out politicians , who have so long been astray on this subject , to come back to correct principles , and to regard the Federal compact , as a covenant between separate and independent States . Let us hope never again to hear the doctrine asserted , that the State ? Legislatures are not to express an opinion as to the violation of a comp &ct; or treaty to which the States are essentially parties . I can not take my leave of Mr. M ' Duff ie without acknowledging to him , as a citizen of the United States , my grateful sense of his untiring efforts in Congress , to restore the purity of the Presidential Election , and to divest the House of Representatives of a trust , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first and greatest of Republics* As a man of private incorruptible integrity , I admire Mr. M'Duffie , and there are few of bis devoted friends , who are more sensible of his public merit , and of his claim to be regarded as an honest public servant , and a statesman of no ordinary stamp , than I am . He has never advocated , as I believe , any public measure , but from the most exalted motives of patriotism . His speech on Internal Improvements , breathes a general spirit , and a feeling , of which every American ought to be proud . Like others , I was transported with the perusal of it  --  but sober reflection soon taught me , that the doctrines there advanced , were incompatible with the safety of the State sovereignties  --  and I doubt not , but that the time will come , if it has not already arrived , when Mr. M'Duffie will himself perceive , that he has attached to the general phrases in the Constitution , an importance , which it was never designed they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the liberty I have taken with his opinions , and of necessity with his name . Nothing but my conviction of the dangers that await the Southern States , and the recollection that these opinions , coming from such a man , would have prodigious influence , would , in my own view , have authorized me , to make his speech , the subject of a public examination . I trust , I have stated his positions with the utmost fairness , and my endeavour has been to controvert them . /z/ The boundaries of power once passed by a Government , which is limited as to its legislation , there is no saying , to what lengths , it will not carry its usurpations . How true is this , as regards the Federal Government . The Government , in the commencement of its career , was as true and as honest to the principles of the Constitution , as could have been desired . But the Constitution was preserved unbroken , only for the first two years of our history . When the bill for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandoned the clear paths of duty and propriety , and has since deviated , more or less , oftentimes innocently , but of late wilfully , from the views which the people entertained , when they formed the compact . General Washington 's motives on the Bank question , were honest and patriotic , as they uniformly were , during every portion of his distinguished life . But General Washington was surrounded , by some of the politicians , who , in the Convention , had contended for a NATIONAL , and not a Federal Government . Alexander Hamilton , and Edmvnd Randolph , were in his confidence and /z/ his Cabinet . These gentlemen , it is well known , had strenuously contended , the one that Congress should " have a negative on all the State Laws , interfering with its own ; " and the other that " a Governor in each State , should be appointed by the General Government with a negative upon the State Legislature , " in order the better to prevent any such laws being passed in the first instance . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest , whether ( in one of Mr. Randolph 's resolutions ) the word " United States , " or the word " National " should be used . It is a truth not to be concealed , that even General Washington sided somewhat with those gentlemen in the Convention , and it certainly is not intended , to derogate an atom from his high fame , when it is said , that he was in favour of an energetic Government , and a strong executive arm . Nor am I disposed to blame Messrs . Hamilton and Randolph , for opinions , as I believe , sincerely entertained by them . Many of the Jtest men in the Union , at that time , thought with them , and some of them from our own State . They had all been so sensible of the defects of the Confederation , that it was natural , that they should incline to the opposite extreme , and believe a National Government as best calculated for the exigencies of the Union . It appears , however , that they were all mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate for us , particularly of the South , that all attempts to consolidate us all into one nation , failed in the Convention . On the first question , therefore , which arose under the Constitution , respecting the powers of the Government , it was not to be expected , but that with the previous prepossessions of Gen. Washington on the subject , he should have decided in favour of a National Bank . But , amongst his followers , have been some , who had not his moderation , his prudence , and his sagacity , and hence it is , that during the last , and the present Administration , we have seen the Government administered in open violation of the Constitution , not by any act immaterial as to its effects upon public liberty , but by acts impairing important and vital interests of the States . When a limited Government , like that of the United States , has passed all the necessary laws , for the collection and distribution of its revenue , . and entered into all the arrangements , to provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , it must soon find itself in need of more occupation , than the ordinary concerns ' of defence and commerce can furnish . Commerce once regulated , what else remains to be done , but to leave the rest to the industry and enterprise of our citizens . Our policy too , being that of friendship with all nations , and entangling alliances with none , atfd amply furnished as we are , with the means of defence , what has the General Government to do , but to make provision for its ' small army and navy , and to keep its forts and arsenals'in repair . ' Can the mind of an American conceive a happier state of things for his country , * than that Congress should sit only five or six weeks , and have as little employment as possible , and that to the local Legislatures , it sjfipuld be left , to extend their care , to all the objects which con-  --  ern the INTERNAL order and Improvement of the States. - ** ' When , in 1788 , the people in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Federal Government , and were hesitating , * whether they would accept the Constitution , Mr. Hamilton , by , way of reconciling the in to the Constitution , told them in his Federalist , ( No. 46 , " that the operations of the Inderal Government would be most extensive and important in times of WAR and danger ; those of the State Governments in times of PEACE and security . " " No exposition of the Constitution can be more true than - this , and ' more calculated to shew , that in general , the State Governments , would have advantage as to legislation , over the Federal Government , the times of war in a country like America , bearing no proportion to the times of peace . But how stands the fact . Thirty years scarcely elapse , before , the General Government commences a great plan of steady operations , by which it is to carry on a system of internal improvements , which will leave to the States , little or nothing to do on the same subject , drawing immense sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a possibility , as already has been elsewhere observed , of its being expended amongst them , in the same proportion , in which it is taken from the several States . It is in PE 4 . CE then , as well as in war , that we observe : the operations of the General Government IMPORTANT AND EXTENSIVE , with a prospect , at the same time , rapidly opening - upon us , that ere long , almost all the subjects of legislation , which the States now regard as exclusively belonging to them , will be gradually drawn towards Congress , under the powerful attraction of the words the " general welfare . " Who could have believed , in 1789 , that in less than forty years , that several State Legislatures , should even entreat that Congress would take under its consideration , measures to remove as an evil of the first magnitude , the FUNDAMENTAL POLITY of the Southern States  --  that even the subr ject of slavery , should be a fit object for the INDIRECT legislation of a Government , instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Let Congress be confined within the proper and the legitimate sphere . of its action , and it , is manifest , that it would not be occupied , half the time it now consumes in its sessions , nor cost the people half of the sum , that is annually spent at Washington . There have been periods , when it might be necessary that the sessions should be somewhat protracted . There was at one time much to dp . A system of revenue laws was to be digested and perfected  - -  the Courts of the . United States were to he organized  --  the public debt to be provided for  --  treaties of commerce to be entered into , and , ratified wjith gvery nation . A Government in fact , was to be put into complete operation . But , in our day , the Government is settled and established , , and were the . National . Legislature occupied as it ought to , be with its iron business* and not in assvtoing the business of the State Legislatures , there would be little to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives are without occupation , that instead of adjourning and going in proper time . tt their /z/ homes , the members : are disposed to meddle , with what lis toot their concern , and that they are constantly in search , for some new subject for their legislation . This is the true reason , why they expend the public money in protracted sessions , and sow the seeds of discontent and jealousy amongst the States . But this is natural ; These men ( feel power and forget right , 9 ' and he must be an indifferent observer , who does not perceive , that unless some check be given to the usurpations of Congress , that there will be no end to the subjects* - which , in time , it may not discuss and legislate upon . */x /z/ No general course of proceeding can be more destructive of the rights of the States , or of the people , than that adopted by Congress , when it is about to construe its powers . Where real doubts exist , as has frequently been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within those intended to be granted by the Constitution , this body does not condescend - to solicit any aid from its constituents , who are represented in the State Legislatures , but it seizes at once upon the doubtful power . Certainly this is tiot the course which friendship and good feeling , and even policy would dictate The Government of the United States , notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary , by the Supreme Court , is not a Government of the people , in the sense in which the Supreme Court would have it . If it were , it would be responsible to the people alone , as its constituents , as is the case under every consolidated Government , and there would be no other security against usurpation , excepting the power of the people to change their rulers , in which case the minority must abide by the will of the majority . A doctrine such as is contended for , is subversive of the end for which the Union was formed . There is an inconsistency in admitting , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , have certain acknowledged rights under the Constitution , which are gua- - ranteed to them , and also , that they are so clearly recognized in the instrument , as to be prohibited from exercising their sovereignty on certain subjects , and yet that they are not to be regarded as having the right to complain of the usurpations of the Government , as if it were ever before heard , that those who create a delegated Government , have not lawfully the same power , to restrict it , within its limits , after it is created . This doctrine , of the General Government being " truly and emphatically d Government of the people " which has been so often relied on , as excluding the right of the State Legislatures , to protect the States against the usurpations of Congress , was first suggested by Mr. PiNckNEYs Counsel for the Plaintiff in Error* in M'OulloehvB . The State of Marfiand , and the Chief Justice , with his usiial ability and eloquence , has placed the position in so masterly an aspect , as almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position oi the Court can not be sustained . It is as unsound , as the other ' parts of this opinion already noticed in previous numbers . The Counsel for the Defendants in JJrror , in speaking of the true nature 1 ' tor -f the Federal compact took this ground " That the terms of ttor grant , did not convey sovereign power generally , but power limited to particular cases , and with restrictive means ior ex* ecuting such powers ; " and further , that the powers of the General Government u were delegated , not by the people of the U. States at large , bite by the people of the respective States , and , that therefore , it was a compact between the different States " The Counsel hero were certainly right , and the Court as clearly wrong in not admitting the position . The Constitution IS a compact between the States , and there are no parties to it , excepting the people of the different States , in their corporate capacities . The Court , it is true , cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people , as compounded into one common mass , ' 9 for that would be too untenable ; but still , its reasonings do artfully carry us on to the conclusion , that the Constitution does not emanate from , and is not the act of sovereign and independent States , but on the contrary , is as much the act of the people of the United States , as if they were assembled in an aggregate society , to distribute power between the Federal and the State Governments ; and that all power derived from such a source , is as sovereign , as if it had remained in the hands of the people , and that all the incidental ) as well as the direct powers , are a part and parcel of any sovereignty conveyed by the instrument . Let us examine this doctrine of the Government being a Government of the people . In a former number , has been stated , the obvious distinction , between the case of a people without any regular Government , forming a Constitution ; and that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design to part with power to a common head ; the Legislators , in the one case , possessing all powernot reserved by the people , and in the other , possessing not king , but what is delegated . Situated as were the citizens of America , at the close of . the Revolution , there were but two ways , in which the pie , could have formed a Government . The first , was , by being as sembled in the relation to each other , of individuals of one great political society . The second , as associated in separate sovereignties . Under one , or the other of these situations of our community , , was the Constitution formed . If the powers of the Government , are not derived from the people of the United States , as individuals ag* gregated in a general society , they must then be created by the people in their corporate capacities , and so vice versa . From , no other ; sources . than these , can they be claimed . Now , it is immaterial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court shall decide as having prevailed , in 1788 . If it chooses the last , we agree . If the first , it is in its own language , " a political dreamer , who is wilA enough , to think of breaking down the lines , which separate the States , and of compounding the American people into one common mass. 1 ' The Chief Justice , however , thinks , he avoids a dilemma of this nature , by . giving the idea , that though the people on this occasion , were not actually compounded into one mass ; yet , that in dispensing power to the new Government , thejr did it as effectually , - as m if they had constituted oft e great community , for . on no. other principie , thaathis , can he establish , the doctrine , that as to any particuJar power conferred on Congress , it is as " Supreme , as the people themselves would be on the subject ; a doctrine which has been denied in . these numbers . As if aware , that the assemblage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ratification in this way of the . Constitution , was the act of the States , and not of the people , he justifies this mode of ratification as the most proper , under the circumstances . " They acted upon it , in the only manner , in which they could act safely , effectively , and wisely , on such a subject , by assembling in Convention* " It is true , adds he " ' they assembled in their several States , and where else should they have assembled ? If they act , they mupt act of course in their States . But the measures they adopt , do not , on that account , cease to be the measures , of the people , or become the measures of the , State Governments . " The answer to be given here , is , that the Constitution might have been ratified , ( if the Convention had so chosen ) in two other ways ; but neither of them , would have comported , with the general sentiments , in and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not national in its creation . What , for instance , could have prevented the Convention , from proposing , that the State Legislatures should divide their States into election districts , upon some equitable plan agreed upon , and that each district should send a deputy to a General Convention , or that the people in the different States , should give their assent , or dissent , by voting in districts by a general ticket , and that ' in either case , the ' votes of three fourths of the whole , should be an acceptance of the Constitution . To these last modes there could be no objection , because the Constitution , whether the subject of debate , or not , was to be accepted , or rejected in whole . After Napoleon had assumed the imperial purple , he was desirous to know , whether his subjects regarded him as an usurper , and he opened books in every part of his dominions , that Frenchmen might inscribe their assent or dissatisfaction of his conduct . This was voting by general ticket , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that either mode here proprosed , would have been impracticable , because the very fact of its being impracticable to obtain the assent of the people at large , would be conclusive to shew , that the assent , if given in any other way , could not possibly be the act of the people , but of the States . That the people of the United States , were regarded , as acting in their sovereign capacities , as separate States , when they ratified the Constitution , clearly appears , f from the rule laid down in the instrument itself , for its ratification . The assent of a majority of all the inhabitants of the United States , was not made indispensable , which certainly would have been the case , had the design . been that the Constitution should not emanate from the States . Under such a view , it might have so happened , that the ratification might not have been complete , though nine States should have assented . Four large States , rejecting the Constitution , might have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts , New- York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . These four States , at the first census in 1790 , one year after the Government vent into operation , had 56 members out of 105 , that number being the whole representation in Congress  --  They were the majority of fifteen States . At the second census in 1800 , the same four States possessed 74 out of 141 members , and formed the majority of seventeen States . At the third census in 1810 , they formed exactly one half of twenty-three States . Amongst all the modes of controverting the soundness of a position , there can not be one more effectual , than to shew the manifest absurdity to which its results would lead . If the Supreme Court is right , that the ratification was the assent of the people , and not of the States , the Convention is chargeable with the absurd proposal of having a Government , which is to bind all the people of the United States , to be put into operation , as soon as a minority ! of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , if we consider the Constitution , as emanating from the State sovereignties , and not from tlW people , there is no difficulty whatever , in any view of the subject . The mode proposed by the Convention , was not only the best mode , but it was the only mode , by which the people , acting as the people of separate States , could give their free and unbiassed assent to the compact . There was a manifest propriety in the Convention 's submitting the Constitution , to the assent of the people , in their State Con* ventions , and not to the State Legislatures , if it was the intention , that the new Government , was to be received from the States . It is only , when the people are assembled in their conventions , that they are exercising their utmost power of sovereignty . At no other time , do they wholly act in their sovereign capacity ; for it is then , that they ' can take away what they before gave , and give what they had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true ; exercise the sovereign power of making laws , but the power is limited by the Constitution . The Court says , " from these Conventions , the Constitution derives its whole authority . " Strange then it is , that at the very moment , when the people in the different States , are acting in the only possible known way of exercising complete sovereignty , that this moment should be selected by the Court , as an occasion for considering their acts , not as the acts of sovereign States , but as those of the people of the United States at large . It is very plain , from the reasoning of the Chief Justice , that he regards the State Legislatures , or the State Governments , as he also terms them , essentially , as the State Sovereignties . His words are " The assent of the States , in their sovereign capacity , is implied , in calling a Convention , and thus submitting that instrument to the : people . It required not the affirmance , and could not be negatived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was of complete obligation , and bound the State Sovereignties. ' * For the want of a distinction between a State Legislature and a State Sovereignty , it is not to be wondered , that the Court should deny the Constitution , to be the act of sovereign and independent States , /z/ *ai States . There is a difference , and a very material one , between a State Legislature , and a State Sovereignty . To speak of them as the same , is to Confound two things which are opposite . It is to call the people the Government , and the Government the people .  --  True State Sovereignty , is that supreme power in a State , which is without limits . It resides no where but in the people . To the people it belongs , as founded on the " original inherent RIGHTS OF MAN . " The State Legislature , on the contrary , is nothing more than that portion of the supreme power , which the people have thought proper to delegate , for the purpose of making the necessary laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A State Legislature is not even the State Government , but only a portion of it . If the State Legislature , which is only a part of the Civil Gov* ernment of the State , be State sovereignty* then the Executive and the judicial powers , are also State sovereignty . The only possible case , in which a State Legislature could be pretended to be a State ' sovereignty , would be , where , by the terms of a written Constitution , all power whatever is vested in the Legislature , nothing being reserved to the people . Such a written Constitution , would be comprised in one or two short sentences , and would be- a novelty .  --  - We have no such in America that I know of . As we now see the essential difference between the Legislature of a State , and that supreme power , called State sovereignty , we shall readily perceive , in the rise , progress , and final completion of the Federal Constitution , that every thing which teas done , was in perfect accordance , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , had it been otherwise , the rights of the people , as States , would have been violated . The necessities of the people in every State , called for a change in the structure of the existing Governments . How was this change to be effected ? By the State Legislatures ? Certainly not . The State Legislatures had no light to form a new Constitution . They were competent to form the Confederation , for that was in nature of a league , and it is within the scope of all legislative power , to enter into such a compact . But , when a Constitution is to be formed , Governments are not to be the actors in any way . According to Mr. Paine , in his " RIGHTS OF MAN , " " Government has no right to make itself a party , in any debate , respecting the principles , or modes of forming , or changing Constitutions . It is not for the benefit of those who exercise the powers of Government , that Constitutions , and the Governments , issuing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of judging and acting , is in those who pay  - -  the people ; and not in those who receive . A Constitution is the property of a nation , and not of those who exercise the Govern-ment , " But though no one State Legislature , could place its own people , under a new form of Civil Government , in which Government they were to be associated with the people of other sovereign States , yet they had a right to submit proposals to that effect , which they did by sending deputies to the ( Several Convention . The work of the /z/ Convention being finished , the next inquiry was as to the mode of ratification , There were but two modes , proposed ' in the Conven* tion , by which the people were to be bound as x the people of sovereign States . The first , to have the assent of the State Legislatures* The second , of the people of the States in State Conventions* The latter was preferred . Had the Convention considered , that the assent of the State Legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution* it would have betrayed an extreme ignorance of the true origin of all civil government , and of that inherent right of the people alone , to make a Constitution . The assent of the people in conventions , then , was the only way , in which their assent could be obtained , as sovereign and independent States . They do assemble . In each State , a majority of the people decide for that particular State . The vote is transmitted as one vote , out of thirteen . Delaware , the smallest State in the Union , has the same influence in making up the majority , without which the Constitution can not operate , as Virginia , which is the largest State . And yet we are told by the Supreme Court , that the binding efficacy which the Constitution received in these proceedings , was not the act of the States , as States . But let us , for the sake of argument , pervert terms , and say , that Legislatures are States . Still the acts of the Convention , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States . That sovereign political body , which requires another body to decide for it , any question , which it has the power of itself to decide , is certainly the power , that does the act , and not the Substitute . Quifacit per alium facit per se* Suppose , that instead of the present Constitution , Mr. Pattern son 's plan had been adopted in the Convention , which was so to have enlarged the power of the old Government , as to give it the additional power of imposts and stamp duties , and to regulate com* merce , and to have a Federal Executive , and a Federal Judiciary , Ac . This Government , in the words of the Court , would " be the Government of all . Its powers delegated by all . Representing all , and acting for all. * ' But would any one say , that because it was to act directly on the people , that , on that account , it must be national in its creation . The manner in which a Government is ushered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it is created , are two distinct things . The mode , in which a Government is to operate upon the people , has really no more to do with an enquiry , as to the source from which it emanates , than the manner of its origin , has to do with questions as to the operation of its powers . The only question is , who ratified it . The people , it is true , did it . Who else could ratify it . But did the people ratify it f as the people at large . The answer has been already given . The votes were not a portion of the aggregate votes of all the individuals in the United States , but the vote as one people . It was a single vote . Who , but a State can give a single vote . What is the characteristic of a confederacy of States , according to our own experience ? The voting by States . If South-Carolina , in giving her assent tp the compact , ' tbtes precisely as she did in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , is it not absurd to say , that this ratification is not a federal act . The Court is at some pains to confute the plain proposition , insisted on by the Counsel for the State of Maryland , that the Constitution is a compact between the States in their sovereign capacities . The Government , says the Court " proceeds directly from the people ; " " is ordained and established " in the name of the people ; and is declared to be ordained , " in order to form a more perfect union . " And what then 1 Who are the people here meant 1 The people of the United States as one entire nation , or the people of the Thirteen States . The title or caption of the Constitution , as it is presented to the Conventions , announces it , u as a Constitution framed for the United States of America , by a convention of deputies from the States of New-Hampshire , " &c.; If an argument is to be drawn from what immediately follows in the preamble , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and establish this Constitution , ' 1 I should suppose , the people here meant , must be the people of those thirteen named Stares of America , for which States the Constitution was formed , to wit , New-Hampshire , &c.; The Government , being a compound Government , it would be difficult to say , how it could , upon the whole , be better expressed , supposing that its adoption was to be the act of in* dependent States . Again as to union . What is meant by " more perfect union , " more than an union of sovereign States upon better terms than the confederation afforded . The Court will not say , that a Consolidated Union was the end in view The best way to put an end to all argument , is to ask ourselves this simple question  --  Supposing that it was the real design of the whole convention , that the new Constitution was to be the act of the several States , as States , could it have adopted any other legitimate mode , than that of submitting the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered in the negative , unless we design to maintain the absurdity , that a State Legislature can make a Constitution , which is to associate its people in civil government , with the people of other States . If then , it is clear , that in a State Convention alone , the assent of the people of a State , as a State , can be given to a radical change in the structure of the Government , so as to bind the people of that State , the very circumstance of calling the Convention , incontestibly proves , that its required ratification was to be a State act . It is a loss of time , to attempt to prove what is so plain . That the Government did not emanate from the people , excepting in their sovereign capacities , as separate States , appears also to be the exposition of the Federalist . In speaking of the real character of the Government , considered in relation to the foundation , on which it is to be established , it is said , ( Federalist , No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of America , given by deputies , elected for the special purpose ; but on the other , this assent and ratification , is to be given hv the people , not as individuals , comprising , one entire aation , but , as composing the distinct . ami i/ufepenfonttatesy . te which they respectively belong , tt is to be the assent and ratification of the several States , derived from the supreme authority in each State , the authority of the people themselves . The act , therefore , establishing the Constitution , will not be a National , but a FEDERAL act . " The Federalist goes on to say , u That it will be a federal , and not a national act , ( as the terms are understood by the objectors ) the act of the people , as forming so many independent States , not as forming one aggregate nation , is obvious from this single consideration , that it is to result , neither from a majority of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . It must result from the unanimous assent of the several States , that are parties to it , differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent , than in its being expressed , not by the legislative authority , but by the people themselves . Were the people regarded in this transaction , as forming one nation , the will of . the majority of the whole people of the United States , would bind the minority , in the same manner as the majority of each State , must bind the minority ; and the will of the majority must be determined , either by a comparison of the individual votes , or by considering the will of the majority of the States , as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the U. States* Neither of these rules has been adopted . Each State , in ratifying the Constitution , is considered as a SOVEREIGN BODY , independent of all others , and only to be bound by its voluntary act . In this relation , the new Constitution will , if established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 ' Having thus clearly shewn , as I conceive , that the counsel for the . Defendants in Error , were right in saying , that the federal compact was the act of the State sovereignties , and that the Supreme Court was decidedly wrong in denying the position , it may not be unprofitable , to correct some popular errors on the subject of civil government being considered as a compact ; as on the correction of these , a vt-ry important axiom is hereafter to be maintained , to wit , that to the State Legislatures , as States , and not to the people at large , as its constituents is Congress responsible for the abuse of its powers . These Legislatures have the unquestionable right to keep Congress within the limits of its prescribed powers . It is an erroneous idea , that wherever civil government exists , that there is any compact between the people on the one side , and the the Government on the other , and that the Government iu consequence , has any rights , except when it acts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an incontrovertible point of view , by Thomas Paine , in his " Rights of Man . " In the American Constitutions , of which be was treating , he maintains there is no such idea . The compact , says he , in " each instance , was that of the people with each other , to produce and constitute a Government . To suppose , that any Government , can be a party in a compact , with the whole people , is to suppose it , to have existence , before it can have a right to exist . " In the confederation then , we must admit , that the compact necessarily was . that of the people of the different States , with each other , in the relation of independent /z/ communities . In the Federal Constitution , it is a mistake to sup* pose , that the relation is in the least altered , because the people them selves met , to make the compact , instead of doing it through their Legislatures. - The act of ratifying the compact by such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratification , as an act of an independent State , for it is done by the people themselves , in the most sovereign character , in which they can - possibly be recognized . In no State in this Union , is the sovereignty of the State perfectly represented by its Government . The people may . constantly be in the exercise of all the legislative , judicial , and executive powers of the Government , and yet , they may not be using their utmost sovereignty . In every American Constitution , there are fiowers reserved to the people , which Government can not exercise , t is ' in convention alone , that State sovereignty is without limits or " controu 1 . ' The Constitution then , being a compact , between the people of the different States , as States , and not as individuals , it results , that the tJ . States Government is nothing more than a great trustee , under an irrevocable power of attorney , to perform certain duties , or to execute certain trusts , prescribed to it by the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , which any man , or body of men , have a right to set up , and exercise for their own emolument , but is altogether A TRUST , in right of those , by whom the trust is delegated , and by whom it is always resumeable . It has of itself NO RIGHTS . They are altogether duties . All power exercised over a nation , must have some beginning . It must he either delegated , or assumed . There are no other sources . ALL DELEGATED power is TRUST , aud all assumed power is USURPATION . Time does not alter the nature and quality of either/ 1 If this be not truth , in the name of reason , what shnll we call by that name . Let us then , apply this doctrine to our subject . The power of the Federal Government , we all admit , is a delegated power , and ail delegated power , we must , as freely admit , is u. trust . It is the * State sovereignties who confer this delegated power , and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this view , what becomes of that doctrine so often advanced , that Congress is not amenable to the States , as State sovereignties , for an abuse of its powers . Was it ever , heard , that the parties who create the trust , are uot to see that the purposes of the trust deed are fulfilled . Who else is to complain , and to take the measures to keep a trustee to the proper discharge o* ' his duties , if it be not the constituents of the trust estate . Suppose that the directors of any public trading company , were to violate certain fundamental articles of covenant , between the individuals who may compose such a company , and are so supported by the majority of the stockholders , to the injury of the minority ; what is the remedy ? A Court of Justice , by its writ of prohibition or mandamus , or injunction , or other process , arrests their illegal proceedings . The only difference between the abuse of a private trust , such as has been stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegated sovereign powers , /z/ is , in the nature of the remedy , to be applied* For the first , there are impartial tribunals provided in all regular Governments . For the other , as regards the anomaly in the American plan of Government , it results , from the very nature of the Government , that ho such tribunal . can be found , and that relief must be sought by other means . For who is to appoint such a tribunal 1 Not surely , the delegated Government . It would be , to consent to allow the trustee , not merely to appoint the arbiter , who is to judge , whether he has or has not abused his trust , but to name for that purpose , his own servants , who are fed and supported by him . In this view , the States who constituted the Federal Government , ean never consent , that the United States tribunals should decide , whether the Federal Government had or had not usurped its powers . Such an assent would involve the absurdity just mentioned . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pause . I am aware that it will be said , that the mode of settling all suck questions , is specified in the compact , and is . a part of it ; and that the second section of the third article of the Constitution , makes the United States Judges , the arbiters in all disputes between the Statefer and Congress . I think not . The only part of the section whifeh can be enlisted on the side of such a construction is , that which extends the judicial power of the United States , to all " cases arising under this Constitution , and the lrws of the United States ; " and also , that which speaks of " controversies to which the United States shall be a party . " I have always thought , and do believe , , that had this provision been for any other purpose , than to enable Congress to protect itself , against any exercise of power by the States , prohibited to them by the Constitution , or intended to em% brace great and vital questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to constructive powers as well as cases aP meum and tuum y that it would not have been so loosely expressed. - This view is considerably strengthened by the circumstance* that on , the introduction of these passages , on the 27th and 28th of August* as amendments to the reported draft of the Constitution , there was , no opposition , which can only be accounted for , on the supposition that it was intended to embrace the claims of individuals against the United States , and vice versa . We can not imagine , that so important a provision , as that , by which inherent rights of States were to be , taken away , couild pass unnoticed , if it were understood to refer to . disputes about sovereignty ; but we can readily believe , that if the supposed controversy , was to partake of the ' general nature of the . cases provided for in the same section , which are pecuniary suits at law and equity , that there could be no objection .  --  " Controversies between two or more States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same reason which might warrant the insertion of this last power , to adjust ordinary controversies between two States , would apply to the exclusion of the idea , that important vital rights were to be the subject of cognizance in the Federal Courts , under the amendments . A State differing with a neighbouring State , might be perfectly willing to leave a dispute , about boundaries , &o.; /z/ to the decision of the United States Courts ; because , as between such parties , the arbiter must be impartial , and this would be the case , in all the other cases in the section , allotted to the cognizance of the Federal Courts . But the case is materially altered , when the question to be propounded , to the servants of the Government , is , whether their masters have , or have not usurped their powers . It is requiring too much of frail mortals , ( unless the usurpation be outrageously gross ) to ask of them , to decide in the affirmative . It is unreasonable , even to require of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , to throw those doubts into any other scale , than that of the Government , to which they are attached from interest . The absurdity and the danger of any such stipulation on the part of the States , is too apparent , to admit of the idea , of its ever having been intended , and unless ity can be shewn as clear as the sun in the firmament , that such was actually the iutention of the clause , such a construction ought to be resisted by the States , upon the principle of self-preservation . They have no other recourse . If we , however , look into the journals of the Convention , we shall be satisfied , that it never once eutered into the minds of the members to pro* ride for any other disputes , than such as might occur between States as to boundaries or territorial jurisdiction , or between a State and Congress , where the former might be disposed ( as was feared ) to pass laws , clashing with the expressly delegated powers of Congress . It was anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction . In the confederation , a mode of adjustment had been provided . In the first draft also , of the Constitution , proposed by Mr. Pinckney , a power for this purpose , was invested in the Senate . In the reported draft of the Constiation , by the committee of detail , the same power is invested in the Senate . But in neither of them , nor in any of the fire plans submitted to the Convention , is there any provision proposed for disputes , involving rights of sovereignty , between the United States and any one State* None of the proposed plans , as to the settlement of State disputes , being agreed to , it was finally judged proper to make the Federal Judiciary , the tribunal . There was a strong apprehension in the Convention , that the State laws woold interfere with those of the National Legislature , and it was upon this expectation , that Mr. Madison advocated Mr. Pinckicby 's proposhioe , that a Congress should have a negative upon all State taws , and because , * he moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could impartially determine line of State powers , when drawn in doubtful rases , ' 7 This proposition having been thri e l  --  *st in convention , twke on the discussion of Mr. Randolph 's resolution , anJ once again on the 23d of August , it became necessary in the minds of some members , that provision should be made , to prevent the States passing laws , which - might infringe the powers exclmstcrbf delegated to Congress/ ' tor that is the expression in Mr. Pikcksey * draft . The Committee of detail not having made any such provision in their reported draft of the Constitution , because it would have been repugnant to their instructions , and the proposition having been repealed on the 23d /z/ -f August , as an additional enumerated- power , there arose a necessity of a different phraseology of the judiciary clause , when it was under consideration . The judicial power was then extended " to all cases in law and Equity , arising under this Constitution and the laws of the United States , " and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . "  - -  The provision evidently was intended for the cases , which might arise , from the States , interfering with the powers delegated to Congress . It is impossible to read the secret journals of the Convention , without being struck with the unfounded fears , which at that day seized the bosoms of the majority of the members , as to the danger of the State Legislatures , constantly embarrassing the new Government . Thirty-five years experience has demonstrated that all their apprehensions were as " the baseless fabric of a vision . " To prevent the evils which they anticipated from this source was the cause of those very amendments to the judiciary clause , which have been supposed to give the United States Courts cognizance of all disputes as to the extent of the constructive powers of Congress  --  however vitally such disputes might affect the sovereignty and very existence of some of the States . Mr. Hamilton , ( Federalist No. 80 sustains this very motive for introducing the above amendments . In speaking of the necessity of some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " the power must either be a direct negative on the State laws , or an authority in the Federal Courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of Union . The latter , appears to have been thought by the Convention , preferable to the former , and I presume will be most agreeable to the States . " In speaking , however , of the motives of the Convention , as to the above amendments to the judiciary section , I am not to be understood , to say , that it is altogether clear , that even the constmction here given or admitted , is not too liberal , but merely to contend , that whatever the words may mean , they could not mean , more than to provide a substitute for tha favourite measure of some members , a negative upon such State laws , as might be passed , in repugnance to the express prohibitions in the Constitution .  - -  There is a view of this subject , which at this moment strikes me with some force , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hamilton 's exposition just quoted , that all these amendments , might have been intended simply to refer to pecuniary claims , preferred by or against the United States , and also , to all suits which must necessarily or ordinarily arise , between one citizen and another , out of the general 1 proceedings of the Government , and the conduct of its officers , agents or servants . The only way , to come at the intentions of the convention , is , to go up to the fountain head , for their first meaning , and to observe whether that meaning was altered , and how far it was altered by its subsequent acts . In Mr. Randolph 's 16th resolution , the outline of the power of the judiciary , is thus given . " To extend to cases , arising under laws , passed by the General Legislature , and to such other questions , as involve the national peace and harmony . " That by the words , . national peace and harmony , " was intended , no more than disputes between States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " cases arising under laws . of the , tJnited States , " the clashing of jurisdiction which might take place between . /z/ the Federal and State Judges as to admiralty and other jurisdiction , as to piracies , captures , &c.; is evident , from the simple , and yet important fact , that the committee of detail , who heard all the debates , certainly understood the resolution in this sense , fn their reported draft of a Constitution , they make provision for the settlement of disputes between States , and for other cases connected with the national harmony , but none whatever as regards collisions between the Federal , and the State Governments , as to powers . We can not therefore believe , that under these expressions , " national peace and harmony , " the Convention ever did intend to include , such important disputes , as collisions about sovereignty . The most rational construction would be , that the cases arising under Legislative enactments , were such only , as must ordinarily occur , under every Government , and no others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28th of August , by adding the words " at Law and Equity " seems to establish this exposition , and as some cases of pecuniary interest probably might occur under the " Constitution " as well as of the laws of the United States , this may have been the cause of the addition of that word u Constitution " also to the section . The claim of Massachusetts , against Congress , for militia claims during the late war , would have been a case of Law and Equity , arising under the Constitution , had Congress not have allowed these claims . Other instances might , no doubt , be cited . In the Virginia Convention and North-Carolina Conventions , ( I have not seen the debates of any other ) when this clause was under consideration , great as were the objections , yet , no speaker anticipated the evil , of any such construction , that the judicial power was to decide questions of jurisdiction and sovereignty between the United States and any particular State . The whole apprehension was , that in process of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all the subjects of litigation , so as finally to leave to the State Courts , nothing to do . Their fears are likely to be realized , by a decision of Judge Story 's in Delovio &; Boit . The introduction of the words u controversies , to which the United States shall be a party , " it is true , would countenance the supposition , that questions respecting the boundaries- of power , were contemplated as fit for the cognizance of the Judiciary . But , on the other hand , it is extremely difficult to conceive , for the reasons already given , in this and a previous number , that disputes about vital sovereignty were intended to be referred to any such tribunal . A sovereign State can never be presumed ) in any compact which it enters into with another State , to yield inherent rights of sovereignty . The absuidity and the danger of any State agreeing to entrust the decision of disputes about sovereignty , to an arbiter , to be appointed by the opposite party , is the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained . What would become of the States , if , under indefinite phrases in the Constitution , they could , in this way , be deprived of all their rights . I have not forgotten , that as regards disputes relating to the boundary between the Federal and the State jurisdictions , Mr. Hamilton considers the Supreme Court as the tribunal , which is established for the purpose of ultimately deciding : them . and in his thirty-ninth number , he justifies " such a tribunal us essential to prevent an appeal to the sword , and a dissolution of ' the compact/ " : But , against this short antl transitory , or accidental police of the subject , is to be opposed , , f he ' fact , ( hat whenever he tat* /z/ occasion to answer objections , to the Federal Government , as a Govern* ment , likely to usurp power , and thus to endanger public liberty , he never once suggests , that the remedy for such a state of things , is to be sought ) elsewhere , " than in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all positive forms of Government . " He calculates , invariably , that " all schemes of usurpation , if attempted by the national rulers , will easily be defeated by the Stale Go vernments . " Nor ought there to be any other remedy . It is proper that a tribunal should beat hand , to decide conti ovei sies relating to the boundary of jurisdiction , between Congress and the States , because all parties , might be willing , to have the opinion of such a tribunal , as long as it shall , by its proceedings , an J the conduct of its members , inspire Miutoal confidence  - -  The exposition of any particular clause in the Constitution , by such a tribunal , might have so much weight , as to have the effect of preserving the harmony between both Governments . It is in this view , and in no other that the Supreme Court , ought to be solicited for jits opinion . It might also happen , that the decision of the Court might be right , upon all the princi* pies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , there mVy be circumstances , which would not warrant an obedience oftbeStatef to its decrees . The General Government might so usurp power , as to be beyond the reach of my ground , on which a Court could pronounce its acts unconstitutional . In a former number , I noticed the Tariff , as an instance . The " Woollens ' Bill " is perfectly constitutional , if the Court shall be called upon for its opinion in relation to it , because it must decide , according to the provisions of the Bill , and can not enter into any notice of the motives of the Congress for passing such a bill . If it should pass , It will , in its shape , and all its provisions , be an act simply " to lay imposts , " which is within the enumerated powers of Congress , whilst its design would be to promote a great local interest in particular States . Here is a case in which a State , would commit an act of SUICIDE , were it to admit of the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compact , it was . to seek no redress , but in the Courts of the United States . Other illustrations might be adduced . Let one suffice . According to the letter of the Constitution , the compact may at any time be altered , with the assent of three fourths of the States . There is but one single restriction , now ex- ' isting , on the power to amend the Constitution , which is , that the equality of suffrage in the Senate , shall be preserved . Supposing now , that Eighteen States were willing , that the Constitution should be so altered , that a ' power be conferred on Congress to promote the objects of the Colonization Society , and to purchase and remove gradually , out of the United States , the slaves of the Southern States . This proposition is actually suggested in the last Philadelphia Quarterly Review  --  or suppose the proposed amendment be , a declaratory clause , that Congress has the right to abolish slavery under the Constitution , on compensation being given to individual ? . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radical change in the Government as to its structure , so as to make it any thing but what the States originally designed it to be . What is there in the letter of the Constitution to prevent all these things being done  - -  Were the Supreme Court called upon to decide , as to the right to make such alterations , would it not be compelled to say , that by the terms of the grant , there is an unlimited power to amend , excepting in one solitary case , /z/ and moreover , might it not Mso call to its assistance , that refined metaphysical doctrine of its own Chief Justice , that u a power to create , implies a power to preserve " and from that power to create , easily deduce " a power to change . " In such an emergency as this , would any one doubt the right of the six dissentient States , to dissolve the compact , on the simple ground , that an alteration , , either in the fundamental polity of a State , or , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of the spirit , in which the Constitution was formed . No one can doubt it . This subject might be pursued almost without end I have already stated that in all instances of abuse or usurpation of power , on the part of Congress , the Stete Sovereignties , being parties to the compact , it is their right to remonstrate , and to resist . But some may say , that according to my own previous reasoning , it is the people in convention , who have this right , and not the State Legislatures , who are not the people , but only a portion of the sovereign power of the State . This objection is thus removed :  --  Under the State constitutions , all power , which is not reserved to the people in a bill of rights , or by positive limitations , is invested in the State Legislatures . Not so in the United States* Government . In the exercise then , of that portion of the supreme power , which is conferred on a State Legislature , by its Constitution , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , not expressly forbidden , which the people themselves could possess . Amongst those rights , stands pre-eminent , the sovereign right of demanding that all compacts entered into , with other States , be faithfully fulfilled , and of adopting such measures to enforce such compacts as in their wisdom they shall judge fit . If the people of SouthCarolinn , in their collective - capacity as a State , be a party to the Federal compact , ( as is the fact , ) they have the undoubted right , to call the General Government to account for an abuse of its delegated powers . If the people have that right , the same right belongs to the Legislature , that body having in this particular , all the rights , and having imposed on it all the duties of the people . And it is a right , which 1 trust they will not only exercise , but so use it , as to preserve the State . But view the compact as we will . Let us regard the Federal Government , as it really is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been suggested , as a deed TRIPARTITE , in which the people en masse are one party , the - people as States another , and the people in one great political community as a third ; or let us call it a CONFEDERACY of States ; or by any other name we please , there is yet one feature in the system , which every man in the United States has always before his eyes , and that is , that we are governed , as one entire nation , and at the same time exist as twenty-four separate sovereignties , and that a common friendship , after all , is the great bond of our Union . @#@ n a difference of opinion then , as to the true meaning of any particular provision in the compact , the same course ought to be . adopted , as would be proper between one friendly nation and another . As in the latter case , a conference would be proposed , before any step would be resorted to , as likely to lead to serious misunderstanding or war ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it assumed any great substantive power , such as the power over internal improvements ought , ( under that provision , in the Constitution , which empowers it topropose amendments ) to have submitted to the State Legislatures , the question , whether such a power belonged to the States , or to Congress , and /z/ Ill thus by soliciting their aid and advice , as to the true intent of all parties , it would have gained for itself , the confidence and the support of the State Legislatures . To both , the power cannoi belong , for I have demonstrated , I trust , satisfactorily , in my nineteenth number , that there can be no divU sion of sovereignty , on the subject of internal improvements . If Congress be not exclusively sovereign , as to every purpose for which the Federal Government was created , it can not be sovereign at all . The concurrence of authority in Legislation , is only as to taxation , which is only a means of promoting the objects , for which Civil Government exists , and not itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist on any other subject .  - -  The United States ' Government is supreme within its sphere of action , and the States equally sovereign as to their reserved powers . This is the decision . f the Supreme Court , and can not be confuted . The fault of the Supreme Court , is not , that it decides the United States ' Government to be sovereign for the great purposes of its creation , but ' because it confers on Congress , as means of executing those powers , contrary to the spirit of the league , poweis which have no necessary , and appropriate connection Aitb those expressed objects , to which their Legislation is expressly confined by the terms of the instrument . Every patriot and friend to his country , must freely admit , that where there are two rules of interpretation , or two modes of adjusting difficulties , that must always be the best , and the safest , from which no inconvenience or injustice can arise to either party . The difference between the two modes is this  --  Under the construction here contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the States generally , which may not be fairly referred to some one or other of the many enumerated powers , and therefore the measure may be constitutionally adopted . Should it so happen , that there may be an object , for which the Constitution has not provided , if such an object be one of general and primary interest , the instrument itself , has provided the means , by which it may be accomplished .  - -  An amendment to the Constitution , may , at any time , be proposed , and if the new power asked for , be necessary to war , foreign negotiation and commerce , ( those great ends of the Union , ) there is no fear , but what three-fourths of the States will agree to the amendment . The people will always have intelligence enough to discover their true interests . If the assent of three-fourths of the State Legislatures , for this purpose , can not be obtained , it would prove that the power ought not to be exercised . It is for the happiness of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not for US own sake ; and the people , heard through their State Legislatures , are the best judges , whether any new contemplated measure will , or will not , augment their happiness . If the power be necessary , and it be refused v the people will suffer , as they ought to suffer . By this construction , the Federal Government will be the sun , or centre of a great political system , diffusing its light and warmth , to all the State Governments , which harmoniously and beautifully revolve around it , and thus , the order and design of the Convention , will be preserved* But , under the opposite course , which is the one adopted by Congress , viz. that of seizing upon power in all doubtful cases , a discretion is given to select objects for legislation , to which there is no affixing any limits , and the necessity of which may not be seen ; a door may thus be opened for ex. travagance and waste in the public expenditure j the people may be but thened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority , under , the pretext of their being national ; seciiomiljeafri/Met will be fomented ; an habitual disregard to the State Legislatures will be encouraged ; no amendments to the Constitution will be thought of ; ant strifes and contentions , between the States and Congress , will increase and multiply , until by some great convulsion , we shall all be resolved again into our original elements . Are we not , under the intemperate measures ' of Congress , rapidly approaching such a crisis ? /z/ If Congress had not regarded itself as omnipotent in legislation* it would not have ventured to name amongst its committees , " a committee on Agriculture " as if it possessed an atom of sovereignty to regulate Agriculture any more than it can pass laws on the subject of Negro Slavery , or regulate descents at law . What but a sense of its own omnipotence could prompt this body to think of laying one section of the Union under tribute , to encourage the industry of another portion 1 And shall we , in the Southern States , who furnish such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products ; shall an interest so great and so paramount as the Agricultural interest of the South , be prostrated , that the local interests of Massachusetts or Pennsylvania may be promoted 1 1 would insult you , my fellow-citizens , were I to doubt your unanimity in the reply which must be given . From one extreme of the State to the other , your voice has already been heard , and your resolutions expressed in terms not to be mistaken . As for myself , 1 can not conceive a measure more fraught with permanent mischief and ruin to the Plantation States , than the Tariff . It is not simply to tax us to support our Northern brethren , but it is also to destroy all our means to acquire the ability to pay those taxes . In these States there are but two interests , and thev cherish and support each other . The one is AGRICULTURAL ; the other COMMERCIAL . Within ' the memory of man , and the records of history , no other interests than these ever grew up in our country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not hazarding too much to assert , that no other can exist in South-Carolina . In this respect , we not only differ as to interest from the Northern States , but we differ from every State and Kingdom in Europe . The cause of the difference is obvious . In those countries the great produce of the soil is bread stuffs ; the population is dense ; the soil is cultivated by whites ; labour is more or less cheap ; and each being likely to raise in abundance , those articles which the others need not , causes an anxiety in all to seek amongst themselves for the means of consuming the surplus produce of their own soil . That a period may occur in the future history of the Northern , Middle and Western sections of this Union , when manufactures may be properly regarded as of primary importance to them , it would be as much a waste of time to deny , as it would be to assert , that in the past periods of European history , they were not sometimes most judiciously encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity even now of /z/ i encouraging manufactures to a certain extent in the Northern State* , 00 as not to interfere with others 0$ their local interests of equal magnitude , may be true . I , therefore , have not the smallest disposition to dispute the utility of manufactures in general , as a source of wealth and prosperity , provided all circumstances suit for their introduction into a country . 1 feel the weight of all that has been said in their favour ; and believe that where they are permitted to grow up alongside of other interests , under the protecting care of a Government which has the undoubted power to extend its patronage to them , ( as is the case with every consolidated Government ) they * will give activity and energy , to every languishing branch of internal industry . But however true it is , as a general position , that domestic manufactures is the true policy of nations , who abound with a dense and a crowded population , and in which there is more capital than Agriculture or Commerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards the application of the axiom to the Southern States of this Union , and particularly to the plantation or cotton growing States , there is not one word of truth , in all that has been written as to the utility of manufactures , from the beginning of the world until the present day . All the writers who have discussed the subject , have discussed it with the sole view to the interest and circumstances of the countries in which they lived and wrote  --  countries , the very opposite to these Southern States , in climate , soil , population* production , and agricultural labour . It is therefore false , under any possible light in which the subject of manufactures can be viewed , as regards the South , that any pro- tection given by Congress to the manufacturers of Pennsylvania , can operate otherwise than as an indirect tax upon the people of the Southern States , amounting exactly to the difference between what they now pay , and the cheaper price at which they might obtain the article , if the three tariffs already imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , to tell them that the Northern manufacturer can supply us with goods upon the same terms as the foreign merchant . He now furnishes , it is true , some coarse fabrics cheaper than the English dealer ; but he is protected by duties almost amounting to prohibition of the rival article from abroad .  - -  Take off all the tariffs of 1816 , 1820 and 1824 , and every manufacturer in the United States , for the protection of whose fabrics these tariffs were imposed , will be a bankrupt without a single exception . If it were otherwise , two and two could not make four ; for the pro-* tection afforded by these Tariffs is not trifling . It is prodigious . All the bold assertions , therefore , of these men , and their adherents in this southern country , are to be disregarded . Any man of common sense must know , that if the home manufacturer could sell his fabrics for a lower price than is demanded by the foreign dealer for the same goods , that he would not ask for protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woollen goods , by the Websters , Everetts &; Co. is , that the British having reduced their duty five pence or foreign wool , gives the British capitalist an advantage in our market over the home manufacturer . In the name /z/ fcf common sense what is this but a direct admission that the British are about to undersell them . With the same boldness of assertion , they also tell our folks , ( and surprising to say , it is believed by some ) that the Eastern people can actually undersell the British in a foreign market , whilst the British are so underselling the Websters , Everetts &; Co. in Boston , in their own market , that they are obliged to clamour for an additional Tariff upon woollens lest they should be all ruined . No , my fellow-citizens . All that has been written on the subject , of manufactures , has no more application to the Southern country , than it has to the Sandwich Islands , or any other Islands in the Pacific Ocean . Our policy ic a peculiar one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material of manufactures not being raised in Europe , the foreign demand of it , never can be partial or occasional , as is the case with bread stuffs , or the fleece of sheep , or other produce of the soil at the North  --  but must be steady and constant as long as England shall continue to manufacture for the world . Even Alexander Hamilton , in his elaborate report on manufactures , admits , " that if one nation were in a condition to supply manufactured articles on better terms than another , that other might find an abundant indemification in a superior capacity to furnish the produce of the soil . And a free exchange , mutually beneficial , of the commodity each was able to supply , on the best terms , might be carried on between them  --  supporting in full vigor , the in industry of each . " Mr. Hamilton had here , in his view , two coun- - tries , each of whom could manufacture . His reasoning would , I think , well apply to the United States and England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , which is cotton , there is a capacity to produce it only in one country . But , Mr. Hamilton 's reasoning must be much more conclusive , where one country can manufacture , and the other can not . This is the case as regards Great Britain and the Plantation States . We can raise the raw material  --  she can not . She can manufacture  --  we can not . But how yain are th  --  speculations often of the wisest men . Alexander Ha- , milton never committed a more egregious blunder , than when he hazarded before Congress , in his report , the opinion , " That theEXTENSIVE cultivation of cotton in the United States , could , perhaps , hardly be expected , but from the previous establishment of domestic manufactories of the article . " Every Planter knows , that for his cotton , he must look to Europe , and to England particularly , for a market . England is the principal customer , with whom we can expect to deal upon reciprocal terms , and to our greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be any , between Europe and the Plantation States  - -  as there is , and always must be , between OLD England and NEW England . We are exactly in the situation of two shop-keepers , who do not vend , or deal in , the same articles  --  rand between whom , there is no prospect of competition  --  and between whom , there of course , never cau be jealousy . Only close the European trade against us and where shall we look for a market ? Not certainly to the North , /z/ which does not probably consume a seventh of what we raise . No* Should that day ever arrive , that England shall not want our cotton  --  then may we despair . Our true interest , I repeat , which is a distinct interest from am Eastern interest , is a free and uninterrupted commerce with the whole world , and particularly withJBngland , where are the work shops of sufficient extent , to work up the raw material which wc raise , and are in danger of raising in too great abundance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with protecting or prohibitory duties , and we drive our best customers to seek the raw material elsewhere , and to encourage other countries to grow cotton wool for them . With the exception of the fine brands of Sea Island cotton , it must be remembered , that a third of the globe is capable of producing cotton . To imagine , therefore , that England will take our cotton , if she is to go to South America and bring gold and silver for it , and not her own manufactures , betrays extreme ignorance . The experiment once hazarded , it may be fatal to us for ever . Commerce is a shy damsel , and must be caressed . Once slighted by a nation , she returns no more . What then will be the situation of South-CaroHna 1 Will it be any consolation to us , that the time may come , in some hundred years hence , that the Eastern folks shall realize their visions of manufacturing for the world  --  and drive x England and France entirely out of the market  --  when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , shall have been impoverished  - -  and more generations than the present , be reduced to beggary , and be involved in one common ruin . This can not , and MUST NOT be . We have but one intercut , and that is , the Agriculture that produces , and the Commerce that wafts our cotton and rice io the shores 1 of Europe . * No other interest can flourish , or even take root in our land . . Nature has decreed , by an immutable decree , that in foreign commerce , shall South-Carolina seek for the sources of her 1 prosperity , and her importance as a member of the great American family . The Government , therefore , which places upon that commerce any restraint , is not the Government that would , but the Government which ALREADY HAS RIVETED the CHAINS around the neck and the feet of Southern industry .

Disunion did I say ? Whether disunion- shall approach us , rests not with ourselves , but with our Northern brethren . Forbearance and pusillanimity in the South , may retard , but can not finally prevent disunion . There /z/ is a point , beyond which , we never can endure the oppression of Congress . The " veriest worm will turn when trodden on , " and sooner or later , we must turn on those , who would lay us under perpetual tribute . It is firmness alone  --  the same firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such success , the aggressious of Britain , that is to carry us triumphantly through all the perils which assail and surround us , and which in the end , will , in my humble view , lead to the regeneration of the liberties and the sovereignties of the States , as secured by the Federal Constitution . Let there be but one mind and one soul in the South , and we shall have more perfect union , and with our Northern brethren , better friendship and better feelings . There is no Congress that has yet been convened , or that will sit in our day , that will dare to trifle with freemen , who know their rights , and know too how to maintain them ; who have within themselves , the resources for empire , the same resources which give to this 1 Union , its extended commerce , and which is constantly aggrandizing the Northern States , whilst it impoverishes ourselves ; whose half a million of cotton bags are a circulating wedium , or as . so many Bank of England Notes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pot Ashes , and Flour of the North , are dull and heavy merchandize . Let Congress then , be told distinctly , that though the ** current of the public Treasury , has always run as steadily and unceasingly , to the North and East , as the 6hdf Stream , and with as little prospect of its ever changing , its course , " yet that , when by some great political convulsion , it shall cnange its course , all those regions of the North , hitherto improved by the commerce created by our . products , and . by the rich contents of our Custom Houses , borne year after year , on the bosom of the fertilizing stream , will become comparatively barren and unproductive , whilst South Carolina , like a Phoenix* will rise from the ashes in which she is humbled . Let Congress beware , bow it approaches us with any extension of the Tariff , or it may tread upon the RATTLESNAKE of the South . " It is SLOW in . its resistance , GENEROUS in its warning , but may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to establish a Tariff to protect manufactures , were evea a power warranted by the Constitution , still the motives for abstaining from its exercise , at the present time , are so many , and so powerful , that the mind would he at a loss to conceive , how an impartial Congress , legislating ! for itbe whole Union , and not a part , should be so fatally bent upon its-adoption , did we not know from experience , that where suggestions of interest are at . all attended to , the judgment must be in unison with that interstJ Such is the case with the present , ' , and I believe will , every day , be more and more the case , with the majority of every Congress , which shall . hereafter be assembled at Washington ; " Whether an extensive protection to manufactures , will , or will not be , productive , of the general good , which is anticipated , even in those parts of the Union , where the clamour for protection is so great , is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no concern of oars . It will be enough for the purposes of oar argu- in that the great body of the people in those States , are in favour of itianufactures . As long as this opinion shall prevail , and it will never subside , it is quite natural , that these people should , through their representatives in Congress , advocate " the American Policy/ 5 as it is termed . To - expect , that with all the bright prospects of a general activity in business before their eyes , they should not combine their efforts , or that they will turn aside to ask themselves , whether the same measures , by which they are to be aggrandized , may not ruin other States , is so far from being rational , that it is contrary to all experience . It is rare , to find men in private life , practising that wholesome Christian precept , to do as they would be done by . In political societies , it is still moie rare , and hence it is , ' that considerations of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , therefore , we desire to know , how this , or that community will act , under any particular circumstances , there is no better way of coming at the truth , than to ask ourselves , in what does the interest , or the supposed inteiest of such a community consist . The answer being given , it will be seen that its opinions accord with their interest . Now the opinion of the North is , ( whether right or wrong is immaterial ) that manufactures is their true and proper policy , and artful men have persuaded many of their good people into the happy belief , that in promoting their own interest , they advance at the same time , the interest of all the States . Thus we account for the majority of the members of Congress , voting for the tariffs , and as this opinion will prevail more and more every day , as these people shall taste the sweets of an extensive monopoly , so we in the South , must make up our minds , that in the natural course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter , more and more of that influence , which will raise up Manufactures , at the expense of our Agriculture and out Commerce . Unless then , we resist the tariff on principle , so as to be done with it for ever , it will be a subject constantly before Congress , and we shall never have any repose . The tariff question will no more die away in our country , than Catholic Emancipation or Par " Uamentary Reform will in England . It is a mistake to suppose , that the tariff question , is the measure of this or that political party . It is not got up for the purposes of the Presidential Election . It is a movement of the people in the Northern , Middle , and Western States , who feeling the depressed state of their agriculture from competition with Europe , and the want of art adequate market , are taught to look up to Manufactures , as best calculated to create a home market for their grain , wool , iron , and other products of their soil , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political characters will take advantage of this feeling at the North , and make it a stepping stone to their preferment , it would be folly to deny 5 and that Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay , are using this feeling for their own purposes , I do as sincerely believe , as I must confess , that on the opposite side , there are also some men , who will , if they have the opportunity , use the excitement against the Tariff , for similar purposes . It is paying too great a compliment to the politicians on either side , to suppose that they have created these opposite feelings in the North and in the South . The knowing politicians on both sides , one and all , are not leading , but they are following public opinion . Opposed as I always have been , and now am , heart and mind , to Mr. Adams , yet I would scorn to make a charge upon his Administration , which /z/ it does not merit . The odium of the tariff belongs not to him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Jackson , nor any other President hereafter to be elected , can ever suppress the clamour at the North for domestic manufactures . The firm resolution of the South , to oppose it on principle , and at every hazard can alone exempt us from its operations . Let us then , not deal unfairly to our political antagonists . Let our opposition to Mr. Adams , be steady , manly , and honorable . There are sufficient grounds , on which , as Americans , we may oppose him , and I hope successfully . But the tariff question must not be entangled with the politics of Jackson or of Adams It may suit some crafty politicians , on both sides , who are thinking more of their own interests , than either of the North or the South , to blend two subjects , which have no connection with each oilier . The tariff question is a sacred question , and it belongs to the sons of the South alone , as Southern men , to consider it . The man amongst ' us , who would approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , than those of a South-Carolinian , or who , before he would decide , upon this or that measure to be taken at this crisis , would ask , what effect it would have upon the Presidential election , is unfit to be a counsellor or an actor in times like these . He may be an American , but he is not a Ca-rolinian* It is the excitement of the Presidential elections , which , hitherto , has prevented us from looking carefully into our own situation , and has at length brought us to the unpleasant dilemma in which we find ourselves . It is an excitement , which promises to be perpetual in our country , and if we suffer it to engross our thoughts , as we hitherto have done , South-Carolina MUST perish . Let us then give to this qustion a portion of our interest , and not our whole interest . The vote of South-Carolina is irrevocably fixed for the Hero of New-Orleans . As Americans , let us , without noise , support him in 1828 . As South-Carolinians , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do Mr. Adams ' ' . General Jackson may be as much a Tariff President , as is Mr. Adams . As far as the acts of an individual indicate his sentiments , he is in principle t a Tariff manGeneral Jackson voted for the Tariff upon principle  --  Mr. Adams how supports it with a view to his own interest . We have it on the unquestionable authority of Mr. M'Dupfie , that Gen. Jackson is for the Tariff on principle , and also on the authority of Mr. Dickerson , the respectable Senator from New-Jersey . Mr. Dickerson is a fiiend of the General , and mentions the fact , to his praise , that his election in Pennsylvania may hot suffer from a contrary impression . The rei*V difference between the two candidates is this  --  Mr. Adams , who in 1820 , voted against the tariff and internal improvements , now advocates all these measures , with a view to his re-election to the Presidency . unstable a man as this , is not to be relied on . General Jackson having approved of the tariff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from an honest conviction of its necessity at the time , possibly , may alter that opinion . His refusal to take the Presidency from the hands of Henry ( lay , is a magnanimous instance of self denial . Such a man as this , will never administer the Government . to his re-election , but solely with a view to his own honest fame , and the good of his country . From such a President there is every thing to hope and little to fear . Once convinced that an extension of the tariff would disturb the harmony of the States , he would be apt to discountenance it , by further /z/ support , and this too , at all hazards to himself . This , however , is mere opinion . He may or may not disappoint his friends . Let us all hope for the best* but in the mean time , let us so act , as not to be diverted from vrhrt ought to constitute one main object , which is , to oppose the tariff upon the right r and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the people 's eyes , to make them believe , that on Jackson 's being elected , all will certainly be right , or that South- Carolina will be benefited by the change as to her situation with the North . Such opinions are fatal , mischievously fatal to us . It is not with this , or that Administration , that we are to contend . We shall have to oppose every future Administration , as we now oppose Adams ' , until the tariff be put down , and put down for ever . Let us no longei be as cards in a pack , to be shuffled backwards and forwards , in a garue , in which we can gain nothing , but will lose all that is valuable and dear to us . Under these circumstances , and with every prospect before their eyes , that the manufacturing policy , would acquire strength and vigour as the Government would wax older , and that in a few years more , we shall be an insignificant minority in Congiess , it has often amazed me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tariff , almost every ground of opposition , excepting the true and the only ground upon which South-Carolina is to stand or to fall . The Representatives from this State have zealously and ably discharged their duty .  - -  They have done as much , nay more , * than the rest of the Southern minority in Congress ; but yet 1 ask , and I ask it with the most profound respect and deference to them all , what has been done , compared with what might have been done , had they brought their legal acquirements , their profound research , their knowledge of Constitutional law , and that phalanx of general Mlenrs of which they had the command , and that weight of character for which they are distinguished , to bear , not upon the secondary and to us unimportant question of expediency , but upon the great and paramount question of the Constitutional powers of Congress  --  a question so full of interest to n  --  , who have no safety , but in the integrity and sovereignty of the States , The Southern members generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the interests even of the Northern States . They demonstrated its folly in various ways , and they brought to the argument all the aids which genius , high intellect , and their profound knowledge of the subject could furnish . They failed not to entrench themselves behind such names as Hcskisson in the old , and Franklin in the new worlds .  - -  Their whole effort , was , in truth , a splendid display of talent , and a rich repast . But had all the speeches which were made , to the South of the Potomac , been the speeches of a Bukkk or a Canning ; had they been " an irradiating bi ? am of light , a continued blaze of eloquence " from the beginning to the end ; yet , the light that was shed in that discussion , , was not the light , to lighten their constituents to the spot , where their liberties were violated , and their wrongs inflicted . It was not that pillar of lire , by which , in the dark and dismal night which is fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a wilderness of unsettled opinions as to the Constitutional right , into paths , where we might find some rock , on which we might build for our safety , and defy all the tempests , with which the constructive powers of Congress , with the fury of a desolating and overwhelming flood , are sweeping away the rights of the States . /z/ To dwell so much on the impolicy of the Tariff as a national measure , and scarcely more , than to hint at its unconstitutionality , aas , for us , most unfortunate The tenacity too , with which the Southern members clung to this ground , implied , that in their minds , it was the strongest find the best ground . But they were all mistaken . The inexpediency of the Tariff is a ground which must forever slip from under us . To rely on guch a ground as this , is to build upon the sands , for we are the minority , and must continue a minority , and as a minority we must submit , in such a view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be violated , by a clear and unequivocal act of usurpation , as ever was practised , why did not all the members South of the Potomac , with one soul and one mind , when they perceived a measure proposed so " big with the fate ' of the Southern States , as is the Tariff ; why did they not , 1 repeat , bring all the power of their minds , in demonstrating to the world , that neither the letter , nor the spirit of the Constitution , could authorize such a system of robbery , upon their constituents ! The unconstitutionality of the measure i  --  -  --   --   --  Alone should live Within the book and volume of their brain , Unmixed with baser matter . I declare most solemnly , that if I thought no better ground could be taken against the Tariff , than its impolicy , as a measure of State 5 or if I wer 1 inspired with no better hope of ridding my country of this mill stone around its neck , than the forbearance of the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and the South . 1 would yield it , and forever sit down , and be content to wear the chains , which , with our own consent in 1789 , we fastened upon ourselves . If by that family compact , called the Constitution , South-Carolina ever surrendered , expressly or impliedly , any power to Congress , to legislate unequally upon the States , or to touch any subject , in which one State did not possess an interest in common with every other State , I would give up my State in despair . And which of us would not despair ! Take from us the ground o ( the unconstitutionality of the measure , and what remains for us to do , but to submit , as is the duty of every good and patriotic citizen . What are fine speeches , what the powers of argument , when they are addressed to men , whose constituents have , perhaps , an hundred millions o ( dollars at hazerd , unless protected by Tariffs ! What are the sayings and doctrines of the political economists ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you address a body , the interest of whose constituents consists in differing from you , who Were they to assent against their will , Would be of the same opinion still . Men , with whom , if we except the recollections which the glories of our Revolution inspire , have not , nor never can have the feelings , the sympathies , or the associations that are in common with us in the South . I would as soon address myself to the Khan of Tartary , or as Mr. Jefferson saysj to the marble columns of the Legislative Halls , with a hope of success , as to expect to operate upon the minds of a majority of Congress , sent from Tariff States to protect their focal interests . No . If we are to be relieved /z/ from the usurpations that are pressing us tn the dust , w ? must not go to Washington , with arguments to convince the VYkbsters and the Evkrktts , that by the Tariff policy , they will injuie themselves as well a us . Such a ground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . They understand the science of political economy better than those who have written on the subject Their sagacity in discern* ing their true interests , is by a kind of instinct , and the success of their establishments , and the activity that has been given to the industry of the country around Boston , by a spirit for manufactures , has caused even their farmers to bo enamoured with the " American Policy ; " and thus , we have a signal and a splendid triumph of the intelligence and good sense of a few plain woollen weavers of Massachusetts , over the metaphysical subtleties of the school of the economists . Let us then , not think of going to Congress as suppliants for their fa* vour , but let our representatives repair thither , with the HISTORY of our Revolution in the one hand , and the DECLARATION of Independence in the other . By the ONE document , Congress may be reminded of what it has forgotten ; namely , the separation of valuable colonies from a mother country , brought about by the tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may learn lessons of wisdom and moderation . By the OTHER , it will be astounded at the manner in which . freemen can speak of their wrongs , and when it recollects , that the descendants of those freemen , inherit all the principles and the chivalry of their sires , such a recollection will be worth more than all the speeches from Maine to Florida . /z/ There is another contemplated exercise of power , which soonef or Later , will take place in Congress , and which , in my view , must be resisted at every cost , about which there must be no empty resolutions , no parleying , no compromise . That subject , is the olaim of the American Colonization Society , to be supported from the Na- tionai Treasury . - I know , that many of my ' fellow-citizens , in some parts of thet State , will not at once fall into the opinion here advanced ; but it is , heeausc they have not reflected on the movements of this dangerous association of individuals . 1 intreat , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I do not satisfy all , I hope at leastj to shew to the greater number , that whilst internal improvements 7 are drawitig off our resources to the North , and tariffs are reducing us rapidly into colonial vassalage , here is an insidious atttaek me- ' ditated at the domestic tranquillity of the South , which is to be re*-garded in a more serious light , than if an hostile foreign army , is great force , were to invade our territory . The bold and the daring invader attacks openly . In the bravery and devoted patriotism of our citizens , we have , under the worst of circumstances , a hope of ultimate success and safety . But against the secret dagger of the midnight assassin , no precaution oan guard us . He enters our premises undiscovered . He advances , or he recedes in his softly stealing steps , as prudence would dictate , and he strikes the fatal blow , when it is too late for us to . avert it Thus it will be with the American Colonization Society . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1817 , that in its very formation , it might be regarded as NATIONAL . Its ostensible object is the colonization of the free persons of colour of the United States , on the continent of Africa . The scheme at the outset , was thought to be so visionary , that the wonder was expressed , that so many intelligent members of Congres , at Washington , could be persuaded to attend the first meeting . The idea , that a class of people , who in the Northern and Eastern States , were enjoying in common with the white inhabitants , so great a portion of civil liberty , should voluntarily exile themselves , and en counter all the diseases of an African climate , and the hostility of savage neighbours , was so preposterous , that many persons suspected , that there was more meant by this Society , than met either the eye or the ear .

Have they keen careful in their speeches at anniversary meetings , or in their annual reports , to avoid touching a subject , producing to us in the South , such exquisite sensitiveness , as the emancipation of our . slaves ?
