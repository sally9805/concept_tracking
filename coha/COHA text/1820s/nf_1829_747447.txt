txt No apology is necessary for giving anything to the public from the pen of Fenelon . Such were the elevation and liberality of his spirit , that it soared above party , to diffuse itself over all the interests of humanity . He was in spirit and in truth a Christian ; a lover of God and man . His pure and expansive thoughts could not in their nature be confined to any sect or country . It is true that he was not above all the prejudices and influences of education . Who is ? But his was one of those pure and beneficent spirits , which from their natures belong to the whole of mankind . It is not - contended that he has done as much as some others to enlarge the limits of human science . His political maxims were just and pure , and they were fearlessly promulgated at the expense of his highest temporal interests ; and it is scarcely worth consideration , whether he were as well acquainted with all the rules of political economy , as others , whose residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not as a politician , but as a Christian and a man , that we regard his character . Fenelon was born nd brought up a Roman Catholic . He was a dignitary in that arjitrary and exclusive church . It was not pofisible that his thoughts and feelings should not be affected by this circumstance . What we hav to wpndejr ftfxji rejoice at m , that his pure ad expaove affQptiona burst all eaLcluure bioda . His heart belonged tp no creed , no country , but embraced the earth , and aord lo heiiven . He . loved that was lovely on efth , and his aspkatioBs were t/9 aU ibat is elevated above it . This putting forth of the affections from and above himself , was the ennobling and distinctive trait in the character of Fenelon . He loved men , not because they were of the saiie re as himself , but because they were susceptible of virtue and happisss . He loved God not merely as his bene &^tor,; but as the great source of felicity to a ) ! sentient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest sense of the teripi . He did not submit to commands , because the lawgiver was powerful and could punish disobedience ; aor yet simply because he was ust and faia coiGwaads ocuitablej biit his spirit voluntarily went forth to cooperate in all the designs of goodness . His efforts were never retarded or interrupted . He threw /q/ off , if he eirer felt them , the bonds of indolence , and the mists of selfishness never impaired his vision . The pure and holy influences of such a spirit should surely be diffused as widely as possible , and this is the design of the present volume . The direct influence of such a mind ought not to be confined to those who have acquired a foreign language and can afford to purchase books extensively . It is not invidious to say , that there is no existing translation of Fenelon 's works which renders this volume unnecessary . To render the work as cheap and easily attainable as possible , it is oonfined to a few selections . The translation is a free one ; but sedulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the author , nor to introduce any but his ideas . As the productions of a Roman Catholic and one zealously attached to his church , his writings necessarily contain many things that could not be acceptable to Christians of all denominations . These have been uniformly omitted . The translator has no other ambition than to render the rich treasures of the mind and heart of Fenelon accessible to those of another age and country , nor any other wish than that the reader may imbibe something of the spirit of the author . /z/ PocHX menti vegg ' k ricche di lume ; quelle poche oscura orgoglio altera : Luminoso intelletto , e umil pensiero Di star concordi iusiem non han costume .

His family has derived more lustre from the single name of the Archbishop of Cambrai , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished stations in the cabinet , in the field , and in the church . Fenelon was brought up under the paternal roof until his twelfth year , for his constitution was very weak and delicate . This circumstance , added to his amiable disposition , made him an object of peculiar tenderness to his father . There was nothing remarkable attending his early education ; it was entrusted to a preceptor , who appears to have possessed the principles of sound literature , axid who knew how to render it acceptable to his pupil . He gave him in a few years a more extensive knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages , than is usually obtained ' at so early an age . When he was twelve years old , he was sent to the University of Cahors , not far removed from /z/ the residence of his family . He there completed his philosophical and his philolocal studies , and he even took the . degrees which were afterwards of sufficient efficacy when he was elevated to ecclesiastical dignities . The Marquis Antoine de Fenelon , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew , sent for him to Paris and placed him at the college of Plessis , there to continue his philosophical studies , where he also commenced those of theology . It was here h$ formed a friendship with the young Abb de Noailles , afterwards cardinal and archbishop of Paris . The young Abb6 de Fenelon distinguished himself so much at the college of Plessis , that they suffered him to preach at the age of fifteen ; his sermon had an extraordinary success . A similar circumstance is related of Bossuet , who at the same age preached before the most brilliant assembly in Paris with the same applause . It is curious to remark this coincidence of opinion , so prematurely formed of two men , who were both destined to be the instructers of princes , and to become the ornament and glory of the French church . The Marquis de Fenelon was rather alarmed than gratified by the encomiums bestowed upon his nephew . Some idea of the frankness and austerity of his character , may be formed from what he said to M. de Harlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is . Sir , ' said he , " a great difference between the day when such a nomination procures you the compliments of all France , and the day of your death , when you wiU appear before God , to render him an account of your office . " He had lost his only son at the siege of Candia , and had found in religion the only support that could uphold his courage under so severe an affliction . Such was the man who acted as the father and guide of Fenelon , in the path of virtue and honor . Providence MEttOIK OF FBNXLON* 5 treasured up for the Marquis de Fenelon the most lenient of all consolations in replacing the son he had lost , by a nephew , who became the object of his tenderest care and affection* This nephew the Marquis hastened to secure from the snares of a deceitful world , by placing him at the seminary of St SuJpice , under the direction of M. Tronson , there to acquire a just knowledge of himself It was from the erudition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent man , that the youthful Fenelon derived his relish for virtue and religion , which made him so perfect a model of excellence , in all those various employments with which he was entrusted , and of those elevated functions which he discharged . It was about this time that Fenelon is supposed to have contemplated devoting himself to the mission of Canada , as the congregation of St Sulpice had a considerable establishment at Montreal ; but his uncle was justly alarmed at the project , which was incompatible with . the delicate constitution of his nephew , and he refused his permission . He accordingly , after having been ordained at St Sulpice , devoted himself to the functions of his holy office , in the same parish . It was during the exercise of this ministry , that Fenelon , by mixing with all ranks and conditions , by associating with the unfortunate and the sorrowful , by assisting the weak , and by that union of mildness , of energy , and of benevolence , which adapts itself to every character , and to every situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which afflict human nature . It was by this habitual and immediate communication with all classes of society , that he obtained the melancholy conviction of the miseries which distress the greater part of mankind ; and to the profound impression of this truth through his whole life , we must ascribe that tender commiseration for the unfortunate , which he manifests in all his writings , /z/ suceeded in obtaining the xcmsent of his uncle to his going as a missionary to the Levant , who could not allege the same objection as against his going to Canada . There is no doubt , however , that the fear of inflicting pain upon hiauncle , and subsequent reflection , made him suspend the execution of his project , and soon after , his friends succeeded in giving his zeal another direction ; he was nominated by the archbishop of Paris , Superior to the society of JouveUea Caiholiquea , It had been instituted in 163 ; its object was to strengthen the faith of newly converted females , and to instruct persons of the same sex , who showed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fenekn entered upon this path with pleasure , as it had some similarity with his earliest wish of becoming a missionary . It was at this time that he formed an intimacy with Bossuet , for whom he seems to have had a filial veneration . To enable him to live in Paris , the Bishop of Sarlat , his uncle , resigned to hkn the priory of Carenac . This benefice , which was worth about three or four thousand livres a year , was the only one which Fenelon had until his forty-third year . For ten years he devoted himself to the simple direction of a community of women . There may not be wanting those who would say that such an employment at his time of life , must have circumscribed his mind , by fixing it upon uninteresting details and useless studies It was , however , at this period that he wrote his first works , the Treatise on the Education of Girls , " and the Treatise on the Mission of the Clergy . " The first of these was not composed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauvilliers . Thus , a work which was originally intended for the use of a single family , has become an elementary book , equaUy adapted to every family , and to all timet and all places . /q/ Fenelon was called at this time to monm the death of his uncle , who had directed his first steps in the path of life , and who had been still more useful to him hy turning his heart towards the sublime idea of christian perfection . It was under his eyes , it was in his house , and in the intimacy of that tender confidence which a father delights to show towards a favorite child , that Fenelon imbibed his unshaken conviction of the duties and of the greatness of his ministry . The next event in the life of Fenelon , was the choice of him by Louis the Fourteenth , as a missionary to convert the Protestants of the provinces of Poitou and Saintonge . Fenelon , in an interview with the king before he set out upon his mission , refused a military escort ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he answered , ' Sire , ought a missionary to fear danger ? If you hope for an apostolical harvest , we must go in the true character of Apostles . I would rather perish by the hands of my mistaken brethren , than see one of them exposed to the inevitable violence of the military . " In a letter to a Duke , he said , The work of God is not effected in the heart by force ; that is not the true spirit of the Gospel . " An officer in the army consulted him to know what course he should adopt with such of his soldiers as were Hugonots . Fenelon answered , ' ' Tormenting and teasing heretic soldiers into conversion , will answer no end ; it will not succeed , it will only produce hypocrites . The converts so made will desert in crowds . " And long afterwards , when he was archbishop of Cambrai , hearing that some peasants in Hainaut who were descended from Protestants , and who held still the same opinions , had receiv , ed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when they were discovered , they disguised their sentiments and even went to mass ; he said to the reform- /z/ ed miniBter , " Brother , yoa see what has happened . It is full time that these good people should have some fixed religion ; go , and obtain their names and those of all their families ; I give jou my word , that in less than six months they shall all have passports . " This same clergyman , whose name was Brunice , he received at his table as a brother , and treated him with great kindness . This was the spirit that animated Fenelon in his mission to the Protestants . Those who were not converted by him , were charmed with his character while they refused to yield to his pathetic exhortations , they never refused him their esteem and their admiration , and we may even say their love and confidence . The reputation which Fenelon acquired by his exertions in Poitou , made him ' an object of public attention , and it was not long after that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent to the kingdom . This he owed to the friendship and esteem of the Duke de Beauvilliers , who had been appointed by the king to be the governor to the young prince , and who immediately named Fenelon for his preceptor . The choice of the new governor and preceptor was no sooner made public , than all France resounded with applause . The character of the Duke of Burgundy is described as violent and difficult to manage ; he is said to have given indications in his earliest years , of everything that was to be feared in temper and disposition . " The Duke of Burgundy , " says St Simon , " was unfeeling and irritable to the last degree , even against inanimate objects . Passionately addicted to every kind of pleasure , he was often ferocious , naturally cruel , and inordinately proud ; he looked upon men only as atoms , with whom he had no sort of similarity whatever . Even his brothers scarcely seemed , in his estimation , to form an intermediate link between him and the rest of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his penetration , were at all times eyident , and even in his moments of greatest violence , he showed proofs of genius . The extent and vigor of his mind were pro* digioas , and prevented him from steady and direct application . Such was the prince confided to Fenelon . There was everything to he feared , and everything to be hoped from a soul possessing such energy . From the combined efforts of those engaged in his instruction , but principally , as it seems , from the influence of the religious principle , as emloyed by Fenelon , the unruly and violent prince became afiable , mild , humane , moderate , patient , modest , humble , and severe only toward himself ; wholly occupied with his future obligations in life , which he felt to be great , and tiiinking only of unig the duties of the son and the subject , with those which he saw himself destined afterwards to fulfil . But what incessant vigilance , what art , what industry , what skill , what variety in the means adopt* ed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extraordinary alteration in the character of a child , a prince , and the heir to a throne . Fenelon composed his ** Fables , " the * Dialogues of the Dead , " and " Telemachus , " for the use of the Prince ; but as we have before mentioned , it was by keeping alive the feeling of accountability to the King of kings , that he acquired such an influence over the mind of the highspirited Duke , and succeeded in subduing his passions . He was ever presenting to him that awful day when he was to appear before the Judge of all . He strove by every means to awaken and cherish in the soul of his pupil , sentiments that were truly religious , and to make him feel the solemn truth , that he was ever speaking and acting in the presence of God . This was the secret of the almost miraculous effect produced upon the character of the pupil of Fenelon. // During five years , Fenelon received no mark of favor from Louis the Fourteenth , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a scanty means of support to him . He is described as being obliged to practise the most rigid economy . At last , at the age of forty-three , he was nominated to the Abbey of St Valery . The king informed him of this in person , and apologized for so tardy an acknowledgment of his gratitude . His success in the education of the Prince , ha excellent character , his conciliating manners , had procured him the love and esteem of aU who knew him ; and a year after this time , he was elevated to the dignity of Archbishop of Cambrai . Fenelon showed his disinterestedness , by immediately resigning the Abbey of St Valery . Louis at first refused to receive his resignation , but Fenelon insisted , saying the resources of the archbishopric of Cambrai were such as made a plurality of livings against the canons of the church . A short time previous to his nomination to the archbishopric of Cambrai , his acquaintance commenced with Madame Guyon , which was the cause of his unhappy controversy with his friend Bossuet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be loved for his own perfections , without any view to the future rewards or punishments , which was the doctrine of Fenelon , appears to have been the radical point of controversy . They who supposed that they had attained this habitual state of divine love , were called Quietists , from the perfect freedom from hope or fear that it produced . They thought that God was to be worshipped in the entire silence and stillness of the soul ; in a perfect renunciation of self to him . Fenelon , who was one of four ecclesiastics appointed to examine this doctrine of Madame Guyon , could find nothing in it to condemn , and he even defended her as far as he could against her persecutors , who thus were made en- qwq liked a man whose whole life and character were a tacit reproach upon his own , he readily believed all that was said agajinst him . He was forbidden to ramain in Paris , and spon after , the king , with his own hand , struck out his name as preceptor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried on with great warmth hy Bossuet , and supported on the part of Fenelon with great ability , but with unfailing meekness , was finally submitted to the Pope and his Cardinals . The Pontiff disapproved of some propositions which were advanced by Fenelon , and the Archbishop acquiesced . The Pope is related to have made a remark respecting the controversy , which could not have been very pleasing to the opponents of Fenelon. ** Fenelon , " he said , " was in fault for too great love of God ; and his enemies were in. fault for too little love of their neighbour . " As a specisqen of Fenelon 's style and manner of vindicating himself against the writings of Bossuet , we give the following passage . ' * Hqw painful is it to me , to carry on against you this combat of words ; and that , to defend myjelf against your terrible charges , it should be necessary for me to point out your misrepresentations of my doctrine . I am the writer so dear to you , whom you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as another Molinos , into the gulf of Quietism . Everywhere you weep over my misfortunes , and while you weep , you tear me in pieces ! What can be thought of tears , to which you have recourse only /z/ for the purpose of crimination ! Yoa weep on my account , and you suppress what is essential in my writings . You join together sentences in them which are wide asunder . Your own exaggerated consequences , formally contradicted in my text , you hold out as my principles . What is most pure in my doctrine , becomes blasphemy in your representation of it Believe me , we have been too long a spectacle to the world , an object of derision to the ungodly , of compassion to the good . ' * That otheic nen should be men , is not surprising ; but that the ministers of Jesus Christ , the angels of the church , should exhibit such scenes to the profane , to the unbeliever , calls for tears of blood . How much more fortunate would have been our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interminable disputes , we had been employed in our dioceses in teaching the catechism , in instructing the villager to fear God , and bless his holy name . " The enemies of Fenelon finally succeeded in obtaining the condemnation of his book , * Les Maximes . " It was with great reluctance that the Pope yielded at last to his enemies ; and in the manner in which he issued the decree , he discovers the greatest tenderness and respect for Fenelon . This truly great man was informed that his book was condemned by the Pope , just at the very moment when he was about to ascend the pulpit to preach . Deeply as he must have been affected by a decision so unexpected , yet his religion held such perfect empire over his mind , that he meditated a few moments only , and then , changing the entire plan of his sermon , he delivered one upon perfect snbmission to the authority of superiors . The news of the condemnation of Fenelon had spread rapidly through the whole congregation ; and this admirable presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew tears of tenderness , of grief , of love , and of admiration from every ye . He immediately prepared his public declaration of /q/ submisaion to the decree of the Pope . It was simple , entire , and without any reserve . We extract from it the following passages . We shall find consolation , my dearest brethren , in what humbles us , provided that the ministry of the word , which we have received for your sanctification , be not enfeebled , and that , notwithstanding the humiliation of the Pastor , the flock shall increase in grace before God . " - " Heaven forbid that we should ever be spoken of , except to remember that a Pastor thought it his duty to be more docile than the meanest sheep of his flock ; and that his submission was unlimited . " The submission of Fenelon was neither a respectful silence , nor a measure of policy , or any compromise with truth , but , as he himself said to a friend , " An inward act of obedience rendered to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded , " says Fenelon , the decision of my superiors as an echo of the Supreme Will ; I forgot all the passions , prejudices , and disputes which had preceded my condemnation ; I heard God speak to me as he did to Job 5 I accepted my condemnation in its most extensive sense . " He very justly discriminated between the meaning he intended to convey in his book , and the actual sense of the text , of which he considered the Pope the infallible judge . While he still solemnly asserted that it had never been his intention to advocate those errors for which his book was condemned , the Pope 's condemnation was sufficient to convince him that these errors were there expressed . And in his answer to an unknown friend who wished to write in defence of his book , he would not consent to have even his own personal intention vindicated from the errors imputed to him , lest it should appear as an indirect vindication of his book , and a want of sincerity in his submission to the Pope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " speak to me only of God , and leave men to judge of me as they like . As to myself , I shall seek only peace and silence . " 16 HEHOm OT Fenelon seems hot to hiive regarded his btiiiflfiiiient to Ills diocese as any calamity , exceit from a fear that it might lessen his usefulness ; he loved the country and rurdi pleasures . He was particularly fond ofValking . He writes to a friend , ' ' I amuse myself , I walk , and I find mysefif peaceful , in silence before God . Oh ! Missful commnnionl in his presence we are never alone ; as to men , we are alone when we do not wish to be wilh them . ' * In the course of his walks , he would often join the peatf ants , sit down with them on the grass , talk with them , and console them . He visited them in their cottages , seate himself at table with them , and partook of their bumble meals . By such kindness and familiarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . As they love him as a father and fViend , they delighted to listen to hk instructions , and to submit to his guidance . Long after his death , the old people who had the happiness of him on these occasions , spoke of him with liie most tender reverence . " There , ** they woudd say , " is the chair in which our good Archbishop used to sit in the midst of us ; We shail see him no more , " and then their tears would flow . The diocese of Cambrai was often the theatre of war , and experienced the cruel ravages of retreating and conquering armies . But an extraordinary respect was paid to Fenelon by the invaders of France . The English , the Germans , and the Dutch , rivalled the inhabitants of Cambrai in their veneration for the Archbishop . All distinctions of religion and sect , all feelings of hatred and jealousy that divided the nations , seemed to disappear in the presence of Fenelon . Military escorts were offered him , for his personal security ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by war , to visit his flock , trusting in the tion of God . In these visits , his way was marked by alms and benefactions . While he was among them , the people seemed to enjoy peace io the midst of wiur . MEMOIR OF FMXmtAOf. 17 He brought together into his pelace , the wretched iidnbitants of the country , whom the war had driven from homes , and took care of them , and fed them at his own table . Seeing , one day , that one of tiiese peasants eat nothing , be asked him the reason of his abstinence . Alas ! my Lord , " said the poor man , ' in making my escape from my cottage , I had not time to bring off my cow , which was the support of my family .

" He adds , ' ' Alas ! for the man who reads it without being affected . " Another anecdote , showing his tenderness to the poor , is thus related of him . A literary man , whose library was destroyed by fire , has been deservedly admired for saying , " I should have profited but littie by my books , if they had not taught me how to bear the loss of them . " The remark of Fondon , who lost his in a similar way , is still more simple and touching . " I would mucb rather they were burnt , than the cottage of a poor peasant " The virtues of Fenelon give his history the air of romance ; but his name will never die . Transports of joy were heard at Cambrai when his ashes were discovered , which it was thought , had been scattered by the : tempest of the Revolution ; and to this moment the Flemings call him " the good Archbishop . " The kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endeared him to the whole nation . His charity embraced the rich and the poor , his friends and his enemies , ( ' it is impossible , " says biographer , " to conceive how much he was the idol of the military , and how Versailles , in sjute of her stem master , resounded with his name . His charity and polite attentions extended equally to the prisoners /z/ 18 IttXOiA OF VEHELOK* of war , M io bis owil eaimtaymtm Virtoe henelf bectaie mor bestttiflil ISfota Fenekm'B mumer of being &#9660; iftnoos. * ' One of the dtireteii tf his diocese oemplained to bioi that be was unable to put a stop to dances on the feast dajra* ' Mr Curate , " said Fenelon to him , let abstain froos amusement ourselves , but let us permit these poor people to dance . Why prevent them from hngetaag fw a momeiift their poverty and wretchedness ? " The simplicity of Fenelon 's character obtained for him a triumph on one occasion , which most have been most graii fying to his feelings , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm and power of virtue , fiis enesBMS ( for to the reproach of human sAtute , Fenelon had his enemies ) were mean enough to practise the shameful artifice of placing about him an ecclesiastic of high birth , whom he considered only as his grand vicar , but who was io act as spy upon him . This man , who had consented to uodertak* so base an office , had , however the magnanimity to punish himself for it Subdued by the purity and gentleness of spirit that he witnessed in Fenelcai , he threw himself at his feet , confessed the unworthy past he had been led 4o act , and withdrew from the world , to conceal , in retirement his grief and bis shame . Fenelon , so indulgent to others , required no induigienoe to be exercised to himself . Not only was he willing tn have his failings treated with severity , he was even grateful for it . qwq and refused to receive any pay for it , saying , The owes me nothing , and in times of calamity it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give back to the state what I have received from it** It was thus that he avenged himself for his disgrace . His mind , dead to vanity , was in conversation entirely given up to the person with whom he conversed . Men of every profession , proficients in every branch of knowledge , were at ease in his company . He directed every one first to the subject he best understood , and then he disappeared at once , thus giving them an opportunity to produce , out of their own stock , the materials they were most able to furnish . Thus every one parted from him well pleased with himself . The different writings in philosophy , theology , and belles lettres , that came from the pen f Fenelon , have made his name immortal . The most powerful charm of his writings , is that feeling of quiet and tranquillity which they excite in the reader . It is a friend , vfbo approaches you and pours his soul into yours . You feel that you are holding an intimate communion with a pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least for awhile , your worldly cares and your sorrows ; you enter for a time into that spirit of self-sacrifice and self-oblivion which seems to be the key-note of all his writings . Your whole heart seems to expand with the christian love that inspired him . We are ready to forgive human nature so many men who make us hate it , on account of Fenelon who makes us love it In the authors whom he quotes in his Dialogue upon Eloquence and Letter to the French Academy , and cites as models , those touches of feeling which go to the soul , are those upon which he loves , to repose . He there seems , if we may so speak , to breathe sweetly his native air , and te find himself in the midst of what is most dear to him . His sermons were always the outpourings of his heart ; it was not his object to be brilliant ; he retired to his oratory , and . tlere , it theresenee cf Gad , he cified up to M* iiikid those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the friend of God , he went to the holy moantainj nod returned to the people to communieate to tiiem what he had learned in that inefiable communion . He would begin by instnicting his flock upon the reasone of our faith , and Of ear hope , and then hasten to ineukate that charity which prodaces and perfects all the rtuea . When &e; question was discussed beibre the Queen of Poland , which of the two champions , Bossuet er Fenelon , had rendered the greatest services to religion , " The one , " said that Princess , has proved its truth , the ether has made it to be loved. * ' Although the spirit of k ) ve is manifest in all his writings , it is most deeply impressed on those that were composed for his pupil . He seems , in wtking themi to have ever repeated to himself , " What I am going to say to this child , will be the occasion of hajiness or misery to twenty millions of people . He said , tliat , not having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of actually travelling himself , he bad made him travel over the world with Mentor and Telemachus ; ' If be ever travel , ** added he , " I should wish that it might be without an equipage . The less retinue he had , the easier would truth be able to approach him . He wotdd be able to see good and evil , so as to adopt the one , and avoid the other , much better abroad than at home ; and delivered for awhile from the cares and anicieties of being a prince , he would taste the pleasure of being a man. ** Let us not forget the most interesting fact relative to the education of this Prince , and which bound him by tiie strongest tie of afTection to his instructor . When Fenelon had committed any fault , even the slightest , in the execution of this trust , he never failed to accuse hunseif of it to his pupil . What an authority , founded in love and confidence , /z/ most he have acquired over him by this iiigetiiious frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; - openness and ingenuousness even at the expense of his self-love , indulgence towards the faults of others , readiness to confess his own , the courage even to accuse hinn self , the noble ambition of knowing , and the still more noble ambition of conquering himself . If you wish , " said a phi losopher , to have your son listen to stem , unbending truths begin by speaking it to him when it is against yourself. * ' The enemies of Fenelon have insinuated most falsely , that he took side in the controversy against Jansenism , only because the Cardinal de Noailles had declared himself against Quietism . But his noble and ingenuous soul was incapable of such a motive . The sweetness of his disposition , and the idea which he had formed to himself of the goodness of God , made him averse to the doctrine of Quesnel , which he considered as leading to despair . He consulted his own heart for arguments against it . " God , ** said he , " is to them only a terrible being ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not consent to make him a ty-. rant who binds us with fetters and then commands us to walk , and punishes us if we do not " But in proscribing principles , which seemed to him too harsh , and the consequences of which were disavowed by those who held them , he would not permit them to be persecuted . " Let us be to them , " said he , what they are unwilling tliat God should be toman , full of compassion and indulgence . " He was told that the Jansenists were his declared enemies , and that they left nothing undone to bring him and his doctrine into discredit " That is one farther reason , " said he , " for me to suffer and forgive them . " Thus passed Fenelon 's life till the melancholy death of the Duke of Burgundy , in 1712 . His death was a sad blight upon the fairest hopes of the nation . Penelon 's highest wishes seemed to be realized in him ; the eyes and hopes of OF f 23 /z/ were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceptor had continued , and when he was allowed , he did not fail to express it When Fenelon heard the afflicting intelligence of his death , he exclaimed * All my ties are broken ; nothing now remains to bind me to the earth. * ' Shortly after , the Duke de Chevreuse , his intimate friend , died , and this was also a great sorrow to him . He writes thus to a friend , when he was deeply oppressed by these x ; aamities . " Real friends are our greatest joy and our ' greatest sorrow . It were almost to be wished that all true and faithful friends should expire on the same day . " All his letters written during this period , show how deeply he suffered . Fenelon had one more severe trial to endure . The Duke G fieauvillirs , to whom he was tenderly attached , and who , being governor to the Duke of Burgundy , was not permitted to see him after his banishment , died in 1714 . Fenelon survived him but four months . The death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally subdued the tender heart of Fenelon . His frame was feeble ; a severe shock that he received from the upsetting of his carriage , induced a fever , and he died on the first of January , 1715 . In the last letter he wrote with his own hand , which was to the Duchess of Beauvilliers , he says to her , * ' We shall soon find again that which we have not lost ; we daily approach it with rapid ; yet a little while and there will be no more cause for tears . " He was taken sick and died three days after , aged sixtyfive . In his last sickness , he displayed the most admirable fortitude and submission . There was the same sweetness of temper , composure of mind , love for his fellow creatures , tmd confidence in God , which became the Christian and the friend of God and man , and which had distinguished his whole life . The death of Fenelon was deeply lamented by all the inhabitants of the Low Countries . So extensive had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly alftuffs , that he died without money and without a debt The fallowing portrait of this celebrated prelate , . if given by the Duke de St Simon in his Memoirs . He was a tall , lean , well made man , with a large nose , ; eyes full of fire and ix telligenoe ; a phyisiogncMBy resembling- none which I have elsewhere seen , and which could- not be forgotten after it had been once beheld . There was such a sublime simplicity in his . appeacance , that it required an effort to cease to look at him* His manners corresponded to bis face and person . They were masked . with that ease which makes others easy ; there was . an inexpressible air of good taste and refinement in them . He possessed a natural eloquence , a ready , clear , and agreeable elocution , and a power of making himself understood upon the most perplexed and abstract subjects . With all this , he never wished to appear wiser or wittier than those with whom he conversed , but descended to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivating , that it was scarcely possible to leave him . " When we speak of the death of Fenelon , we realize the truth of what we all acknowledge , though fisw feel , that the good man never dies ; that , to use the words of one . of our eloquent divines , " death was but a circumstance in his being. * ' We may say , as we read his writings , that we are conscious of his immortality ; he is with us ; his spirit is around us ; it enters into and takes possession of our souls . He is at this tune , as be was wiien living in his diocese , the familiar friend of the poor and the sorrowful , the bold ' reprover of vice , and the gentle guide of the wanderer ; he still says to all , in the words of his Divine Master , ' * Come to me , all ye that are heavy laden , and I will give you resf In the houses of the unlearned , where the names of Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with Fenelon 's , where not a word of his /z/ Bative tongue would be understood , his tpint hM entered as a minister of love and wisdom , and a well-worn translation of his Reflections , with a short Memoir of his life , is laid upon the precious word of God . What has thus immortalized Fenelon ? For what is he thus cherished in our hearts ? Is it his learning ? his celebrity ? his eloquence ? No . It is the spirit of christian love , the spirit of the Saviour of mankind that is poured forth from all his writings ; of that love that conquers self , that binds us to our neighbour , that raises us to God . This is Fenelon 's power , it is this that touches our souls . We feel that he has entered into the full meaning of that sublime in St John , and made it the motto of his life ; Beloved , let us love one another ; for love is of God ; and every oneat loveth , is born of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knoweth not God ; for God is love. ** /z/ I CAN NOT open my eyes without admiring the skill that everything in nature displays . A single glance enables me to perceive the hand that has made all things . Men accustomed to meditate upon abstract truths , and recur to first principles , recognise the Divinity by the idea of him they find in their minds . But the more direct this road is , the more is it untlrodden and neglected by common men , who follow their own imagination . It is s* pimple a demonstration , that from this very cause , it escapes those minds that are incapable of a purely intellectual operation . And the more perfect this way of discovering the Supreme Being is , the fewer are the minds that can follow it . But there is another method less perfect , and which is adapted to the capacity of all . Those who exercise their reason the least , those who are the most affected by their senses , may at a single glance discover him who is represented in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has manifested in everything that he has made , reflects the name , as m a mirror , of him , whom they have not which every one without prejudice or passion is capable of acquiring . A man whose whole heart is engaged in some grand concern , might pass many days in a room attending to his affairs , without seeing either the proportions of the room , the ornaments on the chimney , or the pictures that surrounded him . AH these objects would be before his eyes , but he ould not see them , and they would make no impression upon him . Thus it is that men live . Everything presents God to them , but they do not see him . He was in the world , and the world was made by him ; and nevertheless the world has not known him . They pass their lives without perceiving this representation of the Deity ; so completely do the fascinations of life obscure their vision . Saint Augustin says that the wonders of the universe are lowered int ) lir estimation by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to witness the same things every day , the mind as well as the eye is accustomed to them . It does not admire , or take any pains to discover , the cause of events that it always observes to take place in just the same way ; as if it were the novelty rather than the grandeur of a thing that should lead us to this investigation . " But all nature shows the infinite skill of its author , I maintain that accident , that is to say , a blind and /q/ fortuitous succession of events , could never have produced all that we see . It is well to adduce here one of the celebrated comparisons of the ancients . Who would believe that the Iliad of Homer was not composed by the effort of a great poet ; but that the characters of the alphabet being thrown confusedly together , an accidental stroke had placed all the letters , precisely in such relative situations , as to produce verses so full of harmony and variety ; painting each object with all that was most noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fine , making each person speak in character , and with such spirit and nature ? Let any one reason with as much subtilty as he may , he would persuade no man in his senses that the Iliad had no author but accident . Why then should a man , possessing his reason , believe with regard to the universe , a work unquestionably more wonderful than the Iliad , what his good sense will not allow him to believe of this poem ? But let us take another comparison , which is from Gregory Nazianzen . If we heard in a room behind a curtain , a sweet and harmonious instrument , could we believe that accident produced it ? Who would doubt seriously whether some skilful hand did not touch it ? Were any one to find in a desert island , a beautiful statue of marble , he would say . Surely men have been here . I recognise the hand of the sculptor ; I admire the delicacy with which he has proportioned the body , making it instinct with beauty , grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man reply , if any one were to say to him , No , a sculptor did not make this /z/ 30 Olf THK KXIflmNCB OV GOD . flUttte . It 18 made , it is true , in the most ezqukite taste , iiid adooriing to the most perifoct rules of tjmmetry ; bat k is accident that has produced it . Among all the pieces of liiarble , one has happened to take this form of itself . The rains and the wind detached it from the mountain ; a violent stonh placed it upright upon this pedestal , that was alreadj prepared and placed here of itself . It is an Apollo its pesfect as that of Belvedere ; it is a Venus equal to that of the Medicis ; it is a Herqules which resembles that of Famese . You may believe , it is true , that this figure wa &s,; that it Uves , that it thinks , that it is going to speak . But it owes nothing to art , it ' is only a blind stroke of chance that has formed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say to a man who should pride himself upon superior knowledge and philosophy , and who , entering a house , should maintain that it was made by chance , and that art and industry had done aotking to render it a commodious habitation for men ; and who should give as a reason , that there were caverns that resembled it , which the art of man had /z/ not made ? We should show to him who reasoned in this way , all the different parts of the house and their uses . It must be , we should say to this philosopher , that this work has been conducted by some able architect ; for all parts of it are agreeable , pleasing to the eye , well proportioned , convenient ; he must also have employed excellent workmen* Not at all , this philosopher , would say ; you are ingenious in self-deception . It is true that the house is pleasant , well proportioned , qwq aiair-eases . Do net believe that the hand of inan had anything to do with it . Men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that it tt made lor them , be:ause they find in it things that they can turn to their accommodation ; but all that they attribute to the design of an architect , is only tiie efiect of their inventions afterwards . This house , so regular and so well arranged , was made just as caverns are made ; and finding it convenient , they have occupied it just as they would a cave that they should happen to find under a rock , during a storm , in the midst of a desert . What would yoiSi think of this whimsical philosopher , if he were to persist in it seriously , that this house did not discover any art ? When we read the fable of Amphion , who by a miraculous harmony raised the stones one upon another , in order and symmetry , to form the walls of Thebes , we smile at the fiction of the poet ; but this fiction is not so incredible as that which this philosopher maintains . But why do we smile less at hearing that the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabuloua house is ? We do not compare the world to the cavern which we suppose made by accident , but we may to a house in which is displayed the most perfect architecture . The smallest animal has a construction that is more admirable than that of the most perfect Louse . % as EUflTBNCE OT GOB . A traveller entering Salde , which is the place that was once ancient Thebes , with its hundred gates , and which is now a desert , would find there colunms , pyramids , obelisks , and inscriptions in unknown characters . Would he say . Men have never inhabited this place ; the hand of man has never been employed here ; it is chance that has formed these columns , and placed them upon their pedestals , and crowned them with capitals in such beautiful proportions ; it is chance that has hewn these obelisks out of single stones , and that has engraved upon them all these hieroglyphics ? Would he not , on the contrary , say with all the certainty of which the mind of man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture that flourished in ancient Egypt ? This is what our reason would pronounce at the first glance . It is the same thing when we first contemplate the universe . People perplex themselves with sophistry , and obscure their view of the simplest truths . But a glance is sufficient ; such a work as this world , could not have been made by chance . The bones , the tendons , the veins , the arteries , the nerves , the muscles , which compose the body of a single man , display more art and proportion than all the architecture of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians . The eye of the meanest animal surpasses the skill of all the artisans in the world . But let us , before we proceed to the details of nature , fix our attention for a. while upon the general structure of the universe . Cast your eyes upon the earth that supports us ; raise them then to this im* mense vault of the heavens that surrounds lis these OH KXlStrsirCE O GOD . di fitthoRiless abysses of air and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is it that has suspended this globe of earth ? who has laid its foun-* dations ? If it were harder , its bosom could not be laid open by man for cultivation ; if it were less firm , it could not support the weight of his footsteps . From it proceed the most precious things ; this earth , so mean and unformed , is transformed into thousands of beautiful objects , that delight our eyes ; in the course of one year , it becomes branches , buds , leaves , fiowers , fruits , and seeds ; thus renewing its bountiful favors to man . Nothing exhausts it . Afler yielding for so many ages its treasures , it experiences no decay , it does not grow old , it still pours forth riches from its bosom . Generations of men have grown old and passed away , while every spring the earth has renewed its youth . If it were cultivated , it would nourish a hundred fold more than it now does . The inequalities of the earth add to its beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended , in the places where the Lord has appointed . " In the deep valleys grows the fresh herbage for cattle . Rich harvests wave in the champaign country . Here , ranges of little hills rise like an amphitheatre , and are crowned with vineyards and fhiit trees ; there , high mountains lifl their snow-crowned heads among the clouds . The torrents that pour from their sides , are the sources of the rivers . The rocks , marking their steep heights , support the earth of the mountains , just as the bones of the human body port the flesh . This variety makes the charm of rural scenery , while it is also the meins ef BfilisQring fdl tbe different of men , // Everything that the earth produces , is decomposed and returns again to its bosom , and becomes the germ of a new production . Everything that springs from it returns to it , and nothing is lost . All the seeds that we sow in it , return multipUed to us . It produces stone and marble , of which we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or useful to man . Look at the plants that spring from it . Their species and their virtues are innumerable . Contemplate these vast forests , as ancient as the world ; those trees whose roots strike into the earth , as their branches spread out towards the heavens . Their roots support them against the winds , and are like subterranean pipes , whose office is to collect the nourishment necessary for the support of the stem ; the stem is covered jvith a thick bark , which protects the tender wood from the air ; the branches distribute , in different canals , the sap which the roots have collected in the In summer , they protect us with their shade from the rays of the sun ; in winter , they feed the flame that keeps us warm . Their wood is not only useful for fuel , but it is of a substance , although solid and durable , to which the hand of man can give every form that he pleases , for the purposes of architecture and navigation . Fruit trees , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to receive their treasures . The feeblest plant contains within itself the germ of all that we admire in the grandest tree . The earth , that does not change itself , produces all these changes in its offspring . Let us notice what we call water ; it is a liquid , clear , and transparent body . Now it escapes from /q/ our grasp , and now it takes the form of whatever surrounds it , having none of its own . If the water were a little more rareiied , it would become a species of air ; the whole face of nature would be dry and sterile . He who has given us this fluid body , has distributed it with care through the earth . The waters flow from the mountains . They assemble in streams in the valleys , and they flow on in rivers , winding their way through the open country , that they may more effectually water it . At last they empty themselves into the sea , to feed this centre of the commerce of nations . This ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , the great rendezvous of all nations . It is over this pathless way , across this profound abyss , that the old world has put forth its hand to the new , and that the new supplies the old with its treasures . The waters circulate through the earth , as the blood does through the human body . Besides this perpetual circulation , there is the ebbing and flowing of the sea . We need not know the cause of this mysterious effect . This we are certain of only , that the sea goes and returns to the same places at certain hours . Who has commanded it to ebb and flow with such regularity ? A little more or a litle less motion in the waters would derange all nature . Who is it that controls this immense body , with such ' irresistible power ? Who is it that always avoids the too much and the too little . What unerring finger has marked the boundaries for the sea , that through countless ages it has respected , and has sud to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " /z/ If I look up to the heavens , I perceive clouds flying as upon the wings of the wind ; bodies of water suspended over our heads , to temper the air and water the thirsty earth . If they were to fall all at once , they would overwhelm and destroy everything in the place where they fell . What hand suspends them in their reservoirs , and bids them fall drop by drop as from a wateriog-pot We have considered the waters ; let us notice other bodies of still greater extent . The air is so subtile , so transparent , that the stars at an almost infinite distance pierce through it with their light . We live immersed in the abysses of air , as fishes do in the depths of the waters . As the waters , if they were rarefied , would become a species of air , that would destroy them ; so the air would destroy us , if it were more dense and humid . Who is it that has composed the air so exactly for our respiration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempests of this vast fluid body ? From what storehouse are the winds drawn that purify the air , that temper the seasons , and that change the face of the heavens in an instant ; wafling the clouds on the wings of the wind , from one edge of the horizon to the other ? Let us fix our attention upon the flame that lights up the stars , and spreads its light over the universe . The mountains vomit the fire that the earth has held in its bosom . This saine fire remains unseen in the veins of the flint , and waits for the blow that shall excite it and make it kindle mountains . Mankind have learned the way to obtain it , and subject it to their /q/ use , to make it bend the hardest metals , to feed and cherish it in cold climates , and make it take the place of the absent sun . Fire penetrates all seeds ; it is as the soul of everything that lives ; it consumes all that is impure , and renews what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a celestial treasure that mankind had stolen from the gods . But it is time to raise our eyes to the heavens . Who has stretched over our heads this vast and glorious vault ? What sublime objects are there ! An allpowerful hand has presented this grand spectacle to our vision . It is , says Cicero , in order that we may admire the heavens , that God has formed man differently from other animals . He is made upright , antf lifts his head that he may contemplate that which v above him . What does the regular succession of day and nigh teach us ? The sun has never omitted , for so many ages , to shed his blessing upon us . Aurora never fails to announce the day ; she appears at the appointed time , and in the fixed place , and the sun , says the Holy Book , knows its going down . Thus it enlightens alternately both sides of the world , and sheds its rays on all . Day is the time for society and employment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and softens our troubles . It suspends , it calms everything . It sheds round us silence and sleep ; it rests our bodies , it revives our spirits . Then day returns , and recalls man to labor , and reanimates all nature . /z/ Besides the constant course of the sun that produces day and night , during six months it approaches one pole , and during the other six , the opposite one . E/ this beautiful order , one sun answers for the whole world . If the sun at the same distance were larger , it would light the whole world , but it would consume it with its heat . If it were smaller , the earth would be all ice , and could not be inhabited by men . What compass has been stretched from heaven to earth , and taken such just measurements ? The changes of the sun make the variety of the seasons , which we find so delightful . The spring checks the cold winds , Wakens the flowers , and gives the promise of fruits . The summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits that spring has promised . Winter , which is the night of the year , treasures up all its riches , only in order that the following spring may bring them forth again with new beauty . Thus nature , so variously adorned , presents alternately her beautiful changes , that man may never cease to admire . Let us look up again at this immense concave above us , where sparkle the countless stars . If it be solid , who is the architect ? Who is it that has fastened in it at regular distances , such grand and luminous bodies ? Who makes this vaulted sky to turn around us so regularly If , on the contrary , the heavens are only immense spaces , filled with fluid bodies , like the air that surrounds us , how is it that many solid bodies float in it , without interfering one with another After so many ages that men have been making astronomical observations , they have discovered no derangement in the heavens . Can a /q/ fluid body give such a constant and regular order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is this almost countless multitude of stars for ? God has sown them in the heavens , as a magnificent prince would adorn his garments with precious stones . But some one may say , These are all worlds like the earth we inhabit . Suppose it be so , how wise and powerful must He be , who has made worlds as innumerable as the grains of sand on the seashore , and who has led on in order , for so many ages , all these moving worlds , as a shepherd leads his flocks . The motion of the stars , it is said , is regulated by immutable laws . I suppose the fact , but it is this very fact that will prove what I wish to establish . Who is it that has given laws to all nature so constant and so salutary ? laws so simple , that people are tempted to believe , that they established themselves ; so full of utility , that we can not help recognising in them a miraculous skill . Whence comes the power that conducts this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us without our thinking of it ? To whom shall we attribute this assemblage of so many means so wonderful and so well arranged ; so many bodies , great and small , visible and invisible ? If the least atom of this machine were to become deranged , it would disorganize the universe . What is this design , so unlimited , so admirably pursued , so beautiful , so beneficent ? The necessity of these laws , far from preventing me from seeking the author , only increases my curiosity and my admiration . The hand that guides this glorious work must be as skilftil as it is powerful , to have made it so simple , r /z/ yet so efTectual ; so constant and so beneficent . I am ready to exclaim , in the language of Scripture , Every star makes haste to go where God commxmds it , " and when he speaks , they answer with trembling , are here . " iurn our attention to the animals , still more worthy of our admiration than the heavens and the stars . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fins of fishes are like oars , with which they cleave the waves of air or water , and which conduct the floating body of the bird or fish , that is formed like a boat . But the wings of birds have feathers , that are covered with a soft down , that expands in the air , and would grow heavy in the water ; but the fins of the fishes are of dry and hard pointed bones , that cut the water without imbibing it , and do not become heavier from being wet . Some birds that swim , as the swan , lift up their wings and all their plumage , for fear of wetting it , and make use of it as sails . They have the art of turning it towards the wind , and tacking like a vessel when it is not favorable . Among animals , ferocious beasts , such as lions , have the largest muscles in the shoulders , thighs , and legs . These animals are also very supple , nervous , agile , and quick to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the body . They have teeth and tusks , which serve'them as terrible arms against their prey . Some animals , like the tortoise , carry about with them the house in which they were born ; others build theirs , like the bird , upon the high branches of trees , to preserve their little ones from being injured by animals without wings . They /q/ pl#ce their nests amidst the thickest folinge , to hide them from their enemies . The beaver builds for himself an asylum from the very bottom of the water , and raises dikes to secure it from inundation . The fox midges his burrow with two openings , that he may , if surprised , escape the snares of the hunter . Birds , says Cicero , that have very long legs , have also long necks , in proportion , so that they can reach the botvtom and take their fiod . The elephant , whose neck would be too heavy , if it were as long as the camePs , is provided with a long trunk , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and contract , that it can fold up and turn in any way it pleases , to seize anything , or to lifl or repulse any object . The Romans called it a hand . Certain animals seem made for man . The dog seems born ( or his caresses and his service . The horse seems bom to carry his burdens , to support him in his weakness , and to obey his will . The ox has the strength and patience that is wanted to drag the plough The cow refreshes him with her milk . The sheep has a superfluous clothing , which is continually renewed , as if to invite man to accept it . Even goats have a sort of long hair , which is useless to them , and of which men make stuffs to wear . The skins of animals , in cold countries , supply the inhabitants with the most beautiful furs . Thus the Author of nature has clothed the brute creation according to their necessities , - and their apparel serves for the use of man . If any animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever makes a part of this grand spectacle of nature , is not without its use in the eyes /z/ of those who think and attend to it . What is there more magnificent than those various republics of animals , all so well governed and different from each other ? Everything demonstrates to us , how &r; the skill of the workman surpasses the vile material that he employs . Everything astonishes me , even the structure of the smallest fly . We find in the most insignificant worm , as in an elephant or in a whale , perfectly organized members . We see in it a head and body ; limbs as in the greatest animals ; there are , in each part of these living atoms , muscles , nerves , veins , arteries , blood ; in this blood , component parts and humors ; in these humors , particles , containing in themselves different substances ; and we know not where to stop in the infinite process . The microscope discovers to us in every object , a thousand things that have escaped our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the microscope can not discover to us . What should we not see , if we could continually improve the instruments , which we use in aid of our feeble vision . But let our imagination be a sort of microscope , by which we may see , in every atom , thousands of new and invisible worlds ; it could only present to us new discoveries in the smallest bodies ; we should be wearied , and at last we should leave , in the smallest organ , a thousand unknown wonders . Let us dwell for a while upon the animal machine . Animals have what we call instinct , that enables them to pursue what is useful , and avoid what is hurtful . We need not seek to know what this instinct is ; let us be contented with the simple fact , without reasoning /q/ about it . The lamb knows its mother at a distance . The sheep is conscious of the approach of the wolf before she can see ' him . There is in all animals a contingent power , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that braces their nerves , and renders their joints supple , and that gives them , in sudden danger , an almost miraculous agility , strength , and adroitness in escaping from their enemy . It is instinct , it is said , that guides animals . I grant it . It is in truth an instinct ; but this instinct is a most admirable sagacity and dexterity , not in the animals , who have not the power at the time to reason , but in that superior wisdom that directs them . This instinct , or this wisdom , that thinks and watches over animals in unexpected circumstances , when they could not reason , or protect themselves even if they had our reason , can only be the wisdom of the workman who has made the machine . Let us then no longer speak of instinct or nature ; these are only empty sounds in the mouths of those who repeat them . There is , in what we call nature and instinct , an art , an admirable skill , of which human invention is only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immense number of movements entirely unpremeditated , that are performed according to the most perfect rules of mechanics . It is the machine obeying its laws . Thigf is the fact , independent of all philosophy , and the fact is enough . What should we think of a watch , that should be able to defend itself , or escape when any one desired to break it ? Should we not admire the skill of the workman ? Could we believe that this watch could be formed , proportioned , /z/ and arranged by chajakce- Should w ihwk diot diese operations were saiisfaetiHrilj explained , of saying , It is nature or instinct tiial makes this wat tell its master tke hours , and escape those who wiidi to hurt it ? What can be more perfect than a machine that ever renews and repairs itself ? As the ammil is limited in its strength , k is soon exhausted by labor ; but the more it is used , the mcure it is prompted to compensate its losses by an abundaat nourishment . Food restores the waste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , by a strange metamorphosis , becomes a part of it . First it is ground up and is changed into a liquid ; Uien it is purified , as if it were passed through a sieve in order to separate the parts of it that are too gross . Then it passes to the centre , where it goes through a process , by which it is refined and turned into blood , and at la it flows through innumerable channels , and waters all the members , and insinuates itself tiirough the whole fi-ame ; it is filtrated by the flesh as it passes , and finally it becomes flesh itself . So many diflerent solids and liquids become all the same substance . The food which was only an inanimate body , becomes a living animal . What was not long since a horse , is now only a vapor or air . What was only hay or oats , has become that noble , high-spirited animal . He passes for the same animal , notwithstanding this insensibie change in his substance . To nourishment is added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior operations that might agitate and dissipate the spirits ; nothing remains /q/ but digestion and respiration ; that is to say , everything is suspended that requires effort , and everything necessary for renovation is active and free . This repose , which seems a sort of enchantment , returns every night , while the darkness interrupts labor . Who has contrived this suspension ? Who is it that has so well chosen the operations of this machine that ought to proceed , and stopped so wisely those that should be at rest ? The next morning all its fatigues have passed away . The animal labors as if he had never labored before , and there is a vivacity and spirit in him that invite to new exertion , in consequence of the renovation . Let us stop no longer at the inferior animals . It is time to study the structure of the human frame ; of man , that we may discover Him in whose image he is made . I see in all nature but two kinds of beings ; those who have knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature these two forms of being . He has a body like the most inanimate beings ; he has a soul , that is , a power of thought , by which he knows himself and perceives all that is around hiip . If it be true , that there is a Being who has drawn everything from nothing , man is his true image ; for he unites in his nature , the perfection of those two forms of being . But the image is only an image ; it can only be a shadow of the truly perfect Being . Let us begin with the body of man ; it is moulded of clay , but let us admire the hand that has fashioned it . The stamp of the workman is imprinted on his work , it seems to have been his pleasure to make of such worthless materials a perfect work . Observe the /z/ t himes that support th flesh which surrounds them ; the nerves , that give it streagt ; the muscles , that , bj foekig expanded or lengthened , produce the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain distances , and are fitted one to another , and fastened by nerves and tendons . Cicero admired , with good reason , the beautiful contrivance that unites the bones . What can be more supple and adapted to different motions , but what is there more firm and durabk ? Thus this machine is erect or bent , stiff or flexible , as we wish it . From the brain , which is the source of all the nerves , flows the vital principle . It is too subtil to be discerned , but nevertheless real , and so active , that it produces all the motions and all the strength of the machine . It flies in an instant to the farthest extremity of the body . Now it moves gently and with uniformity ; now with a violent impetuosity ; it varies unceasingly with the different situations of the body . The flesh is covered in certain parts with a thin and delicate skin for the ornament %f the body . In some pfrts , this skin is harder and thicker than in others that it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much thicker the skin is on the sole of the foot , than the face ; on the back part , than on the front of the head . This skin is pierced everywhere like a sieve , with small holes ; these are called pores ; while the perspiration is insensibly exhaled through them , and the blood never escapes . The skin has all the delicacy necessary to make it transparent , and give to the countenance an animated and beautiful color . Wlio has tampered and mingled tbte oolpis , so a9 to /q/ produce this brilliant carnation that painters adiffire and vainly endeavour to imitate ? We find in the human body innumerable channeb . Some carry the blood from the centre to the extremities , and are called arteries ; others return it from the extremities to the centre , and are called veins . Through all these various canals , the blood flows ; it is a soft , unctuous liquid , calculated from this quality to preserve the most dcKcate substances , as we preserve essences in gums . This blood waters the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ' what it has passed through , it returns to its source slowly , and divested of the vital principle ; but it renews and refreshes itself again , and so circulates perpetually . Who can explain the delicacy of the organs by which we discover the taste of such a variety of bodies ? How is it that so many voices strike my ear at the same time , and produce no confusion , and that after they are gone , these sounds leave with me such lively and distinct resemblances of what they were ? With what care has He , who made our bodies , provided our eyes with a moist and moving envelope , to close them with . And why has he left our ears always open ? Who is it that paints on my eye in an instant , the heavens , the ocean , the earth ? How is it that on such a little organ , faithful images of every object in nature , from the sun to the motes in his beams , are depicted and clearly defined ? This substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glorious objects that we see in the universe , is it'bot a most wonderful /z/ thing ? We admire with reason the invention of books , in which are preserved the histories of so many facts , and which are the depositaries of so many thoughts . But what comparison is there between the most delightful book , and the brain of a learned man ? There can be no doubt that this brain is a far more precious collection , and a much more beautiful invention , than any book . In this little reservoir , you can find at any moment every image that you desire . You call them , they come . You send them away , they hide themselves , we know not where , and others appear in their place . We open and shut our imaginations as we open and shut a book ; as one may say , we turn over its leaves , we pass suddenly from one end of it to the other . We have even tablets in the memory , to indicate the places where certain images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can read so rapidly , leave no traces on the brain . If you examine it , you see only a soft substance , a sort of cluster of fine , tender , and twisted threads . What hand has hidden in this apparently shapeless matter , such precious images , and arranged them there in such beautiful order ? But the body of man , that seems the chef-ceuvre of nature , is not comparable to his soul . , Whence comes it that beings so unlike are united in his composition ? Whence comes it that the movements of the body give so infallibly and so promptly certain thoughts to the soul ? How is it that the thoughts of the soul produce certain movements of the body Whence comes it that this harmonious connexion exists without interfuption for seventy or eighty years ? /q/ Whence comes it that two beings possessing such different operations , make a whole so perfect , that some are tempted to believe that they are one and indivisible ? What hand has united these two extremes ? Matter could not make an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any compact with matter . Nevertheless it is certain , that it is dependent on the body , and that it can not be freed from its power unless it destroys it by a violent death . This dependence is reciprocal . Nothing is more absolute than the empire of the soul over the body . The spirit wills , and every member of the body is instantly moved , as if it were impelled by some powerful machine . What hand , holding an equal power over both these natures , has imposed this yoke upon them , and held them captive in a connexion so nice and so inviolable ? Can any one say . Chance ? If they do , can they understand what they say themselves , and make others comprehend it ? Has chance linked together by a concourse of atoms the particles of body with soul ? My alternative is this ; if the soul and the body are only a composition of matter , whence is it that this matter , which did not think yesterday , begins to think to-day ? Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess , and what is incomparably more noble than itself , when it was without thought ? Does not that which bestows thought , possess it ? Suppose even that thought resulted from a certain configuration and arrangement and motion of matter ; what workman has discovered these just and nice combinations , so /z/ as to make a thinking machine ? If , on the contrary , Che soul and the body are two distinct substances , what power superior to both these different natures has bound them together ? Who is it , with a supreme empire over both , has sent forth his command that they should be linked together , by a correspondence and in a civil subjection that is incomprehensible ? The empire of my mind over my body is despotic to a certain extent , since my simple will , without effort or preparation , can move every member of ray body by mechanical rules . As the Scriptures represent God , in the creation , to have said , ' Let there be light , and there was light , " so the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the power which men , who believe in God , attribute to him over the universe . This power of the soul over the body which is so absolute , is at the same time a blind one . The most ignorant man moves his body as well as the best instructed anatomist . The player on the lute , who perfectly understands all the chords of his instrument , who sees it with his eyes and touches it with his fingers , often makes mistakes . But the soul that governs the machine of the human body , can move every spring without seeing it , without seeing or understanding its figure , or situation , or strength , and never mistakes . How wonderful is this ! My soul commands what it does not know , what it can not see , and what is itself incapable of knowing ; and it is infallibly obeyed . How great its ignorance , and how great its power I The blindness is ours ; but the power whence 19 it ? To whom shall we attribute it , /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see , and who gives him the power to perform what surpasses his own comprehension ? The truth is , we can not admire too much this absolute empire of the soul over the corporeal orgaos , that it does not understand , and the continual use that it makes of it . This is principally shown in recalling images traced on the brain . I am acquainted with all the objects of the universe , that have impressed my senses for a great number of years ; I have distinct images of them , so that I can think I see them when they are no more . My brain is a cabinet o pictures , every one of which is brought forward or removed , according to the taste of the master of the ' mansion . By the portraits which I have in my head , I judge whether the artist 's picture is a faithful representation . It is by consulting them that I ascertain where are his defects . Such wonders astonish me . I remember distinctly having known that which I no longer know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of life , in which I have known them . The same person passes in different forms through my mind . First I see him a child , then a man , and at last old . I place the wrinkles upon the same face in which I have seen the tender and lovely traits of childhood . I join that which , is no more , with what now exists , without confounding their outlines . I preserve in this storehouse a something which has been successively everything I have known since I was born . From this treasure spring all the perfumes , all the harmony , all the tastes , all the degrees of light , all the bright colors , and all their shades j /z/ in short , all the forms that have been presented to my senses , and which they have conveyed to my brain . I recall , when I please , the joy that I experienced thirty years since . It returns , but it is not the same . It appears , but it does not rejoice nie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at the remembrance . On the other hand , I bring back departed sorrows . They are present with me ; for I perceive them just as they were at the time . Nothing escapes me of their bitterness , and of the acuteness of the feeling . But they are not the same thing . They trouble me no longer , they are softened . I see all their severity without feeling it , or if I feel it , it is only as a representation : it is like a scene of a play ; the images of past griefs give us pleasure . It is the same with our pleasures . A virtuous heart is afflicted at the recollection of its unworthy pleasures . - They are present to us , but they are no longer themselves ; such joys return only to bid us weep . Chance surely never created this wonderful book ; all the art of man is unequal to such perfection . What hand has made it ? Let us conclude these remarks by some reflections upon the nature of the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness and weakness . Its grandeur is real . It connects , without confusion , the past with the present , and it penetrates into the future ; it has an idea of matter and of spirit ; it has within it the idea even of infinity , for it will deny all that does not belong to it , and affirm all that does . Say that infinity is triangular , and it will instantly answer , that what has no limits can not have any form . /q/ Ask it to name the first unit of an infinite number , and it will readily answer , that there can be neither beginning , nor end , nor number , in infinity . It is through the infinite that it comes to the knowledge of , the finite . How glorious is the spirit that is in man ; it bears within itself what is far beyond its own comprehension . ' Its ideas are universal , eternal , and immutable . They are universal ; because , when I say ,  --  It is impossible to be and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; A perfectly circular line has no straight parts ; Between two given points , the straightest line is the shortest ; The centre of a circle is equally distant from all the points in its circumference ; - none of these truths cam be controverted , there can be no line or circle that does not obey these laws . These truths are of all time , or rather before all time , and will continue beyond it through an incomprehensible duration . Let the universe be overthrown and annihilated , let there be no minds to reason upon these truths , they will still remain equally true ; as the rays of the sun would be no less real , if men should be blind , and not see them . In feeling assured , says St Augustin , that two and two make four , we are not only certain that we say what is true , but we have no doubt that this proposition has been always , and will continue to be eternally true . These fundamental ideas have no limits , and can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we acknowledge to be necessarily true of all circles to infinity . These ideas , that are illimitable , can /z/ never change , or be effaced , or impaired ; they are the foundations of our reason . It is impossible , whatever power we may exert over our minds , to make ourselves seriously doubt anything that these ideas represent to us . The idea of infinity is within us in like manner . Change these ideas and you overthrow reason . Let us learn the greatness of our natures from this immutable idea of infinity , that is imprinted within us , and that can never be effaced . But lest our real greatness should dazzle our eyes , and flatter us to our injury , let us hasten to contemplate our weakness . This same mind that dwells upon the infinite , and through it sees the finite , is ignorant of all that surrounds it . It does not know itself It gropes its way through an abyss of darkness . It knows not what it is itself ; it does not comprehend how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empire over it . It is Ignorant of its own thoughts and its own desires ; it does not know with certainty what it believes or what it desires . It often deceives itself , and its highest attainment is to understand itself . It joins errors in opinion to a perverted will ; and it is often reduced to groan and weep at the experience of its own corruption . Such is the spirit of man , weak , uncertain , limited , full of imperfections . Who has given the idea of infinity , that is , of perfection , to a being so shortsighted , so full of imperfection ? Has he given to himself this thought , so high , so pure , which is in itself an image of the infinite ? Let us suppose that the spirit of man is like a mirror , in which the images ON Tfix inasTKKCi : of ood* 55 of all the surrounding objects are reflected ; whence is this image of the infinite that we there trace ? How can the image of an unreal object be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a confused mass of finite objects , which the mind mistakes for the infinite ; it is the true infinite that is presented to our thoughts . We understand it well ; we recognise it , and distinguish it from all that it is not . No subtilty can put any other object in its place . From whence comes this glorious image ? Do we draw it out of nothing ? Can the finite and limited being invent and imagine the infinite , if it does not exist ? External objects can not give us this image ; for they can only give us the images of themselves , and they are all limited and imperfect . Whence do we draw this distinct representation of the infinite , unlike all that we know and all that exists without us P From whence comes it ? Where is this infinite that we can not comprehend , and yet can not mistake ? Where does it dwell ? If it did not exist , could it be so engraven in the depths of our souls ? But besides this idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of all my judgments ; I can not decide upon anything without consulting them , and it is out of my power to decide against what they represent to me . My thoughts , far from being able to correct or form this rule , are themselves corrected , in spite of myself , by this superior power , and are irresistibly subjected to its decisions . I can not , as I before said , doubt that two and two make four , and so of other mathematical truths . I am not free to deny them . This fixed and immutable law /z/ is SO inwrought , that it seems like my identity ; hut it is above me , since it corrects , rectifies , and guides me , teaching me my own weakness and imperfection . It is a something , that will ever inspire me if I listen to it ; and I always err when I do not attend to it . This principle will guide me right , if I am docile ; for this inspiration of the Almighty will enable me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on which . I am called to decide . And of all other things , it will teach me not to judge , a no less important lesson than the first . This interior guide is what I call my refison ; but I speak of my reason without comprehending the full import of the term , as I speak of nature and instinct without comprehending what these things are . This law is perfect and immutable . I am changing and imperfect j I deceive myself , while this never loses its rectitude . When I am undeceived , it is not my reason that changes and returns to the right view , but it is this , which has never departed from it , recalling and forcing me to return to it . It is a controlling power within me , that silences or bids me speak ; that makes me believe or makes me doubt ; bids me confess my errors or confirms my decisions . In listening to it , I am instructed ; in listening to myself , I go astray . This sovereign power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the universe to the other , by all mankind as it is by me . Two men who have never seen each other , who have never heard each other spoken of , and who have had no communication with any other man that could give them common notions , would speak , at the two extremities of the world , of certain truths in perfect /z/ unison . We know perfectly well beforehand in one hemisphere , what answer would be returned in the other , oh certain truths . Men of all countries and of all times , whatever education they may have re* ceived , necessarily think and speak of some things in the same manner . It is the great Master that has taught us all , who thus bids us speak . Thus , when we think most of our own powers , of ourselves , that is , of our reason , this is what the least belongs to us , this is most truly a borrowed good . We are every moment of our lives receiving a reason far superior to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as we see objects around us by the light of the sun that does not belong to our vision . It is this noble reason that reigns with an absolute dominion , to a certain point , over rational beings . It is this that makes a Caoadian savage think many things that Greek and Roman philosophers have thought . It is this that led the Chinese geometricians to the discovery of the same truths that the Europeans , who knew nothing of them , have become acquainted with . It is this that makes men think upon various subjects , just as they thought a thousand years ago . It is this power that gives a uniformity to the opinions of men , the most opposed to each other in their natures . It is by this that men of all ages and couatries are bound to an immoveable centre , to which they are held by certain invariable laws , which we call first principles ; notwithstanding the infinite variety of opinions , that are created by their passions , their distractions , their caprices upon all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept men , depraved as they are , from /z/ daring to caU virtue vice , and that has obliged them to put on the appearance , at least , of sincerity , moderation , and beneficence , when they would attract esteem . They can not esteem or despise anything according to their own arbitrary wills ; they can not force the eternal barriers of truth and justice . The law of the soul , which we call reason , reigns with an absolute sway ; its reproaches are ever uttered and repeated at what is wrong ; it sets bounds to the foUy of the most audacious . After vice has enjoyed so many ages of unrestrained sway , virtue is still called virtue ; and it can not be dispossessed of its name by its boldest and most brutal enemies . From thence it is that vice , although triumphant in the world , is still forced to disguise itself under the mask of hypocrisy , that it may secure a regard that it does not hope for when it is known as it is . Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by adorning itself with her charms , that it may receive the honors that are rendered to them . Men cavil , it is true , at the virtuous , and they are , in truth , always liable to censure , for they are still imperfect ; but the most vicious men can not succeed in effacing entirely the idea of virtue . No man has ever succeeded in persuading others or himself , that it is more estimable to be deceitful , than to be sincere ; to be vio lent and malignant , than to be gentle and to do good . This inward and universal teacher declares the same truths , at all times and places . It is true that we often contradict it , and speak with a louder voice ; but then we deceive ourelves , - we go astray , we fear tba /q/ we shall discover that we are wrong , and we shut our ears lest we should be humbled by its corrections . Where is this wisdom , where is this oracle that ever and against which the prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason which we are bound to consult , and which of itself inspires us with a desire to hear its voice ? Where dwells Ibis pure and gentle light , that not only enlightens eyes that are open to receive it , but uncloses those eyes that were shut , cures those that were diseased , gives vision to the blind , in short , inspires a desire ibr the light it can bestow , and makes itself beloved even by those who fear it ? Every eye has it ; it would see nothing without it ; it is by its pure rays alone that it can see anjrthing . As the visible sun enlightens all material bodies , so the sun of intelligence illuminates all minds . There is a spiritual sun that enlightens the soul more fully than the material sun does the body . This sun of truth leaves no shadow , and it shines upon both hemispheres . It is as brilliant in the night as in the daytime ; it is not without that it sheds its rays , it dwells within each one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ; whatever corner of the earth we may go to , there it is . . We never need say to another . Stand back that I may see it ; you hide its rays from me ; you deprive me of the portion that is my due . This glorious sun never sets ; no clouds intercept its rays , but those formed by our passions . It is one bright day . It sheds light upon the savage in the darkest caverns . There are no eyes weak that they can not bear its light ; and there is i /z/ no man so blind and miserable , that does not waUc bj the feeble light from this source , that he still retains in his conscience . We believe the instructions of men just in proportion tio the conformity we find between them and this inward teacher . After they have exhausted all their reasonings , we still return to this , and listen to the decision it makes . If any one tells me that a part is equal to the whole , I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is within myself , by confiulting this inward teacher , that I must ascertain the truth of a proposition . Far from pronoucing judgment upon this teacher , we are in all cases judged by it . It is disinterested and superior to us . We may refuse to listen to it , and go astray from it ; but if we do listen , we can not contradict it . There seem to be two kinds of reason within me ; one is self , the other superior to it . That which is self , is very imperfect ; prejudiced , rash , apt to wander , changing , obstinate , ignorant , and limited ; it possesses nothing that is not borrowed . The other , while it is common to all men , is yet superior to them ; it is perfect , eternal , immutable , always ready to be communicated , and to reclaim the erring ; - given freely to all , inexhaustible and indivisible . Where is this all-perfect reason , so near me , yet so different from me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it not God himself ? I find still further traces of the Divinity within me . I have within me a clear idea of a perfect unity , far superior to what I can discover in my own soul ; this is often divided between two opinions , between /q/ two iQcIiniitions , bQtwee two opposite habits . This division that I find within me , provos a composition of parts and something more than one . My soul haa at least a succession of thoughts , one very different from another . My idea of unity is , if I may use the expression , infinitely more one . I have a conception of a Being who never changes his thought , who has all thoughts at the same instant , who has no succession of ideas . It is doubtless this idea of a perfect and supreme unity in my own mind , that makes me desirous to find a unity in the soul and even in matter . This idea , ever present to my spirit , must have been born with me . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect copy . This idea of what is simply and indivisibly one , can only be the idea of God . I then know God with such certainty , that by this knowledge I seek in every outward thing , and in myself , some resemblance to his unity . Another mystery that I bear within me , and that renders me incomprehensible to myself , is , that on the one hand X am free , and on the other , dependent . I must be dependent . Independence is the supreme perfection . The Creator must be the cause of all Ihe modifications of his creation . The being who is dependent for his nature , must be so for all its operations . Thus Grod is the real cause of all the combinations and movements of everything in the universe . It is he who has created all that is . But 1 am free , and I can not doubt it ; I have an intimate and immoveable conviction that I am free to will , or not to will . There is within me a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to decide between different objects . This is in itself a proof of the immaterialitj of my soul . Whaf is material , corporeal , can not choose ; it is , on the contrary , governed by fixed laws , that are called physical , that are necessary , invincible , and contrary to what I call liberty . In saying , then , that I am free , I say that my will is fully in my power , and that God leaves it to me to use it as I am disposed ; that I am not determined by a law , like other beings , but I will of myself . I conceive that if the Supreme Being were beforehand to inspire me with a will to do right , I have the power to reject the inspiration , however great it might be , to frustrate its effect , and to refuse my consent . I conceive , also , that when I reject his inspiration to do right , I have actually the power not to reject it , just as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things may solicit me by all that is most captivating , the most powerful and affecting arguments may be presented to influence me , the Supreme Being may touch my heart with the most persuasive inspirations ; but I still remain fre.e to will or not to will . It is this exemption from all restraint and from all necessity , this empire over my own actions , that makes me inexcusable when I will what is evil , and praiseworthy when I will what is good . This is the foundation of all merit or demerit ; it this that makes the justice of reward or punishment . Hence it is that we exhort , reprove , menace , or promise . This is the foundation of all government , of all instruction , and of all rules of conduct . Everything /q/ in human life brings us to this conclusion , that there is nothing over which we have such entire control , as our own wills ; and that we have this free will , this power of election , between two things equally in our reach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , that merchants and artisans take for granted in their negotiations , that the actor represents on the stage ; the magistrate recognises it . in his decisions , and learned doctors teach it in their schools ; it is what no man of sense can seriously doubt . This truth , imprinted on our hearts , is acknowledged in the practice of those philosophers who attempt to overthrow it by their chimerical speculations . The internal evidence of this truth , is like that we have of those first principles , which have no need of demonstration , and by which we prove other truths less certain . Let us view together these equally undoubted truths . I am dependent upon the Supreme Being even for my will ; nevertheless I am free . What is this dependent liberty ? How can we comprehend a will that is free , and that is yet given by the Supreme Being ? I am free in my will , as God is in his . It is in this , principally , that I am in his image , and resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infinite Being , a trait of his celestial nature . It is a divine power that I possess over my will , but I am only a faint image of his all-powerful will . My liberty is only a shadow of that of the Supreme Being , from whom I exist , and from whom I act . On the other hand , the power I have of willing evil , is not so much true power , as the weakness and frailty /z/ of my will . It is a power to destroy , ' to degrade myself , to lessen my own perfection and being . On the other hand , the power I have of willing what is right , is not an independent power , as I do not possess it in myself . A borrowed power can only confer a dependent liberty . How then is such a being free ? What a deep mystery ! Man 's liberty , of which I can not doubt , proves his perfection ; his dependence shows the nothingness from whence he has been drawn . ' For as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in the Scriptures , ' ' so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts . " We have thus followed the traces of the Divinity through what are called the works df nature . We may observe , at the first glance , an all-powerful hand that is the first mover of everything , in every part of the universe . The heavens , the earth , the stnrs ; plants , animals ; our bodies , our spirits , - all discover an order , a nice arrangement , a sldH , a wisdom , far superior to our own , which is the soul of the whole world , and which conducts everything to its destined end , with a gentle and insensible , but all-powerful sway . We have seen , if we may so speak , the architecture of the universe , the just proportions of all its parts ; and one look is enough to discover to us , in an insect yet more than in the sun , a wisdom and a power that shine forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ignorant . What would be our impressions , if we could enter the secrets of the material world ; if we could dissect the internal parts of animals , cuid observe their perfect /q/ mechanism ! Everything , then , in the universe , bears the marks of the Divinity , and man more than all the rest . Everything discovers design to us , and a connexion of second causes , directed by a first cause . We have no ground to cavil at this great work ; the defects that we discover in it , are produced by the ill regulated , but free will of man . It often happens , that what appears like a defect to our limited vision , viewed separately from the whole , gives a beauty to the general design , for the perception of which we do not possess that enlargement and simplicity of mind , by which alone we could comprehend the perfection of the whole . Does it not often happen , that we hastily condemn parts of the works of men , because we have not sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters of the Holy Scriptures were of such immense size , that each letter , looked at near , would nearly fiU our vision , we could only see one at a time , and we could not read , that is to say , collect the letters , and discover the sense of the whole . It is the same with the great features of the providence of God , delineated in the government of the world for so many ages . It is only the whole that can be intelligible , and the whole is too vast for a near view . Every event is a particular character , which is too great for the smallness of our organs , and which means nothing if it is separated from the others . When we shall see God as he is , and see all the events of human life from the first to the last day , m all their proportions and their relations to the designs of God , then shall we exclaim , O ! Lord , thou alone /z/ 66 otf tvE tmsTSKOfe ooid. art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men only by examining the whde . Every part ought not to have all perfecticm , but only that which belongs to it in the order and in the proportion which pervade the whole . In the human foody , it would not be well that all the organs should be eyes ; fiset and hands are also necessary . In the universe , we want the sun for the day , but we also want the moon for the night . It is thus we ought to judge of every part , by its relation to the whole ; every olher view is narrow and false . But how insignificant are ike designs of men , when we compare them with the creation and government of the universe ! Let man , then , admire what he understands , and let him be silent when he can not comprehend . There is nothing in the universe that doesr not equally bear these two opposite characters , - the stamp of the Creator , and the marks of nothingness from whence it is drawn , and into which it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of meanness and glory , of the frailty of the material , and of skill in its conformation . The hand of God is displayed everywhere , even in th worm ; and weakness and nothingness are discoverable everywhere , even in the most sublime geniuses . All but Crod himself must be limited and imperfect ; it may have more or less of imperfection , but it still must be ever imperfect ; we must still be able to point out something in it , of which we may say . This is what leuld not be , , or this it does dot possess . qwq Can we be astonished that poets have animated all nature ; that they have given wings to the winds , and darts to the sun ; that they have painted rivers hastening to precipitate themselves into the sea ; and trees that reach the clouds , to overcome the rays of the sun by the thickness of their foliage ? These figures have been adopted even in common conversation ; so natural is it for man to feel the power and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to inanimate things , the design of the Creator . The language of the poets gave rise to the theology of the Pagans ; their theologians were poets . They imagined a power , a wisdom in objects the most entirely destitute of intelligence . With them the rivers were Gods , and the fountains were Naiads . The woods and the mountains had their particular divinities ; the flowers were subject to Flora , and the fruits to Pomona . The more enlarged our minds are when we contemplate nature , the more we discover of that inexhaustible wisdom which is the soul of the Then do we see the Infinite Creator represented in all his works , as in a mirror , to eonlemplataon of his in- /z/ telligent offspring . But some men have bewildered themselves with their own thoughts ; everjrthing with them turns into vanity . Through sophistical arguments , they lose sight of that truth , which nature and simplicity would teach them without the aid of philosophy . Others , intoxicated by their passions , live unconscious of the presence of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be attentive . Passion not only blinds the savage , but those who are surroupded by the light of religion . It is thus we see men living in the world , thinking only of what gratifies passion and vanity , their souls so laden with the weight of earth , that they can not raise them to any spiritual object . Whatever is not palpable , can not be seen , or heard , or touched , or counted , is unreal and chimerical to them . This Weakness of the mind at last becomes incredulity , and appears to them strength ; and their vanity leads them to applaud themselves for being able to resist arguments that influence the rest of the world . It is as if a monster should boast of not being formed in the fashion of other men ; or , as if a blind man were to triumph at his incredulity about colors that other men perceive . /z/ Oh my Grod ! while so many of thy children are unconscious of thy presence in this glorious scene of nature that thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of them . Thou art near us , but we do not perceive thee ; our passions blind- us. /q/ TkttSj Oh Lord , the light dhineth in the dariuiess , and the darkness comprehendeth it not . Thou diflcoyerest thyself everywhere , hut men do not see thee . All nature speaks of thee , and resounds with thy most holy name ; but its voice is uttered to deafened ears , - they will not hear . Thou art near them and within them , but they fly from themselves and from thee . They would find thee , oh thou eternal and holy light , fountain of all pure and unfaiUng fehcity , life of all true existence , if they would seek thee within their souls . But alas ! thy good gifts that declare the bounty of the giver , turn their attention from the hand that bestows them . They live in thee without thinking of thee ; or rather they die , for to be ignorant of thee is death . Thou supportest them in the arms of thy mercy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art within them , in the temple of the soul into which they never enter , that thou art hidden from them . The order and beauty of the creation , is like a veil that hides thee from their weak vision . The light that should enlighten , blinds them . Thou art too high and too pure to be perceived by their gross senses . The earthly-minded can not comprehend thee . Frightful darkness that envelopes the children of men ! when they can see only shadows , and even truth appears a phantom ; when what is nothing seems all to them , and what is everything is as nothing to them . What do I see in all nature ? God ! Grod in everything , ' and God alone ! Who does not see thee , has seen nothing . He is as if he were not , and his whole life is as a dream . Sorrow to the soul , that has not seen /z/ thee , that is far from God , without hope , without conr solation ! But blessed already are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unspeakable the felicity of those , who rejoice in thy immediate presence , from whose eyes thou hast wiped away every tear , and whose hearts are filled with thy love and presence i /z/ How unspeakable are the blessings that piety bestows ; pure , disinterested piety , piety that never fails , that does good in secret ! It enables us to conquer our passions and our bad habits ; it destroys our love of the polluting pleasures of the world ; it touches our hearts with the salutary truths of religion . It protects us from the fatal snares that are around us . Shall we be ungrateful for so many benefits Shall we not have the courage to sacrifice to piety all our irregular desires , however it may wound our self-love ? Let us examine ourselves , as in the presence of God , and see if such be our piety , and let us view the subject as it relates to God , to ourselves , and to our neighbour . These three relations will guide us in the following discourse . I. Are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with him destroy ou fear of death ? Do we love to think of God ? Do we give ourselves up to him ? It is by asking ourselves these questions , that we shall ascertain the true state of our souls . 1 . Are we willing to suffer for God ? I do not speak of a certain vague love of suffering , that shows itself in words and fails in actions ; of a willingnesd to suffer , that consists only in a habit of talking magnificently and eloquently of the use of crosses , and that shrinks from the slightest personal inconvenience , and /z/ indulges in all the seductive pleasures of a sensual life . Neither do I mean a certain fiinciful spirituality that is ever meditating upon resignation , patience , and the joy of tribulation , while the whole life discovers a jealous self-love , unwilling to suffer anything . True piety is not satisfied with offering to God a sterile faith ; it would add the sacrifice of an humble heart , glad to suffer for him . In vain will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cross . Dare you , can you complain when you have his example to support you ? Will not the faithful soul rejoice to suffer in imitation of Jesus , , and to show his love for him , with the hope of meriting the blessing that he has promised to those who weep ? If I were seriously persuaded that the life of a Christian is a life of patience and self-denial , if in sincerity and truth I loved Jesus Christ , who suffered and humbled himself for me , should I be contented with talking of trials when I am called upon to bear them , with giving lessons to my neighbour and not applying them to myself ? Should I be so impatient with the infirmities of others , so discouraged by obstacles , so disquieted by little troubles , so sensitive about human friendship , so jealous and intractable towards those whom I ought to conciliate , so severe towards lite faults of others , so lenient and so backward in mending my own ? Should I be so ready to murmur at the trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal that might make the pious weep , to see men , who profess to be followers of Christ crucified , shrinking firom sufferings and trials ; men , who would serve God with all possible convenience , /q/ who pretend tp sigh after another 1 , while they are clinging to all the delights of this , who declaim with zeal agninst self-loYe , while they take aU imaginahle precautions to save their own from the least mortification . 2 . Are we willing to die to be with Christ ? St Augustin says , that holiness of life and willingness to die are inseparable dispositions . ' The love of this life and of another , " says he , cause an incessant conflict in the imperfect soul . Let not such persons say they wish to live , in order to repair tfa past : if they examine their hearts , they will find that they cling to life , because they are not sufficiently virtuous to desire the pure joys of heaven . " If we only feared the judgments #@# of God upon our entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The perfection of our love to God consists in our feeling an entire confidence in him . If we loved him as our father , should we fear him as our judge ? Should we fly from his presence , should we tremble thus , when sickness warns us of the approach of death ? But there is a secret infidelity at the bottom of our hearts , that stiflfes all these sentiments . We weep at the death of those we love , and we tremble at our own , as they who have no hope . Judging from our anxiety about this life , who would believe that we anticipated a happy futurity ? How can they to whom religion has opened the path to another life , they whose hope is full of immortality , how can they reconcile such substantial and glorious hopes with vain enjoyments that fill their hearts in this world ? /z/ Our pietj must be weak and imperfect , if it do not conqaer our fear of death . We must take a very eonfaaed and superficial view of the eternal resourcea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that he hopes for beyond this transient life , if our hearts do not kindle with joj at the contemplation of the moment when our sorrows shall pass away and our felicity begin . Let us each ask himself , Am I ready to die ? Let me not deceive myself by a false courage . Does the ardor of my love for God overcome my fear of death ? Do I use this world as not abusing it ? Do I regard it as a passing shadow ? Am I unwilling to be subjected to its vanities ? Is there nothing here that flatters my self-love and enslaves my affectionsy making me almost forget eternity ? in fine , am I every day preparing for death ? Is it by this thought that I regulate my life ? And when the last hour shall arrive , shall I be prepared for the fatal stroke ? Shall I not shrink from its approach ? What will become of my courage when I shall feel myself between world that is fast vanishing from my sight , and eternity that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who profess not to be lovers of life do fear death . less than Oers ? S. Do we enjoy the contemplation of God ? Do we feel a sincere joy when we pray to him , and when we meditate upon his presence ? Prayer , says St Augustine , is the measure of love . He who luves much , prays much . He whose heart is closely united to God , has no sweeter consolation than in communion with him . He finds a positive bappiness in being /z/ able to love him , to speak to him , to meditate upon his attributes , to adore his majesty , to admire hid power , to dwell on his goodness , and to yield himself up to bis providence . In this intercourse he poura out , as into the bosotn of a tender father , all the sorrows of his overflowing heart ; this is his resource under every affliction ; he finds strength and consolation in spreading out all his weaknesses and all his desires ; and as our whole lives are full of imperfections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , in the exercise of prayer , ask pardon of God for our ingratitude , and thank him for his mercy . Let us pray then , but let us pray with all our duties before us . Do not let us make eloquent and abstract prayers that have no connexion with the practice of virtue , but let us pray to become more humble , more docile , more patient , more charitable , more modest , more pure , more disinterested in the performance of our duties . Without this , our prayer will be an illusion to ourselves and a scandal to our neighbour : an illusion to ourselves , for how often do we see a devotion that only noutishes pride and misleads the imagination ; and a scandal to our neighbour , for there can be none greater than to see a person who prays unceasingly without correcting his faults , who comes from his orisons neither less frivolous nor less discontented and anxious , nor less selfish than he was before . 4 . Are we resolved to give ourselves up without reserve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or have we concerning our own affairs a timid anxiety , that renders us unworthy of his care ? 76 ay FIETT . The dispoflkioB easnial to the soul that eottsecretes itself to Gody is to desire nothing but in reference to his will . Whence comes it that so many good people undertake good works without any success ? It is be cause they commence them without any sincere trual in God , and without a complete renunciatiim of self . The thought of self is never entirely excluded . They do not prefer the interest of the work which Ls God 's to their own ill regulated ill inclinations and perverse fancies , to a weak jealousy of authority and a desire of consideration that contaminates the best things . In fine , it is because they wish to serve Grod , with a security of benefiting themselves ; they are not willing to risk their own glory , and they would be very unhappy if they were exposed to any misapprehension through their love for him . Can we expect from these cowardly and mercenary souls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designs of Providence ? He who distrusts God , is not worthy to be his instrument . God , aa St Paul says , ' ' over all is rich , " but it is unto aU who call upon him and trust in him . But we will proceed to the second part of this discourse ; What are our dispositions with rard toourselves /z/ II . Let us examine ourselves upon these four questions . Whether our zeal be not imprudence under the pretext of religion ? Our prudence , is U qot earthly-mindedness ? Our devotion , is it not the efiect of natural temperament ? Our charity , is it not qiQ amusement ? /q/ 1 . Is not our zeal imprudence ? Let every root of bitterness , said St Paul , be put away from you . There is a violent zeal that we must correct ; it thinks it can change the whole world , it would reform everything , it would subject every one to its laws . The origin of this zeal is disgraceful . The defects of our neighbour interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another ; our own haughtiness finds our neighbour 's ridiculous and insupportable ; our restlessness is rebuked by the , sluggishness and indolence of this person ; our gloom is disturbed by the gaiety and frivohties of that person , and our heedlessness by the shrewdness and address of another . If we were faultless , we should not be so much annoyed by the defects of those with whom we associate . If we were to acknowledge honestly that we have not virtue enough to bear patiently with our neighbour 's weaknesses , we should show our own imperfection , and this alarms our vanity . We therefore make our weakness pass for strength , elevate it to a virtue and call it zeal ; an imaginary and often a hypocritical zeal . For is it not surprising to see how tranquil we are about the errors of others when they do not trouble us , and how soon this wonderful zeal kindles against those who excite our jealousy , or weary our patience ? If our zeal be true , it will be regulated by Christianity , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our own defects , our own wants , that it wiU find but little time to think of those of others ; and when conscience obliges us to correct our neighbour , we shall be very cautious with regard to ourselves , following the advice of the apostle , Rebuke thy /z/ brother in the spirit eIleekaes , considering thyself ) le thou also be tempted . " Whatever is said or done with passion will not make our neighbour better . Where do we see any good effects from harsh reproof ? We must gain the heart when we would recommend religion ; and hearts are wcm only by love and condescension . It is not enough to be right , it is dishonoring reason to defend it with violence and haughtiness . It is by gentleness , by patience , by love , that we insensibly lead the mind to truth , undermine old prejudices , inspire confidence , and encourage one to conquer bad habita. - When he who receives correction perceives that reproof is given with ill humor , his own is not subdued by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For ' the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God . ' 2 . Our prudence - is it not an earthly policy a blind prudence which the apostle says , ' is death , " and is not subject to the law of Grod ? There is an absolute incompatibility between this sort of worUly wisdom and that of the true children of God . How many good works do we see arrested by considratiooa of mere earthly prudence ! How many sacred duties are yielded to the imaginary claims of politeness Formerly , Christians despised the undeserved contempt of the world ; now , they fear its judgmeuts and seek for its favor , they regulate their conduci ; by ita whimsical prejudices , they consult it even on subjects the most holy ; not merely that they mfiLj avoid soandA ) which is right , but they try to accommodate theipr selves to its vain maxims , and allow their good worjka to depend upon its decision . /q/ What pJMi do me to . ftoquire eensideralioo aoA confidence , what aaxiety , what eagomess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ieebly . Our heirts are divided between him und a thousand objects unworthy of being remembered before him We seek the glory of God , we really desire it , bat i% is upon certain conditions which destroy our best pun- , poses . We carry , " says St Augustin , * a languid vriU to the practice of virtue , and thus our minds are flattered , while our hearts are not changed . " Who is there among us who desires perfection as it ought to be desired , more than pleasure , more than reputation ? Who is willing to sacrifice to it all tha-is incompatible with it ? Henceforward , let our prq* be regulated by the spirit of God ; let it not he an earthly-minded prudence ; let us be prudent that we may do good ; let us be fqli of charity towards or neighbour , but of distrust concerning ourselves . Let . us be prudent , b.ut let our prudence tea to promote e glory of Grod , to show the true dignity of religioi ) and to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the effect of tempter ment P The apostle , predicting ' the . misfortunes wi4h which religion was menaced , said , ' opft shall be lo ers of their own selves . " This is whfit we see every day ; men quit the amusements of social li &,; live in retirement and with strict regularity , but it is kfi " cause their temperament is harsh aiil they prefeif solitude . Others are modest and gentle , but this ijlkot efiect of weakness and ioelence rather than viirtue , . There is but one gospel , yet each one adapts kk tolm own peculiar inclinations . Weare conunanded to da /z/ violence to our incliiiationBy instead of which we see people forcing religion to their own interests . I know that the grace of takes various forms in different minds ; but , after all , the essentials of religion are the same , and although there are many ways of going to God , they all meet at one point , they all bind us to the obedience of the same law , and hold us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we see this admirable conformity ? Every where we see men who disfigure religion by vain attempts to make it accord with their own caprices . One is fervent in prayer , but he is insensible to the miseries and weaknesses of his neighbour . Another talks much of the love of and of selfsacrifice , whilst he is not willing to suffer the least contradiction . Another deprives himself of allowed pleasures , that he may indulge himself in those that are forbidden . This woman is fervent and scrupulous in orks of supererogation , but faithless in the most common and positive duties ; she fasts and prays , but she does not restrain her pride or the violence of her temper . Thus we see people who think , because they do what they are not commanded to do , that they may dispense with what is required . Far better is that simple obedience that finds the rule of life in the gospel , and follows it , without any of those extravagances that disturb its calm and celestial features . Place each virtue in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gifts , the most difficult virtues ; but do not practise them at the expense of others . Charity and justice are the first Off PfETy. 81 of the virtues ; why cherish one dt the expease of tlM other ? Be Btrict , even austere if you will ; but be bumble . Be very zealous for the reformation of abuses ; but be gentle , charitable , and compaasioaate . Do , for the glory of God , all that your love for him prompts , but begin wiih the performance ofallthedu* ties of the situation in which you are placed . With* out this vour virtues are only whims and fancies , and iastead of glorifying God , you are a subject for the eeandal of the v/orld. . 4 . Our charity - is it not an amusement ? Our friendships - are they not vain and ill regulated ? Is aot St Chrysostom right in saying , that we are more faithless to God in our friendships than even in our enmities ? For , says he , there is a terrible law against bim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves the feelings of hatred and vengeance , we are shocked and make haste to be reconciled to our brother . But it is not so with our friendships . It seems so innocent , so natural , so conformable to charity , to ' love our brethren , that religion seems to authorize it , and thus we are not enough on our guard in forming our friendships , and they are often the result of whim or a blind prejudice . Let us give everything its proper place m out hearts . Are our friendships regulated by reiigioiA if Do we love more than others , those friends , we can carry in our thoughts to God , and who can them selves lead us to him ? Do we seek such with a real pleasure ? Alas , how frivolous are our friendships ( What loss of tiine in expressing feelings tbui often do net exist I How many weleas or dangerojus eoos /z/ flions ! How many unjust preferences destroying tto confiding affection and harmony of families ! - I know that we are permitted to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who are bound to us Jby the ties of nature and sympathy ; but we must be sober and moderate even in these friendships ; let them dwell in the very bottom of our hearts , but there let them be controlled by a calm discretion , and be ever kept in subjection by the general law of charity . Let them be outwardly expressed only so far as is necessary to show esteem , and the cordiality and gratitude that we ought to manifest . We never should allow those movements of tenderness to escape us , or indulge in those familiar caresses and expressions of partiality which may wound others . The most holy friendships should be restrained within these bounds . III . In the regulation of our conduct towards our neighbour , we are called upon to be gentle and humble , to act and to suffer . 1 . To be gentle and humble . The foundation of peace with all men is humility . God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . It is essential to men in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride ; hence arise divisions in the world . Humility is still more necessary where we would promote the designs of God , which are to be supported only by the same spirit which the Son of God has himself chosen for the execution of his great work , the establishment of religion . We must be ready to perform the most menial offices ; we should not de- /q/ sire any distinction ; we should be sincerely contented with obscurity , and be willing to be forgotten by the world . We should esteem such a situation as a happy asylum . We should renounce in our hearts all desire of reputation for understanding , or for virtue , which might awaken a secret self- com placency , and be a low and unworthy recompense for any sacrifices we may have made to the will of God . We should be able to say from our retreat what the Prophet King said in the midst of his triumph , * I will humble myself yet more in my own eyes that I may please thee , O my God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little contrivances to promote our own glory , vain desires to please , or to succeed , or to be praised , the fear of seeing others preferred to ourselves , the anxiety to have our plans carried into effect , the natural love of doniinion , and desire to influence others . These rules are soon given , but it is not so easy to observe them . Our natures must be subdued by the grace of God in our hearts , before we can at all times act with such simplicity and humility . With some people not only pride and hauteur render these duties very difficult , but great natural sensitiveness nrmkes the practice of them nearly impossible , and instead of respecting their neighbour with a true feeling of humility , all their charity amounts only to a sort of compassionate toleration that nearly resembles contempt . 2 . We must act . During the short and precious time that is allowed us on earth , let us hasten to employ ourselves . While it remains to us , let us not fail to consecrate it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vanished forever , the works of the just will follow them , even beyond this life ; for it is certain , according to the beautiful langunge of St Paul , ' ' we have been created in Jesus Christ unto good works , that we should walk in them ; " that is say , pass our whole lives in this happy employment . Let us then do good , according to the means which has given us , with discretion , with courage , and with perseverance . With discretion ; because , while charity extends its efforts for the glory of God , it also regulates its exertions by the nature of the work ; and by the condition of him who undertakes it ; it avoids disproportionate designs . With courape ; for St Paul exhorts us not to become weary in well do* ing . With perseverance ; for we often see weak and yielding spirits , who very soon begin to turn back in their course . We shall find occasions to do good everywhere ; they surround us ; it is the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have the least Gommuoication with others , will furnish us with means of doing good to our fellow beings , and of glorifying Him who is their master and ours . Finally , we must suffer ; and I shall finish this dis course with one of the most important truths with which I commenced it . Yes , we must suffer not only in submission to the will of Providence , for the purification of our souls , and the perfection of our virtues , but often for the success of those designs of which God has made us the instruments . Whoever desires to do good must be willing and must expect to suffer . You must arm yourselves with courage /z/ patience . You must be willing to endure tribtilations and trials of all sorts , which would overwhelm you if you were not supported by well established Eiith and charity . The world will blame , will tempt you ; your friends and your enemies may appear to combine against your good designs . Those even with whom you are iited to promote a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temperaments , different views , contrary habits , may cause you great suffering from those upon whom you have depended for support and consolation . Their defects and yours will perpetually clash in your intercourse with them . If true charity does not soflen these difficulties , if a more than common virtue does not sustain you under these bitter trials ; if an unfailing and fervent piety does not render this yoke easy to you , you will sink under it . /z/ Of all the duties eDJoined by Christianity , none is more essential , and yet more neglected , than prayer . Most people consider this exercise a fatiguing ceremony , which they are justified in abridging as much as possible . Even those , whose profession or fears lead them to pray , pray with sach languor and wandering of mind , that their prayers , far from drawing down blessings , only increase their condemnation . I wish to demonstrate , in this discourse , first , the necessity of prayer ; secondly , the peculiar duty of prayer ; thirdly , the manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imtruct w in our duty . The teachings of men , however wise and well disposed they may be , are still ineffectual , if do not shed on the soul that light which opens the mind to truth . The imperfections of our fellow creatures cast a shade over the truths that we learn from them . Such is our weakness , that we do not receive , with sufficient docility , the instructions of those who are as imperfect as ourselves . A thousand suspicions , jealousies , fears , and prejudices prevent us from profiting , as we might , by what we hear from men ; and though they announce the most serious truths , yet what they do weakens the efiect of what they say . In a word , it is God alone who can perfectly teach us. /q/ St Bernard said , in writing to a pious friend , - If you are seeking less to satisfy a vain curiosity than to get true wisdom , you will sooner find it in deserts than in books . The silence of the rocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most gifted men . ' All , " says St Augustin , ' that we possess of truth and wisdom , is a borrowed good , flowing from that fountain , for which we ought to thirst in the fearful desert of this world , that , being refreshed and invigorated by these dews from Heaven , we may not faint upon the road that conducts us to a better country . Every attempt to satisfy the cravings of our hearts at other sources , only increases the void . You will be always poor , if you do not possess the only true riches . " All light that does not proceed from , Grod , is false ; it only dazzles us ; it sheds no illumination upon the difficult paths in which we must walk , along the precipices that are about us . Our experience and our reflections can not , on all occasions , give us just and certain rules of conduct . The advice of our wisest and most sincere friends is not always sufficient ; many things escape their observation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They suppress much from delicacy , or sometimes , from a fear of transgressing the bounds that our friendship and confidence in them will allow . The animadversions of our enemies , however severe or vigilant they may be , fail to enlighten us with regard to ourselves . Their malignity furnishes our self-love with a pretext for the iilttulgence of the greatest faults . The blindness of our self-love is so /z/ great , that we find reasons for being satisfied with ourselves while all the world condemn us . What must we learn from all this darkness ? That it is God alone who can dissipate it ; that it is he alone whom we can never doubt ; that he alone is true , and knoweth all things ; that if we go to him in sincerity , he will teach us what men dare not tell us , what books can not , all that is essential for us to know . Be assured that the greatest obstacle to true wisdom is the presumption inspired by that which is false . The first step towards this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the want of it , and to be convinced that they who seek it must address themselves to the Father of lights , who freely gives to him who asks in faith . But if it be true that God alone can enlighten us , it is not the less true that he will do this only in answer to our prayers . Are we not too happy in being able to obtain so great a blessing by only asking for it ? No part of the effort that we make to acquire the transient enjoyments of this life , is necessary to obtain these heavenly blessings . What will we not do , what are we not willing to suffer , to possess dangerous and contemptible things , and often without any success . It is not thus with heavenly things . God is always ready to grant thent to those who make the request in sincerity nd truth . The Christian life is a long and continual tendency of our hearts towards that eternal goodness which we desire on earth . All our happiness consists in thirsting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach yoof Creator , and you will never cease to pray . /z/ Do not think that it is necessary to prmounce many words . To furay is to say , Let thy will be done ; it is to form a g0oA purpose ; it is to raise your heart to God ; it is to lament your weakness ; it is to sigh at the recollection . of your frequent disobedience . This prayer demands neither method , nor science , nor reasoning ; it is not necessary to quit one 's employment ; . it is a simple movement of the heart towards its Creator , and a desire , that whatever you are doing , you may do it to his glory . The best of all pra ) ' er8 is to act with a pure intention and with a continual reference to the will of God . It depends upon burselves whether our prayers be efficacious . It is not by a miracle , but by a change of heart , that we are benefited , by a spirit of submission . Let us believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God never will reject our prayer . Yet how many Christians do we see , strangers to the privilege , aliens from God , who seldom think of him , who never open their hearts to him ; who seek elsewhere the counsels of a false wisdom , and vain and dangerous consolations ; who can not resolve to seek , in humble , fervent prayer to God , a remedy for their griefs , and a true knowledge of their defects , the necessary power to conquer their vicious and perverse inclinations , and the consolations and assistance they require , that they may not be discouraged in a virtuous life . But some will say , I have no interest in prayer ; it wearies me ; my imagination is excited by sensible and more agreeable objects , and wanders in spite of me. /z/ If neither your reverence for the great truths of " religion , nor the majesty of the ev6t present Deity nor the interest of your eternal salvmon , have power to arrest your mind , and engage it in prayer ; at least mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , and wish that your thoughts wera more under your control , and desire to become less frivolous and inconstant . Make an effort to subject your mind to this discipline . You iiill gradually acquire habit and facility . What is now tedious will become delightful ; and you will then feel , with a peace that the world can not give nor take away , that God is good . Make a courageous effort to overcome yourself There can be no occasion that calls for it more imperiously . Secondly , The ' peculiar obligation of player , Wer I to give all the proofs that the subject affords , I should describe every condition of life , that I might point out its dangers , and the necessity of recourse to God in prayer . But I will simply state , that under all circumstances we have need of prayer . Ther6 is no situation in which we can be placed ; where we have not many virtues to acquire , and many faults to correct . We find in our temperament , or in our habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities that do not suit our occupations , and that oppose our duties . One person is connected by marriage with another , whose temper is so unequal , that life becomes a perpetual warfare . Some , who are exposed to the contagious atmosphere of the World find themselves so susceptible of the vanity , which they inhale , that all their pure desires vanish . Others have /z/ solemnly ' promised to rctroimtse their resentments , to_the conquer their aversions , to suffer with patience certain crosses , and to repress their eagerness for wealth ; but nature prevails , and they aire vindictive , violettt , impatient and avaricious . Whence comes it , that these resolutions are so frail ? that all these people desire to improve , thai ' they wish to perform their duty towards God and matr better , and yBt fail ? It is that our own strength and wisdom alone are not enough . We undertake to do everything without God ; therefore we do not succeed . It is at the foot of the altar , that we must seek for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must lay our plans of virtue and usefulness ; it is he alone that can render them successful ; Without him , all our designs , however good they may appear , are only temerity and delusion . Lotus then pray , that we may learn what we are , and what we ought to be . By this means , we shall not only learn the number and the bad effects of our peculiar faults , but we shall also learn to what virtues we are called , and the way to practise them . The rays of that pure and heavenly light that visits the ' humble soul , will beam on us ; and we shall feel anfd understand that ever3rthing is possible to those who put their whole trust in God . iTius , not only to those who live in retirement , but to those who are exposed to the agitations of the world and the excitemenlsof business , it is peculiarly necessary , by c6ntemplfLtion and fervent prayer , to restore their souls to thaft serenity , whih the dissipations of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged /z/ in business , contemplation and prayer are much more difficult than to those who live in retirement ; but it is far more necessary for them to have frequent recourse to God in fervent prayer . In the most holy occupation a certain degree of precaution is necessary . Do not devote all your time to action , but reserve a certain portion of it for meditation upon eternity . We see Jesus Christ inviting his disciples to go apart , , in a desert place and rest awhile , after their return from the cities , where they had been to announce hi &; religion . How much more necessary is it for us to approach the Source of all virtue , that we may revive our failing faith and charity , when we return from the busy scenes of life , where men speak and act as if they had never known that there is a God . We should look upon prayer as the remedy for our weaknesses the rectifier of our faults . He who was without sin , prayed constantly ; how much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer ! Even the exercise of charity is often a snare to us ; it calls us to certain occupations that dissipate the mind , and that may degenerate into mere amusement . . It is for this reason that St Chrysostom says , that nothing is so important as to keep an exact proportion between the interior source of virtue and the external practice of it ; else , like the foolish virgins , we shall find that the oil in our lamps is exhausted when the bridegroom comes . The necessity we feel that God should bless our labors , is another powerful motive to . prayer . It often happens , that all human help is vain . It is God alone that can aid us , and it does not require much faith to believe , that it is less ouf exertions , our /q/ foresight , and our industry , than the blessing of the Almighty , that can give success to our wishes . ' Thirdly . Of the manner in which we ofihl to pray . We must pray with attention . Grod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the lips . Our whole heart must be engaged in prayer . It must fasten upon what it prays for ; and every human object must disappear from our minds . To whom must we speak with attention , if not to God ? Can he demand less of us , than that we should think of what we say to him ? Dare we hope that he will listen to us , and think of us , when we forget ourselves in the midst of our prayers ? This attention to prayer , which it is so just to exact from Christians , may be practised with less difficulty than we imagine . It is true , that the most faithful souls suffer from occasional , involuntary distractions . They can not always control their imaginations , and , in the silence of their spirits , enter into the presence of God . But these unbidden wanderings of the mind ought not to trouble us ; and they may conduce to our perfection even more than the most sublime and affecting prayers , if we earnestly strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our infirmity . But to dwell willingly on frivolous and worldly things , during prayer , to make no effort to check the vain tiK ) ughts that intrude upon this sacred employment and come between us and the Father of our spirits , - is not this choosing to live the sport of our senses , and separated firom Crod We must also ask with faith ; a faith so firm that it never hesitates . He who prays without confidence , can not hope that his prayer will be granted . Will /z/ net Ged love tiie hoart that trttats in hkn ? WtU he reject those who bring all their treasures to him , and repose everything upon his goodness ? When we pray to Grod , says St Cyprian , with entire assurance , it is himself who has given the spirit of our prayer . Then it is the Father listening to the words of his child ; it is he who dweUs in the depth of our hearts teaching us to pray . But must we not confess , that this filial confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource only after all others have failed us ? If we look into our heiuls , shall we not find , that we ask of God as if we had never before received benefits from him ? Shall we not discover there a secret infidelity , that renders us unworthy of his goodness ? Let us tremble , lest , when Jesus Christ shall judge us , he pronounce the same reproach that he did to Peter , ' O thou of little faith , whereforedidst thou doubt ? " We must join humility with trust . Great God , said Daniel , when we prostrate ourselves at thy feet , we do not place our hopes , for the success of our prayers , upon our righteouess , but upon thy mercy . Without this disposition in our hearts , all others however pious they may be , can not please God . Saint Augustin observes , that the failure of Petev should not be attributed to insisicerity in his zeal for Jesus Christ . He loved his Master in good faith ; in good &ith; he would rather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in tirusting to his own strength to do vrb &t; his heart dictated . It is not enough to possess a right spirit , an exact knowledge of duty , a sincere desire to perform it . /q/ We must continually renew this decdre , and enkindle tiiis flame within us , at the fountain of pure and eternal light . It is the humble and contrite heart that Grod will not despise . Remark the difference which the Evangelist has pointed out between the prayer of the proud and presumptuous Pharisee and the humble and penitent Publican . The one relates his virtues , the other deplores his sins ; the good works of the one shall be set aside , while the penitence of the other shall be accepted . It will be thus with many Christians . Sinners , vile in their own eyes , wiU be objects of the mercy of God ; while some , who have made professions of piety , will be condemned on account of the pride and arrogance that have contaminated their good works . It will be so , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank thee that I am not as other men are . They imagine themselves privileged souls ; they pretend that they alone have penetrated the mysteries of the kingdom of God ; they have a language and science of their own ; they believe that their zeal can accomplish everything . Their regular lives favor their vanity ; but in truth they are incapable of self-sacrifice , and they go to their devotions , with their hearts full of pride and presumption . Unhappy are those who pray in this manner . Unhappy are they whose prayers do not render them more humble , more submissive , more vigilant over their faults , and more willing to live in obscurity . We must pray with love . It is love , says St Augustin , that asks , that seeks , that knocks , that finds , and that is faithful to what it finds . We cease to /z/ jjny to God , as soon as we cease to love him , as soon as we cease to thirst for his perfections . The coldness of our love is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may pronounce prayers , but we do not pray ; for what shall lead us to meditate upon the laws of God , if it be not the love of him who has made these laws . Let our hearts be full of love then , and they will pray . Happy are they who think seriously of the truths of religion , but far more happy are they who feel and love them . We must ardently desire , that God will grant us spiritual blessings ; and the ardor of our wishes must render us worthy of the blessings . For if we pray only from custom , from fear , in the time of tribulation ; if we honor God only with our lips , whilst our hearts are far from him ; if we do not feel a strong desire for the success of our prayers ; if we feel a chilling indifference , in approaching him who is a consuming fire ; if we have no zeal for his glory ; if we do not feel hatred for sin , and a thirst for perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless prayers . We must pray with perseverance . The perfect heart is never weary of seeking God . Ought we to complain , if God sometimes leaves us to obscurity , and doubt , and temptation ? Trials purify humble souls , and they serve to expiate the faults of the unfaithful ; they confound those who , even in their prayers , have flattered their cowardice and pride . If an innocent soul , devoted to God , suffer from any secret disturbance , it should be humble , , adore the designs of God , and redouble its prayers and its fervor . How often do we hear those , who every day have to /q/ feproach theaiselyes with unfaithfulness towards Gkd/ complain that he refuses to answer their prayers ! Ought they not to acknowledge , that it is their sins which have formed a thick cloud between Heaven and them , and that has justly hidden himself from them ? How often has he recalled us from our wanderings ! How often , ungrateful as we are , have we been deaf to his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel , that we are blind and miserable when we forsake him ; he would teach us , by privation , the value of the blessings that we have slighted ; and shall we not bear our punishment with patience ? Who can boast of having done all that he ought to have done , of having repaired all his past errors , of having purified his heart , so that he may claim as a right that Grod should listen to his prayer ? Alas ! all our pride , great as it is , would not be sufficient to inspire such presumption . If , then , the Almighty do not grant our petitions , let us adore his justice , let us be silent , let us humble ourselves , and let us pray without ceasing . This humble perseverance will obtain from him what we should never obtain by our own merit . It will make us pass happily from darkness to light ; for know , says St Augustin , that God is near to us even when he appears far from us . Lastly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mingle , in our prayers , what is false with what is real , what is perishable with what is eternal , low and temporal interests with that which concerns our salvation . Do not seek to render God the protector of your self-love and ambition , but the promoter of /z/ 99 oir PftAnft* your good doiires . You nak for the gratifioalioii of your pauMHiSy or to be delirered from the crossi of which he knows jou have need ; carry not to the foot of the altar irregular desires and indiscreet prayers ; sigh not there for vain and fleeting pleasures . Open your heart to your Father in heaven , that his Spirit may enable you to ask for the true riches . How can he grant you , says St Augustin , what you do not yourself desire to receive ? You pray every day that his will may be done , and that his kingdom may come . How can you utter this prayer with sincerity , when you prefer your own will to his , and make his law yield to the vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you make this prayer , you who disturb his reign in your heart by so many impure and vain desires , you , in fine , who fear the arrival of his reign , and do not desire that God should grant what you seem to pray for ? No . If he at this moment were to offer to give you a new heart , cmd render you humble , and meek and self-denying , and willing to bear the cross , your pride would revolt , and you would not accept the offer , or you would make a reservation in favor of your ruling passion , and try to accommodate your piety to your humor and fancies . Methods and forms of prayer , received from pious and experienced Christians , should be treated with respect ; but we must not neglect the essential of prayer , which is an earnest desire that God , who knows our wants better than we do ourselves , will supply them . His Holy Spirit will teach us to pray , and will guide us when we are in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persuasion , that /z/ qwq Advice upon the Exercista of Prayer and Piety , Perfect prayer must be the love of Grod . The exoefiBnce of this prayer does not consist in the number of words that we pronounce , for Grod sees our hearts and knows all that we want . The heart asks only what Grod wills that we should have . He who does not demre with his whole heart makes a deceitful prayer . How few are there who pray ! for how few really wish the true riches , humility , renunciation of tiieir own will , the reign of Grod upon the ruins of their self-love . We mijt desire these blessings sinoerely , and in connexion with all the details of life ; else prayer is only an allusion , like a pleasant dream to a wretched sufierer , who thinks he possesses a felicity that is far from him . Still we must not cease to pray , even when we can not feel this true love and sincere desire ; Grod looks into the soul , and will see the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of God , we may feel an inevitable distraction of mind ; but we carry within is a flame which is not extinguied , batj on tile contrary , nourishes secret prayer , // 18 like a lamp , ever bumiog before the throoe of the Supreme . When the divine light begins to illaminate us , then we have a clear vision of truth , and we immediately recognise it . We need not reason to prove the splendor of the sun ; it rises and we see it . This union with God in prayer must be the result of faithful obedience to his will ; bj this alone must we measure our love to him ; our medkatioBs ought to become every day more profound and intimate ; divine truths should enter the substance of our soul , and nourish and grow with it . We ought to meditate upon truth , and meditate at leisure , in singleness of heart , without seeking ingenious and abstract thoughts . Let us do good , according to the means that God has given us , with discernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for charity , while it seeks to promote the glory of God by imparting to man , has reference to the natudre , the work , and the condition of him who undertakes it ; it avoids disproportionate designs . With courage ; St Paul exhorts us not to be weary in well doing ; that is , let us not be wanting in true zeal and faith . With perseverence ; for we see weak spirits , light and inconstant minds , soon looking back in the career of vir* tue . We shall always find occasions to do good ; they present themselves everywhere ; it is the will to do good that is wanting . Even solitude , where we seem to have no means of action , even the solitude that allows the least action , and affords the least com munication with our fellow beings , still presents oppor- tunitieaof glorifying him who is their Master and oura /z/ THE spnirr of god teaches within . It is certain , that the scriptures declare that " the Spirit of God dwells within us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggests all truth to us , and that we are so united to it , that we are joined unto the Lord in one spirit . This is what the christian religion teaches us . Those learned men , who have been most opposed to the idea of an interior life , are obliged to acknowledge it . Notwithstanding this , , they suppose that the external law , or rather the light from certain doctrines and reasonings , enlightens our minds , and that afterwards it is our reason that acts by itself from these instructions . They do not attach sufficient importance to the teacher within us , , which is the Spirit of God . This is the soul of our soul , and without it we could form no thought or desire . Alas ! then , of what blindness we are guilty , if we suppose that . we are alone in this interior sanctuary , while , on the contrary , God is there even more intimately than we are ourselves . You will say , perhaps , Are we then inspired . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostles were . Without the actual inspiration of the Almighty , we could neither do , nor will , nor think anything . We are then always inspired ; but we are ever stifling this inspiration . God never ceases to speak to us ; but the noise of the world without , and the tumult of our passions within , bewilder us , and prevent us from listening to him . All must be silent around us , and /z/ all must be sdll whhin as , when we would listen with our whole souls to this voice . It is a still small Toice , and is onlj heard by those who listen to no other . Alas ! how seldom is it that the soul is so still , that it can hear when speaks to it . Our vain desires and our self-lore confuse the voice within us . We know that it speaks to us that it demands something of us ; but we can not hear what it says , and we are often glad that it is unintelligible . Ought we to wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amusements , full of vain desires , fabe wisdom , and self-confidence , can not understand it , and regard this interior word of God as a chimera ? This inspiration must not make us think that we are like prophets . The inspiration of the prophets was full of certainty upon those things that God commanded them to declare or to do ; they were called upon to reveal what related to the future , or to perform a miracle , or to act with the divine authority . This inspiration , on the contrary , is without light and without certainty ; it limits itself to teaching us obedience , patience , meekness , humility , and all other christian virtues . It is not a divine monition to predict , to change the laws of nature , or to command men with an authority from God . It is a simple invitation from the depths of the soul , to obey , and to resign ourselves even to death , if it be the will of God . This inspiration , regarded thus , and within these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common doctrine of the christian church . It has not in itself , if the imaginations of men add nothing to it , any temptation to presumption or illusion ; as /q/ the contTBiyy it places us in the hands of God , trust* ing all to his Spirit , without either violating our liberty , or leaving iMAjthing to our pride and fancies . If this truth be admitted , that God always speaks within us , he speaks to impenitent sinners ; but they are deafened and stunned by the tumult of their passions , and can not hear his voice ; his word to them is a fable . He speaks in the souls of sinners who are converted ; these feel the remorse of conscience , and this remorse is the voice of God within them , reproaching them for their vices . When sinners are truly touched , they find no difficulty in comprehending this secret voice ; for it is that which penetrates their souls ; it is in them the two-edged sword of which St Paul speaks . God makes himself felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy , entering , the very recesses of the heart , in accents of tender reproach , and the soul is torn with agony . This is true contrition . God speaks in the hearts of the wise and learned , of them whose regular lives appear adorned with many virtues ; but such persons are often too full of their own wisdom ; they listen too much to themselves to listen much to God . They turn everything to reasoning ; they form principles from natural wisdom and by worldly prudence , that they would have arrived at much sooner by singleness of heart and a docility to the will of God . They often appear much better than they are ; theirs is a mixed excellence ; they are too wise and great in their own eyes ; and I ' have often remarked , that an ignorant sinner , who is beginning in his conversion to be touched with the i 104 0PON THE Of CBOSSES. true love of Crod , is more disposed to understand this interior word of the Spirit , than certain enlightened and wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , who seeks to communicate himself , can not be received by these souls , so full of themselves and their own virtue and wisdom ; but his presence is with the simple . Where are these simple souls ? I see but few of them . sees them , and it is with them that he is pleased to dwell . My Father and I , says Jesus Christ , will come unto him , and make our abode with him . /z/ We find it difficult to believe in that almighty goodness that inflicts trials ou those whom it loves . Why , we say , should it please Grod to make us suffer ? Why could he not make us good without making us miserable ? Doubtless he could , for he is all-powerful ; the hearts of men are in his hands , and he can turn them as he will . But he , who could save us from sorrow , has not chosen to do it ; just as he has willed that men should slowly grow from infancy to manhood , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be silent , and adore his profound wisdom without comprehending it . Thus we see clearly , that we can not be virtuous but in proportion as we become humble , disinterested , trusting everything to God , without any unquiet concern about ourselves . /z/ We have need of all our crosses . When we saflr much , it is because wo have strong ties that it is necessary to loosen . We resist , and we thus retard the divine operation ; we repulse the heavenly hand , and it must come again ; it would be wiser to yield ourselves at once to God . That the operation of his providence , which overthrows our self-love , should not be painful to us , would require the intervention of a miracle . Would it be less miraculous , that a soul , absorbed in its own concerns , should , in a moment , become dead to self , than that a child should go to sleep a child , and wake up a man ? The work of . God in the heart , as upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train of almost insensible events . He not only produces these effects gradually , but by ways that seem so simple , and so calculated to succeed , that human wisdom attributes the success to these natural causes , and thus the . finger of God is overlooked . Formerly every work of God was by a miracle , and this precluded that exercise of faith which he now demands of us . It is to try our foith , that Grod renders this operation so slow and sorrowful . The ingratitude and inconstancy of our fellow creatures , the misapprehensions and disgust we meet with in prosperity , detach us from life and its deceitful enjoyments , God destroys the delusions of self-love by the experience which he gives us of our sinfulness and numberless errors . All this appears natural to us ; and thus our self-love is consumed by a slow fire , while we would have it annihilated at once , in the overpowering flame of a pure and devoted love to God ; but this would cost us but little pain . It is an lOtf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become perfect ni a moment , rather than by alow degrees* What is it that makes us complain of the length of oor trials ? It is still this attachment to sedf ; and this is what God would destroy . Why riiould we complain ? The lore of the beings and things of this worki is our eril , and still more the lore of ourselyes . Our Father in heaven ords a series of erents that gradually detach ' us from the earth , and finally from self This opera* lion is painful ; but it is the disease of our soul that renders it necessary , and that causes the pain we feel . Is it cruelty in the surgeon to cut to the quick I No , on the contrary , it is affection , it is skill ; he would so treat his only son . And tus it is with Grod ; his parental heart does not wish to grieve us ; he must wound us to the very heart , that he may cure its malady . He most take from us what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest we love it to the prejudice of our lore for him . We weep , we despair , we groan in our spirits , and we murmur against God ; but he leaves us to our sorrow , and we are saved ; our present grief saves us from an eternal sorrow . He has placed the friends whom he has taken from us in safety , to restore them to us in eternity . He has deprived us of them , that he may teach us to love them with a pure love , a love that we may enjoy in his presence forever ; he confers a greater blessing than we were capable of desiring . There happens nothing , even to the sinner , that God has not willed . It is he who does all , who rules , who gives to all whatever they receive . He has awnbered the veiy hairs of our head , the leaves of the trees , the MOHb ob tke and the drops of the ocean* In ereeting the unirerse big ntnmdoni has weighed and nwasured the least atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renews the breath of life within us . It is he who has numbered our dajs . That which most astonishes us , is nothing in the sight of Grod . Of what consequence is it whether this frail house of clay crumble into dust a little sooner , or a little later ? What do they lose , who are deprived of those whom they love ? Perhaps they lose only a perpetual delirium , they lose their forgetfulness of God and of themselves , in which they were plunged ; or rather they gain , by the efficacy of this trial , the felicity of detachment from the world ; the same stroke that saves the person who dies , prepares others , by sufiering , to labor for their own salvation . Is it not then true , that God is good , that he is tender and compassionate towards our real sorrows , even when he strikes us to the heart , and we are tempted to complain of his severity ? Very soon they who are separated will be re-united , and there will appear no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set out upon a journey , ought not to feel themselves far distant from those who have gone to the same country , a few days before . Life is Uke a torrent ; the past is but a dream ; the present , while we are thinking of it , escapes us , and is precipitated into the same abyss that has swallowed up the past ; the future will not be of a different nature , it will pass as . rapidly . A few moments , and a few more , and all will be ended ; what has appeared long and tedious , will seem short , when it is finished . /z/ It is this unquiet selIove that renders us so sensitive . The sick man , who sleeps ill , thinks the night long . We exaggerate , from cowardice , all the evils which we encopnter ; they are great , but our sensibility increases them . The true way to bear them is to yield ourselves up with confidence to Grod . We suffer , indeed , but Grod wills this suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . The world forgets us , slights us , is ungrateful to us , places us in the rank of those who have passed away ; true , and is it astonishing that the world should be unjust , treacherous , and deceitful ? It is nevertheless the same world that you have not been ashamed to love so dearly , and that perhaps you still love ; and this is the source of your sorrow . Almighty God , thou , who alone canst see the whole extent of our misery , canst alone cure it . Give us , we implore thee , the faith , the hope , the love , the christian courage that we need . Enable us ever to raise our eyes to thee , the all-powerful , who will give to thy children only what is for their everlasting good , and to Jesus Christ thy Son , who is our example in suffering .

We* often reproach a friend for a fault that he knows gives us pain , and that he still repeats with this knowledge , although not with the design to offend us . We sometimes commit such faults towards God . They are in truth voluntary , because , though we do not reflect ' at the moment , yet we have an interior light in our consciences , that should be sufficient at least to make us hesitate before we act . These are often the faults of very good people . Small offences become great in our eyes , as the light from God increases within us , just as the sun , when rising , reveals to us the magni- - tude of objects , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As this ' light rises within us , we must expect that the imperfections which we now discover , will appear greater and more sinful , and that we shall see , springing up from our hearts , numerous defects that we never suspected were there . We shall there find weaknesses enough , to destroy our self-love , and to demolish to the very foundation the fabric of human pride . Nothing proves more certainly the real advancement of the soul , than the power to see these imperfections without being discouraged by them . When we perceive an inclination to do wrong before we have committed a fault , we must abstain . from it ; but after we have committed it , we must . /z/ courageously endure the humiliation that follows . When we perceiye the fault before we commit it , we must beware of zmstii the spifit of God that is warning us of danger , and that may , if we neglect it , be silenoed within us , and thai will in time leave us , if we do not yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in comparison with those which render us deaf to this voice of the Holy Spirit , that is beginning to sipeak in the bottom of our hearts . Those faults that we do not perceive till afer they are commijtted , will not be cured by inquietude and . vexation with ourselves ; on the contrary , this fretfulness is only the impatience of pride at the view of its own downfal . The only use , then , to be made of errors , is to submit quietly to Ihe humiliation they bring , for it is not being humble to resist humiltty . We must condemn our faults , lament them , repent them without seeking any palliation or excuse , viewing ourselves as in the presence of God , with all our imperfections upon our heads , and without any feeling of bitterness or discouragement , meekly improving our disgrace . Thus may we draw from the serpent a cure for the venom of his wound . Very often what we would offer to God , is not what he calls upon us to relinquish .

There are some people who think that they should be always mourning that they should put a continual constraint upon themselves , and feel a disgust tor those amusements to which they are obliged to submit For my own part , I confess that I know not how to conform myself to these rigid notions . I prefer something more simple , which I also think would be more pleasing to God . When diversions are innocent in themselves , and we enter upon them with a due regard to the condition in which we are placed by Providence , then I think that we may enjoy them with moderation and in the sight of God . Manners more reserved and harsh , less complaisant and firank , only serve to give a false idea of piety to the people of the world , who are already but too much prejudiced against it , and who believe that we can not serve God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on our way in the simplicity of our hearts , with the peace and joy that are the fruits of the floly Spirit . Whoever walks as in the presence of Grod in the most indifferent things , does not cease to do his will , although he may appear to do nothing of much importance . I believe that we are conforming to the divine order and the will of Providence , when we are doing even indifferent thinga that belong to our condition . Most persons , when they wish to be cohyetted or io refbrm , think more of performing some dSifflcult and extraordinary actions , than of purifying their intentions , and sacrificingtheir inclinations in the most common duties of their situation in life ; in which they are deceived . It would be ' detter to make less change in the action , and a deeper change in the disposition with which it is performed .

It is our undivided love that he demands ; it is an acquiescence , without any reserve , in his will . Let us carry this submissive temper , this will , inspired by the will of God , wherever his providence conducts us . Let us seek the Father of our spirits in those times that seem so vacant , and they will be full of his presence . The most useless amusements may be converted into good works , if we enter into them with proper decorum and in conformity to the will of God . What enlargement of heart do we experience when we act with this simplicity ; we walk like little children led by a tender parent , not fearing whither we may go , and with the same freedom and joy . When piety has its foundation entirely in the will of God , regarding neither fancy nor temperament , nor induce d by an excessive zeal , how simple , and and lovely , are all its movements ! They who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witheut affectation , without austerity ; they are social and easy , /z/ but still liye in perpetual subjection to all their and in an unceasing renunciation of everjrthing that does not in some way belong to the divine order which always governs* In short , they live in the pure vision of Grod sacrificing to him every irregular movement of nature . This is the adoration in spirit and in truth that Jesus Christ has taught . All the rest is the mere ceremony of religion ; the shadow rather than the substance of Christianity . You ask by what means we can retain this purity of intention in our intercourse with the world , and while thus partaking of its pleasures . We find it difficulty you will say , to defend ourselves against the torrent of evil passions and bad examples among . men , even when we place a continual guard upon ourselves* How then shall we hope to resist , if we expose . ourselves so readily to its pleasures , which may contaminate , and must dissipate even the mind of the Christian ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is said to be , and I admit the necessity of great precaution against these snares ; and these are the safeguards that I would recommend , reading , prayer , and meditation upon the great truths of religion . Fix your thoughts upon some action or instruction of Jesus Christ , and when you feel convinced of the truth which you have been considering , make a serious and particular application of it for the amendment of your defects . If you are faithful to retire , morning and evening , for the practice of this duty , you will find that it will serve as a counterpoise to the dangers that surround you . I say morning and evening . /q/ because the soul , like the body , must refresh itself at stated times , lest it faint and become exhausted in its commerce with the world . But we must be firm against tenlptations from without and from within j if we would observe those periods . We never need be so engrossed by external things , however good they may be , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in following these simple rules , we shall insure an abundant blessing ; we shall be in the midst of pleasures , moderate , discreet , and self-possessed , without constraint , without affectation , and without the severity that gives pain to others . We shall be in the midst of these things as not being there , and still preserving a . cheerful and complaisant disposition ; we shall thus be all things to all men . Should we feel at times disheartened and discouraged , a confiding thought , a simple movement of heart towards God will renew our powers . Whatever he may demand of us , he will give us at the m ( bment the strength and the courage that we need . This is the daily bread for which we continually pray , and which will never be denied us ; for our Father , far from forsaking us , waits only for our hearts to be opened , to pour into them the stream of his unfailing love . Hi AOAnriT TBXPTATIOHd. /z/ Thkre are but two things that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the light within us , in avoiding all exposure to temptation , which we are at liberty to avoid . I say , all that we are at liberty to avoid , because it does not always depend upon ourselves , whether we shall escape occasions of sin . Those that belong to the situation in life in which Providence has placed us , are not under our control . The other is to turn our eyes to God in the moment of temptation , to throw ourselves immediate ly upon the protection of Heaven , as a child , when in danger , flies to the arms of its parent . The habitual conviction of the presence of God is the sovereign remedy ; it supports , it consoles , it calms us . We ihust not be surprised that we are tempted . We are placed here to be proved by temptations . Everything is temptation to us . Crosses irritate our pride , and prosperity flatters it ; our life is a continual warfare , but Jesus . Christ combats with us . We must let temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still move on ; like* a traveller surprised on the way by a storm , who wraps his cloak about him , and goes on his journey in spite of the opposing elements . In a certain sense , there is little to do in doing the will of God . Still it is true that it is a great work , because it must be without any reserve . His spirit enters the secret foldings of our hearts , and even the most upright afiectiona , and the most necessary upcm FioBLirr m little things . 117 attachments , must be regulated by his will ; but it is not the multitude of hard duties , it is not constraint and contention that advances us in our Christian course . On the contrary , it is the yielding of our wills without restriction and without choice , to tread cheerfully every day in the path in which Providence leads us , to seek nothing , to be discouraged by nothing , to see our duty in the present moment , to trust ail else without reserve to the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly Father that our wills may be swallowed up in his . /z/ Great virtues are rare ; the occasions for them are very rare ; and when they do occur , we are prepared for them , we are excited by the grandeur of the sacrifice , we are supported either by the splendor of the deed in the eyes of the world , or by the self-complacency that we experience from the performance of an uncommon action . Little things are unforeseen ; they return every moment ; they come in contact with our pride , our indolence , our haughtiness , our readiness to take offence ; they contradict our inclinations perpetually . We would much rather make certain great sacrifices to Grod , however violent and painful they might be , upon condition that we should be rewarded by liberty to follow our own desires and habits in the details of life . It is , however , only by fidelity /z/ AU great things are onlj a. great mmiber of sshA ibmpi itkit have keen carefdlly cdlected together .

What he desires is a pore intention , the deeMitj , and a siacaare self-renunciation . All this is exercised more frequently , and in a way that tries us noere severely , on common than on great occasions . Sometimes we cling more tenaciously to a trifle , than to a great interest . It would give us more pain to relinquish an amusement than to bestow a great sum in charity . We are more easily led away by little things , because we believe them more innocent , and imagine that we are less attached to them ; nevertheless when God deprives us of them , we soon discover , from the pain of privation , how excessive and inexcusable was our attachment to them . Tlie sincerity of our piety is also impeached by the neglect ef minor duties . What probability is there , that we should not hesitate to make great sacrifices , when we shrink from slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the habit it acquires of unfiuthfiilness . True love to God thinks nothing small . All that can please or dispense him is great . It does not produce constraint and weak seniles , bat it places no Itttits to its Melitfi k acts with sanplioity , and as it is not emb n f f as aod with things that God has net commanMlj H nevair /q/ hesitates a moment about what he does command , whether it be great or small . Those persons , who are naturally less exact , ought to make an inviolable law with themselves about trifles . They are tempted to despise them ; they have a habit of thinking them of no consequence ; diey are not aware of the insensible growth of the passicms ; they forget even their own most fatal experience . They trust to a delusive courage , though it has be . fore failed them , for the support of their fidelity . " It is a trifle , " they say , " it is nothing . " True ; but it is a nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you prefer to the will of God , a trifle that will be your ruin . There is no real elevation of mind in a contempt of little things ; it is , on the contrary , from too narrow views , that we consider those things of little importance , which have in fact such extensive consequences . The more apt we are to neglect small things , the more we ought to fear the effects of this negligence , be watchful over ourselves , and place around us , if possible , some insurmountable barrier to this remissness . Do not let us be troubled at this constant attention to trifles ; at first it will require courage to maintain it , but it is a penance that we have need of , and that will at last bring us peace and serenity . God will gcadually render this state pkaaant and easy to us. // /z/ There is a simplicity that is a defect , and a simplicity that is a great virtue . Simplicity may be a want of discernment . When we speak of a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps vulgar . The simplicity that is a virtue , is something sublime ; every one loves and admires it ; but it is difficult to say exactly what this virtue is . Simplicity is an uprightness of soul that has no reference to self ; it is different from sincerity , and it is a still higher virtue . We see many people who are sincere , without being simple ; they only wish to pass for what they are , and they are unwilling to appear what they are not ; they are always thinking of themselves , measuring their words , and recalling their thoughts , and reviewing their actions , from the fear that they have done too much or too little . These persons are sincere , but they are not simple ; they are not at ease with others , and others are not at ease with them ; they are not free , ingenuous , natural ; we prefer people who are less correct , less perfect , and who are less artificial . This is the decision of man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have us so occupied with ourselves , and thus , as it were , always arranging our features in a mirror . To be wholly occupied with others , never to look within , is the state of blindness of those who are entirely engrossed by what is present and addressed to their senses ; this is the very reverse of simplicity . /z/ To bB absorbed in self in whatever engages us , - whether we are laboring for our fellow beings , or for God , to be wise in onr own eyes , reserved , and full of ourselves , troubled at the least thing that disturbs our self-complacency , is the opposite extreme . This is false wisdom , which , with all its glory , is but little less absurd than that folly which pursues only pleasure . The one is intoxicated with all that it sees around it ; the other with all that it imagines it has within ; but it is delirium in both . To be absorbed in the contemplation of our own minds , is really worse than to be engrossed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet is not ; we do not think of curing it ; we pride ourselves upon it ; we approve of it ; it gives us an unnatural strength ; it is a sort of frenzy ; we are not conscious of it ; we are dying , and we think ourselves in health . Simplicity consists in a just medium , in which we are neither too much excited , nor too composed . The soul is not carried away by outward things , so that it can not make all necessary reflections ; neither does it make those continual references to self , that a jealous sense of its own excellence multiplies to infinity . That freedom of the soul , which looks straight onward in its path , losing no time to reason upon its steps , to study them , or to contemplate those that it has already taken , is true simplicity . The first step in the progress of the soul is disengagement from outward things , that it may enter into itself and contemplate its true interests ; this is a wise self-love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God whom it fears ; this is the feeble beginning of /z/ true wisdom ; but the soul is still fixed upon itself ; it is afraid that it does not fear God enough ; it is still thinking of itself These aniieties about outseWefi are fkr removed from that peace and liberty , which a true and simple love inspires ; but it is not yet tlttkt for this ; the soul must pass through this trouble ; this operation of the Spirit of God in our hearts comes to us gradually ; we approach step by step to this simplicity . In the third and last state we begin to think of God more frequently , we think of ourselves less , and insensibly we lose ourselves in him . The more gentle and docile the soul is , the more it advances in this simplicity . It does not become blind to its own defects , and unconsci6us of its imperfections ; it is more than ever sensible of them ; it feels a horror of the slightest sin ; it sees more clearly its own corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , but by the light from the presence of God we see how far removed we are from infinite purity . Thus simplicity is free in its course , since it ihaks no preparation ; but it can only belong to the soul that is purified by a true penitence . It must be the fruit of a perfect renunciation of self , and an unreserved love of Gd . But though they , who become penitents , and tear themselves from the vanities of the world , make self the object of thought , yet they must avoid an excessive and unquiet occupation with themselves , such as would trouble , and embarrass , and retard them in their progress . Dwelling too much upon self , produces in weak minds useless scruples and superstition , and in stronger minds a presumptuous wisdom . /z/ Roth are contrary to true simplicity , which is free and direct , and gives itself up , without reserve and with a generous self-forgetfulness , to the Father of spirits . How free , how intrepid are the motions , how glorious the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , and interested , and unquiet cares . If we desire that our friends be simple and free with us , disencumbered of self in their intimacy with us , will it not please God , who is our truest friend , that we should surrender our souls to him , without fear or reserve , in that holy and sweet Communion with himself which he allows us ? It is this simplicity , which is the perfection of the true children of God . This is the end that we must have in view , and to which we must be continually advancing . This deliverance of the soul from all useless , and selfish , and unquiet cares , brings to it a peace and freedom that are unspeakable ; this is true simplicity . It is easy to perceive , at the first glance , how glorious it is , but experience alone can make us comprehend the enlargement of heart that it produces . We are then like a child iii the arms of its parent ; we wish nothing more , we fear nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not anxious about what others think of us , all our motions are free , graceful , and happy . We do not judge ourselves , and we do not fear to be judged . Let us strive after this lovely simplicity ; let us sek the path that leads to it . The ther we are from it , the more we must hasten our steps towards it . Very far from being simple , most Christians are not even sincere . They are not . only disingenuous , but they are false , and 124 ' on siMPLicirr. they dissemble with their neighbonr , with Grod , and with themselves . Thej practise a thousand little arts that indirectly distort the truth . Alas ! every man is a liar ; those even who are naturally upright , sincere , and ingenuous , and who ore , what is called , iiraple and natural , still have this jealous and sensi'ave reference to self in everything , which secretly nourishes pride and prevents that true simplicity , which is the renunciation and perfect oblivion of self . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with myself ? A crowd of selfish fears trouble me , and tyrannize over my mind , and excite a lively sensibility . The principal means to cure this is to yield yourself up sincerely to God , to place all your interests , pleasures , and reputation in his hands , to receive alt the sufferings that he may inflict upon you in this scene of humiliation , as trials and tests of your love to him , neither to fear the scrutiny , nor to avoid the censure of mankind . This state of %villing acqui* escence produces true liberty , and this liberty brings perfect simplicity . A soul that is liberated from the little earthly interests of self-love , becomes confiding , and moves straight onward , and its views expaiki even to infinity , just in proportion as its forgetfulness of self increases , and its peace is profound even in the midst of trouble . I have already said , that the opinion of the world conforms to the judgment of God , upon this noble simplicity . The world admires , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who has lost sight of self . But the simplicity , which is produced by a devotion to external things , still more vain than self /q/ IB not the true aimplicity ; it is only an image of it , and can not represent its greatness . They who can not find the substance , pursue the shadow ; and shadow as it is , it has a charm , for it has some resemblance to the reality that they have lost . A person full of defects , who does not attempt to hide them , who does not seek to dazzle , who does not affect either talents or virtue , who does not appear to think of himself more than of others , but to have lost sight of this self of which we are so jealous , pleases greatly in spite of his defects . This false simplicity is taken for the true . On the contrary , a person full of talents , of virtues , and of exterior graces , if he appear artificial , if he be thinking of himself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wearisome companion that no one likes . Nothing , then , we grant , is more lovely and grand than simplicity . But some will say , must we never think of self ? We need not practise this constraint ; in trying to be simple we may lose simplicity . What then must we do ? Make no rule about it , but be satisfied that you afiect nothing . When you are disposed to speak of yourMfrom vanity , you can only repress this strong desire , by thinking of God , or of what you are ealled upon by him to do . Simplicity does not consist in false shame or false modesty , any more than in pride or vain- glory . When vanity would lead to egotism , we have only to turn from self ; when , on the contrary , there is a necessity of speaking of ourselves , we must not reascm too much about it , we must look straight at the end . But what will they think of me ? They will think I am boasting ; I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . // None of these unquiet reflections should trouble us for one moment . Let us speak freely , ingenuously , and simply of ourselves , when we are called upon to speak . It is thus that St Paul spoke often in his epistles . What true greatness there is in speaking with simplicity of one 's self . Vain glory is sometimes hidden under an air of modesty and reserve . People do not wish to proclaim their own merit , but they would be very glad that others should discover it . They would have the reputation both of virtue and of the desire to hide it . As to the matter of speaking against ourselves , I do not either blame or recommend it . When it arises from true simplicity , and that hatred with which God inspires us of our sins , it is admirable , and thus I regard it in many holy men . But usually the surest and most simple way is not to speak unnecessarily of one 's self either good or evil . Self-love often prefers abuse to oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ourselves , we are quite ready to be reconciled , just like angry lovers , who , after a quarrel , redouble their blind devotion to each other . This simplicity is manifested in the exterior . As the mind is freed from this idea of self , we act more naturally , all art ceases , we act rightly , without thinking of what we are doing , by a sort of directness of purpose , that is inexplicable to those who have no experience of it . To some we may appear less simple than those who have a more grave and practised manner ; but these are people of bad taste , who take the affectation of modesty for modesty itself , and who have no knowledge of true simplicity . This true simplicity /q/ has sometimes a careless and irregular appear ance , but it has . the charm of truth and candor , and sheds around it , I know not what of pure and innocent , of cheerful and peaceful ; a loveliness that wins us when we see it intimately and with pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to me ? I will quit all else ; it is the pearl of great price . /z/ It is commonly said , that the private vices of kings are less injurious than the mistakes they make as lers . For my own part I boldly assert the contrary , and I insist , that all their defects as men , arc of infinite importance to the community . Examine your actions , then , in detail . Subjects are servile imitators of their rulers , especially when the passions are concerned . Have you then set any example of a criminal love ? If you have , your authority has given distinction to infamy ; you have broken down the barriers of honor and decency ; you have afibrded a triumph to vice and impudence ; you have taught your subjects not to blush at what is disgraceful . Fatal lesson , that they willnever forget ! It would be better , said Jesus Christ , to be thrown with a mill-stone round your neck into the depth of the sea , than to cause one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagious poison . Human nature is always liable to the contamination ; it is eTer ready to break the yoke of modesty . A spark causes a flame . A single action of a king may produce an increase and succession of crimes through many nations , and through distant ages . Have you not given any of these fatal examples ? Can you think that your irregularity will be secret . O no ! the crimes of rulers are never secret . Their good actions may be hidden ; people are slow to believe them ; but evil is believed upon the slightest suspicion . Have you discountenanced irreligion in its lightest expression ? Have you manifested your indignation at impiety ? Have you made it felt , and left no one to doubt your sentiments ? Have you never been influenced by a false shame , that has made you blush for the gospel ? Have you shown by your conversation and actions , your sincere faith and zeal for Christianity ? Have you used your authority to silence impiety ? Have you shrunk with horror from immodest levity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have you committed no injustice towards foreign nations ? The poor wretch , who from extreme necessity , steals a purse upon the highway , is hanged ; while the man who unjustlysubjugates a neighbouring state , is called a hero . The unlawful seizure of a meadow or a vineyard , is regarded as an oflence against God ; but no account is made of taking possession of cities and provinces . To take a field from an individual , is a great sin ; to take a country from a nation , is an innocent and glorious action . Whence are these ideas of justice ? Will God judge thus ? Ought we to be /q/ less just in great , than in little things ? Is not justice still justice , when great interests are at stake ? Should we not have some scruples about committing a crime against a million of men , against a whole country , when we dare ' not injure an individual ? All , then , that is taken by mere conquest , is taken unjustly , and ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from necessity , because one party is the stronger , is like that which is made with a robber , who has his pistol at your head . Your enemy is your brother ; you can not forget this , without forgetting all humanity . You have no right to do him any harm when you can avoid it . You have no right to take up arms against him , but in extreme necessity . And in making a treaty with him , it is no longer a question of war , of arms , but of peace , justice , humanity , and good faith . And it is more infamous to deceive in a treaty of peace with a nation , than in a private contract with an individual . /z/ Never let your high rank prevent the exercise of kindness to the most insignificant .

Virtue can not penetrate the crowd ; it has neither eagerness nor presumption ; it allows itself to be forgotten . /z/ Do not be subdued by the artful and by flatterers . Let them feel that jou do not love either their praises or their meanness . Put trust only in those , who have the courage to contradict you with respect , and who value your character more than your favor . Let ail the world see , that you think and feel as a prince should think and feel . It is important , that the good love you , that the wicked fear you , and that all esteem you . Make haste then to correct yourself , that you may labor successfully to improve others . True piety has in it nothing wec , nothing sad , nothing constrained . It enlarges the heart ; it is simple , free , and attractive . The kingdom of Grod does not consist in a scrupulous observance of trifling formalities ; it is in each individual the performance of the duties that belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in the same manner as a her .. mit , or a private individual . Feeling as affectionate an interest in the happiness of the wbde human race as in his own nation in particular , and being as true an enemy to persecution as he was a sincere friend to justice and equity , the following is the wise advipe that Fenelon gave to the Chevalier St George , when he visited hini at Cambrai in 1709-10 .

Every wise priaee should rejoice to be only the executor of the laws , and to have a supreme council who can moderate his aotberity . The paternal relation is the true modd fot governments ; and every good father acts in concert with his wisest and most experienced children . /z/ NoTHiNO is more neglected than the education of girls . Custom and the caprice of mothers determuM it altogether . A careful education of boys is thought necessary for the public good ; though it is frequently as defective as that of girls . Women in general have feebler minds than men ; the weaker the mind is , the more important it b to fortify it . They have not only duties to fulfil , but duties which form the basis of aocial life . Is it not women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who regulate the detail of domestic afiairs ; and who , of course , govern what most nearly relates to man ? Thus they have a decided influence on the happiness or unhappiness of those who are connected with them . A judicious , industrious , religious woman is the soul of her family . Men , who exercise authority in public , can not by their deliberations aflfect the general good , if women do not aid them . The occupations of women are not less important to the public than those of men ; they have families to govern , husbands to make happy , and children to educate . It is ignorance which renders women frivolous . When they have arrived at a certain age , without habits of application , they can not acquire a taste for it ; whatever is serious appears to them sad ; whatever demands continued attention fatigues them . The inclination for amusement , which is strong in youth , and the example of persons of the same age , who are devoted to pleasure , have inspired them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early age , they want that experience and authority that would make them useful at home . They do not understand the importance of domestic occupations , unless their mothers have taken pains to instruct them . In this state of uselessness , a girl abandons herself to indolence , which is a languor of the soul , an inexhaustible source of ennui . She accustoms herself to sleep a third more than is necessary for the preservation of health ; too much sleep enfeebles her , renders her delicate ; whereas moderate sleep , accompanied by regular exercise , would produce gaiety and strength . ON THE BBUCATIOK OF eiRLSk 13$ HMnamg the true perfection of the hod/ , to say aothing of it influence on the mind . Idleness and weakness thus being united to ignorance , there arises froia this union a pernicious taste for amusements . Girls brought up in this idle way have an ill regulated imagination . Their curiosity , not being directed to substantial things , is turned towards vain and danger ous objects . They read books - which nourish theit vanity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures . Thr minds become visionary ; they accustom themselves to the extravagant language of the heroines of romance , imd are spoiled for common life . To remedy all these evils , it is necessary to begin the education of girls with their earliest infancy . At that tender age , when they are left to the care of weak and often of unprincipled women , the deepest impressions are sometimes made ; impressions , which have an in* fluence during life . Before children can speak , we may instruct them . They are learning a language which they will soon speak with more ' correctness , than scholars acquire in the use of languages which they have studied , at a more mature age . For what is learning a language ? It is not merely crowding the memory with words ; it is observing the sense of each particular word . The child , in the midst of its crjes and plays , notices of what object each word is the sign . It makes this observation sometimes in considering the natural movements of bodies which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children have an admirable %cility to receive impressions from images . Thus you may give them , by the assis* /z/ tance of tones and gestures , an inclination to be with honest and virtuous persons ; and by the different expressions of the countenance and the tone of the voice , inspire a dread of those whom they have seen angry . I speak of these little things as important , for there can be no doubt that deep impressions can thus be made on the minds of children . It is desirable that instruction should not be forced on children ; that everything should be avoided that tends to excite the passions ; that they should gently be deprived of whatever they desire with too much ardor . If the disposition of a child is good , we may thus render it docile , patient , firm , gay , and tranquil ; whereas , if this early period is neglected , it will become impetuous and irritable through life . Its habits are forming ; and its soul , which has no bias towards any particular object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , when reason is developing itself , every word we say should tend to inspire a love of truth , and a contempt for every kind of dissimulation . We should never coax children ; if we do , we teach them to disguise the truth , and they never forget it . We must lead them by reason as much as possible . They observe everything . We must accustom them to speak little . The pleasure we derive from playfal children often spoils them . We teach them to say everything that comes into their minds ; to speak of things , of which they have no distinct idea . This habit of judging with precipitation , of speaking of things without understanding them , remains during the rest of their lives , Bn &; forms a very defective order of mind . /q/ We must take care of children , without letting them percei*/e that we think of them ; let them see , that it is your love and their helplessness , that makes you attend to them , and not their merits . Content yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can advance the mind of a child very far , without forcing it , you ought to fear to do it ; for the danger of vanity and presumption always outweighs the advantage of that premature education , which makes so much noise . We must content ourselves with following and aiding nature . Children , being ignorant , have many questions to ask ; we must an- swer them correctly , and sometimes add little comparisons , in order to illustrate our meaning . If they judge of anything , without understanding it well , we must try them by difficult questions , in order to make them feel their ignorance , without discouraging them ; and at the same time we must make them perceive , not by vague praises , but by some decided mark of esteem , that we approve of them , if , when they are in doubt , they ask an explanation of what they do not understand , and then decide after reflection . In this manner we may gently teach them to be truly modest . From the time that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against presumption . You see , you will say , that you are better able to exercise your reason now , than you were last year ; in a year more , you will know things which you are not capable of understanding now . If last year you had attempted to judge of things which you know now , but of which you were then ignorant , you would not have judged correctly . We commit a great error /z/ when we pretend to know what is beyond our com prehension . The curiosity of children is an inclination of nature , which anticipates instruction . We must not fail to profit by it . For example , in the country they see a mill , and they wish to know what it is ; we must show them how it is that corn is thus prepared for man . They perceive reapers ; we must explain to them what they do ; how corn is sowed and multiplied in the earth . If you are in the city , surrounded by shops where several arts are exercised , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be iro* patient at their questions ; they are so many openings that nature offers you to facilitate instruction . Listen to them with pleasure ; by this means you will insensibly teach them how all those things are made , which man uses . Thus , gradually , without a particular study , they will learn the best manner of doing things , and the just value of each . Such knowledge should not be despised , since every one ought to be secure against imposition in his expenses . I think it is desirable to use indirect teaching , to awaken the attention of children . Let us mingle instruction with their plays ; let Wisdom show herself to them , but at intervals , and with a smiling face . Beware of fatiguing them by ill-judged exactness . If virtue offer itself to a child under a melancholy and constrained aspect , if liberty and license present themselves under an agreeable form , all is lost , your labor is in vain . Never permit a child to be flattered by its attendants ; we adopt the manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure they find in the /z/ /q/ society of ill-bred people , gradually induces them to tolerate what they should despise . In order to render good men agreeable to children , - we should lead them to remark what is amiable in them , their sincerity , modesty , fidelity , and discretion , but above all , their piety , which is the source of all the rest . If they have anything in their manners unpleasant , say to them , Piety does not produce faults ; when it is perfect , it cures them . But after all we must not obstinately endeavour to make them like good people , whose manners are disagreeable . It is important for teachers to know their own faults ; ask your friends to point them out to you . Children are very nice observers , and they will often perceive your slightest defects . In general , those who govern children forgive nothing in them , but everything in themselves . This excites in children a spirit of criticism and malignity , so that when they discover a fault they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not be afraid of speaking of faults which you have committed before a child . If you see it capable of reasoning on the subject , say , that you wish to set it the example of correcting its faults , by correcting your own ; your imperfections will thus be the means of instructing and benefiting your child , and you will avoid the contempt you would otherwise awaken . At the same time , you will seek every means to render agreeable all that you exact . If you have anything tiresome to propose , show its utility . We must always present to children the attainment of an agreeable or useful object , ' and never attempt to govern them by harsh and absolute authority . As /z/ their reason strengthens , we should reason with them . An austere and imperious air must be avoided , except in cases of extreme necessity , for children are generally timid and bashful . Make them love you ; let them be free with you ; let them not hide their from you ; be indulgent to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their failings ; b.ut , on the contrary , pity their weaknesses . It is true , that this treatment will impose less the restraint of fear , but it will produce confidence and sincerity . We must always commence with a conduct open , gay , and familiar , without trifliug . By this means we learn to understand children , and know their real characters ; whereas if we subject them to obedience merely to authority , we govern by fatiguing forms , we produce a disgust of virtue , the love of which it should be our first object to inspire in them . A child* of lively imagination dislikes virtue and study , be cause it dislikes the person who speaks to it of them ; and this severe education makes it retain through lif painful idefis of religion . We must often tolerate things which we wish to correct , and wait for the moment when the mind of the child will be in a state to profit by instruction . Never correct it in anger ; if you do , it will be perceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best moment to correct it . Do not tell it of its fault , without leaving it the hope of improvement . We ought to consider that children are weak ; that their age renders them extremely sensible to pleasure ; and that we have no right to require from them more than they can give . When we speak to them of words and things that they do not ON THE EDUCATION OF GiRLS . " 139 understand , we often leave a dangerous impreBsioa of ennui and sadness on their minds . Though we can not , at all times , avoid employing fear in the government of unruly children , we must never have recourse to it , until we have tried every other method . We should always make children understand why we make use of fear ; for joy and confidence ought to . he habitually cherished in there , otherwise their minds will become dull , and thus will lose courage . If they are gay , they will be irritated ; if timid , they will be rendered stupid . Like all- violent remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we punish them , the suffering should be as slight as possible , but accompanied by every circumstance which can inspire the child with shame and remorse . Show it how gladly you would have avoided coming to this extremity ; show that you suffer also ; speak before the child to others of the misfortune of being so deficient in reason and sensibility as to require chastisement . Omit your accustomed marks of affection , until you sec that the child requires consolation ; make its punishment public or private , as you shall judge will be most salutary . We ought to adapt general rules to particular circumstances . Neither men nor children always resemble themselves . What is good to-day is dangerous to-morrow . A plan of conduct that never varies , can not be useful . Forms should be used as little as possible , in their lessons . We may impart instruction more useful than their lessons convey , by our conversation . I have known several children , who have learned to read as a play ; , amusing stories have beea /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after this , they have heen anxious themselves to go to the source whence they have derived so much pleasure . The greatest defect of common education is , that we are in the habit of putting pleasure all on one side , and weariness on the other ; all weariness in study , all pleasure in idleness . Let us try to change this association ; let us render study agreeable ; let us present it under the aspect of liberty and pleasure ; let us sometimes permit study to be interrupted by little sallies of gaiety . These interruptions are necessary to relax the mind . We must acknowledge , that of all the difficulties in education , none are comparable to that of educating children who are deficient in sensibility . Children of lively sensibility are liable to terrible faults ; passion and presumption lead them astray ; but they possess great resources , and often return from afar . Instruction is in them a hidden germ , which springs up and yields fruit , when experience comes to the assistance of reason . At all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make them interested in our instructions . We can stimulate them by a principle of honor . Whereas on indolent minds we have no hold . All their thoughts are wandering ; they are never where they ought to be . We can not touch them to the quick , even by correction ; they hear all , and they feel nothing . The best education will be thrown away , if we do not begin at an early age to remedy this evil . It is necessary to observe , that in some children live are very much deceived at first . They appear /q/ charming , because the early graces of infancy throw a lustre over all their conduct . Every trait of intelligence that we see in them , surprises us , because we did not expect it at that age ; every fault of judgment is permitted , and in oar eyes has the charm of ingenuousness ; we mistake animal spirits for intelligence . Hence it is that promising children , who are celebrated at five years of age , fall into neglect and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children , reason is the only one on which we can depend ; if we cultivate it carefully , it always grows with them . The graces of childhood pass away ; vivacity vanishes ; even tenderness of heart is often lost ; for the passions and the society of men insensibly harden the young , in their intercourse with the world . Try then to discover , through the graces of childhood , whether the character you have to form be wanting in curiosity , and insensible to virtuous ambition . In this case it is almost impossible for those who have the care of the child , not to be disheartened by a labor that affords so little interest . We must hasten to touch all the springs of the soul , that we may awaken it from this slumber . Be careful not to fatigue it , nor to overload its memory ; endeavour to animate it ; do not fear to show it all of which it is capable . Be contented with little progress ; notice its slightest success ; excite its ambition ; let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lead the child to laugh freely with you , at its timidity ; point out those , whose natural character is as timid as its own , but who have conquered their temperament ; teach it , by direct instruction , that timidity and idle- /z/ nesB paralyze the intellect , that men who have these faults , whatever talents they possess , are imbecile , and degrade themselves . But be careful not to give these instructions in an austere and impatient tone ; for nothing sends the feelings back to the heart of a timid child like harshness . On the contrary , redouble your efforts to awaken the necessary zeal , by pleasures suited to its age and character . We must endeavour to give to children of this class a taste for improvement ; we must let them pursue whatever may cure them of their disgust to study , must permit some infringement of rules , taking care that they do not go to excess . It is more difficult to create taste in those who have none , than to regulate an incorrect taste . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of friendship . From the time a child is capable of affection , it is desirable to turn its heart towards those persons who do it good . By its affections wc can lead it to do whatever we wish ; we have a certain influence over it ; if we know how to use it , we have only to fear for the choice it makes of its friends . There is another class of children , who are naturally indifferent , reserved , and calculating . They deceive their parents , they only pretend to love them , they study their inclinations in order to conform to them ; they appear more docile than other children of the same age , who act without disguise , according to their humor ; their docility , which is a concealed selfishness , appears to be genuine , and their dissimulation is not discovered until it is too late to correct it . If there is- any fault of a child which education can /q/ not cure , it is without doubt this ; and yet it is much more common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve to believe that their children want feeling ; and as no one dares to tell them of it , the evil increases . The chief remedy , is , to permit children from the earliest age , to discover their inclina- ' tions , that we may know what they are ; they are naturally simple and confiding , but the slightest restraint will be likely to inspire them with a wish to disguise , and they will never recover their simplicity . It is true that God alone gives goodness and tenderness of heart ; we can only try to excite it by generous examples , by liberal sentiments , by disinterestedness , and by disapprobation of those who love themselves too well . Before children have lost their native ingenuousness , we must make them taste the pleasure of cordial and reciprocal friendship ; those who surround them , therefore , should be amiable , sincere , frank , and disinterested ; the persons who have the care of them had better have other faults , than be at all wanting in these virtues . Parents should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ; it is from their parents that children often learn to love self . We must also , in their presence , * avoid all feigned demonstrations of friendship , that are often substituted for a love that ought to be real . But we more frequently see children enthusiastic than indiflferent . They never see two persons disagree , without taking a lively interest on one or the other side ; they are always full of affections and aversions without foundation ; they see no fault in those they /z/ like , no good in those they dislike . We must gradually teach them that we are acquainted with all the good qualities of the persons they love , and all faults there are in those they dislike . Do not press the matter ; they will gradually see the truth . Then lead them to think of their own mistakes , and show them how unreasonable they are disposed to be . late to ( hem errors like these , that have happened in your own youth ; above all , point out to them the mix* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in human nature , to check the extravagance of their friendships , , and the violence of their aversions . Never promise children , as a reward for their good conduct , either dress , or sweet-meats ; by doing this you create in them two faults ; in the first place , you teach them to estimate highly what they ought to despise ; and in the second , you deprive yourself of the means of establishing recompenses , which facilitate your labor . Be cautious how you ever force them to study . You must have as few rules as possible , and for those few , you must have a good reason . Though we should fear to excite the vanity of children by flattery , judicious praise is very necessary . St Paul often employed it to encourage the weak . We may also recompense children by innocent plays , by walks , conversation , little presents of pictures , or geographical charts . Children are extremely fond of stories ; we see them transported with joy , or shedding tears , at their recital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the serious intention of the author ; when you have related one fable , wait until the child /q/ msks for another ; when their curiosity is excited , r count certain select passages of history ; leave off in an interesting part ; postpone the rest for the next day , leaving them impatient to hear the end ; animate your recital by a familiar tone of voice ; make your characters speak for themselves . This delights a child ) particulariy if he considers it as a reward . If the child has facility of language , he will , of his own accord , wish to repeat it to another person ; you can choose one of his attendants who will be anxious to hear the story ; he will delight to tell it ; do not appear to re* mark his mistakes , but when he has repeated several , give him some general advice upon the manner of relating a story , which is , to render it simple , short , and correct , by a choice of circumstances which shall best represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for Sacred History , rather than any other ; not by telling them that it is more interesting , but by making them feel that it is so . Lead them to remark the important events that are to be found in it , such as the Creation , the Deluge , the sacrifice of Isaac , the birth and flight of Moses . By this means , we shall not only awaken the curiosity of children , but we shall lay the foundation of religious knowledge , which consists of a tissue of wonderful facts . Recount to them , in detail , the history of Jesus Christ ; select the most striking parts of the Gospel , his preaching in the temple at twelve years of age , his retreat to the desert , his temptation , the multiplication of bread , Lazarus resuscitated , the entrance into Jerusalem ; describe his death , and his rising from the tomb . All these events , man- /z/ ed with tocretioni will fill the imaguiatieB ftod Ji fectionate heart of a childy with lively imagea of all the reaiarkahle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , ; it will aee the hand of God forever raised to confound the impious and protect the just . But we must select , amoof these histories , on* ly fluch as afford pleasing or nuignificent images , so aa to render religion heautiful , lovely , and sttblime . We should never laugh aA anything which is in tmf way associated with reljgioa , before children . We Bometimes indulge ourselves in ridiculing the devo tion of a simple mind , but we comnit a great fault in ao doing . We should speak of God with seriousness asid reverence , and never trifle upon sacred subjecta . In matters of propriety , we must foe careful before children . As women are in danger of superstition , we anust 4ry to enlighten and strengthen their minds . We mint accustom them not to admit things without authoritjr . Nothing is so painfiil as to see people of intellect and piety , shudder at the thoughts of death ; a woman ought to know how to resist weak fears , to be fimia danger , and to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a coward ; the soul of Christianity , if we BUiy 80 call it , lies in the disregard of this life , and the love of . another . There are several faults which are common to girk brought up in* indolence and timidity ; they are inca- pable of a firm and steady conduct ; there is a good deal of affectation in those ill-founded alurms , and those tears that they shed so easily . We must begin by treating them with indifference ; we mfst repi /z/ too tendec love , little flatteries , and complimentfl . We muBt teach them to speak in a concise manner . Gennine good taste consists in saying much in a fyw. words , in choosing among owt thoughts , in having some order and arrangement in what we relate , in speaking with composure ; whereas , women in general are enthusiastic in their language . Little can be expected from a woman , who does not know how to express her thoughts with correctness and how to be silent . Girls are timid and foil of fklse shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , we must lead them to discover their thoughts without disguise ; when they are tired , to say to ; and not oblige them to appear to enjoy books , or society , while fatigued by them . When they have unfortunately acquired the habit of disguising their feelings , we must show them by examples , that it is possible to be discreet and prudent , without being deceitful ; and tell them that prudence consists in saying little , and distrusting ourselves more than others , not in dissembling speeches . Simplicity and truth excite more confidence , and succeed better , even in this world , than dissimulation . What is there more delightful than to be sincere , tranquil , in harmony with our conscience , having nothing to fear and nothing to pretend ; whereas she who dissembles is always agitated , and under the necessity of hiding one deception by a hundred others , and yet , with all these efforts , she never fails to be discovered ; sooner or later , she passes for what she is . If the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so respecting the whole life . Truth /z/ always out al some place ; thej are often dupes even of those thej wish to deceive , for people pretend to believe them , and thej think themselves esteemed when they are despised ; at least they can not prevent suspicions , and what can be more painful to a wise self-icwe , than to inspire doubt and distrust . Teach girls to say but little , and that little according to the occasion and the person they address ; let them be reminded that finesse always belongs to a mean heart and a weak mind ; people are artful because they have something to conceal , and do not dare to appear what they are . Take notice of the evil of certain little artifices that are committed , and the contempt which falls upon those who are guilty of them . From time to time deprive them of what they have gained by art , and tell them they shall have whatever they want when they ask for it openly . Pity their little infirmities , in order to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous of all defects , and the first to be corrected , for it will render all others incurable . Guard children against the subtlety that leads another into a deception , while they appear not to have been the cause of the deceit themselves ; teach them that there is more baseness in such refinements , than in common art ; say to a child that God is truth itself , that it is tri6iog with God to trifle with truth , and that he has given us language to be used in speaking with precision and simplicity , that we may say notlRhg but what is just and true . We must , above all things , avoid praising children when they discover art in trifling ; far from appearing to think such things pretty /q/ aaamnsing , we should correct 4heni severely . When we praise childieafo ) * such faults , we teach them that to deceive , is to he ingenious .

It is - nevertheless from ignorance that the science of economy is despised . The polished Greeks and Romans ' tocc care to instruct themselves in this art . That mind is of a low . order , which canonly speak /z/ well , and can not act well ; we often meet with woraes who utter wise maxims , yet , nevertheless , are very frivolous in their conduct . It is well to accustom girls from their childfaood to have the care of something ; to make out accounts , to understand the value of things , and their uses ; hut we must be careful not to let economy lead to avarice . A reasonable mind desires , ' by a frugal and industrious life , to avoid the shame and injustice that is produced by extravagance . We ought to retrench in superfluous expenses , only that we may have more to bestow in charity and friendship ; it is good order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to represent the foolish economy of those women who save a lamp , while they are careless in their general expenses . Attend as much to neatness as you do to economy . Accustom girls never to suffer anything about them to be unclean or in disorder ; lead them to notice the slightest derangement in a house ; say to them that nothing contributes more to economy and neatness , than keeping things in their proper place . This may seem trifling , yet it leads to very important consequences . For then when anything is wanted , there will be no difficulty in finding it ; and when it is done with , it will be returned to the place it was taken from . This exact order forms the most essential part of neatness ; for instance , a dish will not be soiled or broken , if it is put in its proper place as soon as it has been used ; the carefulness which makes us place things in order , makes us keep them clean . Joined to all these advantages , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , by obliging them to place things in order , and keep them clean . /q/ At the same time we must avoid fastidioasness ; neatness , when it is moderate , is a virtue ; but when it is carried to an extreme , it narrows the mind . Teach children that it is a weakness to be troubled because a dish is not properly seasoned , or a chair is put in the wrong place . This fastidiousness , if it be not repressed , becomes one of the most dangerous faidts ; common folks are disagreeable and wearisome to them . We should teach them early that we are not to judge of any one merely by his manners ; and point out to them people whose manners are unpleasant , but who , nevertheless , having a good heart and a correct mind , are a thousand times more estimable than they , who , under an accomplished address conceal a bad heart , capable of all kinds of baseness and dissimulation . Say to them , that those who are apt to feel a disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from whose conversation we may not draw some good , and though we should choose the best when we have the freedom of choice , yet we may be consoled when we have not ; we may lead people to speak of those subjects with which theyare acquainted , and thus derive some instruction from the most ignorant . The science of teaching others to serve us , is not a slight one ; we must choose servants who have principle and religion ; we must understand their different duties , the time and the labor which ought to be given to each thing ; the manner of doing it well , and what is necessary to do it with . For instance , you might blame a servant for not having cooked a dish sooner than it was possible to do it ; or you would be in danger /z/ of being ckeMed fby your- eorvonl from your ignorance of the quantity necessary , to use in doing a. things We . must Iqarn to underirtand . thoi temper , and to manage the minds of : ' our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have authority , fbn.the lessu reasonable menace , so much the meire necessary is it that fear should restxaii them ; but we must remember tha ( they are our brethren ; in Jesus Christy* ajsd thai iwbh should n use authority untB persuasion i has ' . failedc to mftke your servants love youy withoutbeing , familiar with jthem ; do ntot enter intoiconversar tiouriwith them , but speak ito them sympathy. - ail iolRction of ( their wanis ) lettthem.beijcertain your advice and your , compussion ; do ; not them Kaffshly for theic.faults ; do not appear . ofibndedo or astonished at themy while , there as any hope , that : they can be . corrected speak to them with . gentleness and with reason . submit to some neglects of service , in order to convince them that yen do not ffiod fauh : from impatience , or temper .

With respect to dress , we must endeavoor to inspire girls with moderation . True wisdom consists in our never displaying in our dress , or our equipage , anything remarkable ; let there be nothing in their dress like affectation .

His kingdom is within us . Teach her to confess her faults to God , to represent her wants to him , and to acquire the habit of acting always as in his presence , and of being animated in the performance of duty by the spirit of love , and to place ail her confidence in Him . /z/ These letters are numbered merely for conyenience ; the sub jectfl will enable any one who wishes to refer to to fini them ill ' the original. fkom the " spiritual letters .

Christian perfection , that people have a sort of dread of , from the idea that it imposes gloom and constraint , is not perfection , but inasmuch as it increases benevolence . We do not consider it constraint to do those things which we love to do . We find a pleasure in sacrificing ourselves to any one that we truly love .

Oh ! how kind and faithful a friend will Grod be to those , who enter into a sincere and constant friendship with him ! The most important thing , if you really wish to be a raligious man , is to distrust yourself , after so many proo &; of your weakness , and to renounce immediately those companions that might lead you from the right path . If you wish to love God , why should you wish to pass your life in friendship with those who do not love him , and who slight his love ? Why are you not satisfied with the society of those who will confirai and strengthen your love for him ? I do not wish that you should break off entirely your connexions with all those persons with whom politeness requires you to associate , and still less do I wish you to neglect any of the duties of your station . But I refer to those connexions that are voluntary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best resolutions ; intimacies with the vain and foolish , and the company of those who despise piety and tempt you to a dangerous dissipation . These things are dangerous for the most confirmed in virtue , and of course still more pernicious for those who have taken only the first steps in the right path , from which it is so natural for them to turn aside .

We begin to hesitate , to deliberate , and to find subtile doubts upon the simplest and clearest things ; we are even ashamed of being grateful to him and we dare not let the world se that we are willing to serve him . In a word , we are as timid , as irresolute , and as scrupulous in the cause of virtue , as we are unhesitating , bold , and decided in that of vice . I ask but one thing of you , which is , to follow in simplicity , the bent of your own mind for goodness , as you have formerly followed your earthly passions in the pursuit of evil . Whenever you examine the proofs of our religion , you will find that no solid arguments can be opposed to it ; and that those who contend against it , only do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they refuse to obey God , that they may be devoted to self .

To become too humble , too much detached from self , too pure , too just , too reasonable , too grateful to your Father in heaven ? Oh ! fear nothing so much as this unjust fear , and this foolish wisdom of the world , which deliberates between God and self , between virtue ' and vice , between gratitude and ingratitude , between life and death .

He has kindled a flame in the bottom of our hearts , that should ever burn like a 1anp for Him who lighted it ; and all other - life is like death . We ought then to love . But what shall we love ? That which we can not love sincerely , that which is not lovely , that which vanishes as we would grasp it ? What shall we love in the world ? Men , who are as great hypocrites in honesty as they accuse religious men of being in devotion ; an honorable name , that perhaps we can not keep , and that would not satisfy our hearts if we could ; the esteem of ignorant persons , whom we perhaps individually despise ? What i/ill you love ? This mortal body , which debases your mind , and subjects /q/ your heart to tU pains of its own diseases and to death ? What will you do then ? Will jou not love anything ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not love God , who desires that you should love him , and who wishes you to give yourself to him that he may restore you to himself ? Do you fear , with this treasure , that you can want anjrthing ? Can you think that the Infinite Creator can not fill and satisfy your soul ? Distrust yourself and all created beings ; they are all nothing , and can not satisfy the heart of man , that was made for the love of God . But never doubt Him who is the sole good , and who mercifully fills your heart with dissatisfaction towards all other things , that it may be constrained to return to him . /z/ Although I have not heard from you , I can not forget you nor relinquish the privilege you have given me . Suffer me , then , I beg you , to represent to you how culpable you will be , if you resist the truths and the strong feelings that Grod has awakened in your heart . It would be resisting his Holy Spirit . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you happy , nr the illusive nature of its flatteries . You acknowledge the rights of the Creator over the creature , and how much /z/ more inexcusable is ingratitude to him than to man . You recognise the truth , that there is a God , in the wisdom that shines in all his works , and in the virtues with which he inspires those who love him . What can you oppose to such touching truths ? Is it not a real indocility of heart which produces this irresolution ? We are afraid of the yoke ; this is the true leaven of unbelief We try to persuade ourselves that we do not believe enough , and that , being in this state of doubt , we can not take any steps in a religious life , but with precaution , and as if there were danger of soon retracting . What have you in reality to oppose to the truths of religion ? Nothing but a fear of constraint , and of being obliged to lead a serious life ; a fear of being led farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because you see the sacrifices that it demands , that you are afraid of religion . But permit me to say that you know not all its delights . You perceive what it deprives you of , but you do not see what it bestows . You exaggerate its sacrifices , without looking at its consolations . It leaves no void in the heart . If it constrain your inclinations , the love with which it will inspire you , will give you a relish for truth and virtue , far superior to all your ill regulated tastes . What do you expect from it ? that it will perform a miracle to convert you ? Even a miracle could not take from you this irresolution of self-love that fears a sacrifice . What will you gain by reasonings without end , while your conscience declares the right that God has over you ? Arguments will not cure the wound in your heart ; you do not reason for the sake of conviction and /q/ action , but that you may find doubts , that you may find excuses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you to yourself , as a punishment for so long a resistance . But he loves you more than you know how to love yourself ; he follows you with his mercy , , he troubles your heart to subdue it ; yield yourself to him , and finish this dangerous irresolution . This hesitation between two courses is in fact a choice ; it is the secret , lurking desire of the heart in the illusion of self-love , fearing to yield itself up , and ready to fly from the restraints that religion imposes . Pardon the liberties I take , but I can not moderate the zeal with which your confidence has inspired me. /z/ 1 HAVE given my attention to the difficulty you state , of discriminating between the operations of the spirit of God , and our own natural understanding . We can not have a precise and certain rule upon this subject within us . We only have an exterior guide for our actions , which is conformity to the precepts , counsels , and graces of Christianity . If we had , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Divine influence from the operation of our natural powers , we should then be endowed with a sort of 164 UtTTEBS. sanctky and inftlUbility , that woald amount to inspiration . This is exactly opposed'to the uncertainty of faith and to a state of pilgrimage . We ought not to seek what our present condition does not permit us to obtain ; I mean a certain rule to decide when we are moved by a Divine influence , and when it is our nature , which may imitate it . On the other hand , it is of the utmost importance in our conduct , as a protection against illusion , to dis cern this difference , and to have a certain rule for judging . Wo must , it is said , obey the Divine influence ; not to do it , is to resist ( xod , is to constrain the Holy Spirit , is to turn away from that perfection to which we are called . But how shall we follow this Divine guide if we have no certain rule by which to distinguish it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject , leaves us in continual danger of acting contrarily to what we reaUy desire ; of being influenced by natural inclination , when we desire to be guided by the spirit of Grod . This is the difficulty ; let us seek the remedy . These doubts can never relate , as I have before observed , to those things that are forbidden by the precepts , the commands , the charities of our religion . This holy influence n*bt only can never lead us to violate the direct instructions , but can never teach us to neglect any of the minor duties recommended in the Gospel . Thus we see that there is no question about an entire purity and perfection of manners in the case . The question must be , between two right actions , to know which is the prompting of this inward teacher . /q/ It is true , that in tlus choice , we have no certain ity of internal evidence . We have only external rules pf christian prudence to enable us to judge by car* cumstances , and to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within us any certain rule to discern whether a decided preference for one right action , over another , is from a Divine influence or from our crwn nature . And it would not suit our condition here to have this certainty ; it is the will of God that we shall remain in this uncertainty , and that we shall not be able to distinguish between them . It is neces* sary/tben , that this Divine influence be adapted to our CMiditiim , and that it should operate always without our consciousness . The duiger of illusion as to venial acts , is not asr tonishing in a state in which we are liable to far more perilous mistakes , which lead us to take the motions of setf-love , that are the death of the soul , for itstrue fe . MThat shall we do in this state of darlmess ? All that depends upon us to do , and with this be satisfied . Fidelity in duty , united to peaceful trust , in such a etate of uncertainty , is the greatest self-sacriflce to those spirits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that notwithstanding the obscurity that rests upon this pilgrimage , there are appearances , though without absolute certainty , that serve to cherish in the heart an humble confidence , that the spirit of God guides it . There are gleams of this light in the darkness - of the most uncertain faith , making.it visible occasionally , that we are led on to perfection by the Divine love . God mingles light and darkness /z/ qwq and in the preseace of God , do all we cam to die to ourselres and to pleue him . But we musfguard against useless scruples , against a mental constraint , and an anxietj to be assured that we peTfomi all our actions under the influence of the spirit of Crod . We may extinguish this light in the endeavour to ascertain that we are following it . We may return , under a pretext of safety , into all the windings of that self-love that we pretend to avoid . We are in danger of losing the reality of this influence in our effort to obtain a certainty with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should possess . Thus we might pass our lives in reasoning upon the operation of the spirit of God , without daring to yield ourselves up to its influence . Were I to propose anything personal and peculiar to yourself ) my good Buke , it would be to remind you that the bent of your mind , and the temptation to illusion in you , arise , not ftom any gross disorders , but trom the intemperance of wisdoHl and the excess of reasoning . Even wisdom ought to be sober and ' temperalf . Sobriety and aimplicity of mind are the same thing . The practice of true love to God dissipates doubts , and disgusts us with speculative reasonings. /z/ It is . Madam , but a and consolation , to say to you that I feel your sorrow . This , however , is all that human weakness can do ; and when we woulddo more we must turn to God . It is to Him that I go , the consoler of the afflicted , the protectoa of the weak . I pray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you , but that he may make it a blessing to you ; that he may give you strength to support it , and that he may not let you sink under it . These great sorrows are the remedies for the diseases of our minds . It is through great suffering that the mystery of Christianity is accomplished , I mean the crucifixion of self . It is then that the grace of Grod is unfolded to us , and that we understand its intimate operation upon us , and that we are taught to sacrifice self . We must turn our thoughts away from ourselves , before we can give them to God ; and that we may be constrained to do this , it is necessary that our hearts be so deeply wounded , that all created things be turned into bitterness to us . Thus touched in the tenderest part , troubled in its sweetest and purest affections , the heart feels that it can not support itself , and escapes from its weakness and goes to God . These , Madam , are violent remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true support of the Christian in affliction . God lays his hand upon LSTTERS. l two beings united in a holy affection . He confers a blessing upon both ; he places one in glory , and makes his removal the means of salviation to the one that remains . This is what God has done for you . May his Holy Spirit awaken all your faith , that you may penetrate these truths . I will pray for it continually ; and as I have much faith in the prayers of the afflicted , I beg of you to remember me in your prayers . Your charity will teach you what I have need of , and will give earnestness to your petitions . /z/ God has taken what was his own ; has he not done right ? It was time that F rested from all his sufferings ; they were great , and he thought little of them himself ; his only inquiry was concerning the will of Him in whose hands he was . Crosses are of no use to us , but inasmuch as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget yourself , then , my friend ; otherwise this sorrow will not be a blessing to you . God does not make us suffer for the sake of suffering , but to teach us to forget ourselves- in that state , in which this self-fbrgetfulness is the most difficult , a state of great sorrow .

There is nothing brilliant , nothing grand , nothing striking in the eyes of others , and still less in their own eyes , in this . If you tell them that they have suffered nobly , they will not understand you . They do not know themselves bow all this comes to pass ; they scarcely know what is in their own hearts , and do not seek to know . If they endeavoured to know , they would lose something of their simplicity . This is what we call perfect good will , that makes less show , but is far greater than what is called courage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , the purer it is ; and it is its purity that makes it transparent . This good will , which is only a love of the will of God , becomes , upon every occasion , just what it should be , that it may conform itself to him .

They are patient with themselves , and only insist upon those things that may be accomplished under present circumstances . They are not discouraged because they can not be perfect in one day .

A life of faith produces two things . First , it enables us to see in everything . Secondly , it holds the mind in a state of readiness for whatever- may be his will . We must trust to God for whatever depends upon him , and only think of being faithful ourselves in the performance of our duties . This continual , unceasing dependence , this state of entire peace and acquiescence of the soul in whatever may happen , is the true , silent martyrdom of self It is so slow , and gradual , and internal , that they who experience it , are hardly conscious of it .

I ACKNOWLEDGE that I am glad to see you oppressed with a sense of your defects and your inability to correct them . This despair of nature that leads us to trust only in God , is what he himself wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need . It is true that you have a hasty and severe disposition , and a fretful character , that is too sensitive to the faults of others , and that renders it difficult to efface impressions which you receive . But it is not your natural temperament that God condemns ; for this you have not chosen , and are not able to change . It may be the means of your salvation , if you bear it rightly as a trial . But what God requires of you , is , that you actually perform those duties for which his grace gives you ability . What is required , fe , if you can not be gentle in your exterior , to be humble in your heart ; to restrain your natural haughtiness a &; soon as you perceive it ; to repair the evil you have done , by your humility . The duty you are called to practise , is a real , genuine lowliness of heart upon all occasions , a sincere renunciation of self . It is not surprising that the high opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , has insensibly encouraged in you a secret confidence in yourself , and a hauteur of which you are not aware . /z/ The hasty expresRions into which your temper sometimes betrajs you , may perhaps reveal to you the haughtiness , that , without this natural frankness , you would not discover . But the source of the evil is within ; it is this high opinion of yourself , that has lain hidden so long under some specious name . Be then as humble in the contemplation of your own defects , as you have been elevated by your office in judging the defects of others . Accustom yourself to see others neglect your opinion , and give up judging them . At least if you say anything , let it be said in simplicity , not to decide or correct , but merely to propose a question and to seek for information . In a word , the object is to place yourself upon a level with the lowest and most imperfect ; to encourage in them a freedom , which must make it easy for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to bestow upon them , let it be consolation and support rather than correction . /z/ WK MUST ENDURE THK FAULTS OF OTHERS , AlfD BE WILI. - IlfG OURSELVES TO RECEIVE BLAME . It appears to me that your heart wants enlargement with regard to the faults of others . I grant that you can not help seeing them when they are presented to your notice , and can not avoid the opinions produced in your mind by the principles on which some people /q/ apparently proceed . You can not even avoid a degree of pain which these things must occasion . It is enough if you are willing to bear with some faults , form no judgment in doubtful cases , and do not cherish that degree of pain that would separate you from those who are imperfect . Perfection easily supports the imperfections of others . It makes itself all things to all . We must familiarize ourselves to the greatest defects of good men , and quietly leave them till the time when Grod shall indicate the moment for undertaking their cure ; otherwise we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons must strive according to their strength for their own improvement , and we must bear with their weaknesses . You ought to remember from your own experience , how bitter is this correction ; , and this should lead you to soflen it to others . I ask of you with more earnestness than ever , that you will not spare me with regard to my faults . If your opinion of my defects gives me pain , this sensibility will prove that you have touched me in the tender part . Thus you will have done me a great good , in exercising my humility and accustoming me to be blamed . I ought to be more lowly in my mind , as I am more elevated from my situation , and as God demands of me a greater sacrifice of myself . I stand in need of this simplicity , and I hope it will strengthen the union between us. /z/ While we are so imperfect , we can understand onlj in part . The same self-love that causes our defects , injuriously hides them from ourselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . It finds some hiding-place , it places itself in some flattering light to soften its ugliness . Thus there is always some illusion in us , while we are so imperfect and have so much love of ourselves . Self-love must be uprooted , and the love of God take its place in our hearts , before we can see ourselves as we are . Then the same principle that enables us to see our imperfections will destroy them . When the light of truth has risen within us , then we see clearly what is there . Then we love ourselves without partiality , without flattery , as we love our neighbour . In the mean time , God spares us , by discovering our weakness to us , just in proportion as our strength to support the view of it increases . We discover our imperfections one by one as we are able to cure them . Without this merciful preparation , that adapts our strength to the light within , we should be in despair . They who correct others ought to watch the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patience , till we perceive his spirit reproaching them within . We must imitate him who gently reproves , /q/ 80 that thej feel that it is less God , than their own hearts , that condemns them . When we blame with impatience because we are displeased with the fault , it is a human censure , and not the disapprobation of God . It is a sensitive self-love that can not forgive the selflove of others . The more self-love we have , the more severe are out censures . There is nothing so vexa  - -  tious as the collisions between one excessive self-love , and another still more violent and sensitive . The passions of others are infinitely ridiculous to those who are under the dominion of their own . The ways of God are very different . He is ever full of kindness Ibr us , he gives us strength , he regards us with pity and condescension , he remembers our weakness , he waits for us . The less we love ourselves , the more considerate we are of others . We wait even years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the occasion , and grace to open their hearts to receive it . If you would gather the fruit before its time , you lose it entirely . Our imperfect friends can know us only imperfectly ; the same self-love that hides their defects , magnifies ours . They see in us what we can not see , and they are unacquainted with what we ourselves know . They are quick to discover what is disagreeable to them , but they do not perceive the defects that lie deep within , and that sully our virtues and displease Gcod alone . Thus their best judgments are superficial . My conclusion is , that we must listen to the voice of God in the silence of our souls , and pronounce for or against ourselves , whatever this pure light may /z/ reveal to us at the moment when we thus endeavour to know ourselves . We must often silently listen to this teacher within , who will make known all truth to us , and who , if we are faithful in attending to him , will often lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , which is the soul of our soul , it is a proof that self is silent , that it may listen to it . This voice is not a stranger there . God is in our souls , as our souls are in our bodies . It is something that we can not distinguish exactly , but it is what upholds and guides us . This is not a miraculous inspiration , which exposes us to illusion and fanaticism . It is only a profound peace of the soul , that yields itself up to the spirit of Grod , believing his revealed word , and practising his commands as declared in the Gospel . /z/ A LSTTEll or COIfSOLATlOir . I THINK much of you and your sufferings . God will send his consolations into the depths of your soul . The wound is terrible , but his hand is all-powerful to heal . It is only the senses and the imagination thai have lost their object . He whom we do not see , is more truly with us than he ever was . We shall meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him for many years , yet I have felt as if I conversed with him ; I have opened my heart to him , and believed /q/ that we have met in the presence of God ; and although I have wept bitterly at his death , I can not think that I have . lost him . Oh ! the reality of this intimate and invisible communion which the children of God enjoy ! I am anxious about your health ; when the heart is sick , the whole body suffers . I fear lest every object should awaken your grief . We must enter into the designs of G*od , and try to receive the comforts that he bestows . We shall soon find him whom we seem to have lost ; we approach him with rapid strides . Yet a little while , and we shall shed no more tears . We shall die ourselves . He whom we love lives , and will never die . This is what we believe ; if we believe it rightly , we shall feel in respect to our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to him when he rose to heaven . ** If you loved me , " said he , " you would rejoice ' ' in my glory . But we weep for ourselves . For a true friend of G*od , who has been faithful and humble , we can only rejoice at his happiness , and at the blessing that he has left upon those who belonged to him on earth . Let your grief , then , be soothed by the hand of Him who has afflicted you . /z/ . Your greatest danger is from effeminacy and love of pleasure . These two defects may put the soul in dreadful disorder , even where it has resolved to practise virtue , and feels a great horror of vice . Effeminacy is a languor of the mind , that paralyzes and destroys its better life ; it hides within it a treacherous flame that evil passions are ever ready to kindle and that will consume all before it . We must cherish , then , a manly , vigorous faith that , without even listening to this weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , or make any terms with it , we are lost . It injures iis as much in our connexion with the world as with God . An effeminate man devoted to amusements , will ever be a poor man , and if he ever gets into an important place , he will dishonor it . Such a one is not a man he is half a woman . A love of ease will lead him . away from his true interest . He can neither cultivate his talents , nor acquire the knowledge necessary for his profession , nor submit to the labor of a difficult office , nor endure the constraint that is necessary to please others , nor can he apply himself courageously to the correction of his faults . What shall such a man do ? He is good for nothing ; he is incapable of any good thing , but he may fall into great evils . Pleasure will betray him . It is /q/ not for nothing that the senses are flattered . Afler appearing indolent and insensible , they will become furious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till it can no longer be quelled . Even your religious sentiments , if they are mingled with this effeminate spirit , while they may lead you to a life of seriousness and exterior decency , will have nothing real in them . You think much of relinquish* ing the follies of youth ; religion is only a pretext for abandoning them . The truth is , that they are irksome to you . You have lost your relish for them , and it is a matter of taste with you , to lead a serious and sober life ; but this seriousness , I fear , is as vacant and as dangerous as the folly and gaiety of pleasure . A serious sensualist , whose passions reign amidst gloom and retirement , leads an obscure , cowardly , and corrupt life , at which the world , earthly-minded as it is , shudders with horror . You may quit the world , not for God , but to be devoted to your passions ; or at least for a life of indolence , which is offensive to God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the most depraved passions . You may relinquish great objects , to be absorbed with toys and amusements , so trifling that any but children should blush to regard them . Again , I repeat to you what I said at first , effeminacy enervates and contaminates all who yield to it . It takes from every virtue , and from every power of the soul , its strength and marrow , even in the opinion of the world . Its victims are weak and inefficient in everything . God rejects them , the world spurns them . Such a man is a nonentity , he is as if he were not . /z/ He is not a man . Fear this defect which will be the source of so many others . Pray , watch ; watch against yourself . Rouse yourself as you would rouse a man in a lethargy ' . Make your friends stimulate you and awaken you from sleep . Have recourse to the ordinances of religion . Do not forget that , in this instance , the rewards of the world and of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these kingdoms are to be taken by violence . /z/ ADVICE RELATIVE TO EXTERlfAL COITDrCT AND TO THE /z/ I AM not astonished at the disgust you feel at seeing so much that is opposed to the will of God ; it is the natural effect of your change of heart . You now enjoy a certain calm in which you may be entirely occupied with what is so interesting to you , and be freed from all that would again open the wounds of your heart . But this is not the will of God . Bear this cross then in peace , as an expiation of your offences , and wait till he shall liberate you from it . He will do it in his own time , and not in yours . In the mean time , set apart certain hours to think of God and your relation to him . You must read , pray , distrust your inclinations and habits ; remember that you carry the gift of God in an earthen vessel , and above all , let your soul be nourished with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hkn , do not fear to return to him with a humble and childlike love . Speak to him in your prayers of all your wretchedness , of all your wants , of all your sufferings ; aipe9k even of the disrelish you sometimes feel for hi* service . You can not speak too freely nor with too much confidence . He loves the simple and the lowly ; it is with them that he converses . If you are of this number , open your whole heart , and say all to him . After you have thus spoken to God , be silent and listen to him . Let your heart be in such a state of preparation , that his spirit may impress upon you such virtues as will please him . Let all within yon listen to bim . This silence of all outward and eavth* ly affections , and of human thoughts within ns'is essential , if we would hear this voice , that calls upon us to deny ourselves and to worship God in spirit and in truth . You have great helps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good books , you are acquainted with the true foundations of religion , and . with the weakness of all that is opposed to it . But all these means , which might conduct you to God , will finally arrest your progress , if you value too highly your own wisdom . - The best and highest use of your mind , is to learn to distrust yourself , to renounce your own will , and to submit to the will of God , to become as a little child . It is not of doing difficult things that I speak , but of performing the most common actions with your heart fixed on God , and as one who is accom ' plishing the end of his being . You will act as oth- 204 LfiTtERS. ers do , except that you will never sin . You will be a faithful friend , polite , attentive , complaisant , and cheerful , at those times when it is becoming in a true Christian to be so . You will be moderate at table , moderate in speaking , moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversions ; temperate even in your wisdom and foresight . It is this universal sobriety in the use of the best things , that is taught us by the true love of God . We are neither austere , nor fretful , nor scrupulous , but have within ourselves a principle of love that enlarges the heart , and sheds a gentle influence upon everything ; that , without constraint or effort , inspires a delicate apprehension , lest we should displease God ; and that arrests us if we are tempted to do wrong . In this state we suffer , as other people do , from fatigue , embarrassments , misfortunes , bodily infirmities , trials from ourselves , and trials from others , temptations , disgusts , and sometimes discouragements . But if our crosses are the same with those of the rest of the world , our motives for supporting them are very different . We have learnt from Jesus Christ how to endure . This can purify , this can detach us from self , and renew the spirit of our minds . We see God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in suffering and in humiliation . Live , my friend , without any exterior change , but what may be necessary , either that you may avoid evil , or may be protected against your weakness , or that you may not discredit the Gospel . Beyond this , let not your left hand know what your right hand doth ; endeavour to be cheerful and tranquil . /z/ Hegulate your expenses and your business . Be honorable and modest , simple and free . Serve your country from duty , not from ambition or Vain hopes . This will be serving your country , your king , andihe King of kings , before whom all visible glories are but tadows . Let your conduct be single , moderate , and without affectation of either good or evil , but be really firm in the cause of virtue , and so decided that no one can hope to lead you astray . When it is evident that you are devoted in good faith to the cause of religion , no one will make the attempt to turn you from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or your own strength , but in the goodness of Grod , who has loved you when you thought not of him , and before you could love him /z/ Your grief is present to me . I can not forget the great loss you have met with ; but God has taken what was his own and not ours . Who shall say to him , What doest thou ? You are far from saying it . His good Measure is the supreme reason . Besides , amidst the most severe sorrows , we can see his paternal hand , and a secret design of mercy . /z/ In another life we idiall see and underatand the wonders of his goodness that have escaped as in this , and we shall rejoice at what has made us weep on earth . Alas , in our present darkness , we can not see either our true good or eyil . If God were to gratil our desiresy it would be our ruin . He saves us by breaking the ties that bind us to earth . We complain because God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We weep because he has taken those , whom we love , away from temptation and sin . We would possess all that delights and flatters our though it might lead us to forget , that we are exiles in a strange land . God takes the poisonous cup from our bands , and we weep as a child weeps when its mother takes away the shining weapon , with which it would pierce its own breast . Your son succeeded in the world ; it is this success that makes you weep , but it was this that , in the counsels of the Almighty , perhaps , was the cause of his removal , in mercy both to him and to his friends . We must be silent and adore . Prayer alone can console you ; it is only in prayer that we are truly in the presence of Grod . As soon as we are with Crod in faith and in love , we are in prayer . And the most holy occupation that does not bring us in this way into his presence , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our only consoler . Remain in silence in his presence , he will comfort you . We shall find all that we have lost in him . Happy they who desire no other consolation . This is pure and inexhaustible . /q/ /z/ VrON THB OP IBIVIITG FRBEIOM TO XXACTirESS . It sppears to me that great freedom and great exactness should be united . Exactness makes us faithful , and freedom makes us courageous . If yon are retf strict without being free , yeu will become servile and scrupulous . If you are free without being stfict , you will neglent and earless . Those who have little experience of the ways of God , think they can not unite these two virtues . They understand , by enigf epaciy living in constraint , in sorrow , in a timid and scrupulous unquietness that destroys the repose of the soul ; that finds sin m everything , and is so narrow-lninded that it questions about the merest trifles , and dares hardly to breathe . They define being free having an easy conscience , not regarding small things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering any but gross crimes as faults ; and with the exception of these , allowing whatever flatters self-love , and any license to the pasaions , that does not produce what they call great evU . It was not thus that St Paul understood things , whi he said to those whom he endeavoured to make Christians , Be free , but with the liberty that Jesus Christ has given you ; be firee , iot the Saviour has called yen to liberty , but let not this liberty be an or pretext for evil . /z/ It appears to me that the fidelity consists in obej ing Grod in eyeryibmgy and following the light that points out our duty , and his spirit that prompts us to do it ; having the desire to please him , without debating about great or little sins , about imperfections or unfaithfulness ; for though there may be a difference in fact , to the soul that is determined to do aU his will , there is none . It is in this sense that the Apostle says . The law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I may so speak , tyrannizes over us , enslaves us . But there is a superior law that raises us above all this , and introduces us into the true liberty of the children of ( Sod . It is this ; that we ever desire to do all that we can to please our Father in Heaven , according to the excelleni instruction of St Augustin , Love God and then do all you wish . To this sincere desire to do the will of Ciod , we must add a cheerful spirit , that is not overcome when it has failed , but begins again and again to do better ; hoping always to the very end to be able to do it ; bearing with its own involuntary weakness , as God bears with it ; waiting with patience for the moment when it shall be delivered from it ; going straight on in singleness of heart , according to the strength that it can command ; losing no time by looking back nor making useless reflections upon its falls , which can only embarrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little failures should humble us , but then we must press on , not judging ourselves with a Judaical rigor , not regarding God as a spy , watching for our least offence , or as an enemy who placea /q/ in our path , but as a father who loves and wishes to save us : trusting in his goodness , invokinf his blessing , and doubting all other support ; this is true liberty . I advise you to aspire after it . Fidelity and free dom should go hand in hand , but I fear with you there is more danger of your wanting confidence in God and openness of heart to him . I do not hesitate te advise you to yield yourself upntirely to that grace , with which he calls you to himself . f ) i ii LETTER XXXni , " VTOV gUBMlSSION TO OCCASIONAL INDIFPERENCE AND DI8IXLI8H FOR RELIOtON. ill I AM not astonished at this lukewarmness in youl We can not always be in raptures .

God compels you , by a continual experience of your own defects , to acknowledge how just it is that you should bear with gentleness the faults of others . Turn these weaknesses to your advantage , by mitting to them , and ingenuously confessing them , and accustoming yourself not to depend upon your own strength .

We ought not , however , to be so silent , as to be deficient in firankness and complaisance in our moments of relaxation and amusement ; but then we may speak of indifierent things , and suppress whatever may do harm . In our recreations , we ought to have a sort of joyousness , that will induce us to please others , and be pleased with trifles .

No , the breath of heaven never fails , but the vessel is held fast by anchors that we do not perceive ; they are at the bottom of the deep . The fault is our own , and not our Creator 's . We have only to seek for them , and we shall find these hidden chains that bind us and arrest our progress ; /z/ and there , where we the least suspect , is the place where we should feel the most distrust .

I have felt my irreparable loss with a despondency , that proves that my heart is very weak . ! N'ow I am more calm , and all that remains is a sort of bitterness and languor of soul . But this humbles me as much as my more violent grief All that I have felt in both these states , was self-love . I acknowledge that I have wept for myself , in mourning for a friend who made the delight of my life , and whose loss I feel continually . I find an alleviation in the lassitude of grief , and my imagination , that was excited by a blow so unexpected , has become accustomed to the thought , and is now calm . But alas ! everything is vain , except an entire yielding up of our hearts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was so calm and peacefiil , that it would have made you happy to witness it . Even /q/ when he was delirious , his thoughts were all of God . I never witnessed anything more edifying or lovely . I relate this to you , because I ought not to speak of my great suffering , without also acknowledging this joy of faith of which St Augustin speaks , and which God has granted me upon this occasion . He has done his will , he has preferred the happiness of my friend to my comfort . I should be wanting in my love to God , and to my friend , if I did not acquiesce in kis will . In my deepest grief I have offered him , whom I so dreaded to lose , to God . I can not help being touched at the tenderness with which you feel for me . I pray that He whose love inspires you , may reward you a hundred fold . /z/ The true way to love our neighbour , is found in the love of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mankind do not understand the love of God ; therefore they fear it , and separate themselves from it . It is from this fear that they can not realize this filial and intimate communion of children with a beneficent parent . They think only of a power- /z/ ful and severe master . They are ever constrained and troubled in their intercourse with him . They perform good actions with unwillingness , that they may avoid punishment ; they would do evil if they dared , and if they could hope to do it with impunity . The love of God is an oppressive debt , that they think they must pay ; they try to elude it by the performance of certain ceremonies and an external homage , which they would substitute for a sincere and practical love of God . They practise arts with their Creator , in hopes to escape by giving the least they possibly can to Him . Oh ! if men did but know what the love of God is , they would not desire any other felicity . The love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids us do for his sake what reason dictates to be done . It calls upon us to do from love for Him , what men of the world do from a sense of honor , or from self-love . It forbids nothing that the right exercise of reason does not forbid . Let us place everything in the order in which Crod has established it in the world . Let us do the same right things , but let us do them for the sake of Him who created us , and to whom we owe everything . This love of God does not demand of Christians those austerities practised by hermits . It seldom requires brilliant and heroic actions , or the renunciation of any rightful possessions ; it only commands us not to make them our idols , but to enjoy them in the divine order , and with our hearts fixed on the Giver . The love of God does not increase the number of our trials ; we find these already thickly scattered over every condition of life . They spring from the infirmities /q/ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our imperfections , and from those of others with whom we are obliged to live . It is not the love of God that causes these sufferings ; on the contrary , it is this alone that can soften them by the consolations it yields . It diminishes them , for it moderates our ardent passions and unreasonable sensibilities , which are the causes of all our real evils . If the love of God were genuine in our hearts , it would cure our griefs and fill us with a peaceful joy . Mankind are great enemies to themselves , in resisting and fearing this pure sentiment . It renders all other precepts light and easy . What we do from fear is always wearisome , hard , painful , oppressive . But all that we do from love , from persuasion , from a free and willing mind , however it may oppose the pleasures of sense , becomes agreeable to us . The desire of pleasing God makes us willing to suffer , if it is his will that we should . The sorrow in which we acquiesce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God never disturbs the order of things that he has established . It leaves the great in their grandeur , and makes them little , only in his sight who has made them great . It leaves those whose condition is low in their lowliness , and makes them contented with being nothing , except in his sight . This willingness to be in the lowest place , has nothing of debasement in it ; it is true greatness . The true love of God regulates and inspires all our attachments . We never love our neighbour so truly as when our love for him is prompted by the love of God . All other foundations for our affections have /z/ reference to self . It is ourselves that we love in oar friends , and this is an imperfect love . It is more like self-love than real friendship . How , then , must we - love our friends ? We must love them in the way that God has ordained . We must love God in them . We must love the good things with which God has endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to the privation of those things which he has denied them . When we love them with reference to self , our self-love makes us impatient , sensitive , and jealous , demanding much , and deserving little ; ever distrusting ourselves and our friends . It soon becomes wearied and disgusted ; it very soon sees the termination of what it believed was inexhaustible ; it meets everywhere with disappointment ; it looks for what is perfect , and finds it nowhere ; it becomes dissatisfied , changes , and has no repose : while the friendship , that is regulated by the love of God , is patient with defects , and does not insist upon finding in our friends what God has not placed there . It thinks of God and of what he has given ; it thinks that all is good , provided it is from Him , and it can support that which God suffers to be , and to which it is his will that we should submit , by conforming ourselves to his designs . The love of God never looks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him alone . As it never expects perfection , it is never disappointed . It loves God and all his gifts to every living thing , according to their respective value . It loves less what is less excellent , and more what is nearer to perfection . It loves all , for there is no one that is not /q/ endowed with some good thing which is the gift of God , and it remembers that the vilest may become good and receive that grace which they now want . He who loves God , loves all his works - all that he has commanded us to love . He loves more those whom God has pleased to render more dear to him . He sees in an earthly parent the love of his heavenly Father . In a relative , in a friend , he acknowledges those tender ties that God has ordained . The more strictly these bonds are in the order of his providence , the more the love of God sanctions them , and renders them strong and intimate . Can we love God without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is He that inspires this love ; it is his will that we should love them ; shall we not obey Him ? . This love can endure all things , suffer all things , hope all things , for our neighbour . It can conquer all difficulties ; it flows from the heart , and sheds a charm upon the manners . It is melted at the sorrows of others , and thinks nothing of its own ; it gives consolation where it is needed ; it is gentle ; it adapts itself to others ; it weeps with those who weep , it rejoices with those who rejoice ; it is all things to all men , not in a forced appearance and in cold demonstrations , but from a full and overflowing heart , in which the love of God is a living spring of the tenderest , the deepest , and the truest feeling . Nothing is so sterile , so cold , so senseless , as a heart that loves only itself in all things ; while nothing can exceed the frankness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animated by the divine love . /z/ fROM THE ' ' LETTERS ON RELIGION ' /z/ This question is not a difficult one , when it is reduced to its just limits . It is true that the soul of man is not a being by itself , possessing a necessary existence . There is but One who derives his existence solely from himself , and who can never lose it , and who imparts it to others according to bis pleasure . Grod need not exercise a direct power to annihilate the soul of man . He would only have to withdraw that which has continued his being every moment from his birth , to replunge him into the nothingness whence he originally drew him ; as a man would merely open his hand to let a stone fall that he had held in the air . The question , that may reasonably be asked , is not , whether the soul of man may be annihilated , if it were the will of God ; it is manifest that it might be ; but what is his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , the soul contain within itself , the seeds of destruction , which must , after a time , terminate its existence ? or , can we prove , philosophically , that it does not ? The following is a negative proof When we think of the essential distinctions between the body and the soul , we are astonished at their union ; and it is only by the operation of the power of God , that we can comprehend how they can be so united and made to act in concert , when composed of /q/ such different elements . The body does not think . The soul is indivisible , has no extent , no form , is invested with none of the properties of the body . Ask any one if his thoughts are round or square , white or yellow , cold or hot , divisible into six or twelve pieces ; and instead of answering you , he will laugh at the question . Ask him if the atoms , of which his body is composed , are wise or foolish ; if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round atoms have more sense and goodness than the square ; he would still only laugh , and could hardly believe you were in earnest . Go a little further , and suppose the atoms of whatever form you please ; make them as impalpable as possible , and ask if it can be , that a moment will come , when these atoms , from being without any consciousness , will begin all at once to know ttaemselTeB , to understand all that is abound ihmf and to say to themselves , I believe this , and I do not believe that ; I love this thing , and I hate another . The person of whom you would ask these questions , would call it child 's play . The absurdity of these questions proves , that none of the ideas that we have of the nature of bodies , enter into our conceptions of mind ; that we do not connect the thinking being with the body , or the being of space . As the distinction is so radical , the natures of these two beings so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dissolved without either of them ceasing to exist . We ought , on the contrary , to be surprised , that two natures so unlike can continue their operations in harmony for so long a time . What /z/ then , shall we conclude ? that one of these beings shall be annihilated as soon as their unnatural union shall cease ? Suppose two bodies of exactly the same nature ; separate them , you destroy neither . As the one is not the other , it may exist or be annihilated without reference to the other . Their separation produces their mutual independence . But if we may reason thus of two bodies , really of the same nature , with how much more reason may we use this argument in relation to the soul and the body , whose union seems unnatural , so unlike are they in ever3rthing . On the other hand , the cessation of this transient union of these two natures , can not be to either the cause of its destruction ; the annihilation of one would not be , on any ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A being that has not been the cause of the existence of another , can not be the cause of its annihilation . It then is clear as day , that the disunion of the body from the ' soul can not cause the annihilation of either , and that even the destruction of the body can not put an end to the existence of the soul . The union of the body and the soul consists only in a mutual concert or relationship between the thoughts of the one and the movements of the other ; it is easy to see what the cessation of their connexion would produce . It is a forced union between two beings entirely dissimilar and independent . God alone could , by his all-powerful will , subject two beings so different in their nature and operations to this mutual dependence . Let this arbitrary and determined will of God cease to act , this forced union would immediately terminate ; just as a stone would fall to the ground when /q/ it was no longer held up in the air . Each party would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case , the soul , far from being annihilated by this disunion which only restores it to its original state , becomes free to think independently of the body ; just as I am free and at liberty to walk alone , and according to my inclinations , as soon as they have set me free from another , to whom a superior power had bound me . The end of this union is only disencumbrance and pure liberty , just as the union itself was only thraldom and subjection . It is then that the soul can think independently of all the movements of the body , as we , of the christian faith , suppose that angels , who have never been confined to bodies , think in heaven . Why then should we fear this disunion which can alone effect the entire freedom of the thoughts ? But the body itself is not annihilated , not one atom of it perishes . All that takes place in what we call death , is a simple derangement of the organs ; its most minute corpuscles exhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever spot dissolution may take place , wherever accident may carry the remains of the body , not one particle ever ceases to exist . Why then should we fear that this other substance , so much more noble , this thinking being that we call the soul , should be annihilated How can we believe that the body , that can not annihilate itself , has the power to destroy the soul that is so superior to it , which is a stranger to it , and absolutely independent of it ? The disunion of these two beings can not produce the destruction of either . /z/ We readily believe that no particle of the body is lost at this separation . Why are we so eager to find reasons for belieringthat the soul , which is incomparably more perfect , is annihilated ? It is tme that Giod might destroy it , if he pleased , at any time , but therfe is no more reason for believing that he would annihilate it at the moment of its disunion with the body , than during its union . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpuscles that form the organs , we have no right to say that thb occurs in the soul , precisely as in the body . The soul , which is a thinking being , has none of the properties of the body ; it has neither different parts , nor figure , nor relative proportions and movements , nor change of situation . Thus no derangement like that of the body can take place . The soul , this thinking and willing self , is a simple being , one by itself and indivisible . There never are , in the same man , two selves , nor two halves of the same self . Objects are presented by different organs , producing different sensations ; but all these different canals pour themselves into a common centre , where they all unite . It is this self , which is so truly one , that by it alone each man has a true identity , and is not many instead of one man . We can not see it , nor hear it , nor touch it . We conceive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body from its extent and form . As soon as we think of the real distinction of the soul from the body , we must acknowledge that it does not possess either divisibility , or form , or arrangement . The body that has organs may lose the arrangement of its parts , and change /q/ ita fotm and b0 depompoey Imt the soul caauot lose an n%agexaen of parts that it ha eyer possessed and that does nojieiopg to it . It may be isaid that the soul , beii created only to be invited to the body , is so connected with it , thfEit its borrowed existence ceases as soon as its associatic with the body terminates . But Hhs speaking ; without proof , and at random , to say , that the soul is created with an existence limited to the time of its connexion with the body . Whence do they draw this unreasQivable ( Conclusion , and with what right do they tke it for granted instead of proving it ? The body is certainly less perfect than the soul , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we see , nevertheless , that the existence of the body is not confined to its . union with the soul . After death has interrupted this connexion , the body still exists in minute particles . We observe only two things ; one is , that the body crumT bles to dust , and is decomposed ; this can not happen to the soul , for it is simple , indivisible , and without arrangement of parts ; the other is , that the body no longer moves in dependence upMi the thoughts of the ) 3. oul . Ought we not to cfonclude on the same ground , aod with more reason , that the soul also exists , and that it then begins te think , independently of the body ? That the operation follows the existence , is acknow ledged by all philosophers . These two beings are independent of each other as much in nature as in operation ; as the body does not depend upon the 60ul for its movements , neither does the soul require the assistance of the body for its thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two beings , so unlike and so independent , were subjected to acting in concert ; the terrainatio#of their transient union leaves them free to operate , each one according to its own nature , that has no mutual relation to the other . In fine , this becomes the question ; Whether God , who has the power to annihilate the soul of inan , or to continue its existence forever , has willed its destruction or its preservation . There seems not the least reason for believing that He , who does not annihilate the least atom in the universe , wills the annihilation of the soul , and there is not the least appearance that such is its fate at the moment when it is separated from the bodj , since it is a being entirely distinct and independent . This separation being only the end of a subjection to a certain concert of operations with the body , it is manifest that it is the deliverance of the soul , and not the cause of its annihilation . We must acknowledge , however , that we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comprehend , if God himself has declared it in his word . What depends only upon his arbitrary word , can only be revealed to us by himself . Those who will believe the mortality of the soul against all probability , ought to prove to us that God has spoken to us to assure us of it . It is by no means necessary for us to prove that God does not will this annihilation ; we are satisfied with the supposition that the soul of man , which , next to Gd , is the most perfect thing that we have any knowledge of , is less liable /q/ to lose its existence than the mean and imperfect substances that are around it ; now the annihilation of the least atom is without example in the universe since the creation . We are satisfied , then , with the supposition , tliat , as the least atom is not lost , ao the soul of man is not liable to annihilation . This is the most reasonable and the most decided judgment from the first impression . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by clear and unquestionable proofs . These they can obtain only by a positive declaration from God himself . We produce the book which bears every mark of a divine origin , for it has taught us to know and to love supremely the true God . It is this book that speaks in the character of G , when it says I am that I am . " No other book has described the Supreme Being in a manner worthy of him . The gods of Homer subject Divinity to disgrace and derision . The book that we have in our hands , after having shown God to us as he is , teaches us theronly worship that is worthy of him . Its object is not to appease him by the blood of victims , but to lead us to love him supremely , and to prefer his will to our own ; to have this love of Grod enter into all our virtues and eradicate everj ' vice . There is but one book in the world that makes religion consist in loving God more than ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat this great truth are borrowed from this . All truth , is taught in ' this fundamental truth . The book that has disclosed to us the nature of God , and the nature of man , and the true worship of the heart , must be divine . /z/ is there another religion in which this is the great truth ? Moreover , this hook , so divine in ks doctrine , is full of prophecies whose accomplishment is open to the observation the world ; as the reprbbation of the Jews , and the admission of idoliH trous nations to the true worship through the Messiiah. iEicfsidei ! , this book is sacred as a record of mil's* dies performed in open daf , and in view of the greaieai enemies to religion . In fine , this book has done all that it says it could do ; it has changed the face of the world ; it has peopled the deserts with men , who have been angels in mortal bodies ; it has taught and cherished , even in the midat of the most corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gentle virtnes ; it has persuaded th idolatet of self to count himself a nothing , and to love supremely the invisible Being . Such a book ought to be read as if it descended frohi ' Heavea to the earth . It is in this book , that Crod hAa declared to us a truth , already so rational , so probable in itself . The same almighty and good Being , who alone could deprive us of life eternal , has here promised it to us ; it is the hope of this Kfe without end , that has taught so many martyrs to despise the short and suA fering life of the body . Is it not reasonable that God , who proves the virtue of every man in this short life , and who often leaves the impious in their prosperous course , while the just live and die amidst suffering and obscurity , should reserve to another life the chastisettient of the one , and the reward of the other ? This is what the sacred records teach us . Wonderful and blessed conformity between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear within us ! All harmonize v philosophy , the supreme authority of the promises , and this deep sentiment of truth imprinted upon our hearts . Whence is it that men are so incredulous concerning the blessed truth of their immortality ? The impious declare that they are without hope , and that they are , after a few days , to be swallowed up forever in the gulf of annihilation ; they rejoice at it , they triumph at their approaching extinction ; they , who love themselves so madly , seem to be enamoured with this horrible doctrine ; they court despair . Others tell them that they have a resource in the life eternal , but they are angry at the thought ; it exasperates them ; they fear being convinced . They exercise all their ingenuity in cavilling at these powerful proofs . They prefer perishing in the indulgence of their insensate pride and brutal passions , to living eternally and submitting to be virtuous . O monstrous frenzy ! wild , absurd self-love , that turns against itself and becomes its own enemy ! /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship is not to fear God as we fear a terrible and powerful man , who destroys ail that resist him . The /z/ Pagans offered incense and Ticttms to certain malignant and fearful diyinities to appease their wratfa . This is not my idea of God . He is infinitely jost and abnighty , and doubtless he is to be feared ; but only by those who refuse to love him and make thenselYes acquainted with him . The best fear we eui have of Crody is the fear lest we should not please him , and lest we should not do his will . The fear of punishment is useful to men , who have wandered from the right path ; it may restrain fnmi crime , but it is only useftil as it is the means of leadr ing them to lore him . There is not a man in the world , who desires to be feared rather than loved bj his children . When we perfonn good actions itom fear alone , we perfbryi them merely to avoid suflering ; and of course , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should do so . There is not only no parent who would be pleased with being honored in this way , or friend who would grant the name of friend to those who were bound to him only by such ties ; but there is not even a master who would love or reward his domestics , or accept their services , if he saw they were bound to him by fear alone and not by any real love . With how much more reason is it that God , who has given us intelligence and affections , in order that we may know and love him , can not be satisfied with a servile fear , but desires our hearts , and that our love should return to the fountain whence it first flowed . /q/ /z/ Wb are too much impressed with the great disparity , that exists between the grossness of the minds of most men , and the grandeur of those truths which must be understood bj one who would become a Christian .

What pains would not a man take to penetrate the cause of his situation , if he were to find himself when he awoke from sleep transported into a desert and unknown island ? What would he not do to discover how he had been removed during his sleep , to ascertain whether there were any vestiges of inhabitants there , to procure subsistence , to clothe and shelter his body , and to find means of returning to his own country ? Such are the natural resources of the human mind among the least cultivated men .

Be as curious to know Him who made you , and to whom you owe everything , as the lowest minded men are to satisfy their earthly desires , and you will find God and life eternal . Let men act in this world , as he who finds himself when he awakes in a desert and unknown island . Let men , instead of being engrossed with what they - call fortune , diversions , reputation , politics , eloquence , poetry , be occupied with answering these questions ; " Who am I ? Where am I ? Whence did I come ? By whose power did I come hither ? Why and by whom am I created ? Whither am I to go ? Who are these beings around me that resemble me ? Whence do they come ? " Why will not men take as much pains to know themselves , as Anacharsis the Scjrthian did to find the truth ? as the Greeks did , who went into Egypt , Asia , and even India , to get wisdom ? It requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a little effort to become acquainted with our own weakness ; to be a true philosopher man needs only to know his ignorance . When will men strive to develope the great mystery of their own existence ? Themlnd of every man expands by use ; it becomes elevated and enlarged in proportion to the exercise of his will , and to the intellectual efforts he makes . Let the soul be turned as strenuously towards good , as it usually is towards evil , and you will find that the simple love of goodness will give incredible resources to the spirit in the search after truth . /q/ If itieii loved truth better than themselves , as it ought to be loved ) they would strive for it as earnestly as they now strive after the illusions that flatter their vanity .

Truth is not the less true , and the deep conviction which all men have of it , is not less a real and invincible belief , although no one has the power to explain his reasons for believing . The greatest philosophers are persuaded of a great number of truths , which they can not clearly develope , nor refute the objections to them . It b very true , as some author of our time has said , ' ' men have not sufficient courage to follow their own reason ; " and I am well persuaded that no . man without the grace of Grod , will by his own natural strength , all the cimstancy , all the method , all the moderation , all the distrust of himself , that are necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superior light of faith ; in a word , that natural philosophy , which follows , without prejudice , or impatience , or pride , the deductions of purely human reason , is a prodigy . I trust only in the grace of Grod to direct our reason even within its own narrow bounds ift the discovery of religion ; but I believe with St Augustin , that Grod endows every man with the first germ of this divine power , which imperceptibly mingles with his reason , and prepares him to arrive gradually at faith . This preparation of the heart is at first the more indistinct , because it is general in its effects ; it is a confused sentiment of insufficiency , a desire after what we have not , a wish to find without ourselves that which we can not find within , * a melancholy consciousness of a void in our hearts , a hunger and thirst after truth , a sincere disposition to readily believe ourselves /q/ ceived , and to think that we are in want of assistance to save us from error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new man ; the first springing up in the soul of that heal* ing and free grace which gradually dissipates all darkness , and conquers all the corrupt passions of man . It will be said that this is not sufficient to lead to the belief in Jesus Christ , since our faith comes by our senses , and we should not have heard of the truth , if the evangelists had not been sent . But I maintain , ' that if the inward dispositions answer to the grace bestowed , God will finish by his providence the work that his love has already commenced . He will doubtless by a miracle enlighten a man , and lead him by the hand to the gospel , sooner than he will let him be deprived of a light which he is worthy to receive . A man who loves God more than himself , and who forgets himself in the search after truth , has already found it in his own heart . The religion of Jesus already operates within him , as it did in the hearts of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Noah , in Job , and in the other worshippers of the true God . St Augustin was assured that Cornelius had received the Holy Spirit before he was baptized ; he believed that God never abandons any but those who deserve it , that he never deprives any one of the supreme good ; he adds , in the words of the Apostle , that those getitiles , who have the law written in their hearts , have a part in the gospel . You perceive that only those infidels are culpable , who have received , without profiting by it , a real mercy , an offered grace that would have enabled them to believe . It will be /z/ imputed to no one to have Qiniiedi where he not the power to know his duty . If we suppose the case of an infidel , who fiiitbiullj uses the light of his reason , and that first germ of the grace of God implanted within hini , to seek for truth with real pietj , we must belioFe that God wifl not refiise the knowledge of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deprived of supreme felicity , which he has fireely promised them , God would enlighten a man living in an unknown forest , or ki a des island , either by an interior and extraerdinaiy revdation , or by sending to him teachers of his wrd . We need only bring to our minds the idea of to be assured that he never will desert us . Shail we fear that the supreme Love will cease to love ? Can we beUeve that the infinite Grood , ever pouring himself forth on all , will deny himself to any who are not unworthy of him ? St Augustin , on the contrary , says , that God does everything to save us , except depriving us of our free will . Whom then shall we accuse ? God , who caimol , without departing from himself , cease to be infinitely good , compassionate , beneficemt , watchfiil , full of tenderness towards ail his children ? or man , who , according to his own confession , is vain , stubborn , MresumptuouB , ungrateful , idolatrous of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not let us blaspheme against God , that we may excuse our own demerits* , pride and selfishness are the causes of our errors . God would have us love him supremely ; we must overthrow and destroy this idol , self . Jesus Christ /q/ has exterminated Tisible idolatry ; but the idolatry within still prevails everjrwhere . Our reason , divested of passion , pride , and evil desires , would naturally arrive at this truth , that we have not made ourselves , and that we owe this self , which is so dear to us , to him who gave it . Let us add to these reflections the true idea of the Christian religion . In what does it consist ? In the love of God . He wills that we should worship him alone in our hearts . This is the true worship which the Pagans never understood , and which the Jews only comprehended imperfectly , although the foundation of it was laid in their own law . According to St Augustin , men understand the whole sense of the scriptures as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth this command includes all others .

Divest that religion of temporal blessings , of mysterious emblems , of ceremonies established in order to prescfrve the people from idolatry , in fine , of its legal policy , and the love of God alone remains ; afterwards unfold and perfect this love , and you have Christianity , of which Judaism was but the germ and preparation . /z/ " When the Son of Man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? " Luke zviii. 8 . If he were to come at this moment , would he find it in us ? Where is our faith ? What are the proofs of it ? Do we believe that this life is only a short passage to a better ? Do we believe that we must suffer with Jesus before we can reign with him ? Do we look upon the world as a vain show , and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith ? Does it animate us ? Do we enjoy the eternal truths that it presents to us ? Do we feed our souls with them , as we nourish our bodies with healthful aliment ? Do we accustom ourselves to view everything with the eye of faith ? Alas ! instead of living by faith , we extinguish it in our souls . How can we truly believe what we profess to believe , and act as we act ? May we not fear , lest the kingdom of heaven be taken from us , and given to others who will bring forth more fruit ? This kingdom of heaven is faith , when it dwells and reigns in the heart . Blessed are the eyes that see this kingdom ; flesh and blood have not seen it ; earthly wisdom is blind to it . To realize its glories , we must be born again , and to do this we must die to self . /z/ " 3trive to enter in at the strait gate . " Luke xiii . 24 .

It is ordained by God that we be conformed to the image of his Son , that we may be crucified to self , that we renounce sensual pleasures , and submit , like him , to suffering .

Such a state is perhaps more to foe apprehended than one of open sin , for this might awaken conscience , and faith might revive , and they might make a great effort ; while the other state only serves to stifle salutary remorse , and establish a false peace in the heart , that renders the evil irremediable . These Christians are low-minded and cowardly ; they would possess heaven at a low price ; they do not think of what it has cost those who have obtained it ; they do not consider what is due to God .
