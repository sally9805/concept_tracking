txt ART . 111. - The Life of Elbridge Gerry , with contemporary Letters , to the Close of the . dinerican Revolution . By JAMES T. AUSTIN . Boston . Wells &amp; Lilly . 1828 . Svo. pp. 520 . IT has been sometimes remarked , in substance , that the Revolution is becoming a trite theme . This is a great error ; its interest is daily increasing . The circumstances , that the generation by whom it was accomplished has almost wholly disappeared ; and that the generation , which succeeded that of the Revolution on the active stage of life , is already in retirernent , heighten instead of diminishing , the interest of that great event . It is viewed by a new generation of men , educated to new ideas , and new destinies . It is viewed through a new medium , that of oral tradition , growing every day more general and faint , and of written accounts , multiplying in the same ratio . It is in the nature of tradition , to select only // the prominent incidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject matter , in the most imposing light , either of praise or censure ; and the result is , that an event of real magnitude in human history is never seen , in all its grandeur and importance , till some time after its occurrence has elapsed . In proportion as the memory of small men and small things is lost , that of the truly great becomes more bright . The contemporary aspect of things is often confused and indistinct . The eye which is placed too near the canvass , beholds too distinctly the separate touches of the pencil , and is perplexed with a cloud of seemingly discordant tints . It is only at a distance , that they melt and mingle into a harmonious , living picture . Besides , great events in real life , like the master-pieces of poetical creation , have their beginning , their middle , and their end . The glory of the whole can not be seen in the detail of any one of the parts . It is only when we see the whole spread out , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the principles for which good men toiled and suffered , have ripened into institutions ; when truths , which seemed *t first the abstractions of the philosopher 's cell , have grown into laws , into constitutions , and what we may call the habits of na* Puns , that we are able duly to appreciate the character of the leading events of the history of our race , and the merit of the great men raised up in the critical conjunctures of national fortune . No man liveth for himself alone ; neither does any generation live and act for itself alone . As it is necessary to put an individual through all the exercises of social life ,  --  to try h*m in every relation for which his physical , intellectual , and moral nature qualify him , before you can attain the full conception of what a man is ; so the character of an age , and the joint action of the great men of an age must be traced , through succeeding ages of consequences . It is true , that the result is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who took the initiatory steps . Not one , perhaps , of those who attended the first congress in 1774 , had any conception of the events which fifty years would bring about in this country ; and it might seem , for that reason , an exaggeration , to give them distinct credit , for what they did not even foresee . This , however , is false reasoning . In a great national crisis , such as the revolution of 1775 , the minds of the leading men are wrought up to the highest pitch of fervor . They glow with unwonted enthusiasm ; the future is indeed indistinec , but it is // full of all that is momentous . What the particular consummation will be , they can not tell ; but their spirits are attuned to great issues . It may be some indefinite remedy of a present grievous oppression ; or some fanciful fulfilment of projects deemed chimerical ; it may even look to a cool reasoning observer like strange delusion , as when some of our revolutionary fathers proposed to introduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Palestine , as the final object of his discoveries. * But it is evident enough , that when men have wrought themselves up to a state of feeling , in which they freely stake their fortunes and lives upon their actions , they are under a prophetic excitement , looking forward to vast consequences , which may be different in kind from those that happen , but not inferior in degree . And whatever the particular form of the result , they who knowingly risked all to produce some great and desirable result , are entitled to the full credit of the happy consequences . To take another example , it may very rationally be stated , that not one of our pilgrim fathers had a distinct anticipation of the future progress of the country . But so far is this from diminishing their glory , as the founders of these republics , that , we might almost say , it increases it . Could they have foreseen the certain train of auspicious consequences , destined to flow from their enterprise , the natural weakness of the human heart would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to destroy the merit of their voluntary sufferings . As it was , they foresaw nothing certain , but incredible hardship and numberless sacrifices . But inasmuch as they deliberately encountered these from good motives ; and did , at the same time , form to themselves an obscure , hut elevated and pious vision of christianizing the Continent , and bringing its undiscovered regions and unknown tribes within the pale of religious civilization ; their merit ought fairly to be measured by the grandeur of the actual consequences of their enterprise , although the precise form of those consequences was not and could not have been foreseen . * An instance may here be found of the different judgments form . ed of the same thing , by different minds . The suggestion alluded to in the text , is spoken of by the late Mr Gifford , in his notes to Ben Jonson 's Plays , in a sneering manner . Mr Poletica , perhaps as good a judge in political affairs as Mr Gifford , refers to it as a su*gestion , it is true , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of the political relation of the United States to Great Britain . A remark on the project of Columbus will be found on another page . // If there be any justice in these principles , they show both that the Revolution , instead of being a theme , trite and exhausted , is now beginning to be understood in its proper grandeur and importance ; and also that , however great and happy the train of events has proved , of which that was the commencement , the illustrious men of that day are fairly entitled to have their merit estimated accordingly . But while we must place ourselves in the point of view , in which the event has enabled us to stand , we must , at the same time , go back to contemporary materials , to furnish the foundation of a true understanding of the character of the men and the events of the revolution . We must open the public archives ; and this , though not thoroughly done as yet , has not been neglected on the contrary , a good part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called public sources . But in addition to this , we must search the scrutoires and examine the private files of the leaders of the day . Though not a little of this work has also been done , much remains to do , and every contribution of this sort , to the general stock of our knowledge , ought to be gratefully welcomed by every patriot and every curious student of our history . We already have a series of works , which no one , who wishes to know what the revolution was , ought to leave unstudied . The lives of Otis , Quincy , Patrick Henry , Richard Henry Lee , Benjamin Franklin , and the signers of the declaration of independence already , constitute an invaluable series . To these are now added that of Gerry , and we have reasonable expectations , that those of Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson will soon enrich the collection . As no one of these works is , of course , a history of the revolution , and as they all owe their chief value to their connexion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as collections of materials ; and possess an interest , independent of their literary execution . The Life of Elbridge Gerry , which is under our present consideration , besides its value as a repository of revolutionary materials , is drawn up in a manner creditable to its author . It is neither overloaded with speculation , nor destitute of the reflections necessary to explain , introduce , and connect the letters of the principal personages of the day . Colonel Austin has avoided an error exceedingly obvious in the composition of a work of this kind ; that of making it a historical sketch of the Revolution . The known events of that period are now so familiar , that however natural // it may be , for the biographer of one of its great characters , to present a continuous narrative of its occurrences , it is a far more judicious course , and it is that pursued by Colonel Austin , to take for granted that the reader knows the history of the revolution , and to introduce so much of it only , as is convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the materials for the first time presented to the reader . On a few occasions , Colonel Austin has indulged in reflections of his own , at some length ; and , at these times , has discovered no little vigor and originality of thought , and pointedness of manner . The life of Mr Gerry was continued to an advanced period , and his agency in public affairs extended throughout an unusually protracted succession of events . In the language of Colonel Austin , In the convention to form a constitution for the confederacy , which may be considered a new epoch in the history of the United States , he attracted no common share of public attention . At the organization of the federal government , he was a member of the house of representatives ; during the negotiations , which ended in the termination of our treaties with France , he was engaged in an important embassy to that power ; during the excitement and agitation which preceded the second war with England , he was at the head of the government of Massachusetts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senate of the United States . This connexion with distant and important events in the history of this country , belongs almost exclusively to him . Four of his associates in the colonial legislature and provincial congress of Massachusetts were his colleagues in the congress which declared the independence of the United States , but neither of them was a member of the convention which prepared the federal constitution . Of the whole number who signed the declaration of independence , seven only were members of the latter assembly . Again , the first and second congress under the new government contained many individuals who had been distinguished in the civil or military service of the revolution , and several who had assisted in forming the present constitution , but the number of those concerned in both these events was small . Time rapidly made that number less , and when the subject of this memoir took the chair of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , few of his associates in the revolution were in its councils . At a subsequent period , when he presided in the senate of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , in any branch of the government , who had been a member of the " immortal congress of 1776 . " Two only of his colleagues of the revolution attained an equal elevation under the constitution of the United States . They passed indeed to a rank one degree higher in its service ; but of these eminent citizens one ceased to hold public office about the commencement of the present century , and the other retired in the year 1809 . Subsequent to this latter period , ELBRIDGE GERRY was governor of Massachusetts , and died in 1814 , vice-president of the United States . ' In the present work , the narrative of Mr Gerry 's life is brought down only to the close of the revolution . His biographer has assigned the reasons which have induced him , for the present , to pause at this sta*ge , in the following manner ; Of those more recent events which occurred at and subsequent to the formation of the constitution of the United States , it is not easy to speak with sufficient impartiality , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not subsided . The storm of party violence may have ceased , but the waves are not yet calm . The traces of a consuming fire are still perceptible . The path lies " per ignes Suppositos cineri doloso . " The prominent incidents in the life , which this volume is intended to illustrate , occurred in times of revolution , faction , and party warfare . The whigs and tories were not more vindictive than the advocates and opponents of the constitution , or than the factions who quarrelled about the treaty of London and the war with France , or than those who arranged themselves under party banners as republicans and federalists . It was not possible that any man of decision of character and personal independence should stand well with all these irritated adversaries . In such times every honorable man selects his side . The consequence of a choice is the favor of one and the enmity of the other . The subject of this memoir enjoyed in a remarkable degree the support of his political friends , and had no patent of exemption from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Much of the malignity , with which he was assailed , may be justly ascribed to a vindictive and vulgar spirit ; but it is not to be doubted that many measures of his public life seriously displeased the leaders of a strong and powerful party , and induced them to believe they " did the state some service " by diminishing the influence of his name . To discriminate between defamation intended merely to exas // perate , and that estimate of conduct which speaks sincerely in the language of reproach ; or between adulation designed to exalt the character of a leader , and praise which is the honest sentiment of a gratified community , is not always a practicable task . The duty of the biographer is doubtless to enable his readers to form their own judgment by an impartial and dispassionate narration of the facts that existed . This and other considerations have induced the publication , at the present time , of so much only of the life proposed to be written as was passed during the revolution , a period about which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . The residue is in progress , and may be given at some future time to the public . It is the more willingly deferred , because it is that part with which recent inquirers into American history are in some degree familiar . ' We are inclined to think that Colonel Austin has in this adopt* ed a judicious course . In the volume at present before the public , he has presented , on behalf of the venerable subject of his narrative , a claim to public respect , which all will admit . He has identified him , in the most intimate manner , with the American Revolution . He has shown him to us , as the confidential associate and coadjutor of its great leaders ,  --  as a distinguished leader himself ; and in this imposing and dignified light , he has deduced his history to the termination of the war . There is a portion , a very large and active portion of the community , who are prepared already for the continuation of the narrative . We believe no man now finds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who advocated the adop .. tion of the Constitution . There are not many states of the Union , to which this ought to be a more tender theme , than to Massachusetts . The Convention was almosf equally balanced , and the means employed to produce the desired result do not illustrate , as much as could be wished , the power of pure reason . Still , however , we believe we have reached an age , when this subject could be treated , without risk of offence in any quarter . The same may be said of the events of a period considerably subsequent , in reference to the younger portion of the community , who have come into life since other events have been the turning points of the politics of the country . But , inasmuch as some of the active politicians of the periods specified by Colonel Austin are still on the stage , we think he has acted with a commendable discretion , in pausing at the close of the Revolution ; and we are quite willing to rest with // the same discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be resumed ; prepared to welcome it , ' whenever he shall think fit to present it to the American people . But it is time to invite the reader 's attention to some of the interesting details of the work before us ,  --  and among these , we can not but allude to the subject of the academical exercise assigned to Mr Gerry , at the period of his graduation at Harvard College . At the period , when Mr Gerry took his degree at Cambridge , the annual commencement was a far more important occasion , than it is at the present day , when colleges are numerous , and festivals of all kinds have been so much multiplied , as to divide that public attention , which was then concentrated on a very few , among which the commencement at college was inferior to none , in the general estimation . The academic exercises of this occasion were therefore highly important , both as an indication of the feeling , which existed among the portion of the community , which , having received a liberal education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence over public sentiment ; and also as an instrument , at the time , of giving tone and animation to the opinion of those assembled from all parts of the state . Accordingly , the very first movempnts of popular sentiment were responded from the Universi-. ty . Samuel Adams took his second degree at Cambridge , in 1743 . On this occasion , he maintained the affirmative of this question , Whether it be lawful to resist the supreme magistrate , if the commonwealth can not otherwise be preserved ? ' In 1765 , John Adams wrote his Essay on the Canon and Feudal Law , in the splendid peroration of which he makes the following animated appeal ; Let the colleges join their harmony in the same delightful concert . Let every declamation turn upon the beauty of liberty and virtue , and the deformity , turpitude , and malignity of slavery and vice . Let the public disputations become researches into the grounds , and nature , and ends of government ; and the means of preserving the good and demolishing the evil . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tender mind , and of spreading and distributing far and wide the ideas of right and the sensations of freedom . In short , let every sluice of knowledge be opened and set flowing . ' At the annual commencement in 1765 , the same year in which this exhortation was given , Mr Gerry received his sec // ond degree at Cambridge , and supported the affirmative of this question , Whether innovations in the laws of trade and revenae which destroy the commerce of a people , may be lawfully evaded by them as faithful subjects ? ' It will be recollected that , in the year before ( 1764 ) , new duties had been laid on the West India trade ; and that in 1765 the stamp act was passed . At the same commencement , Francis Dana , afterwards a distinguished member both of the continental and the federal congress , and chief justice of Massachusetts , maintained the negative of the question , Whether the legislature of a state had a right to change its constitution . ' It was therefore , with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present chief magistrate , at the annual visitation of the Boston free schools in 1826 . It was from the schools of public instruction , instituted by your forefathers , that the light burst forth , which now illuminates the world . It was in your primary schools ; it was by the midnight lamps of Harvard Hall ; that were conceived and matured , as it was within these hallowed walls , * that were first resounded the accents of that independence , which is now canonized in the memory of those , by whom it was proclaimed . ' We pass over a great many details of interest , relative to Mr Gerry 's entrance into political life , and his services in the legislature and on the committee of correspondence , and come to the period when , in 1774 , he was elected a member of the provincial congress , which sat at Concord , Cambridge , and Watertown , and which Colonel Austin justly describes , as the first purely revolutionary assembly in the colonies . There was nothing contrary to the existing charters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia . Like the congress of 1765 , which met at New York , to confer on the Stamp Act ; or the congress of 1754 , which met at Albany to devise a plan of general union , the meeting of 1774 could only be regarded as a legal conference of committees from several colonies , met to submit their grievances to the crown ; which they did in a dutiful address . The provincial congress of Watertown was convened , against all previously existing law , except that , which is previous to all other law ,  - -  the law of necessity . They were truly told by the royal governor , that their assembling , as they had done , was a violation // of their own constitution . ' They in particular took that step , which may be considered , in modern revolutions , as marking , by a precise point of time and action , the turn in the tide of government ; - we mean that , which gives a new direction to the revenue of the state ; - which cuts off the streams from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress of Massachusetts elected Henry Gardner as treasurer , and called on the people to pay their taxes to him . On this general subject , Colonel Austin makes the following just reflection . This assembly had no justification for convening by any provisions of the provincial charter ; and their assuming the powers of legislation , and other high acts of authority and government , were supported by no other sanction than the voluntary consent and approbation of the people . Resistance to organized government usually begins by military force . The arm of the law is active and powerful enough to put down all opposition that is not supported by the bayonet ; but the American revolution began by the exertion of moral and intellectual power . It commenced in an intelligent and peaceable effort by the people to direct for themselves , and by themselves , the public business of the province ; and so far as Massachusetts was concerned , the assembling of these delegates with the intention of exercising all the powers of legislation , and carrying this intention into complete effect , was a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal power , and the beginning of the existence of a free , sovereign , and independent state . ' We are well convinced , that , in after ages , one of the most important points of view , under which the American revolution will be scrutinized by the friends of liberty and the student of history , will be that of a great school of freedom , in which other times may find tbe most instructive lessons , as to the methods , by which a republican independence can most successfully be attempted . If we trace back our history to the cradle of the commonwealth , we find that after liberty of conscience , the first thing needful , the understanding must be enlightened , and the means of education provided ; in order that the reasoning mind , which in its liberty of conscience has acquired the right to think , may be enabled to think rightfully , liberally , and wisely . Without this preparation , strength is brute force ; and numbers , wealth , and what we may call statistical prosperity , can serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth . When a revolution then is to // take place , let it , according to the great example of our fathers , begin far back with that , which is the glory of human nature , the calm , decided , energetic operation of the reason of the people ; diffusively , in the common sense of the mass ; eminently , in the strong conviction of the gifted minds . A just and hopeful political reform must first disclose itself , as such , in this way ; for reason , deciding , reflective reason , is the great glory of our nature ; and that , which makes one mortal being superior to another , and nearer the immortal and Supreme , is the elevation and correctness of his intelligence . When by education the mind of the country is prepared ; when the faculties of the gifted few are prepared to lead , and of the intelligent mass to follow , then , in a well conducted revolution , ensues the purest and chastest operation of intellect ,  --  . that , by which the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the various forms of written discourse , powerfully set forth and brought home to the community , and made familiar to its members . After the unexpressed , the inexpressible , the purely etherial operations of mind , that , which approaches nearest to them , is the silent voice of reason , in the retirement of the closet . It does not supersede , it awakens the in dependent action of other minds . It suggests the theme , but affords space for meditation , for qualification , it may be , for correction . It is the most transparent veil , the most spiritual incarnation , in which the word can be made manifest . Here , too , is the highest test of comparative merit , which man can apply . Of the inward exercises of pure reason , man can not judge ; nor how much those of one intellect exceed those of another . But when the truth of a cause and the strength of its supporters are brought to the test of a written exposition and defence , we are then furnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the power and light , with which it has been conceived and taken up . The whole history of the colonies , down to the year 1760 , presents us with the illustrations of this stage of an orderly revolution . Lower in the scale is the agency , by which the cause , thus prepared in the consciences , convictions , and reason of men , is to win its way to the favor of the less reflecting portion of the community , or to gain a majority of voices in the primary arid popular assemblies . This is the agency of public speaking , an instrument less chaste indeed and intellectual , than that of written discourse , yet liberal and generous in its nature . But it ne // cessarily borrows not a little from physical accidents ; it addresses a taste less severe ; it looks more to the side of the passions , and less to that of the reason ; and is not so necessarily the expression of native power , and independent thought . Moreover , till the understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened ; and they are well taught in the principles of reform , it is premature to put the multitudinous assemblies in action , by the sympathetic fervor of popular eloquence . But when each of these in its place has been done ; when the understandings of the people have comprehended the principles of the proposed reform , and their reason has felt its necessity ; when , in the large cities or in the crowded audiences elsewhere convened , their spirits have been wrought up to a certain passionate enthusiasm , by the eloquence of fervid appeals , then they have reached what may he called the maturity of preparation . They are ripe for the reform they demand . From the year 1760 to 1775 , may be considered the period , in America , of this second stage of preparation . if arbitrary power be still opposed to the acknowledgment of their rights , nothing farther is needed , than to raise the arm of flesh ,  --  the humble but faithful minister of the righteous will of an enlightened and enkindled people , resolved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lower in its character , parta* king of mechanical impulse , and hrute violence ; hut ennobled by a noble cause , and necessary in the conflict with the like force , exerted in an opposite direction . Such is the wholesome gradation of the energies of a people , trained up in orderly discipline , to a seasonahle and auspicious independence . It is of such a revolution and such an one alone , that it can be said , in any hopeful sense , Vestigia nulla retrorsum . But woe to the misguided nation , that inverts the succession of the powers and talents , hy which alone a great and genial efficacy in human affairs can be exerted ; whose mighty masses are put prematurely in motion ; whose popular assemhlies are hurried into hasty and unconsidered measures ; and who are obliged slowly and sadly to go back to the heavenly directress ,  --  the counsels of calm reason ,  --  to repair the errors , into which they had been plunged by following their passionate guides . It would be easy to point out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the American , and to show that the prosperous issue of one and the disastrous miscarriages of the other proceeded from a // complete inversion of the natural order of the talents , by which a movement ought o be given to political affairs . It is necessary , to avoid misconception , to add , that the talents of written discourse , popular eloquence , and physical action do not necessarily exist alone , each exclusively of the others . There are rare Instances , where they are all united . They were eminently so in Julius Caesar , who wanted nothing but good moral qualities , to make him the paragon of humanity ; being , as he was , the most elegant writer , the happiest popular speaker , and the ablest general in Rome . Less rare are the cases , where two of the three great qualities are united , in the same individual . We have compared them above only as possessed , and brought into operation , singly and each exclusively of the others ; that is , as much so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the others . It would be grateful and instructive to examine the characters of our revolutionary leaders , in the application of the talents we have described . Mr Jefferson and Dr Franklin exer. * cised the purely philosophical influence ( but that of the highest order ) over American affairs ; the latter long before the crisis of the revolution came on , the former more eminently in the succeeding stages of our political progress . Neilber of them , we believe , possessed any portion of the talent of the orator or of the soldier . Mr Adams united to the pure philosophy of Jefferson and Franklin a powerful gift in eloquence , which made him a far more efficient member of a deliberative assembly than either . Washington 's talent was peculiar . We believe he never spoke in a deliberative assembly ; and he discharged with great success the functions both of the philosophic statesman and of the soldier , without possessing , in an eminent degree , the peculiar qualities of either . As a learned civilian there were many of his contemporaries who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be hard to point out , in the revolutionary army , a few men more visibly endowed with purely military qualities . He seemed to possess just enough of either character to enable him to do the duties of both . In civil administration , the decision , circumspection , and firmness of the commander were his main strength ; in the command of the army , the moderation , assiduity , and perseverance of the civil service were the great features of his Fabian policy . He does not owe his military fame to his battles ; nor his reputation as a magistrate to his political science . He is more indebted // perhaps for his great and stilitary ascendancy to the moral qualities of his character , and to his high disinterestedness , than to his possession of the talents , which render other men famous . The subject of the present work , Mr Gerry , was not an orator , in the common sense of the word , and though two or three times exposed to peril from hostile violence , was never in the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assiduously , and patiently exerted ; - strengthened by the merit of early espousing , steadily supporting , and never deserting the cause . Mr Gerry was a member of the committee of safety , appointed by the provincial congress ; which committee had been in session at West Cambridge , on the 18th of April , 1775 . The following interesting anecdote shows , by how narrow an escape he was saved from being one of the first victims of the war . A committee of congress , among whom were Mr Gerry , Colonel Orne , and Colonel Hancock , had been in session , on the day preceding the march of the troops , in the village of Menotomy , then part of the township of Cambridge , on the road to Lexington . The latter gentleman after the session was over had gone to Lexington . Mr Gerry and Mr Orne remained at the village ; the other members of the committee had dispersed . Some officers of the royal army had been sent out in advance , who passed through the village just before dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the appearance of similar detachments was not uncommon , these so far attracted the attention of Mr Gerry , that he despatched an express to Colonel Hancock , who with Samuel Adams was at Lexington . The messenger passed the officers by taking a by-path , and delivered his letter . The idea of personal danger does not seem to have made any strong impression on either of these gentlemen . Mr Hancock 's answer to Mr Gerry bears marks of the haste with which it was written , while it discovers that habitual politeness on the part of the writer , which neither haste or danger could impair . MR HANCOCK TO MR GERRY . " DEAR SIR , Lexington , April 18th , 1775 . " I am much obliged for your notice . It is said the officers are gone to Concord , and I will send word thither . I am full with you , that we ought to be serious , and I hope your decision will be effectual . I intend doing myself the pleasure of being with you to-morrow . My respects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANCOCK . " // Mr Gerry and Colonel Orne retired to rest without taking the least precaution against personal exposure , and they remained quietly in their beds , until the British advance were within view of the dwelling-house . It was a fine moonlight night , and they quietly marked the glittering of its beams on the polished arms of the soldiers , as the troops moved with the silence and regQlarity of accomplished discipline . The front passed on . When the centre were opposite to the house occupied by the committee , an officer and file of men were detached by signal , and marched towards it . It was not until this moment they entertained any apprehension of danger . While the officer was posting his files , the gentlemen found means by their better knowledge of the premises to escape , half dressed as they were , into an adjoining corn-field , where they remained concealed for more than an hour , until the troops were withdrawn . Every apartment of the house was searched " for the members of the rebel congress " ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But their property , and among other things a valuable watch of Mr Gerry 's , which was under his pillow , was not disturbed . ' - pp. 67-69 . Mr Gerry was one of the earliest to perceive the importance of organizing the naval strength of the country . While his friend John Adams , in the continental congress , was prompt in directing the attention of that body to the same subject , Mr Gerry , in the provincial congress of Massachusetts , submitted a proposal at an early period in 1775 , for a law to encourage the fitting out of armed vessels , and to provide for the adjudication of prizes . This was a step of no. common delicacy . The idea of a formal war , offensive as well as defensive , found but tardy entrance into the minds of the people . They easily conceived themselves authorized , by the law of nature and necessity , to defend themselves against the actual application of force ; but it was going much farther , to engage themselves in voluntary warfare , particularly a warfare against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were these scruples , that among the anecdotes illustrative of the opinions of the day and the manners of the people , we hear of American merchants , who , in fitting out their privateers to cruise against British commerce , opened an account with the king of England , in which he was regularly charged with the captures they suffered , and credited with the prizes they took . Mr Gerry was chairman of the committee , appointed to prepare the act to authorize privateering and establish admiralty courts . Governor Sullivan was another member of it ; // and on these two gentlemen devolved the task of drawing the act ; which they executed in a small room , under the belfry of the Watertown meeting-house , in which the provincial congress was holding its sessions . It was found necessary to pay regard to the scruples of those , who doubted whether such a measure might not be inconsistent with the allegiance still professed to the crown . This was certainly no easy task , but Mr Gerry said to some of these persons , in the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it , into some reasonable form . ' He accordingly undertook to frame the preamble ; and Governor Sullivan drew the act . The preamble ran in the following terms ; and we apprehend it would be hard to find a more pregnant whereas , in the annals of legislation. * Whereas the present administration of Great Britain , being divested of justice and humanity , and strangers to that magnanimity and sacred regard for liberty , which inspired their predecessors , have been endeavoring , through a series of years , to establish a system of despotism over the American colonies , and by their venal and corrupt measures , have so extended their influence over the British parliament , that by a prostituted majority , it is now become a political engine of slavery ;  --  and whereas the military tools of these our unnatural enemies , while restrained by the united forces of the American colonies from proceeding in their sanguinary career of devastation and slaughter , are infesting the seacoast with armed vessels , and daily endeavoring to distress the inhabitants , by burning their towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , and making captures of provision and other vessels , being the property of the said inhabitants ;  --  and whereas their majesties , King William and Queen Mary , by the royal charter of this colony , " for themselves , their heirs , and successors , did grant , establish , and ordain , that in the absence of the governor and lieutenant governor of the colony , a majority of the council shall have full power by themselves , or by any chief commander , or other officer or officers , to be appointed by them from time to time , for the special defence of their said province or territory , to assemble in martial array , and put in warlike posture the inhabitants of their said province or territory , and to lead and conduct them , and with them to encounter , expulse , resist , and pursue by force of arms , as well by sea as by land , within or without the limits of the said province or * There is more light thrown on one peculiarity of the Yankee character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be gathered from all the travellers in America , we have ever read . // territory ; and also to kill , slay , destroy , and conquer , by all fitting ways , enterprises , and means whatever , all and every such person and persons , as should , at any time thereafter , attempt or enterprise the destruction , invasion , detriment , or annoyance of their said province or territory , and to take and surprise , by all ways and means whatever , all and every person and persons , with their ships , arms , ammunition , and other goods , as should in a hostile manner invade or attempt the invading , conquering , or annoying of their said province or territory ; "  --  and whereas it is expressly resolved by the grand congress of America , " that each colony , at their own expense , make such provision by armed vessels or otherwise , as their respective assemblies , conventions , or committees of safety , shall judge expedient and suitable to their circumsta*nces and situations , for the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unlawful invasion , attacks , and depredations from cutters and ships of war ; " and it is the duty and interest of this colony to exert itself , as well for the purpose of keeping supplies from the enemy , as for those mentioned in the paragraphs of the charter and resolve now recited Therefore , for the more effectual carrying into execution the purposes aforesaid , ' &amp;c. pp. 505 , 506 . In connexion with this extract , our readers ought to turn to the volume , and peruse the letters of the late President Adams , preserved in the Appendix , on the subject of the origin of the American navy . It would be out of our power , did it fall within our present object , to pursue the analysis of this interesting volume . Almost every page of it contains matter , which the curious and patriotic student of our history must read with delight . The original letters of John and Samuel Adams , of Washington , of Jefferson , of Knox , of Dana , of King , and of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest degree of importance on the volume . There are fewer letters of Mr Gerry himself , than we could have wished . We account for their absence , on the supposition , that , in the great press of business , which devolved upon him , he had not time to reserve copies of many of his letters , and that the originals have not been returned to him or his representatives . This is a matter of some general interest in this country , at this moment , and one , therefore , we hope , on which we may be permitted to make a few remarks . In the literary republic of Europe , as far as we are acquainted , letters are considered a the property of their writers , and not of the persons to whom // they are addressed . The person , who writes them , sends them to his correspondent ( generally speaking ) for the sole purpose of being read by him . In the great majority of cases , private letters are good for nothing else ; and consequently it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residuary property in them . But the private letters of distinguished men , on public subjects , soon acquire a literary and a historical importance , and with it , a pecuniary value . To whom do they belong ? We answer , that , as far as we know , in the estimation of the literary world abroad , they belong to their writer or to his representatives . It is considered a matter of course , when an individual dies , unless some other disposition of his papers be made by himself , that the letters of his correspondents should be returned to their authors ; and equally a matter of course , that the letters , which he may himself have written , should be sent back by those , in whose possession they are , to the surviving representatives of the deceased , on whom devolves the care of his property and of his reputation . This course seems to us reasonable and just . Honor , in the first place , forbids the use of a letter , by the person to whom it is addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent him . if I publish my correspondent 's letter to me , unless with his express or easAily implied permission , I do an act by no means creditable . If injury result to bim by the publication , I have been guilty of unpardonable indiscretion . If I make the publication intentionally to injure him , I am guilty of the most detestable baseness . The man , who , intentionally to injure another , violates the confidence of a private correspondence , is an assassin , in all but the nerve which is wanting to plunge a dagger into his neighbor 's back . The quality of the action is not essentially changed , when performed by the representatives of the original parties . But the case of more common occurrence is one , which does not involve a departure from the rules of honor . It is simply that of regarding all the letters found in a person 's possession at his decease , as his property and not that of their writers ; and this idea has been in this country , in some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the subject . How desirable would it have been to the respectable gentleman , who has favored the public with this life of Vice-President Gerry , to have had all his letters in his possession ? Or take the case of Mr Jefferson . Suppose that he // had not been in the habit of retaining copies of his letters ; and that they existed only in the originals , and these scattered over the continent . His family would , in that case , be deprived of a very considerable portion of the richest fruits of his mind , and of the most lucrative remains from his pen . Even as it is , the pecuniary value of any publication his family may wish to make , is essentially impaired , by the practice of freely publishing his letters , on the part of those , who happen to have them in possession . It will not be thought , that we intend any censure applicable to single cases where this has been done . It is often done from good motives , to raise the fame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratify contemporary curiosity ; but almost always at the expense of the interests of those , in whom whatever value such letters possess , ought to be considered as vested . After the last remark , it will be doubly unnecessary to observe , that no covert censure is intended on the introduction into the present work of the letters of the contemporaries of Vice-President Gerry . Colonel Austin has pursued not merely the course which usage has sanctioned ; but that which necessity and duty imposed upon him , in the want of the letters of his venerable relation . Till a general practice of mutual restitution shall be adopted , it would be the height of injustice to enforce it upon an individual . The letters of the conternporaries of Mr Gerry , which the present volume contains , are many of them of the highest interest , especially those of Samuel and John Adams . We can not resist the temptation of quoting one of the latter . The event has hitherto shown , that the fears entertained by its venerable writer , in common with almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the sentiments expressed show the real political principles of a much misrepresented man . MR JOHN ADAM5 TO MR GERRY . " April 25 , 1785. * * * * What is to be done with the Cincinnati ? Is that order of chivalry , that inroad upon our first principle , equality , to be connived at ? It is the deepest piece of cunning yet attempted . It is sowing the seeds of all that European courts wish to grow up among us , viz , of vanity , ambition , corruption , discord , and sedition . Are we so dim-sighted as not to see , that the taking away the hereditary descent of it will not prevent its baneful influence ? Who will think of preventing the son from wearing // a ribbon and a bit of gold that his father wore ? Mankind love to see one child at least of every beloved and respected father possessed of his estate , his office , &amp;c after his decease . Besides , when once the people begin to think these marks rewards , these marks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks should not be adopted in any country where there is virtue , love of country , love of labor . When virtue is lost , ambition suc* ceeds . Then indeed ribbons and garters become necessary , but never till then . Then indeed these should be public rewards conferred by the state , the civil sovereign , not private men or bodies . I have been asked , why I have not written against it ? Can it be necessary for me to write upon such a thing ? 1 wrote twenty years ago some papers which have been called an Essay on the Feudal Law , in which my sentiments and the sentiments of our ancestors are sufficiently expressed , concerning all such distinctions and all orders of chivalry and nobility . But , sir , while reputations are so indiscreetly puffed , while thanks and statues are so childishly awarded , and the greatest real services are so coldly received , I had almost said censured , we are in the high road to have no virtues left , and nothing but ambition to reward . Ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power must keep them company . My countrymen give reputations to individuals that are real tyrannies . No man dares resist or oppose them . No wonder then that such reputations introduce chivalry , &amp;c. without opposition , though without authority . The cry of " gratitude , gratitude , " is animal magnetism ; it bewitches all mankind , and has established every tyranny , imposture , and usurpation that ever existed upon earth ; so true are those words of Machiavel , " Not ingratitude , but too much love , is the constant fault of the people . " This is a subject that requires a volume ; and you see I am in haste . I could not have believed , if I had not seen it , that our officers could have adopted such a scheme , or the people , the legislatures , or congress have submitted to it one moment . I do not wonder at a Marquis de la Fayette or a Baron Steuben ; they were born and bred to such decorations and the taste for them . From the moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and consented to by congress , I suspected that some such project was in contemplation . Awful , my friend , is the task of the intelligent advocate for liberty . The military spirit , the ecclesiastical spirit , the commercial spirit , and innumerable other evil spirits are eternally devising mischief to his cause and disturbing his repose . It is a constant warfare from the cradle to the grave without comfort , thanks , or rewards , and is always overcome at last . Is not this institution against our confederation ? Is it not against the declarations of rights in several of the states ? Is it // not an act of sovereignty , disposing and creating of public rewards , presumptuously enterprised by private gentlemen ? Is the assembly a lawful assembly ? Is it not cruel to call this a club for private friendship , or a society for charity for officers ' widows and children ? Would even such a society be lawful without the permission of the legislature ? Is it not substituting honor for virtue in the infancy of a republic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pernicious in all governments , but especially in ours ? Is it not an effectual subversion of our equality ? Inequalities of riches can not be avoided as long as nature gives inequality of understanding and activity . And these inequalities are not unuseful . But artificial inequalities of decorations , birth , and title not accompanying public trust , are those very inequalities which have exterminated virtue and liberty , and substituted ambition and slavery in all ages and countries . I do not wonder that the word republican is odious and unpopular throughout the world . I do not wonder that so few , even-of the great writers , have admired this form of government . Plato himself ; I am fully persuaded from his writings , was not a republican . It is the best of governments while the people are republicans , that is , virtuous , simple , and of independent spirit . But when the people are avaricious , ambitious , and vain , instead of being virtuous , poor , and proud , it is not . A republican is an equivocal title ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss , a Genevan , and an Englishman , are all called republicans . Among all these shades you will scarcely find the true color . Our countrymen may be the nearest ; but there is so much wealth among them and such an universal rage of avarice , that I often fear they will only make their real republicans miserable for a few years , and then become like the rest of the world . If this appears to be their determination , it is not worth the while of you and me to die martyrs to singular notions . You are young and may turn fine gentleman yet . I am too old , and therefore will retire to Pen 's Hill , The world forgetting , by the world forgot .
