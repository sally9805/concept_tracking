txt ART . VIL. - Recoilections of the Last Ten Years , passed in occa* stonal Residences and . Journeyings in the Valley of the . Mississippi , from Pittsburg and the . II*Iissouri to the Gulf of Jllenico , and from Florida to the Spanish Frontier ; in a Series of Letters to the Rev , fames Flint , of Salem , . Massachusetts . By TIMOTHY FLINT , Principal of the Seminary of Rapide , Louisiana . Svo. pp. 395 . Boston . Cummings* Hilliard , &amp;* Co . TrHIs volume has been perused by us with great pleasure , and with much respect for the writer 's talents and character . We have risen from it , indeed with a stronger sympathy , than we should wish to have occasion to feel with the author , in the hardships and sufferings endured by him and his family ; with more vivid conceptions than we before possessed , of the peculiar aspect of the grand and beautiful features of the country he describes ; with more enlarged views of its natural resources , of the extent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general character of our fellow citizens of those vast and fertile regions , that border upon the Mississippi , and its mighty tributary streams from the east and the west . That wide portion of our country , which is somewhat vaguely denominated the Valley of the Mississippi , ' is daily growing in importance and interest . It presents a fruitful theme of anxious contemplation and prophetic conjecture to the statesman and philanthropist , as the destined theatre of future events and exhibitions of human character , of the most solemn import to the // welfare of mankind ; as the scene of the future trial of those broad principles of freedom in governments , and of toleration in religion , assumed as the basis of our national constitution , never before put to the test of actual experiment in any country . In that region it is to be determined whether , with the increase of our wealth , and the full developement of our physical resources , our intellectual and moral progress will be adequate to maintain our republican forms of government , and whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union , will be felt to be strong enough to keep us together , when the preponderance of population and power shall have passed far to the west of the Alleganies . It is an interesting country , as it will long continue to offer a wide field for the emigrating and enterprisin* population of the older states , and as the great receptacle of the shoals of foreigners , good and bad , that yearly cross the seas to seek , under the tutelar genius of American liberty , an asylum from the oppression , the poverty , or the justice of their native country . It is an interesting region from its physical conformation , its magnificent rivers and forests , its vast alluvions and prairies , its partially explored natural history , the unrivalled fertility of its soil , the facility and richness of its agriculture ; as not only abounding with the most valuable staple products of the Atlantic states , but as the land of the sugar cane , and to be one day the land of the vine and the olive , as it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first discovery of that country was by the French from Canada . In the latter part of the seventeenth century ( 1683 ) , three adventurers , following the chain of the lakes , penetrated the wilderness to the junction of the Illinois with the Mississippi , which they descended to its mouth . They gave the name of Louisiana to the boundless forests east and west of the Mississippi , in compliment to Louis the Fourteenth , in whose name they took possession of the country . In process of time , different positions , from the mouth far up the Mississippi , were occupied by French colonists , and in 1717 the city of New Orleans was laid out , and its building commenced . Of the travellers , who visited and described that country , the earliest and most distinguished were foreigners , who saw it before its pathless forests and boundless solitudes had resounded to the stroke of the AngloAmerican emigrant 's axe , while its sparse and languishing settlements were restricted to the borders of the rivers , and under the ancient French and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American government , under the administration of Mr Jefferson , little was known of the Western country , beyond the American settlements , in the new states of Ohio and Kentucky ; for little interest had been felt respecting it , among the people of the old states . Volney , and some others , had published their observations , from which we had learned little more , than that it was a vast wilderness , occupied by wandering hordes of savages ; and Chateaubriand had peopled it with beings of his own creation , and had pictured it to our imagination , as the region of romance . Since it became the theatre of enterprise to the adventurous and active citizens of the older states , we have had accounts of it , more or less extended , from various sources , but , for the most part , from interested speculators and land jobbers . Or if a man of intelligence and liberal views , and capable of accurate and philosophic observation , gave us notices of that country , he either had not resided there a sufficient time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or come in contact so nearly and familiarly with the various gradations and characters of the inhabitants , as to enable him to satisfy our curiosity , upon many interesting points of inquiry , relating to a region , which , though under the same government and laws , remained , till within a short period , a kind of terra incognita to the good people on this side of the mountains . Brackenridge 's Views of Louisiana , Darby 's geographical tract , the more recent work of Schoolcraft , and Lon0 's Expeditions , have contributed essentially to enlarge our knowledge , and correct our misapprehensions , of the Western country and people . Still , of a country so rapidly filling up , and of a population receiving such constant and heterogeneous accessions , the changes must be so great , that we eagerly welcome an author who b*ngs more recent information of it . Mr Flint is not one of the common herd of travel writers and journal makers , whop as he remarks travel post , or are wafted through a country in a steamboat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to know all about it . ' His opportunities for acquainting himself with the region and the people he describes , were such , as with the other requisites , of which he has proved himself possessed , would authorize any man to undertake the task , which he assumed , of writing for the public , as well as for his friends . I have , ' says he , in his introductory letter , drunk of every considerable stream , that yields tribute to the Mississippi , far from the parent channel ; have traversed the // country in all directions ; have resided a considerable time in the northern , middle , and southern divisions , and in the disehar e of duties , which necessarily brought me in contact with all classes of the inhabitants ; so that , as far as long and familiar ehserva. * tion of the country can qualify one to describe it , I am so quaii* fled . ' What is more to the purpose , his intellectual , moral , and literary qualifications fitted him to avail himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to his narrative , which such qualifications only can impart to a work of this kind . He unites properties which do not often Theet in the same mind , a capacity for discriminating and philosophic observation , a true tact and common sense logic , with the imagination , feeling , and romantic sentiment of the poet and novelist . He is manifestly a true and ardent lover of nature , and has shown himself , throughout his hook , alive to the new , magnificent , and diversified scenery , which , in the wide range of his survey , presented itself to his observation . His deep and vivid sympathy with the varying aspects of the physical universe , which opened to his view in the Western world , gives to his narrative one of its most peculiar and engaging features . There is a truth , a distinctness , a graphic fidelity in his descriptions , which make the reader feel himself to be a present spectator of the objects and occurrences he describes . Nothing is more observable , than the facility with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences of the surrounding scenery , to the chan *es of the elements , and to the character of the events through which he passes and the circumstances in which he is placed . As he feels strongly and deeply , he heightens , no doubt , by the colorings of his imagination , the hues of the gay or sad vicissitudes which befell him . Yet there is an air of good faith and reality in what he relates , which convinces us , that we may listen to him with the confidence , with which a man , at his fireside , receives the communications of a friend of tried integrity , telling the tale of his eventful wanderings and various fortunes after an absence of many years . It is not strange that a mind , obviously so susceptible of enjoyment and suffering in their extremes , should frequently dwell in retrospect upon the painful events of his ten years ' residence and journeyings , ' and upon the depressing gloom , and the sickness of the heart , resulting from disappointed expectations , frustrated projects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strange land , remote from the succour and sympathy // of the friends he had left . With this propensity of the author we are not displeased , but think l1is work derives much interest from the intimate acquaintance , to which it admits us , with his personal character and fortunes . it has the peculiar charm of an autobio*raphy , written by a man of cultivated intellect , disclosing his thoughts and the hidden workings of hi ssoul , under various novel circumstances . it is but just , moreover , to remember , what the author states in his introductory letter . If in the following pages , the feelings of the writer occupy too conspicuous a place in the view of that severe ordeal , in which the square and compass are applied to works of this kind , let it be remembered , that these pages were chiefly intended for the eye of friends , to whom , it was well known , such would be the most interesting parts of the work . ' We perceive nothing like repining in the mention he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the sustaining spirit with which he was borne np under the pressure of calamitous circumstances . We have admired the elasticity of mind , which enabled him to rise from one disease and disaster after another , and to prosecute his objects , still receding as he advanced , through so many discouragements , and by so frequent and distant removals . At the same time , nothing important escapes his observation . He forgets himself , and all that is depressing in his condition , when a fine view upon the rivers or the prairies , a bland atmosphere , a beautiful day , or a moonlight scene appeals to his love of nature ; or when he meets wTith any novelty of character , or falls among people , with whom he can enjoy the mental restorative of endeared society , and the interchange of the amiable courtesies of life . He could be happy in the rude cabins of the backwoodsinert . And he bears ample testimony to the kindness and hospitality , to the rough exterior indeed , but substantial honesty and *vort1*incss of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One valuable effect of the work among us will be , to allay local jealousies , soften prejudices , correct misapprehensions , and divest the Western character of many unfavorable associations , with which it has been too long connected in this quarter ; and to strengthen sentiments of mutual esteem between the people of the East and the XVest . The author goes little into detail . He does not deal in statistics , in speculations upon political economy , in exact admeasurements , numbers , and tables . His concern is chiefly with the // physical and moral aspects of the country ; the general effects of social labor and enterprise in a region , recently the domain of savages and wild beasts ; the state of society , the progress of knowledge , morals , religion , refinement ; and the ch* racteristics of the Western people , resulting from their peculiar position and circumstances . His readers will sometimes wish , that he had been more minute , and had filled up more completely some of his outlines and unfinished sketches . His disquisitions , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun out with a heavy prolixity . Those upon the character of the Indians and negroes , and their distinctive qualities , and upon the advantages and disadvantages in the condition of the New England emigrant in the Western country , are the principal ones ; and though we may not agree with all his views , yet his observations are full of interest . He carries the reader along with him to the last , if not always instructed , yet seldom displeased , often delighted , and never fatigued . We make haste to point out the course of the author 's journeyings , during the ten years , the Recollections of which he has embodied in his work . He leaves the land of his fathers , ' and the place in which he had performed a laborious and secluded ministry ' of fourteen years , in October , 1815 , travelling leisurely with his family in the common route through Philadelphia , and over the Allegany hills , to Pittsburg . After a short stay in that place , he passes down the Ohio to Wheeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat again , and arrives at Marietta . At the close of November he departs for Cincinnati , where he passes the winter . In March he performs a tour of observation and preaching through part of Ohio , the southern frontier of Indiana , and part of the state of Kentucky , as far as Lexington ; returns to Cincinnati , and in the middle of April embarks with his family on board a keelboat ; enters the Mississippi on the 28th of the same month , and on the 24th of May arrives at St Louis . In September he leaves St Louis for St Charles , as a better situation for the discharge of his wide range of missionary duties . Here he remains , variously occupied , till the spring of 1819 , nearly three years , when , induced by flattering encouragements , he goes down the Mississippi to Arkansas . There every thing proves adverse , his family fall sick , and , after passing a gloomy summer , he reascends the Mississippi , touching at St Francisville , and spending the winter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Madrid and Jackson , when he explored the counties of Cape Girardean , St Genevieve , and the adjacent country . He returns in the autumn of 1821 to St Charles , where , with all the members of his family except one , he is arrested by severe and protracted illness . There he remains till the autumn of 1822 , when , having received the requisite means from his New England friends , he descends the Mississippi to New Orleans , spends the winter there , opeas a school the summer following on the Florida side of Lake Pontchartrain , returns to New Orleans in the autumn , and while there receives an invitation to take charge of the seminary of Rapide , in Alexandria , on Red river . At this station he remains , till a broken constitution obliges him , in 1825 , to suspend his duties , and revisit the place of his nativity to recruit his health . From the nature of the work , it would be difficult , if not impracticable to give our readers more than a general idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , from vivid recollections of what had been most deeply traced upon the memory , the only order seems to , be that of the ideas and remernbrances , associated with the places , through which he passed , and in which he sojourned . Without any very distinct method , he passes , by easy and natural transitions , from grave to gay , ' from the most exhilirating to the most gloomy descriptions , from verdant savannahs to swamps of funereal cypress , from the mountains to the valleys , from the void waste ' to the city full , ' from the recent villaoe to the s the wilderness . a olitary log house in He at one time paints to us the boundless forests in the mellow and fading splendor of autumn , or renovated in all the exuberant verdure and lavish bloom of a Western spring . Then the canvass exhibits the river craft , and that unique race , the boatmen of the western waters . We now see them floating at their ease down the stream , or with the pole , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mighty current of the Mississippi and its tributai'ies . By and by we see , ascending and descending the same streams , as by enchantment , the rapid steamboat . The column of smoke , the gay streamers , the crowded deck , the equable movement of the gliding pageant , pass under our eye . The children from the shore look with eager gaze upon the imposing spectacle , as it marches by in its path of foam . Level bottoms and towering bluffs alternate before us . We see the dead trees still standing among the new // villages , springing from the bosom of the wilderness , or we behold from an eminence , the lately arrived emigrant setting himself down in the beautiful and lovely solitude , which he has chosen for his residence . The scene is changed , and we are introduced to the rough , but frank and hospitable backwoodsman , with his rifle in hand , his dogs at his heels , all girt for the chase , ' receiving his visitant with little appearance , but with all th** reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great and little men of the West , the Indian , the negro , the fanatic , the venerable chronicler of the olden time , ' the fresh and lovely xose of the prairie , ' successively pass in review before us . Many amusing , and some affecting anecdotes are related . The classical allusions are numerous and happy . The reflections are often original and sensible , and indicate a mind accustomed to hold large discourse , looking before and after , ' and rich in its own resources . We are , at length wafted from the upper country to the busy mart of New Orleans , and soon after find the author living delightfully in the pine woods . The next letter brings us hack to New England , and we are taken upon a pleasant trip with the author and his friend to Saratoga springs , a review of which , with remarks upon the changes in the physical and moral aspect of the land of his birth , as they struck him after an absence of ten years , in a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . In selecting such passages as afford the most favorable specimens of the author 's manner , we find so many of equal merit , that we are perplexed in our choice . The following is a description of the bright side in a picture of the boatmen 's life . After remarking , that it is not strange that this mode of life should have irresistible attractions for the youn* people who live on the banks of the river , he continues ; The boats float by their dwellings on beautiful spring mornings , when the verdant forest , the mild and delicious temperature of the air , the deli*htfnl azure of the sky of this country , the fine bottom on the one hand , and the romantic bluff on the other , the broad and smooth stream rolling calmly down the forest , and floating the boat gently forward-all these circumstances harmonize in the excited youthful imagination . The boatmen are dancing to the violin on the deck of their boat . They scatter their wit among the girls on the shore , who come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boat glides on until it disappears behind a point of wood . At this moment , perhaps , the // bugle , with which all the boats are provided , strikes up its note in the distance over the water . These scenes , and these notes , echoing from the bluffs of the beautiful Ohio , have a charm for the imagination , which , although I have heard it a thousand times repeated , and at all hours and in all positions , is even to me always new and always delightful . ' pp. 15 , 16 . We take next our author 's account of the Arcadian beauty and simplicity of the emigrant 's establishment , upon the rich lands in Ohio . In making remoter journeys from the town , beside the rivulets , and in the little bottoms , not yet in cultivation , I discerned the smoke rising in the woods , and heard the strokes of the axe , the tinkling of bells , and the baying of dogs , and saw the newly arrived emigrant either rai*ing his log cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me more pleasing reflections , a happier train of associations , to contemplate these beginnings of social toil in the wide wilderness , than , in our more cultivated regions , to come in view of the most sumptuous mansion . Nothing can be more beautiful than these little bottoms , upon which these emigrants , if I may so say , deposite their household gods . Springs burst forth in the intervals between the high and low grounds . The trees and shrubs are of the most beautiful kind . The brilliant redhird is seen flitting among the shrubs , or , perched on a tree , seems welcoming , in her mellow notes , the emigrant to his abode . Flocks of paroquets are glittering among the trees , and grey squirrels are skipping from branch to branch . In the midst of these primeval scenes , the patient and laborious father fixes his family . In a few weeks they have reared a comfortable cabin , and other outbuildings . Pass this place in two years , and you will see extensive fields of corn and wheat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds , the guarantee of present abundant subsistence and of future luxury . Pass it in ten years , and the log buildings will have disappeared . The shrubs and forest trees will be gone . The Arcadian aspect of humble and retired abundance and comfort , will have given place to a brick house , with accompaniments like those , that attend the same kind of house in the older countries . By this time the occupant , who came there with , perhaps , a small sum of money , and moderate expectations , from humble life , and with no more than a common school education , has been made , in succession , member of the assembly , justice of the peace , and finally county judge . ' I admit that the first residence among the trees affords the most agreeable picture to my mind ; and that there is an inexpressible charm in the pastoral simplicity of those years , before // pridc and self consequence have banished the repose of their Eden , and when you witness the first struggles of social toil with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 . The author 's account of the fleet of boats with their contents , which he saw at the mouth of the Bayou , near New Madrid , on their way to New Orleans , will give the reader an idea of the products of the uppdi country . In the spring , one hundred boats have been numbered , that landed in one day at the mouth of the Bayou , at New Madrid . I have strolled to the point on a spring evening , and seen them arriving in fleets . The boisterous gaiety of the hands , the congratulations , the moving picture of life on board the boats , in the numerous animals , large and small , which they carry , their different loads , the evidence of the increasing agriculture of the country above , and more than all , the immense distances which they have already come , and those which they have still to go , afforded to me copious sources of meditation . You can name no point from the numerous rivers of the Ohio and the Mississippi , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place there are boats loaded with planks , from the pine forests of the southwest of New York . In another quarter are the Yankee notions of Ohio . From Kentucky , pork , flour , whiskey , hemp , tobacco , bagging , and bale rope . From Tennessee there are the same articles , together with great quantities of cotton . From Missouri and Illinois , cattle and horses , the same articles generally as from Ohio , together with peltry and lead from Missouri . Some boats are loaded with corn in the ear and in bulk ; others with barrels of apples and potat6es . Some have loads of cider , and what they call cider royal , ' or cider that has bt*en strengthened by boiling or freezing . There are dried fruits ; every kind of spirits manufactured in these regions , and in short , the products of the ingenuity and agriculture of the whole upper country of the West . They have come from regions , thousands of miles apart . They have floated to a corrimon point of union . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fluttering over the roofs , as an invariable appendage . The chanticleer raises his piercing note . The swine utter their cries . The cattle low . The horses trample , as in their stables . There are boats fitted on purpose , and k*aded entirely with turkies , that , having little else to do , gobble most furiously . The hands travel about fromboat to boat , make inquiries and acquaintances , and form alliances to yield mutual assistance to each other , on their descent from this to New Orleans . After an hour or two passed in this way , they spring on shore to raise the wind in // town . It is well for the people of the village , if they do not become riotous in the course of the evening ; in which case J have seen the most summary and strong measures taken . About midnight the uproar is all hushed . The fleet unites once more at Natches , or New Orleans , and , although they live on the same river , they may , perhaps , never meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first dawn , the but les souu ( l . Every thing in and about the boats , that has life , is in motion . The boats , in half an hour , are all under way . In a little while they have all disappeared , and nothing is seen , as before they came , but the regular current of the river . ' pp. * 03 , 1 04 . The following story of a desperate aa ( l successful defence of a log house , against a party of hostile Indians , partakes a little of the marvellous ; but it is well told . The name of the hero in question whom the author knew was Baptiste Roy , a Frenchman , who solicited , and , I am sorry to say , in vain , a compensation for his bravery from Con*ress . It occurred at G6te sans Dessein , on the Missouri . A numerous band of northern savages , amounting to four hundred , beset the garrison house , into which he , his wife , and another man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder , lead , and four rifles in the house . They immediately began to fire upon the Indians . The wife melted and moulded the lead , and assisted in loading , occasionally taking her shot with the other two . Every Indian that approached the house was sure to fall . The wife relates , that the guns would soon become too much heated to hold in the hand . Water was necessary to cool them . It was , I think , on the second day of the siege , that Roy 's assistant was killed . He became impatient to look on the scene of execution , and see what they had done . lie put his eye to the port hole , and a well aimed shot destroyed him . The Indians perceived that their shot had taken effect , and gave a yell of exultation . They were encouraged by the momentary slackening of the fire , to approach the house , and fire it over the heads of Roy and his wife . lie deliberately mounted the roof , knocked off the burning boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What must have been the nights of this husband and wife ? After four days of unavailing siege , the Indi*ns gave a yell , exclaimed , that the house was a " grand medicine , " meaning , that it was charmed and impregnable , and went away . They left behind forty bodies to attest the marksmanship and steadiness of the besieged , and a peck of balls , collected from the logs of the house . ' pp. l6*2 , 163. // We close our extracts with the history of the rose of the prairie , ' a Miss Jamieson , of whose parents the author makes affectionate mention in his letters . She was long a pupil in my family . From the first of her residence with us she was an object of general attention , for she was beautiful , the rose of the prairie , and she was at the most interesting period of life ; and she was gay and untamed in the possession of an uncontrolled flow of spirits , and as buoyant as the fawn of her own prairie . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ours . When she first resided with us she was disposed to consider our rules as odious , and our restric* tions as tyranny . But in the progress of her studies and of more mature acquaintance , she became tranquil , satisfied , and studious exhibiting an affectionate submission , that endeared her to us all . She soon became to me as one of my children . A conversation , which I had with her , during that severe sickness , which I have mentioned , will long be remembered in my family . Contrary to all expectations , I recovered , and had the satisfaction to see the pensive thoughtfulness , that had long been gathering on her brow , assume the form of piety and religion . When we were about to depart from that region for the Arkansas , her parting from my family was affectionate and solemn . I crossed the Missouri with her , and listened with delight to her views , her resolutions , and the plans , which she proposed for her future life . You will believe , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spirit of romance . But she laid down , as the outline , the steady and unalterable guidance of religion . The counsels which Ii gave her , as we were passing the stream , were of course paternal and affectionate , for I expected to meet her no more . ' Why should I refrain from giving a few more details of this interesting young woman , through fear that this page should take the form of romance . ' My mind and my memory suggest in the case of this young person , so dear to my family , far more than I shall relate , and instead of wishing to color , I shall be obliged to touch only , the remaining incidents of her short career . There resided in her father 's family a very respectable young man . I-Ic was rather silent and reserved in his manners , but thinking , intelligent , and of a very different cast from the young men in his vicinity . Still , lie was not exactly calculated to win the affections of a beautiful young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one obhiquity , and that had been caused by the perusal of the novels of the day . He was not her hero , her " beau ideal . " We knew his worth . We knew his true and honorable affection , truly and honorably expressed . He was in a respectable employment , // and looked to the very lucrative and respectable office , which he has since held in the country of St. Louis . Mrs. F. who knew the wishes of her parents , labored the point with her , that the prospect of good sense , fidelity , tried affection , and honorable support , were the best guarantees of happiness in the wedded state . It was not easy to dispel the day dreams , which she had fostered from the idle reading of the day . But with the growing influence of religion , there grew up also more sober and just surveys of life and its duties , and a stronger wish to gratify her parents in the first desire of their hearts . She was engaged to this young man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard with great pleasure , that she was *hortly to reward his honorable and persevering attachment , with her hand . The wedding day was fixed , and all was sober expectation of tranquillity and happiness . The charming and endeared eldest daughter was to be fixed near the plantation of her father . Another square with its compartments of verdure was to be struck out of the brown of the heath . I envy no man , if it be not the father that so settles beloved children around him . This young man , in view of his prospects , probably envied no man . She was suddenly siezed with one of the terrible fevers of the country , which riot so fatally in a frame so elastic and healthful as hers . It ought to cheer us that we may lay hold of a resource , , which will enable us to triumph over human passions and fears , over love and death . The sincerity of her religion was tested in this way . ' She called her lover to her bed , and took of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , but sweet hymn , so common in that country , and in which she delighted when in health ; " The day is past and gone , " &amp;c . She bade them farewell , and closed her eyes in peace upon all the joyful prospects that were opening before her . Circumstances , not necessary to detail , compelled them to make her bridal dress her shroud . The father , the mother , soon followed this daughter , too dearly loved , too deeply lamented . I have been in view of this desolate habitation , but I have not wished to enter it . I have felt more intensely than ever , as I saw these cabins again , the pathetic close of the story of " Paul and Virginia . " * pp. 194-197 . An obvious fault in this work is the confusion , which the reader experiences in its perusal , arising from the circumstance , that the author seems sometimes to be writin0 at Alexandria , sometimes in New England , and at other times it is difficult to conjecture where . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same word is often repeated un // gracefully in the same sentence , where a synonyme would save the awkwardness , and express the sense equally well . The threadbare quotation , longing , lingering look behind , ' comes upon us something like half a ( lozell times . Many parts of the work bear evident marks of haste in the composition . We notice fhese , not as flagrant faults , but as blemishes , which a little more attention , or careful revision would have prevented . The author 's doctrine , that the slaves in Louisiana are the happiest people there , and in generalfar more so than their masters , ' is extraordinary , to sa*r the least of it . If such be the true state of things , the wonder i ; * that the masters are not wise enough to change places with their slaves , and grasp for themselves the felicity of servitude . Why be the wretched master , when it is so easy to turn the tables , and become the happy slave ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
