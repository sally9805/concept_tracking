Svo , 1816. // some other writers of that class , should be reprinted in this country . It was thought that an undertaking of this kind would be well received , and might ho expected 4o produce a heneacial and permanent effect upon our literature6 Taylor Was selected as the most popular of these writers , and the work which stands at the head of this article was published in this town . But the experiment failed ; the edition passed slowly from the hands of the publishers , and the original design has been given up . Many of our literary men lamented this circumstance , as indicative of a bad taste among us , and some regretted it the vuore , as it seeme ( l to them a rejection of the remedy , which would be likely to correct the eviL It will scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points ; and it is equally certain that many , both here and in England , whose information and good sense should give great weight to their opinions , believe that its defects might be corrected , and the public taste purified and reformed , by the study of works like those of Taylor an ( l his contemporaries . There are others who contimie firm in their adherence to the writers of Addison 's school , and will not admit that they have produced , or can produce , an injurious effect upon the character of mind and literature . Both of these opinions have the sanction of high authority , and it may be worth while to examine which of them be wisest , and with what limitations that should be adopted , which , on the whole , we find reason to prefer . We conceive it to be the true and legitimate object of litera. ture , to improve the mind , to fill it with that knowledge which is power ; not so much by adding to its stores , as by enlarging its faculties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that is rather the business of science , but to form an intellectual habit , which shall be sound , healthy , and vigorous . . When the literature of any age or county seems calculated to produce this effect , we should consider it valuable and excellent ; when , on the contrary , it appears to enfeeble or distort the mind , when its prevailing spirit resists the natural expansion and development of the intellectual faculties , we should pronounce it to he faulty amid mischievous .. Let us determine by this criterion , whether we would havethe minds of our countrymen imurtured and disciplined by a literature formed-upon the model ot ' *Taylor and his contemporaries , or upon that of Queen Anne 's wits . // If we compare the literature of England , in the beginning of the last century , with that of the age immediately preceding , we shall find that it has much less strength and much more polish ; that vigour and originality were exchanged for excessive refinement ; that it had heen rough and rude , but gigantic in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature ; that it became gentlemanly and courtierlike , effeminate and weak . Its great fault , at the peFiod mentioned , is a want of life and energy , which is precisely what we should have expected from the unfortunate mistake of its creators and their followers , in preferring cold and spiritless correctness , and faultless mediocrity , to the unrestrained and unsubdued vigour of a strong and independent mind . The faults of their immediate predecessors , with regard to style , were ruggedness , extreme inequality , and the occasional indistinctness , incident to that period in a language , in which the meaning of many words remains as yet unfixed . These faults they anxiously and successfully avoided ; and substituted for them a polished and wearisome monotony , and an elaborate exactness and perspicuity , which certainly weakened their language , and perhaps narrowed their thoughts . Their minds seem to have acted within narrow limits ; their reflections and inferences have too often little of origi .. nality , comprehensiveness , or power . Very much afraid of committing themselves , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be l ) laced in a ridiculous light ; hardly wishing to delight , they were contented when they amused th' imagination , or roused the reasoning faculties to slight and momentary exertions , without offirnding against the laws of* good sense or of good taste . There is nothing in their works which could be taken away without lessening their value ,  --  . - hut there is nothing there which tells of a genius , * hose native elasticity forced it into action ; of minds which could not be restrained from spreading abroad their rich and overflowing stores . This school of literature commenced with Sir William Temple , the first English author with whom we are acquainted , whose language is uniformly harmonious and polished . In this respect he loses little by comparison withinore modern writers , and it is somewhat remarkable that his book upon the Netherlands is so little read that it seems to have lost its rank among standa4 'd English classics . It is writteiu // in a chaste and simple , but elaborate style , closely resembling that which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is moreover full of information , which we find no where else , but in those who have borrowed from him . He should certainly be considered as belonging to this school , if not as its founder , as in ten years after his death , his peculiar style was adopted and perfected by the writers of the Tatler , Spectator , and Guardian . The language had by this time become more settled and determinate , without having lost much of its richness and variety ; and passages may be fiund in the works of the last mentioned writers , of exquisite beauty , uniting perhaps as much of strength , perspicuity , and simplicity , as the nature of the language will ever permit ; yet we do not regard any of them as very great men , or any of their works as displaying uncommon intellectual vigour . The poetry of that day was very analogous to the prose* sensible , correct , polished , and somewhat epigrammatic . It is a fashion with writers of a certain class to deny that there was then any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their assertions are too broad . Pope was a poet , and a very great poet , but unluckily a much greater wit . It was fortunate for his reputation , that he lived in an age prepared to admire the agreeable and witty style , which he carried to such perfection . It is generally believed , that the peculiar character of the literature of that age , was owing to the French taste , introduced with Charles II . This circumstance however could not , of itself , have affected , the literary taste of a nation in so short a time , and should , we think , be regarded rather as an incident favourable to the change , than as its principal cause . It has been sometimcs referred to what has been called the revulsion of feeling , which naturally took place , at this period ; when the stern and chilling fanaticism of the republicans suddenly ceased its hard and heavy pressure upon the spirits of men , and the gloom and austerity , which marked the court of an usurper who felt these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged for the joy , festivity , and licentiousness , which surrounded Charles II , and seemed almost to emanate from his person . The gaiety and vivacity then suddenly infused into English poetry may be attributed to this . cause , hut it was wholly insufficicnt to produce so great a change in the character of English literature , as that which . // took place between the ages of Bacon , Taylor , *nd Barrow , and that of Addison and Swift . Another and a far more efficient cause had been long at work , in giving a new character to English literature , and had brought men 's minds into such a state , that they were ready to bow to a false and factitious taste , like that of France at that period . We allude to the great increase of literary men , both of the reading and writing class , and to the formation of a literary profession-not to say trade-such as could not have existed in the ages , anterior to the art of printing ; which had been growing up , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in question first reached its height . In proportion as books were easily and rapidly mul .. tiplied , knowledge became a comparatively easy attainment , and reading a cheap amusement ; accordingly the class of readers , before confined to a few , whose situation was peciiliarly favourable , or whose thirst for knowledge overcame all difficulty , increased gradually to an almost unlimited extent , and comprehended all but the very lowest ranks in society . When a book was a rarity , readers were few and far between ; ' they were not numerous enough , nor closely enough connected , to know or exert their power . He who read for his amusement , was grateful for his pleasure to its authors ; and if he studied with a higher object , if the consciousness of talent urged him to strive for the privileges and rewards of learning , he willingly paid to those who had preceded him in his path the deference and admiration he hoped one day himself to receive . Never perhaps , but in the golden days of Grecian literature , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they exerted such extensive and powerful influence , as during the dark ages . There were fe'v whose intellectual energies were strong enough to overcome the obstacles with which the scarcity of books and the general character of the age obstructed the path of the aspirant to literary fame ; but he , who succeeded in spreading his fame beyond the walls of his monastery or college , found the toil requisite to climb the steep amply repaid by the eminence of its summit , and the security of the tenure by which he held his station there . All this , both the previous difficulty and the subsequent reward , was exactly adapted to the encouragement of great minds and to the conception and execution of grand 1e*igns ; for it gave hardihood to the intellectual character , and freedom // and confidence to its efforts . In the ages immediately following the invention of printing , before learning had lost its rani and consequence by becoming an universal pursuit , and while , on the contrary , a fresh stimulus had been given to the exertions of great minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account the acquisitions , which should render them famous  --  the writers , who have been well called the giants of English literature , appeared and shed upon their country a glory , which is not to be extinguished . Then it was that such works as Hooker 's Ecclesiastical Polity and the Novum Orgauum , were added to the treasures of mankind . The number of reading men had of course been very much increased by an invention which made it easier to copy a book a hundred times , than it had been to copy it once ; and the class of authors was enlarged in proportion . it had become comparatively easy to acquire an extensive , if riot a permanent reputation , the trade of authorship was found profitable ; and as they , who have not tried it , are apt to think it an easy one , it was soon crowded with those , who might have exercised any other trade to more advantage . As there are unworthy members in every tra ( le , the literary character was soon degraded ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or received the homage which had once been paid to it. , It became part of the business of a scholar 's life , to examine with strict and jealous , scrutiny the works of rival authors , to depreciate their excellencies , to hunt up every lurking fault , and point it out to the less discerning eye of the multitude . Readers too became in their turn critics , and the literary public composed a formidable and despotic body , whose tastes were to be consulted , and whose authority was not to be treated lightly . The time had passed when men received with confiding and iniliscriminate gratitude* whatever the master spirits of the age thought proper to dispense to them , and it was their turn to be treated with deference and attention , to be soothed and conciliated . The author no longer wrote with the boldness and inde-. pendence of commanding genius , for bis spirit was subdued and the activity ef his mind impeded by the restraints , which he felt it to be necessary that he should impose upon himself ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to abide , would appreciate his merits and faults fairly , // or perhaps be willing to pardon a little that was bad , for mitch that was excellent ; for his competitors were his judges . Re had to fight his way to fame , through a host of jealous and watchful rivals , and he must come to the field armed at all points . Such was the system of constraint , under which authors found themselves obliged to live , to write , to think . Admirably was it calculated to hurt the faculties ; impede Their progress in the road of science ; blind The eyesight of discovery ; and beget , In those that suffer it , a sordid mind Bestial ; a meagre intellect . A school of literature arose under its operation , characterised , riot indeed by the sordid mind bestial , ' but by some* thing which we think very like meagerness of intellect . *Vitliout pretensions or pedantry , it is finished to perfection ; with nothing a bout it which could by any ingenuity be made ridiculous , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is all very well and has its value , but we want something more , and if excellence of this sort is not to be attained , but by the sacrifice of what is far more valuable , we think it better not to aim at it . It may be said perhaps , that the two essentials of good writing , strength and refinement , have no such invincible repugnance to each other , that they can not be made to unite-* can not exist together , and this is undoubtedly true , to a certaiti degree . A very sensible man will not only have distinct , and enlarged , and accurate conceptions , but he will be likely to clothe them in language at once forcible and correct ; disfigured neither by unsuitable and meretricious ornament , nor by obsolete or vulgar phraseology . And this is quite eiion*'h ; a more exclu*ive attention to manner would be not oily supertkous but injurious in its effects upon the mind . So far from thinking it a desirable thing that all good writers should , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  should resemble each other as much as possible , we think it highpraise of any composition , which is notsingularly bad or foolish , to say that it is not cast in the very same mould with other works , that it has individuality of char* acter . If a writer be continually and anxiously striving to give his sentences the precise form and structure , which lie admires in another ; if he weigh and b*ilance every word and // phrase , if he modulate the cadence of his periods until they harmonize exactly with those he has selected for imitation , how can his mind expand , how is it possible that he should think vigorously ? One of two things must happen ; either he will succeed in his endeavours , and become a humble imitator , a distant follower of the master to whose authority he bows ; or if his intellect be strong enough to resist the cramping , belittling discipline , to which he subjects it , he will become original in spite of himself ; for there never was an author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a manner of thinking and writing , a character of mind , peculiar in a great degree to himself . The literature of Queen Anne 's age can not be said to owe its peculiar character-unless our theory be wholly wrong-. - to the individual tastes and voluntary efforts of the writers of that period . The spirit of the times , which had gradually received its bent from causes long in operation , demanded and compelled them to adopt a style of literature , which their habits were singularly well adapted to perfect . It would be foolish to say that Addison was not a sensible man . lie had undoubtedly fine taste , sound discriminating judgment , and much playfulness of fancy ; but if we may judge of the character of his mind , from that of his works , we should think its excellence consisted rather in the absence of all that is ba*l* than in the presence of much that is very good . In defiance of his assertiow that he , who writes a hook , has great advantages over him , who confines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not have succeeded in any other kind of composition half so well as in that , which he had sense enough to choose . Desultory and unconnected essays are admirably calculated for minds which have not enough of vigor for intense , sustained , and long continued exertions . For his Saturday papers we can not be too grate .. ful ; never was critical acumen more skilfully or usefully employed than in rescuing Milton from his comparative obscurity . The style of Addison and Steele and their contemporaries , partly from its intrinsic excellence , but much more from its precise adaptation to the character of the age , took so strong hold of the national taste of England , that it can not be wholly shaken off , even at this distant day ; they however , who are in the habit of observing the signs of the tinies , assure us // that it is going out of fashion . The auth*s of the last century , who left the beaten track and dared to write better than Addison , are much better appreciated , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A young man may now read and admire Johnson , and even study the peculiar style which the grandeur of his conceptions arid the extent of his thoughts in a manner forced upon him , without being laughed at for his bad taste , or incessantly warned of his danger . The best prose writing of the last twenty years , which must nearly all be sought in the literary journals arid reviews , is marked by a tone of fearlessless arid decision , sometimes degenerating into arrogance , but always indicating that the writers thought as they pleased , and said what they thought , without reference to any established models , and with as much strength and variety of expression as they could command . The Edinburgh Review may be considered both as a proof and a promoter of this change ; in spite of the bad taste , extravagant opinion , and loose reasoning , which uharacterise some of its articles , it has done more than any other single cause to a*vaken the slumbering intellect of Great flritain . In poetry the change has been more decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to the thraldom of an unnatural and factitious taste . He had too much poetry in his soul not to feel that it was false , and too much independence to acknowledge its authority . When we come from the elaborate and artificial style , the ceaseless wit and epigram of Pope and his followers , to the nature , simplicity , and the pure and deep feeling of Cowper , is it not as if we had returned from a wearisome sojourning in a foreign land , and felt our hearts , which had been chilled and paralyzed by an beartless intercourse with strangers , again swelling with the joys , and affections , and sympathies of home ? Cowper must he considered as the restorer of freedom , but freedom we all know is apt to degenerate into licentiousness , and the poets , who have succeeded him , especially those now living , seem to have fallen from one extreme i-*to the other ; their aberrations from a pure and natural taste tire perhaps as wide as those of the writers whom they dread to resemble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else they may have in common with each other , they all , we think , exhibit instances of a reaction , a spasmodic and irregular reac // tiori against the artificial , unnatural taste , which for a long time subdued the poetic genius of England . We have said that there are strong indications of an approaching or actual change in the literary character of that country , and some of their most sensible writers seem to think ii . very iml ) ortant that a right direction should be given to the movement , which has already commenced . It is a queslion how far this is possible . Great and permanent chauges in national literatures have been usually , if not always , effected by the operation of causes , which were far be ' ond t . e control or influence of human agency . It would seem easier to cause an important revolution in the political , than in the literary world . Empires have been formed , sup* ported , or extinguished , by the energies and resources of an individual ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imparted to one a marked and permanent character . We are not , however , forbidden to hope , that skilfull and judi* cious endeavours to reform and purify a national taste or to aid the development and direct the growth of one , which is yet in its infancy , will be partly at least succes ful . The evils which would be likely to beset its youth may be known an ( l guarded against , those which would obstruct its progress may be removed by liberal arid discriminating patronage , and it would soon reward abundantly whatever support and protection it had received . It is necessary that men who are eminent in the literary world should introduce and give the authority of fashion , which is powerful even in literary matter 's , to the best and safest models . As we have admitted that the authors , who flourished in England in the beginning of the last century , occasionally exhibit a wonderful mastery over their language , and have left some passages which at least approached perfection , it may be asked why we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that we should make a wide and important distinction between their own intrinsic excellence , and that which they would be likely to impart ; between what they are in themselves , and what they would be if proposed as models for study and imitation . We shall not enlarge upon what we have re* ) eatedly admitted , that they have a great deal of genuine excellence , but we would remark that it is unfortunately of a sort , which renders it a dangerous model ; it is altogether negati 've . There is nothing in its character , which could teach the importance // of vigorous and independent thought , nothing which could fill one 's fancy with beautiful imagery , nothing which would move to high endeavours ; ' they are excellent and valuable , chiefly because they are free from inflation , pedantry , and affectation . The student therefore who should endeavour to form his style upon thenvwould strive rather to expunge from his pages , what was bad and redundant , than to till them with what should he good and essential ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeded , until it ceased to flow with strength or rapidity ; he would acquire a habit of regarding manner as of more importance than mat ter , and the result would he perhaps a polished and chasto style , but surely not a bold or vigorous one . It is impossible to do better in their way , than they have done , and their very success would deter us from following in their path , for they reached the goalq and won the prize , and we find it to be of comparatively little value . It is necessary not only that the best models should he pro* posed , but that it should be known how they may be used to most advantage . A wide distinction should be made , and constantly kept in view between study and imitation . The best authors , they whose effect 111 ) 011 the mind would be to give it strength and elevation , may be and should be studied , with assiduity ; but no writer , however excellent , however perfect in his own style , or however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for imitation always tends to destroy ori* ginalit5* and independence of mind , and can not substitute in their place any thing half so valuable . It was once a very jjbopular receipt for making a good writer , to take one of Addison 's Spectators , read it carefully , and remember a& much as possible of the thoughts and arguments , lay the book aside , until the phraseology and expressions were forgotten , and then reclothe what you remembered of the sentiments in language , as similar as possible to that of the original , and so one would learn to write like Addison ! A shorter and equally effectual way would have been to commit the paper to memory , and then one mi.glit make sure of writing once at least like Addison . We will venture to say that such a plan has been rarely adopted and acted upon without lessening the little intellect , which could submit to it . We have not forgotten that Franklin says , that he formed his style in this way ; and they who can think like Franklin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , may pursue with safety this or almost any plan . It is somewhat difficult to give precise and definite rules of study ; they who are conversant with the great efforts of great minds may be benefited in two ways ; in the ilrst place immediate contact with a superior mind is directly beneficial ; it gives an elevated tone to our thoughts and feelings , we catch some of the emanations of their pervading spirit9 and a process of assimilation is constantly going on . But the principal advantage is that by following , or rather accompanying the march of powerful minds , we get some*hing of their speed and impetus , which continues when we are left to ourselves-* the strong action of their minds imparts a degree of sympathetic velocity to less active faculties-we form habits of thinking as they thought and reasoning as they reasoned. - .. we learn what they have learnt , and we get what is far more valuable , the power of acquiring more . But these are effects , and most important effects , which can not he caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of their books ; the tone of thought , which pervades and is manifested , both by the choice of subjects and the manner of treating them , is feeble and contracted , and but little adapted to rouse , or invigorate , or fill the mind , which d wells upon their pages . They can afford the intellect neither aliment nor stimulus . A national literature uniting all the requisites of excellence , and each in its due proportion , has not perhaps as yet existed ; it may be impossible to create such a one , but it is not therefore idle to aim at it . The natural progress of society must before long , and may soon , create in this country a national literature ; and they , in whose hands are placed our literary destinies , should see that no endeavours are wanting , on their part , to ensure the existence of one which shall be at once honourable and useful . The inquiry how this great work may be achieved is of infinite importance , and if in making it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of singularity on the other , the result will be , we think , a conviction , that the most effectual , if not the only means of attaining the great object will be to encourage and promote with earnestness the study of the classics , in the first place , and next , of the English writers of the middle of the 17th century . With regard to the classics , we shall not make a // laboured defence of them , as we hope that a future number of this Journal may afford opportunity for a full discussion of the subject . The notIon that the classics have done and are doing harm is , we know , entertained by some , and there never was a wild and chimerical opinion which had not its advocates ; but there are men considered as belonging to this party , whose names should carry with them influence and authority , but who , we believe , hold very different opinions . A man may dread the introduction of German scholarship into our country , and wish that the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philologists , and still think an acquaintance with the classics an essential part of the educa* tion of a gentleman or a scholar ; he may still be willing that they should be read , and studied , and loved . And they ever will be studied amid loved , for their beauties are general and universal , and therefore imperishable ; they have stood the test of time , their fashion can not pass away . While we are thinking of the old English writers , it is dif . ficult to refrain from believing that we have degenerated from our fathers , that our intellectual stature is less than theirs , that the mind of man has either lost its strength , or refuses to put it forth . It is the usual , and perhaps a sufficient answer to this , that the mind seems to act now with less energy and effect , only because it acts iii a different direction , and upon different objects . However this may be , it is certain that the eminent men of the seventeenth century stood forth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than we are disposed to acknowledge in any men in these days . They were animated by the consciousness of an intellectual supremacy , which all would reverence2 and none could shake , and they felt the responsibility attaching to their high gifts and attainments . Whatever they wrote was mark* ed by a prodigal expenditure of thought and fancy , which does not belong to this age or the last , and which could only arise from a consciousness of inexhaustible resources of boundless affluence . Not satisfied with the applause of their own age , with the admiration of contemporaries , they strove , to use the noble language of Milton , for that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise , which God and good men have consented , shall be the reward of those * hose i ) ublished labours advance the good of mankind . ' An early and intimate acquaintance with these authors will give , as far as example // rjan. can give , what we think of the first importance to him who would be a great writer ,  --  .  - -  . boldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly niay make itself more ridiculous , but without them genius can do nothing . We have recommended these two classes of writers , not only because they are in themselves excellent , but because each is , we think , calculated to correct the evil which might arise from an exclusive stu ( ly of the other . The Greek and Roman languages are far more perfect , better contrived veliides for thought and feeling than any modern tongue . No writer can , therefore , now equal the classic authors in mere style , and if he strives too m*wtt to resemble them , he would perhaps form a tame , niommotonons , and artificial style ; he might substitute excessive delicacy for purity of language . Now this evil would be less likely to befal him , if he were accustomned to ihe copiousness , variety , and force of the old English writers . On the other hand , an excessive and indiscriminate admiration of these last might make him careless , ( liffuse , and declamatory ; but this could hardly happen , if lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid sustained , but disciplined energy of the mighty masters of the Grecian and Roman school . It is apprehended by some that a style , formed by the study of English authors , who flourished when our language was , as they say , in its infancy , would be quaint , affected , and full of obsolete expressions . lie , who is much acquainte ( l with those writers , with Jeremy Taylor particularly , can not but discover that our language is very much impoverished since their day ; he will perhaps feel strongly the contrast between their rich and varied expression , and the lifeless monotony of more modern writers ; he may sometimes be tempted to use a word or idiom that has gone out of fashion ; but this will be the extent of his offence , for the classics will teach him to hate every thing like affectation . In this country , it should he the business and the object of literary men , not to reform and purify , but to create a national literature . We have never yet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied . So much has been said , and Unskilfully said , about the l ) eculiar advantages of our free and popular institutions , and the beneficial effects they might be expected to have upon our literature , that it has become a wearisome theme to many cars , and we almost fear to todch // upon it ; but the fact is , that while some of our countrymen are vain enough , they scarce know of what , the great body of the nation , the literary and the wealthy , of those who have influence in the community are not at all too proud of our peculiar and glorious advantages ; and what is worse , they are not apt to be proud in the right place . Much yet remains to he said upon the subject , for which this is not the place or occasion . We would however remark , that if there be any truth , which reason and experience concur to teach , * it is , that genius and liberty go hand in hand ; and it is equally true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which must cease to exist when they are no longer animated by the spirit of freedom which called them into being .
