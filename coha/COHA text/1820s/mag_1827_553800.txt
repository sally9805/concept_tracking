txt 5. - The Cause of Education in Tennessee ; an Address delivered to the Young Gentlemen admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of A rts , in &amp;mberland College , at the Anniversary LYom ,  - -  mencement , October 4th 1826 . By PHILIP LIND5LEY , D. D. President of the College . Svo. pp. 36 . Nashville , Tennessee . WE have before had occasion to examine some of President Lindsley 's views of education1 and to express our high commendation of them . The same practical good sense and close investigation , the same zeal for improving the systems of teaching , appear in this Address , as in his former publication ; and we are glad to observe , that all reasonable success attends his exertions n the present important sphere of his action . The direct object of the Address , to which our attention is now drawn , was to give suitable counsel to the young gentlemen // of Cumberland College in Nashville , who had just completed their academic course ; and the President took this opportunity to make a few remarks generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of instruction in Tennessee . His aim is chiefly to suggest the best modes of improvement , both in reg*rd to common schools and higher institutions . In reference to the former of these he uses the following language . How important then to human happiness is it , that the first school  --  the infant school  --  the parental school-should be a good one . Here is the great nursery of human weal or woe . Now , I care not whether children ever go to a public school or not , if parents will keep a better school at home , and do their duty to their offspring . I care not whether our youth go to college or not , if parents can and will teach them more effectually by their own firesides . But , unfortunately , the great mass of parents have shown themselves but sorry instructers and faithless guides to those who ought to be dearer to them than their own lives . They are themselves , in general , too ignorant , to say no more , to do much . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many places , to supply this r*idical defect . And report speaks well of them wherever they have been tried . How far it may be practicable or beneficial to introduce them into our country1 except in large towns or manufactories , I shall not stop to inquire . In order to furnish the community at large with the next best aid to parental instruction , and as a substitute for it , after the first period of infancy , COMMON ScHooLs prefer the strongest claims to our regard . We hear a great deal , at the present day , about common schools ; and one would imagine that they had already become the favorites of the people . If so , then the cause of liberty and virtue has gained much in our land , and we need not despair of the republic . Upon this ground we can all meet and harmo .. niously cooperate . In this grand enterprise , all the advocates of colleges in our country will go hand in hand with the humblest of the people , not merely in declaiming about the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting into practieal operation the best system that can be devised . I have no fears that any of the alumni of Cumberland College will ever prove recreant or backward in this good work . Comnmn Schools , then , are needed in Tennessee . How shall they be established ? Let the people decide . What character and form shall they assume ? Let every county be divided into such a number of school districts or departments as will conveniently accommodate all the inhabitants . Erect comfortable and commodious school houses . Attach to each school house a lot of // ten acres of land , for the purpose of healthful exercise , gardening , farming , and the mechanical arts . For the body requires training as well as the mind . Besides , as multitudes must live by manual labor , they ought betimes to acquire habits of industry , economy , temperance , hardihood , muscular strength , skill , and dexterity . Employ teachers qualified to govern and instruct children in the best possible manner . Pay them according to their merit . Pay any sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished teachers . Parsimony in this particular is not only impolitic ; it is mean , it is absurd , it is ruinous . Better have no teachers , than to have incompetent , immoral , lazy , passionate , or indiscreet ones ; however cheaply they may be procured . Their influence will not be merely negative ; it will be positive and most powerful . I have often looked with horror upon the kind of common schools and teachers to which thousands of children , during several of their best years , are cruelly and wantonly subjected in the older States . But it is or was the fashion , in many places , to hire a blockhead or vagabond , because he would teach a child for a dollar and twentyfive cents per quarter ! Now , if there be anything on earth for which a parent ought to feel disposed to pay liberally , it is for the faithful instruction of his children . Compared with this , every other interest vanishes like chaff before the wind-it is less than nothing . And yet , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service so grudgingly and pitifully rewarded . The consequence is what might have been expected . Every man of cleverness and ambition will turn his back with scorn upon the country school . He will become a lawyer , a physician , a merchant , a mechanic , a farmer , or a farmer 's overseer , in preference . Until school keeping be made an honorable and a lucrative profession , suitable teachers will never be forthcoming in this free country . ' pp.9 , 10 . These observations , on the character and qualifications of teachers , have peculiar weight In nothing are we so deficient in our New England schools , as in good teachers . Nine times out of ten , we venture to say , the cheapest man has the preference . By this most ill judged parsimony the standard of school keeping is kept down ; men of talents and high qualifications seek for better employment . Thus the schools fall into the hands of a class of persons , who are more fit to be pupils than teachers . The man , whose recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , is the very last man that should be employed . He , who values his own services at little , will do little , and that badly . The effect of this is a thousand times worse in teaching , than in any other employment . A clumsy mechanic may make a // clumsy piece of workmanship , or may spoil it entirely ; and there will be the end of it ; nobody needs buy or use it . But when the children of a school are subjected to his tutoring , and the mischief he inflicts , from his ignorance and inaptitude , is on the mind , the evil is irreparable . Such workers of ruin should be avoided , and turned over to pursuits in which at least they can do no harm , Legislative aid in favor of education is wanted in nothing so much at present , as in providing some means for creating a better supply of teachers in the common schools . In speaking of the general advantages of an enlightened education , President Lindsley has the following just remarks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom and good government . Now there can be no better or stronger evidence in favor of the general beneficial tendency of learning , however obtained , than the fact , that , whenever , in ancient or modern times , endeavors have been made to procure liberty to a people , and wherever it has been acquired , those endeavors were made , and that acquisition secured , by men of superior knowledge . Such is the language of history from Moses to Bolivar . And among the most enlightened philanthropists on the continent of Europe at this moment , the grand cause of their discouragement and despair in regard to liberty , is , that the people are too ignorant to be entrusted with liberty ; and hence they feel constrained to remain inactive . They fain would give instruction to the people , in order to prepare and qualify them for free and liberal institutions , would their masters permit them . When our fathers commenced their almost hopeless controver*. sy with the mother country ; who were the kindred spirits attracted to our shores and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ? Not the degraded serf or feudal slavenot the 4literate farmer or mechanic  --  but such men as might have adorned the proudest court in Christendom-men of whom their own country was unworthy-men who understood the full import of the glorious cause to which they were ready to sacrifice titles , and honors , and fortune , and life ; - they were Pulaski , Steuben , De Kalb , Kosciusko , La Fayette . And who , allow me to ask my republican auditors , or , if they please , to remind them of what , purchance , they may have forgotten-*Vho were the prompters , the mainsprings , f he leaders of our memorable Revolution ? The answer to the question is upon every schoolboy 's tongue . He will recount a catalogue of patriots who , for profound knowledge and practical wisdom , were never surpassed in any age or country . Such were the friends of our own liberties , at a time toe , when they were not only stigmatized // as rebels , but were in hourly danger of being hanged as rebels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . They were honest men , and they united in promoting the permanent welfare of their country . Happily , the people having been generally educated at common schools , were sufficiently informed to comprehend their rights , when those rightn were ably explained to them , and wise enough to be guided by their superiors in wisdom . But had the intelligent , the learned colonists of those days combined with the English aristocracy in maintaining the ancient government in all its plans of oppression , the people would never have thought of a Revolution . Had they been enlisted on the side of the British ministry , we had this day been the loyal subjects of his majesty , George the Fourth . pp. 14 , 15 . The account of Cumberland College contained in this Address , and of the improvements proposed , exhibits that institution under a very encouraging aspect . The effects of the energy and zeal of the President appear in these , as well as of the liberal and active cooperation of the trustees . The author states , that The trustees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land to meet the various purposes*of their contemplated university . It is proposed immediately to commence the erection of a series of buildings for the accommodation of students , instructers , and stewards ; consisting of five additional colleges , each sufficiently commodious for a hundred students and three assistant professors or tutors , and of seven houses for as many principal or head professors . We shall then have six colleges , and twentyfive instructers , and accommodations for six hundred pupils . To each college will be attached a refectory or boarding house , with eight or ten acres of land for gardening and exercise . The colleges will be erected at such distances from each other as to prevent the usual evils resulting from the congregation of large numbers of youth at the same place . Professors will occupy houses on the intervening lots ; and there will be at least three officers resident within the walls of each college . We shall thus have six distinct and separate families , so far as regards domestic economy , internal police , and social order ; while one &amp;natus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics ' shops will be interspersed among the various edifices , in such manner as to be easily accessible to all the youth for improvement and recreation . Whenever the present ground shall be thus occupied , it will be necessary to procure fifty or a hundred acres more , for a model or experimental farm ; that // agricultur* , the noblest of sciences and the most important of the useful arts , may be thoroughly studied and practised . At a fu- ' ture period , or as soon as the means can be obtained , other suitable edifices , both useful and ornamental , may be erected . The plan adfriits of indefinite extension ; and in proportion to its enlargement , its advantages will be increased , while the expense of its maintenance will be diminished . In order to execute our present design , only about $200,000 will be required . ' pp. 25 , 26 . The average number of students in the regular classes of Cumberland College , during the past year has been between seventy and eighty . These classes are so divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that every individual is enabled and constrained to advance according to his actual ability . Such a variety in their studies and pursuits is provided , as to promote cheerful exertion , without distracting or confusing the mind . There are only two vacations in the year-consisting of five and a half weeks each  --  the one commencing on the first Wednesday in April , and the other on the first Wednesday in October . There are no intermediate holidays ; and no vacation is allowed to the senior class , previously to graduation , as is customary in other colleges . As there are no honors or prizes to animate a few to extraordinary efforts , and to discourage the majority altogether , so the whole are very desirous to avail themselves of every privilege up to the last moment of their collegiate life ; and they fin4 no difficulty in preparing appropriate exercises for the public Commencement . In the Preparatory Grammar School , attached to the college , there are , at this time , about ninety pupils . ' p. 36 . Let the generous enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail generally in Tennessee , and let the community second his ardent efforts , and the time will soon come , when nothing will be left to desire in the modes and means of teaching in that State .
