txt ART . VI. - iZ Practical Treatise upon the duthority and Duty of Justices oJ the Peace in Criminal Prosecutions . By DANIEL DAvIs , SolicitorGeneral of Massachusetts . 8vo. pp. 687 . Boston . Cummings , Hulliard and Co. 18*24 . A CORRECT , practical guide for justices of the peace in criminal prosecutions , presenting an analysis of their duties , in a convenient and accessible form , has long been wanted . The office of a justice is of the highest importance to the public . He has a very extensive and summary jurisdiction . He has power to arrest and imprison any of his fellow citizens . In cases of smaller offences he regulates the punishment ; in complaints for the higher crimes he examines the cir. - cumstances of the case , discharges the accuse4 or ecnnmits him for trial , and either refuses or regulates the bail , at his own discretion . The cases in which he is required to act are numberless ; he is daily and hourly called upon to administer justice . He is the general preserver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution of justices of the peace , lord Coke says , It is such a form of subcwdinate government for the tranquillity and quiet of the realm , as no part of the christian world hath the like , if thetsame be duly executed . ' A magistrate of such power , and so important in the regulation of civilised society , ought to be well versed in the duties of his office . He should understand the nature of crimes , the law of evidence , the statutes regulating punishrnents , the forms of proceeding , and the rights of the citizen . His ignorance on any of these subjects may occasion much injustice and oppression . And it may even be questioned , when we take into view the vast ' number of cases in which they are required to act , whether the unskilfuhiess of justices might not produce a greater amount of injury and vexation , than could arise from the want of knowledge in higher judi-* cial officers . The ignorance of justices with regard to their duty has often been , however , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The causes of this want of knowledge , as far as it respects our own country , will partly appear from the following passage of our author . // Many , perhaps the greater part of the magistrates in this country , have not the means of acquiring a competent knowledge of their official duties . With respect to such of those duties as it is the object of this undertaking to explain , no treatise specially confined to them , and fully pointing them out , has ever been published , either in this country , or , ( as it is believed , ) in England . In the year 1773 , an abridgment of Dr Burn 's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer ' was made and published in Boston . This was a useful undertaking at the time ; but much of the matter , selected for that abridgment , is inapplicable to , and foreign from the object of this work . A volume by Samuel Freeman , Esq . and another by R. Dickinson , Esq . upon the office and duty of justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But very small portions , in either of these , relate to the subject of criminal prosecutions . They were , probably , not intended by their respectable authors , as complete guides in that branch of a justice 's duty . It is not to be expected that many of our practising magistrates can obtain the requisite information upon this branch of their duty from English law books . The more ancient treatises , such as those of Lambard , Croinpton , and Dalton , have ceased to be practical guides , though frequently recurred to as venerable authorities . The work of Dr Burn , before alluded to , is of high and unquestionable authority ; but the former editions of it contain four volumes , by far the greater part of which is of no use to an American magistrate . An analysis upon this subject is contained in the first volume of Mr Chitty 's Practical Treatise on the Crown Law , published A. D. 1816 . The English edition of this work is in four large volumes , and comprises a complete system of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English courts ; together with a copious collection of precedents and practical forms used in those courts . This work is of value in the library of a lawyer ; but a very small portion of it is of any immediate use to a practising magistrate in this country . The size and expense of it are somewhat diminished by a late edition in two volumes , by Richard Peters , jun . Esq . of Pennsylvania . Still the expense of purchasing this , or any other English work , merely for what it contains upon the particular duties of a justice of the peace in criminal prosecutions , can not be readily or conveniently incurred . Two other works upon the powers and duties of justices of the peace and parish officers have been published within a few years ; one by Thomas W. Williams , in five volumes ; the other by William Dickinson , in two volumes ; but they have not as yet been received in this part of the United States . ' p. 3-5 . We may add , that no compilation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work as that // before us . We think too the author might have insisted even more than he has done , on the little use of which the English books can be in this country . Our criminal jurisprudence deviates so widely from that of our parent country , that a large part of every English book relating to justices , must be of little practical application in the United States . The work before us is not unworthy of the high reputation , which its author maintains in his profession . It is a very clear and methodical summary of the duties of justices in criminal cases . Although exhibiting much legal science , it is essentially a practical work , and could only have been written by one practically familiar with the subject of which it treats . Justices of the peace will find it a safe and convenient assistant in the discharge of their official labors . The advice , which is occasionally given to the magistrate , is rendered valuable from the long experience of the author ; and is well adapted to solve those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the justice 's duty in taking bail , recognising parties and witnesses , and taxing costs , are peculiarly useful and convenient , and but a small part of them are to be found in any other treatise . The first part of the volume contains a history of the mode of proceeding before a justice in criminal prosecutions . The proceedings are traced accurately and minutely , and the duties of the magistrate are plainly pointed out . The law of evidence , as far as it is necessary , is also included in this part of the work . The second part begins with a collection of forms . They appear to be drawn with great care and skill ; and are recommended by their neatness and precision . Everything is stated in a full and satisfactory manner , and yet without that prolixity and tautology , which disfigure too many of the English precedents . This part also comprises the law with regard to the various subjects of criminal prosecutions , alphabetically arranged , and contains forms under most of the titles . Without asserting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conscious of any undue partiality in stating , that in correctness and ability it will bear a favorable comparison with the most distinguished treatises on similar subjects . On one subject , however , the law is not laid down with accuracy ; which we notice here , not as a proof of // general inattention , but merely that the sanction of the author 's name may not mislead others . It is said , that Quakers and others , who decline taking an oath on account of their religious scruples , ' are permitted to affirm. ( p. 18 . ) The same statement is afterwards repeated . ( p. 92 , 93 . ) The statute of this State confines the exemption from taking oaths strictly to Quakers. * The author was doubtless inadvertently led into this error , from the practice which has prevailed , though incorrect , of permitting other persons besides Quakers to affirm , who were scrupulous on the subject of oaths . In a few cases the author indulges too freely in moral reflections , as for instance , on the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been proper for him briefly to express his sentiments on offences of this nature , but the discussions and anirnadversions running through several pages are rather out of place in a legal treatise . The following extract , relative to breaking open houses , for the purpose of apprehending offenders , and preventing crimes , is interesting to readers of all classes . In* what cases doors may be broken open in furtherance of the purposes of justice ? are questions of great delicacy and importance , in relation to the execution of warrants , and the apprehension of criminal offenders . A knowledge of the law , as it concerns the powers and duties of officers in these cases , becomes more important and necessary from the circumstance , that the most eminent writers upon the criminal law have differed in their opinions upon this subject . The first general principle is , that no * house or castle can be violated with impunity , except in those cases only where absolute necessity coppels the disregard of inferior rights , in order to secure public benefit ; and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles do not apply , this extreme violence is illegal . And this principle is carried so far in the civil law , that for the most part , not so much as a common citation or summons , much less an arrest , can be executed upon a man within his own walls . There is a distinction between the powers of officers and private individuals in this respect . For it is said that the former , * Mass. st. 1810. c. 127 . See also 2 Gall . R. 364 . In this case , a witness , not a Quaker , refused to take an oath , alleging conscientious scruples . But the judge said that the statue only extended to Quakers ; and committed the witness for a contempt . // Oct. being enjoined by law to apprehend a party suspected , may be justified in. breaking open doors to apprehend him , on mere suspi .. don of felony ; and will be justified though it appear that the suspicion was groundless ; but a private individual acts at his own peril , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breaking open doors without warrant . The reason of this difference between the arrests of private persons and officers , upon suspicion only , is , that in the former case the arrest upon suspicion is only permitted ; and if omitted is not punishable ; and therefore they are not permitted to break open doors ; but in case of officers , they are punishable , if they omit this duty . Another and sufficient reason arises from the great inconvenience and danger of admitting every private man , upon pretence of suspicion , to break open houses ; whereas officers , and the authority with which they are clothed , are publicly knowz* and presumed to be sufficient . It is a principle of law so clearly settled , as that no doubt or fear need be apprehended concerning it , that when it is felony has been committed , or a dangerous wound given , and the offender , upon pursuit , takes refuge in his own house , either a constable , or other peace officer , or any private individual , may , without warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper demand . And when an affray is made in a house , in the view or hearing of a peace officer , he may break open the outer door in order to suppress it . So in some extreme cases it has been holden , that a private individual may break and enter the hpu*e *f another , to prevent his murdering one who cries out for , assistance . But it is doubted whether this power extends to an officer or private person when felony is only suspected , and has not been committed within the view of the party making the arrest . It is said to be certain that an officer may break open doors , upon the positive information of another who was actually a witness to the felony ; and a marked distinction between the power of officers and private individuals is , that the latter can act only on their own knowledge , while the former may proceed on the information of others . A peace officer may justify an arrest on a reasonable charge of felony without a warrant , although it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private individual can not . We may therefore take it as settled law , that a private person may break open doors after a proper demand and notice , when he is certain that a felony has been committed ; and that a constable may do the same upon the information of the party in whom the knowledge , or reasonable suspicion exists .
