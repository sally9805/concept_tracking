Messrs Emmett * Ogden , and Mr William Bayard . By JOHN DUER and ROBERT SEDGwIcK . THE subject of the series of pamphlets just named is too important to be wholly pretermitted in this journal . We took an early opportunity to endeavor to awaken an interest in the VOL. xxv.  --  . No. 56. // cause of Greece , among our fellow citizens , and have never ceased to xvatch , with solicitude , the progress of the great struggle , of which that singular and interesting land is the theatre . Before bringing to a close the remarks , which we intend at this time to offer to our readers , we shall state some circumstances which justify and prompt a continued sympathy with the Greeks , in this their anxious struggle for freedom . But we deem it a preliminary duty to make a few observations on the suW*ct of the pamphlets before us . It is - ot our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pamphlets , nor to relate the history of the controversy of which they are the vehicle . An extensive circulation has brought them , no doubt , directly to the knowledge of many of our readers , and an able digest and examination of their contents , has already been submitted to the public , in the pages of a contemporary journal of the highest respectability , the American Quarterly Review . Inasmuch , however , as the transactions connected with the Greek frigates , are of a nature to produce an effect on the American character abroad , and have already attracted the attention and become the subject of the comments of the foreign press , it is proper that the American press , in its various departments , should not pass them without notice . If we , as Americans , condemn the transactions which form the subject of these pamphlets , it is proper we should say so , and put it out of the power of foreign detractors to allege that such things occurred among us unnoted and uncondemned . And yet it is not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and impressions on this subject . In the construction of the Greek fligates , two mercantile houses of the first respectability , in New York , were employed . To either of them , we should , if called upon , have implicitly confided the management of much more extensive transactions ; and to any impeachment of the good faith and liberality of either of them , we should have turned an incredulous ear . The transactions , moreover , were various and complicated ; and the agency of the two houses not in all respects the same . To one of them may be justly ascribed the lead and governing spirit of these transactions ; as from that house also has emanated a peremptory defence of them , even in those particulars , at which the public sentiment of the country has most revolted . It is scarcely possible , in speaking of the matter , to avoid confounding // the two houses , although we apprehend the public feeling has justly made a decided discrimination between them , as to the share of censure , which belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are not justified in making more particular allusion , have occurred , since the termination of this affair , of a nature to disarm of much of its severity the temper , in which we should otherwise pass sentence on its character . We have never , for a moment , listened to an imputation of fraud . A looseness and irregularity in some important transactions , as the insurance item from Georgetown , we have indeed noticed . It also seems difficult to resist the conclusion , that various persons employed by the houses to do work or furnish supplies , were allowed by the houses an enormous pay and compensation , the commission on which , charged by the houses in their own favor , is certainly not reconcilable with the rules of a delicate morality . Farther than this , however , we are not willing to go . We apprehend that nothing fraudulent , in the common acceptation of that term , was practised or intended ; and that the whole transaction was designed to be brought within the bounds of ordinary commercial honesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great charge agaiast the houses is , that after having in substance solicited the employment ( considering the Messrs Bayards as representing the two houses ) , after having held out to the Greek deputies the promise of economy , after having furnished them with estimates ( which , if not designed to regulate the expectations formed of the necessary expense , were worse than useless ,  --  were a positive imposition ) , after having abandoned a plan of building by contract , and adopted , as cheaper that of day 's work ( a mode of building , which we believe to be without a precedent in our ship yards ) , the houses should , nevertheless have run up the expense of each of these white oak frigates , fifty per cent above that of a live oak ship of the line of the first order ; should have charged an excessive commission on these their monstrous disbursements ; should have pursued a harsh and unfriendly course to compel the payment of demands , afterwards pronounced , by the arbitrators , unfounded ; should have thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to extricate the affair from the difficulties into which it was plunged ; and wound up with the most atrocious libels on all those who had acted against them , as the opposite parties in the transaction , and passionate appeals to the public for sympathy , as wronged and suffering men . // The only reply attempted to any part of this charge , is , that no fraud has been committed ,  --  no monies have been charged as paid which were not paid ; and that the work has been well and faithfully done . We will admit all this to be the case , notwithstanding the very large sum of money which was needed to send the Hellas to sea , after she came from the hands of the houses , and notwithstanding the certificate of Captain Gregory , as to the state in which he found that vessel . The charge is , that , after soliciting this employment from motives of sympathy in the cause of the Greeks , and parading an expression of feeling toward this people , the transaction should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit , and that charges to the amount of over a hundred *thousand dollars should have been made , of such a character as to be disallowed by arbitrators , who certainly will not be accused of abandoning the interest of the houses . By one of the houses , that agency was invited ; it was accepted with warm protestations of zeal for the Greek cause . And yet we find charges of ten per cent commissions on disbursements made of cash already in bank to meet them ; we read of enormous damages on protested bills , not authorized to be drawn , not sold in this country , and not required to meet any expenditure which had taken place ; and worse than all , we meet with a talk of a commission on the sale to the government of the United States of one of these frigates ; a sale , which the party , who talked of charging the commission , had done nothing to effect , and much to obstruct . If , in all this , it be said there is no fraud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , at the same time , there is no liberality , no love for struggling liberty , none of the fine sentiment which had been professed . XVe should , however , have been less concerned , if our censures could have been confined to the houses . But we are obliged to add , that we deem the conduct of the counsel for the houses , in some respects , and that of the arbitrators , throughout* equally open to exception . As the great error of the houses was , after making professions of sentiment , to come down and turn the whole affair into an ordinary business of money making , so we conceive it the error of the highly respectable counsel for the houses , that they could not emancipate themselves , on this occasion , from the influence of mere professional maxims of conduct , as commonly understood and practised . Messrs Ogden and Emmett received each a fee of // fifteen hundred dollars , as counsel for the two houses before the arbitrators , as we are informed by the arbitrators themselves . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel to engage in any cause , in which their assistance is asked . Counsel , it is said , must not undertake to prejudge a cause . Once engaged , we believe it is the duty of counsel to say , not what they think , feel , or know , as individual men ; but anything , and everything , which can be urged , with plausibility , on the side for which they are retained . All this may be very well . In most cases litigated , the great cause of humanity , liberality , and of conscience , in which all lawyers , and all good men , ought to consider themselves as retained , may remain unaffected , in the conflict of opposite counsel plausibly arguing the pro and the con of the issue . But we conceive that this can not be said of the course pursued by at least one of the eminent counsel employed by the houses . If that gentleman is not misreported ( and he can not blame us , if we take for admitted the correctness of an uncontradicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbitrators to award in favor of the houses , on the ground , that Greece was not interested in the award ; that it was the affair of peculating agents ; that Greece was already sacrificed ; and that the clamor raised by her pretended friends , was that of foul birds , screaming for their portion of the carcass . Was this liberal ? Was it merciful ? Was it true ? Mr Emmett , may tell us , indeed , it was a forensic flourish ; that he meant merely to produce an effect on the minds of the arbitrators , which it was the duty of the counsel for the Greek deputies to counteract ; that he left it to the latter gentlemen to state the fact , that Greece was most deeply interested in the award ; that an award in favor of the houses would deprive that country of almost its last hope ; and that the parties which now appeared in behalf of Greece were not ( as unjustly represented by the gentleman with a fee of fifteen hundred dollars in his pocket ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their country , but patriotic and honorable citizens , contending in a foreign land , against fearful odds and most high handed injustice . We say , all this does not satisfy us ; and we do not admit that it was right or becoming for the counsel of the houses , to indulge in insinuations against the honesty of the opposite party . They had reason to be content with acting on the defensive there . Still less , in our humble judgment , did it // become the senior *counsel for the houses , in a portion of the joint address of himself and his colleague , which he published on his individual responsibility , to wage war on the unprotected stranger entrusted with the affairs of Greece in this country , with allusions to worn out proverbs and idle traditionary calumnies . It seems that when ancient Greece had been overrun and subjugated by the Romans , and its inhabitants reduced , from the condition of an independent to that of a tributary people , groaning under tyranny at home and slavery in the land of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of human nature , thought fit to propagate the maxim , that there was no faith in a Greek . ' With the Romans , this ingenious device of damning the conquered Greeks , in an adage , had not even the merit of novelty , for they had already found out , under the same circumstances , that Punic faith was also suspicious . They were in both cases the plagiarists of honest IEsop , whose fable placed the lion wounded and abject , at the hunter 's feet . In the pages of Juvenal these sarcasms are in place . He did not treat Greeks worse than lie did Roman* , or the human race in general . But what shall we say of sober jurists , after a lapse of two thousand years , long enough , one would think , for the prejudices of nations to die away , reviving these stale Roman proverbs , as grave topics of argument in a practical question , at the present day ; casting suspicions on Mr Contostavios 's veracity , because he is a Greek , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dragged from their homes in Attica , and chained to their door posts and work benches ? What shall we say of this when done , not merely in the course of argument at bar , in which , as already observed , counsel are not understood to speak in their individual capacity ; but in an address to the public , through the columns of a newspaper , with the sanction of a name ; against a foreigner , partially acquainted with our language , and friendless , except so far as his cause has gained him friends ; when done , in fine , by an individual , himself a foreigner , himself an exile from a xvronged , oppressed , insulted , country ; himself obnoxious to the stale national sneers and the proverbial sarcasms , of all who can find it in their hearts to indulge in this species of warfare ? With regard to the arbitration , we have no wish to revive the recollection of that burst of feeling , which pervaded the continent , on the subject , especially when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses to an enormous extent , the arbitrators had assigned themselves out of the Greek fund alone , and for a few days ' service , a handsome year 's salary . On the supposition , that the arbitrators were all men of very high respectability in the community , we can point to men as respectable , all over the United States , whose annual salary , in offices of trust , honor , and responsibility , does not exceed what these gentlemen awarded to each of themselves , for about twenty days service on this arbitration . We well remember when the tidings of this awar ( 1 reached our humble metropolis of the north , with what feelings it was heard . Not a man believed it ; the report was universally treated as a libel ; the friends of Greece were cautioned against taking up slanders , which would react on themselves . Such , however , was the charge ; fifteen hundred dollars to each of the arbitrators , as such , for so they express themselves . Risk they ran none ; they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against any , by a written release from the opposite party . But we conceive that this is far from being the most unpleasant feature of the arbitration . In the course of the proceedings before the arbitrators , one of those gentlemen fell into an altercation with one of the counsel of the deputies , and the offensive remarks made by the former were retorted by the latter . This proved the signal for the son of the arbitrator ( who with other spectators was present ) to attempt to strike Mr Sedgwick , which he was prevented from doing , solely by the interference of the gentlemen near . After ineffectually repeating his attempt , he was checked by his parent , the senior arbitrator , with the intimation that he had done enough . ' Enough for what ? Enough , in the opinion of the young gentleman , to make it necessary for Mr Sedgwick to send him a challenge ; which Mr Sedgwick having the firmness not to do , drew down upon himself a fresh visitation of insult in the newspapers , in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that by wilful murder , would be deemed out of taste in New York , on such an occasion . Whether the young man was thought by his father , to have done enough in this way also , does not appear . These are occurrences to which we allude with pain . But they are of more dangerous tendency , than any other connected with the whole transaction . Notoriety and the public press will afford a remedy for the original // evil of the case ; but if respectable citizens , husbands , fathers , and Christians , ably and honorably discharging a professional duty to a helpless stranger , are to be first assaulted , and then involved in the necessity of murdering or being murdered , the press itself will be intimidated ; men of peace struck dumb , and injustice and oppression left without a check . Of the persons whose conduct we now censure , we privately know nothing and say nothing . Of their deportment before the public we take leave to speak in the language due to truth and justice . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bear witness to the zeal , fidelity , and success , with which a most arduous duty was discharged by the Messrs Sedgwicks and their associates , Messrs Duer and Robinson . They have deserved well of the cause of humanity , to an extent , which it is rarely in the power of the most benevolent and active to go , in their efforts to do good . But we forbear to dwell on these painful transactions . It has been our duty to unite our voice to that of the American press in general , in pronouncing a sentence of unqualified reprobation of them . We repeat , however , what we have already hinted , that we are disposed to make great and favorable discriminations between the conduct of the two houses ; on one of which , perhaps , no other blame rests , than that of partial acquiescence ; a blame mitigated by a commendable deference to public opinion , as subsequently expressed . A far more important , though closely connected topic , is , the probable fortune of the country and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starred enterprise was undertaken . With what prospects are the Greeks pursuing their present struggle ? and what is the duty of the civilized world toward them ? If we argued on the prospects of the Greeks merely a priori , we should pronounce it impossible , that so small and feeble a portion of the Turkish empire could succeed , in a conflict with the government . But this reasoning is now out of season , in reference to the present contest . It might have been expected that the Greeks would have been crushed in the first , second , or third campaign . A longer period than this , it could scarcely require , to bring the whole power of the government into its most concentrated and efficient action against them . Three campaigns , however , passed , and the insurrection was no nearer being crushed than at its commencement . It was the case , // however , that in these campaigns the Porte had not brought its whole power to bear on the Greeks . The peculiar nature of the Turkish government ,  --  substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it difficult to put at once into motion the entire amount of the reputed force of the empire . It was not till the fourth campaign , that the Porte was able to bring into the field the most powerful of its subject princes , the bey of Egypt . This skilful ruler , it would seem , took time to deliberate , before he permitted his son to embark with the strength of his principality , in the doubtful enterprise of invading Greece . But when , at length , the first Egyptian expedition was fairly landed in the Morea , it must be conceded that the Porte had made as great an effort , as it could possibly make , to crush the revolt . The Egyptian troops were coniposed of veterans , trained in the recent wars against the Wechabites and the chiefs of the Upper Nile . They were led , in part at least , by European officers ; and every thing that could be effected by a preponderating military strength , ought to have been , and in fact was effected by Ibrahim Pacha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this and two succeeding campaigns , and after five successive reinforcements from Egypt , the war is no nearer a probable termination , than on the first day that hostilities commenced . The Egyptians are able to march at pleasure , through the open country ; but , except in the single case of Missolonghi , have effected nothing without the bounds of the Morea , and within it , they have not found themselves in strength to attempt the reduction of Napoli . Meantime , what has been the effect of this protracted conflict upon the Egyptian forces ? Not a man surely has returned to Egypt , and after five reinforcements , it does not appear , that Ibrahim is in greater force than when he landed . The support of his army must be a dead weight , principally , on his father 's treasury . The system of the Porte does not know of such a thing , as the payment of troops from the Sultan 's coffers . The Pacha , who leads them to the field , must provide for them as he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state of the country , yield scarcely anything , toward the support of the invading army . Egypt is not in a condition to export provisions to any extent ; and no resource remains to the Egyptian army , but direct purchase from the neutral powers , principally the Austrians . What means can the hey of Egypt have of supporting , for any considerable number of years . this // war of dollars , for such it has now* become , as far as the Turks are concerned ? Their invading armies have made no effectual impression ; their fleets are unable to hold the brave little squadrons of the Greeks in check ; the partizans and guerillas of the patriots hang upon the flanks and rear of the Egyptian army , wherever it moves ; the old men , the women , and the children have been transported to the islands or to the fastnesses of the mountains , where , with the sustenance derived from their sheep and goats , they have as yet bid defiance , not merely to the barbarian enemy , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , remains , by which the country can be subdued , by the unaided powers of the Turkish government , but starvation ; and this weapon , thank Heaven , they will not be permitted to employ . It was a propitious circumstance , connected with the revolution in Greece , that the year before it commenced , an attack was made by the Porte , on its most powerful vassal , the Pacha of Yanina . Had events precipitated the commencement of the revolution in Greece , so that it should have burst forth , before the rupture of Ali Pacha with the Porte , there is scarce a doubt , that this powerful prince would have been wielded as an instrument , for the effectual suppression of the insurrection . His interest and policy would have enlisted him in the cause . That of the Sultan would not less strongly have dictated the employment , in this difficult and exhausting service , of a chieftain , too powerful for quiet submission ; and though the event might have been , in the first instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the erection of a new monarchy , under Ali Pacha , yet the revolt could not probably but have been promptly crushed and terribly punished . The Morea , in 1775 , was all but desolated , by letting loose upon it twentyfive thousand Albanians , after its desertion by the Russians ; and a like catastrophe would have been of most probable occurrence , had the turn of affairs permitted the Porte to employ Ali against the rebellious Greeks . The patriots , however , who led on the hazardous movement of the revolution , watched their time with greater sagacity , than they have generally had credit for . They had for more than five years meditated the project of emancipation . A secret fraternity had spread its branches through Greece . Its remotest provinces were in concert ; what was maturing in Moldavia and Wallachia , was known in Constantinople , in the Morca , aug in Albania ; and with all the // multitudes that must have participated in these dangerous counsels , the explosion , though in reality at last accidental and unconcerted , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Au Pacha , instead of being at t Porte , to take the field against the 6 he disposal of the insurgents , occasioned himself the most embarrassing diversion of the Ottoman forces . To this cause , no doubt are to be traced the languor and inefficiency of the military operations of the three first campaigns . Bereaved of the aid of their great vassal of the west , at a moment when it was most needed , and convinced by trial , of the impossibility of crushing the insurrection by the employment of ordinary pachas , the Porte , as a last resort , called in the bey of Egypt ; doubtless on the calculation , that if it did not regain a revolted province , it would embarrass and exhaust a dangerous subject . It appears to us , that the inefficacy of the Egyptian invasion has by this time been shown ; that Ibrahim can not put an end to the war , merely by continuing the - military occupation of a small part of the soil ; and that the expense of this occupation must shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not , therefore , for ourselves , see what can be done by the Turkish government , which has not already been done to no purpose , to effect the subjugation of the Greeks . There are no other powerful pachas , whose military skill and force can be brought into action . An experiment , indeed , has been made , and is now in progress , conceived in a bolder spirit , than usually animates the counsels of the Porte , which , could it be crowned with success , might threaten worse consequences to the Greeks , than anything they have as yet had to fear . We refer , of course , to the disbanding of the Janissaries , and the organization of a regular army on the European system . Could this be eff3cted ; could all the p*'pulation of the Turkish empire , of arrnsbearing age , be enlisted in an army , organized , disciplined , and led like the armies of France and of England , it would indeed make the Porte formidable , not merely to the Greeks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to look , with stoical calmness , at the feeble and ineffectual blows aimed by Turkey at a people who stand on the frontier of Christendom . We have , however , no faith whatever , in the success of this experiment , and this for reasons . wi4* ail which we will not trouble our readers . It will be suilicient to remind them , that precisely the same experiment , attcmnpte6 // the most accomplished and able of all the Sultans , who , for a century and a half , have succeeded to the throne , cost him his life , not more than twenty years ago . We see no reason , why a change of policy which brought Selim to the bowstring , should succeed in the hands of the present Sultan , a man of unpopular manners and moderate capacity . In the next place , the institution of the Janissaries is not a mere arbitrary thing , which can be taken up and laid down at pleasure ; but it is a part of the social existence of the people ; an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , the firm estab*. lishment of the Turkish power in Europe . It approaches , in its nature , the organization of our militia ; and the attempt to disband the Janissaries and introduce a regular force , is very nearly the same as an attempt would be in Europe , to establish a regular army by conscription , in a country where both army and conscription were wholly unknown before . Could a regular army be organized in Turkey , there is great doubt if it could he maintained in the field . Hitherto the civil and the military service under the Turkish government has been ordered , substantially , on the feudal principle , which , in the main , is the principle of the oriental world , as far back as our accounts run . The empire is divided into provinces , which are committed , almost in full sovereignty , to the government of the pachas . These pachas pay an annual sum to the Sultan ; and indemnify themselves from the inhabitants of the provinces , in which they defray the expenses of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contingents , the pachas must defray the expenses of their troops , which are made as light as possible by a system of free quarters alike on friend and foe . Now in a government where the military has long been on this footing , a government , moreover , confessedly in its decrepitude , to attempt to disband the great feudal militia of the country , and enlist a standing army , seems to us a very doubtful experiment . Nor does it appear that any success , at all deserving the name , has attended this experiment , during the three years that it is understood to have been going on . The most the Porte has been able to do , is to quell the revolt of the Janissaries at Constantinople , nor has this been done without immense bloodshed . It does not appear , that a single regiment of the new army has reached Greece ; and as far as our information , at this distance , extends , the only effect of the experiment , hitherto , has been to paralyze the old military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its supprsssion , without substituting any other in its place . If , indeed , ( which we grant to be not impossible , though in a high degree unlikely to happen ) the Porte succeed , by dint of spasmodic and fanatical effort , on the one hand , guided by observation of the systems of western Europe , Oh the other , in organizing an efficient army on the European system ; should she be able so to improve her financial system , as to pay and support this army , and with it conquer Greece , and return as she would from that conquest , a regenerated military power of the first rank , essentially hostile , and as formidable as hostile , to the political system of Europe , it would present a curious commentary on the course which has been pursued by the leading European powers , by Russia , England , and France , in reference to the present struggle . All general principles of politics dictated to these powers , to take advantage of the present convenient opportunity , to drive from Europe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never established within its limits , by any better title , than military occupation . To justify themselves for disregarding these dictates of sound general policy , the leading powers have urged the inconvenience and danger at the present moment , of allowing the peace of Europe to be disturbed , of building up a new power of very uncertain relations toward the rest , or of aggrandizing , in doubtful proportions , by a partition of European Turkey , the older powers , which might take part in a general war against the Turks . Now to avoid these dangers and inconveniences , what are the leading powers of Europe doing ? They are sitting quietly by , while the Porte is making the experiment ( and , as the government party in almost every portion of Europe anticipates , the successful experiment ) of organizing in Turkey an efficient military establishment on the European footing , and thus converting that power , at present effete and passive , into an active military power of the first order , intrenched in Europe in a position chosen by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Asia . In exchange for the risk of building up a feeble republic in Greece , the leading powers think it wise to recall into being , that power which once threw its legions within the walls of Otranto and knocked at the gates of Vienna . The cabinets which dread the disproportionate aggrandizement of Russia , contemplate without alarm the regeneration of a power , whose princi // pies must ever be at war with those of Europe , whose position is far more dangerous , whose means of annoyance more to he dreaded . One needs but to consider the injuries , which the petty regencies of the Barbary coast have inflicted on the states of Christendom , to be able to estimate the effect on the peace and intercourse of Europe , of the restoration of Turkey to a state of vigorous political and military activity . To effect and to countenance this restoration has been the policy of the cabinets of Europe , since the commencement of the Grecian revolution . And this is called preserving the tranquillity of Europe ! But for ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the successful accomplishment of the great transformation , which is attempted in the Turkish system , and we are unable to perceive , after the most diligent scrutiny , under the best lights at our command , where the Porte is to find , or how it is to make , the means of bringing to bear upon the Greeks , a greater military pressure , than it has hitherto effected ; and without a much greater pressure , we see no possibility of crushing the revolt . It is necessary then to contemplate the position of the Greeks , as they are likely to be affected by the continuance of the- present state of things ; on the supposition , that the Porte , although unable to make an effort sufficient to bring the war to a close , may yet , for a number of years , persevere in the present or a similar system of hostilities . Have the Greeks anything to hope from the interference of the powers of Europe ? If the designs of the cabinets could be judged of , by the declarations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if the conduct of the cabinets , in respect to Greece , for any considerable time to come , were sure to be guided by its present designs , we should unhesitatingly pronounce , that , in the way of direct , friendly interference , the Greeks have nothing to hope from the powers of western Europe . Russia is by religion the natural ally of Greece . No jealousy , but a strong friendly feeling subsists between the Greeks and the Russians . Extensive commercial and family connexions exist between them . Greeks who succeeded in amassing wealth retired habitually to Moscow . Individuals , who became obnoxious to the Turkish government , fled to Russia . Many of the young men , particularly those of the ancient families , entered the Russian army ; not a few rose to honorable posts in the Russian civil service . In a word , no national association in Europe is older // or more intimate than that of the Greeks and Russians . It dates from the very dawn of civilization in Russia in the middle ages , and is cemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that of language . Such was the feeling of Russia toward Greece , as between the people on both sides . The late emperor Alexander had every reason to share this feeling , both as a Russian and a ruler of Russians . The hereditary policy of his family looked to extension of the Russian influence , if not of the Russian empire , on the side of Greece ; and all the lessons of his renowned grandmother dictated a watchful policy in that direction . Unfortunately for the Greeks , at least in the first instance , Alexander 's feelings and policy , as a Russian prince , were controlled by his position in the general system of Europe . The occurrences in Naples , Piedmont , and Spain presented a dangerous coincidence with the revolution in Greece . Alexander was not able , or was not permitted , to draw a line of distinction between the two cases , and the Porte was permitted to enjoy the advantage of the decree , which went out against all movements of the people against their rulers . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , that the differences between Russia and Turkey , founded on long established hatred between the countries , aggravated by the breach of the last treaty between them , in reference to the protection to be enjoyed by Moldavia and Wallachia , and exasperated by the personal insults uffered to the Russian minister at Constantinople , and by the massacre of the patriarch , would have ended in war . In fact , the Russian armies were on the Pruth , and the slightest additional provocation , not to say the merest accident , would have carried them over it . But the turn of events in the south of Europe disheartened Alexander ; difficulties since arising with the Persians have occasioned a diversion of the Russian power , on the eastern flank of the empire ; and an accommodation has been made with the Porte . This accommodation , although securing substantially the privileges of the Christian population of Moldavia and Wallachia , has been made at the sacrifice of the privileges of the Greek families , which Russia for more than a century has guarantied , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some future period , and in a change of circumstances , again be matter of contention between Russia and the Porte . But the policy of England is perhaps still more important , in // its bearing on the struggle in Greece , not merely ofl account of the actual ability of England to promote or prevent a successful issue of the struggle , but on account of her supposed interest as the rival and antagonist of Russia . This rivalship , as we have on former occasions been led to state , has , in more than one instance , been an effectual shield to the feebleness of the Ottoman empire . To all appearance , it will for some time so continue ; and perhaps it is the tendency of the present state of things , rather to confirm than to weaken the policy of the English cabinet , in maintaining the Sultan against the Czar . England is now vulnerable in two characters ; characters , in principle , diametrically opposite to each other ; but in which she stands , in consequence of a coincidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parallel in the history of the world . She is mistress of a mighty empire in the east ; in population second only to that of China ; in the despotic frame of its government on the same footing as China , Turkey , and Russia . Of the four great despotisms of the modern dispensation , England , in her Indian empire , is one . She fills a link in the chain of absolute rule , which binds the earth in subjection , from the east of Asia to the west of Europe . Now it so happens , that Turkey , another of these great despotisms , intervenes between the British empire , which is extensively exposed , and the Russian , which is essentially militant , and which is notoriously growing up into some great developement of power , of which no one undertakes to foretell the character or direction , but of which all feel a foreboding dread . Turkey herself is passive ; her power depends on quiescence ; her antiquated machinery of government can sustain no competition with the political doublespeeders of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French engineers in her ship yards , but no seamen , except her revolted Greeks . An effective , disposable military power she has not , and for the reasons we have already ventured to state , can not have . She is there . fore to England a perfectly safe neighbor , in reference to the British possessions in the east . But , on the other hand , she presents , on the side of Russia , a barrier not easy to pass . In any state of things , in which British India should be threatened from Russia , England would find and would employ the means of entangling Russia with the Porte ; to say nothing of the natural effect of the geographical position of the two powers . These relations are perfectly understood by all the parties concerned , // and by none better than by Turkey and England . The Porte well knows , that it is the interest of Great Britain to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman empire , against the advances of Russia ; and Great Britain feels that any essential change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , might be a very hazardous experiment , in r*4erence to her eastern dominions . She has not forgotten that thirty years have not elapsed , since the Turkish empire , on occasion of the French invasion of Egypt , afforded England the most seasonahle aid in warding off a blow , which was ultimately aimed at India , and which was , in the chapter of political accidents , much less likely to be struck , than any to be feared from Russia . if Turkey , in time of need , has so lately proved an useful ally to England against France , it is not to be supposed , that the importance of her position , as a barrier on the side of Russia , will ever be lost sight of . Such is the state of things , which must govern the policy of England in this contest , considered as one of the great despotisms now subsisting . In the other capacity in which she presents herself to the world , we again behold her in Opposition to Russia , but it is in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , against the system of the continental alliance , with Russia at its head . In this view , many things are adverse to an interference of either of these **owers , of a nature friendly to Greece . England could not acquiesce in any measures , which would aggrandize Russia , or powerfully extend her influence , on the side of Turkey . The expulsion of the Turks from Europe would inevitably add to Russia Moldavia and Wallachia ( consequently the mouth of the Danube ) , and probably Bulgaria and ancient Thrace , and with them Constantinople , and the entire communication of the Black sea with the Mediterranean . Is this an event , the remotest approach to which would be endured by England , at the time when the fear of Russian ascendancy is becoming a panic fear in the south and west of Europe ? Certainly not . On the other hand , as we have already said , Russia herself can not , from political reasons , now favor the movement in Greece , being deeply pledged to the antirevolutionary policy , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greece , distinct from the influence of Russia and of England , can be exercised by any of the other great powers of iEurope . It is true , Aus // tria has an important and extensive frontier on Turkey , which she is obliged to watch by a very large and expensive border garrison , which has an organization and establishment of its own , distinct from that of the rest of the Austrian army . One or two Turkish provinces would round out the Austrian dominions very handsomely , on the Danube and on the Adriatic . We are not sure , in fact , that Austria does not , as successor to the doge of Venice , claim to be the legitimate sovereign of the kingdoms of the Morea , of Candia , and Cyprus . The three tlagstaffs on which the banners of these kingdoms waved , still stand in the place of St Mark 's . But Austria , like Turkey , is a quiescent power . She moves only when impelled ; and owes her own safety to the undisturbed maintenance of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners , by intimate association with the Greeks , since the commencement of the French revolution , and by the military passion of the present generation , possesses the means of interfering to great effect in the contest . France is , however , entirely controlled by her own any other question of international politics . Had Napoleon continued to live and reign , some radical changes would unquestionably have taken place , in the southeastern corner of Europe . He informs us , that he often conferred with Russia on the subject of the partition of European Turkey , but that they never could agree about Constantinople . INFapoleon , however , had his way of settling these points with other powers , in cases of disagreement . if the foregoing speculations are correct , it follows , that no powerful interference is to he expected , on the part of any one of the leading powers , in favor of the Greeks . is it equally unlikely , that these powers may , by an union of counsels , effect a termination of the contest on favorable terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too extensively , to be set down as wholly groundless . The groundwork for such a concert between at least three great powers , Russia , Austria , and England , already exists . They are all frontier powers as respects Greece , all concerned in giving a direction favorable to their own interests , to the events of which Greece is the theatre . Should the Turkish government be removed from Europe , it would still remain in sufficient force in Asia , to sa4*f*r all the demands of the British policy , in reference to her indian // empire . The partition , which we have above suggested in reference to Austria and Russia is obvious , and might be compensated to the queen of islands , by as many of the gems of the Levant , as she might choose to set in the coronet of her ocean empire ; while the central portion of Greece , the real seat of the revolution , presents every advantage for the " establishment of an independent government , under the guaranty of the *eat powers . Such an arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no degree novel , in an age , which has witnessed the transactions of the Congress of Vienna , to say nothing of the events connected with the French revolution , and with the erection of the Spanish American provinces into independent states . Nature is evidently struggling for relief , from the oppression of the Turkish despotism in Europe . The presence , in a Christian region , of a Mahometan power ; the rule of a barbarous government , over a race of men belonging to the family of European civilization , is an anomaly , at once too afflicting and too monstrous to become permanent . it is indeed to be deplored , that reasons of state have , on this occasion , sealed up the tongue and palsied the hand of him , who of all living men could the easiest apply the remedy to this grievous disease . There is an individual , who sits on no throne , in whose veins no aristocratic blood runs , who derives no influence from amassed or inherited ' wealth , but who , by the simple supremacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sway , as mighty as that of Napoleon at the zenith of his power . Indebted for his own brilliant position to the liberality of the age , which is shaking off the fetters of ancient prejudices , this literal ruler by the grace of God , can feel no real deference for most of the maxims , by which the neutrality of England , in the wars of Grecian liberty , is justified . How devoutly is it to be xvished , that the pure and undying glory of restoring another civilized region to the family of Christendom , could present itself in vision to the mind of this fortunate statesman ; that , turning from his fond but magnificent boast , that he had called into existence a new world in the Indies , he would appropriate to himself the immortal fame , which could not be gainsaid , of having recalled to life the fairest region of Europe . He has but to speak the word , within the narrow walls of St Stephen 's , and the Sultan trembles on his throne . He has but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // hypocritical sophistries of the continental cabinets vanish into air . Let him then abandon the paltry chase of a few ragamuffin Portuguese malecontents , and follow a game , which is worthy of himself and the people whose organ he is . Let him pronounce the sentence of expulsion from Europe of the cruel and tarharous despotism , which has so long oppressed it . The whole civilized world will applaud and sanction the decree ; he will alleviate a amount of human suffering , he will work out a sum of human good , which the revolutions of ages scarcely put it within the reach of men or governments , to avert or effect . He will encircle his plebeian temples with a wreath of fame , compared with which the diadem of the monarch whom he serves is worthless dross . But we suppose it must not be ; the Greeks must be left to work out their own emancipation , by their own resources , aided by a single , and that we trust an all sufficient ally , to which , before closing these remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in her favor , on the part of the leading powers takes place , present appearances authorize the expectation , that the war , as at present carried on , will continue for years . Neither party is in force to bring it to a decisive close . It has abundantly appeared , from six years ' experience , that the Turkish government can not command the means of crushing the insurrection . It is not less plain , that the Greeks do not possess the means of expelling the hostile forces now in the country , and preventing further invasion . Nothing therefore remains , supposing foreign powers to continue to stand aloof , but that the contest should continue , till the one side or the other is fairly exhausted and disabled . Is this likely to be the Turks or the Greeks ? Obviously the former , from the nature of the case , and manifold causes growing out of the relative position of the two parties . The Turks are invaders . The stationary Turkish population , resident in those parts of Greece , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of the war , one twentieth of the whole population . On the breaking out of hostilities , these Turks fled for safety to the garrisons , or joined the armies , and their hold upon the country was entirely cut off . Difference of language , religion , and political position , prevented the formation of a party in favor of the government , which usually exists in civil wars . It is impossible , then , that the Turkish force should be kept up , either as to numbers or supplies , but // by continual effort from without . The country furnishes nothing to it . Men and provisions must be constantly poured in , at vast expense , if further operations are to be carried on ; or even if things are to be kept as they now stand . The Turkish government has no credit . We suppose that even the Jews of the stock exchange , who lend to all , would not lend to the Turk . Where the resources have been found , to carry on the war thus far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve ; and which the accounts that continually reach us from Constantinople , of Armenian bankers bowstringed , the coin debased , and the ornaments of the mosques transferred to the mint , do but partly explain . The Greeks , on the other hand , act upon the defensive* They have no regular armies to raise , transport , and subsist in foreign lands . it is true , they need money to keep their militia in the field , and the war languishes and is protracted from this very cause . But the population of the count*ry is just able to subsist , in the present state of things . The Egyptian army does not follow them into their mountain retreats , where their flocks , and such rude agriculture *s they can pursue , afford them a pinched subsistence ; while their countrymen in the seaports and nearer the coast have been prevented from starving , by the benevolence of the friends of humanity in foreign climes . We do not say that all this is prosperous , is comfortable , is desirable . God forbid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne , rather than come again under the accursed yoke of the Turks , or encounter the fate , which has been repeatedly denounced , and which , if not denounced , would most surely befall them ,  --  indiscrimmate extermination , by military execution or sale into slavery . At any rate , it seems plain to us , that the Greeks can longer subsist on the defensive , in their present situation , than the Turks can find the means of meeting the enormous pecuniary burden of their establishments . A considerable *part of the Greek population is scattered among the islands and islets of the Archipelago , and subsists by the plunder of the enemy ; and we are sorry to add , by indiscriminate piracy on the navigation of the Levant . This evil indeed will go on increasing , as the war is protracted . Starved out at home , they will take to the sea ; and will prey upon the nations whose policy preys on them . Every way to be regretted , this consequence of the state of things existing in Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // a prejudice against the Greeks . The American merchant , who is invited to contribute for the relief of the Greeks , excuses himself , on the ground , that his last letters from Smyrna in- form him , that he has had a valuable ship plundered , and the crew beaten , by Greek pirates . It ought , however , in charity to be remembered , first , that this state of things unavoidably takes place , where a war is carried on by a feeble government . The Grecian government has not the physical means to coerce the unprincipled part of its subjects , into an observance of the law of nations . In the next place it should be allowed , that some of the christian powers have afforded the Greeks the most irritating provocation , in lending their flag to the Turks . What Greek , that saw the Austrian transports standing into Missolonghi , could be expected to be very scrupulous , as to the law of nations , at least as far as Austrians are concerned ? Nor should it finally be forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , that they are the acts , not of Greeks merely , but of a colluvies of all tongues and nations , the outcasts of every country . To adventurers of this description , the Grecian islands have , in every age , from the time of Julius C*sar , furnished a covert ; and we have no doubt that every mistic 's crew of pirates , whose nefarious deeds are set down to the account of Greece , contains a full representation from every christian people bordering on the Mediterranean . If it does not , the population of the Archipelago is improving , which we certainly did not suppose to be the case . If we can but bring ourselves to a well grounded belief , that the Greeks will be able to ride out , for a considerable time to come , as they have for six years already past , the terrible storm which is beating upon them , we can trace some beneficial consequences from this prolongation of their fiery trial . Starting up from abject political subjection , not to say personal slavery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of individuals from the most remote extremes of society ( for what can be more remote than the manners and character of the mountaineers of Suli , the merchants of Hydra , and the gentry of the Fanal ) ; and all brinoing with them the social vices , which a tyrannical government engenders in every class of society , the phalanx of the Grecian patriots has certainly not yet exhibited all the necessaTy qualifications for self government . They have most wanted // that , which , indeed , wherever it is enjoyed , is rightfully acknowledged to be , not so much a signal advantage of the ordinary kind , as an undoubted gift of heaven . Strike out the name and agency of Washington from the American revolution , and you have the elements of a very dimerent result of all its labors and sacrifices . The Greek revolution has exhibited no defect so prominently , as the want of a brave , skilful , patriotic leader , equal to the momentous crisis of his country 's fortunes . As the influence of such a leader is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feuds , and conciliating the tempers of the men of weight and activity below him , it may safely be ascribed to the want of such a leader , that faction has been permitted to proceed to such alarming lengths , in the conduct of the revolution . Could all parties , from the first , have been cordially united , in an intelligent cooperation against the common enemy , it is probable , though by no means certain , that the war might already have been brought to a close . Time , bowever , has been wasted , opportunities lost , and money thrown away , from the clashing of rival chieftains , and the war of interests , partly personal , partly geographical , partly of political principle . While these factions last , however much to be deplored , they prove that the cause is not *n extremis . If they show the indiscretion of the Greeks , they show the inability of the Turks to apply the sovereign remedy for domestic feuds , an overwhelming foreign force . It does not appear , moreover , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different classes of the population . There is no contest for a new distribution of old political privileges ; no quarrel between creole and native patriotism . There is not even such dissimilarity as exists , on many important points , between various members of our own federal union . In short , we perceive no obstacle , to prevent the hearty union of all Greece under the guidance of any leader , suited for the vocation , who shall arise among them . Till such an individual shall appear , paradoxical as the remark may seem , the cause of the revolution , in spite of all the horrors and sufferings of war , stands safer now , than it would in the event of a premature pacification . Every one , who reflects on our own history , will feel , that , blessed though we were with statesmen and leaders of unbounded influence , the cause of American liberty was in greater peril from 1783 to 1789 , than during the continuance of the war . In the exigencies of // the war , a leader is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in making peace with the Turks , on the basis of independence , before the appearance of any individual of paramount influence , and before their political organization is matured , they would stand in a more critical position than at present . Whether we look , therefore , to the piobability that the character so much wanted will arise among them , under the strong urgency of the times , or that the common peril will gradually draw their counsels into harmony , and effect a mature organization , the continuance of the contest , notwithstanding the misery incident to it , must be regarded as a part of the necessary education of the people , in the school of liberty . At all events , there they are , a gallant race , struggling single handed for independence ; an extraordinary spectacle to the world ! With scarcely a government of their own , and without the assistance of any established power , they have waged , for six years , a fearfully contested war against one of the great empires of the earth . When Mr Canning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental nations , who should violently interfere with the English system , he sought to render the menace more alarming , by calling it a war of opinions , ' in which the discontented of every other country would rally against their own government , under the banner of Great Britain . On this menace , which , considering the quarter from whence it proceeds , comes with somewhat of a revolutionary and disorgani*ing tone , we have now no comment to make . The war now raging in Greece , is , in a much higher and better sense , a war of opinion , which has actually begun ; and in which the unarrayed , the unofficial , and we had almost said the individual efforts and charities of the friends of liberty , throughout Christendom , are combating , and thus far successfully , the barbarous hosts of the Turk . Deserted as they have been by the governments to whom they naturally looked for aid ; by Russia , who tamely sees the head of the Russian church hung up at the door of his own cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , and the protectress of the lonian isles ; by the holy alliance , that takes no umbrage at the debarkation of army after army of swarthy infidels , on the shores of a christian country , the Greeks have still been cheered and sustained by the sympathy of the civilized world . Gallant volunteers have crowded to their assistance , and some of the best blood of Europe has been shed in their defence . Liberal // contributions of money have been sent to them across the globe ; and , while we write the sentences , supplies are despatched to them from various parts of our own country , sufficient to avert the horrors of famine for another season . The direct effect of these contributions , great as it is ( and it is this , which has enabled the Greeks to hold out thus far ) , is not its best operanon . We live in an age of moral influences . Greece , in these various acts , feels herself incorporated into the family of civilized nations ; raised out of the prison house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened states . Let an individual fall in with and be assailed by a superior force , in the lonely desert , on the solitary ocean , or beneath the cover of darkness , and his heart sinks within him , as he receives blow after blow , and feels his strength wasting , in the unwitnessed and uncheered struggle . But let the sound of human voices swell upon his ear , or a friendly sail draw nigh , and life and hope revive within his bosom . Nor is human nature different in its operation , in the large masses of men . Can any one doubt , that if the Greeks , instead of being placed where they are , on a renowned arena , in sight of the civilized world ,  --  visited , aided , applauded , as they have been , from one extreme of Christendom to the other ,  --  had been surrounded by barbarism , secluded in the interior of the Turkish empire , without a medium of communication with the world , they would have been swept away in a single campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trampled into the dust ; and the Tartars , that returned from the massacre , would have brought the first tidings of their struggle . This is our encouragement to persevere in calling the attention of the public to this subject . It is a warfare , in which we all are or ought to be enlisted . It is a war of opinion , of feeling , and of humanity . It is a great war of public sentiment ; not conflicting ( as it is commonly called to do ) merely with public sentiment operating in an opposite direction , but with a powerful , barbarous , and despotic government . The strength and efficacy of the public sentiment of the civilized world are now therefore to be put to the test on a large scale , and upon a most momentous issue . It is now to be seen , whether mankind , that is , its civilized portion ,  --  whether enlightened Europe and enlightened America will stand by , and behold a civilized , christian people massacred en masse ; whether a people that cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly // intercourse with us ,  --  that send their children to our schools ,  - -  that translate and read our historians , philosophers , and moralists ,  --  that live by the same rule of faith , and die in the hope of the same Savior , shall be allowed to be hewn down to the earth in our sight , by a savage horde of Ethiopians and Turks . For ourselves , we do not believe it . An inward assurance tells us , that it can not be . Such an atrocity never has happened in human affairs , and will not now be permitted . As the horrid catastrophe draws near , if draw near it must , the christian governments will awaken from their apathy . If governments remain enchained by reasons of state , the common feeling of humanity among men will burst out , in some effectual interference . And if this fail , why should not Providence graciously interpose , to prevent the extinction of the only people , in whose churches the New Testament is used in the original tongue ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer the religious charities of this and other christian countries , whether the entire cause of the diffusion of the gospel is not more closely connected with the event of the struggle in Greece , than with anything else , in any part of the world ? Is not the question , whether Greece and her islands shall be Christian or Mahometan , a more important question , than any other , in the decision of which we have the remotest agency ? Might not a well devised and active concert among christian charitable societies in Europe and America , for the sake of rescuing this christian people , present the most auspicious prospect of success , and form an organization adequate to the importance and sacredness of the object ? And can any man , who has humanity , liberty , or christianity at heart , feel justified in forbearing to give his voice , his aid , his sympathy to this cause , in any way , in which it is practicable to advance it . Small as are the numbers of the Greeks , and limited as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has not , since the last Turkish invasion of Europe , been waged a war , of which the results , in the worst event , could have been so calamitous , as it must he allowed by every reflecting mind , that the subjugation and consequent extirpation of the Greeks would be . The wars , that are waged between the states of Christendom , generally grow out of the disputed titles of princes , or state quarrels between the governments . Serious changes no doubt take i ) lace , as these wars may be decided one way or the other . Nations , formerly well governed , may come under // an arbitrary sway ; or a despotic be exchanged for a milder government . But , inasmuch as victor and vanquished belong to the same civilized family ; and the social condition , the standard of morality , and the received code of public law are substantially tbe same , in all the nations of Europe ; no irreparable disaster to the cause of humanity itself can ensue from any war , in which they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , succeeded in invading and conquering England ( and this is probably the strongest case that could be put ) , after the first calamities of invasion and conquest were past , which must in all cases be much the same , no worse evils would probably have resulted to the cause of humanity , than the restoration of the Catholic religion , as the religion of the state , the introduction of the civil in place of the common law , and the general exclusion of the English nobility and gentry from offices of power and profit ; an exclusion , which the English government itself , since the year 1688 , has enforced toward the Catholic families , among which are some of the oldest and richest in the kingdom . Whereas , should the Turks prevail in the present contest , an amalgamation of victor and vanquished would be as impracticable now , as when Greece was first conquered by the Ottoman power . The possession of the country has been promised to the bey of E*ypt , as the reward of his services in effecting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to military execution of the most cruel kind , and the women and children would be sold into Asiatic and African bondage . We are not left to collect this merely from the known maxims of Turkish warfare , nor the menaces which have repeatedly been made by the Porte , but we see it exemplified in the island of Scio . On the soil of Greece , thus swept of its present population , will be settled the Egyptian and Turkish troops , by whom it shall have been subdued . Thus will have been cut off , obliterated from the map of Europe , and annihilated by the operation of whatever is most barbarous and terrific in the military practice of the Turkish government , an entire people ; one of those distinct social families , into which Providence collects the sons of men . In them will perish the descendants of ancestors , toward whom we all profess a reverence ; who carry in the language they speak , the proof of their national identity . In them will be exterminated a people , apt and predisposed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;onnected with // the rest of Europe , by every moral and intellectual association : and capable of being reared up into a prosperous and cultivated state . Finally , in them will perish one whole Christian people ; and that the first , that embraced christianity ; churches , actually founded by the apostles in person , churches , for whose direct instruction a considerThle part of the New rres. tament was composed , after abiding all the storms of eighteen centuries , and surviving so many vicissitudes , are now at length to be razed ; and in the place of all this , an uncivilized Mahometan horde is to be established upon the ruins . We say it is a most momentous alternative . Interest Ituntani generis . The character of the age is concerned . The impending evil is tremendous . To preserve the faith of certain old treaties , concluded we forget when , the parliament of England decides by acclamation to send an army into Portugal and Spain , because Spain has patronized the disaffection of the Portuguese ultra royalists . To prevent a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Austria and France invade those countries with large armies . Can these great powers look tamely on , and see the ruin of their Christian brethren consummated in Greece ? Is there a faded parchment , in the diplomatic archives of London or Lisbon , that binds the English government more imperiously , than the great original obligation to rescue an entire Christian people from the scimitar ? Can statesmen , who profess to be , who are , influenced by the rules of a chaste and lofty public morality , justify their sanguinary wars with Ashantees and Brn'mans , and find reasons of duty for shaking the petty thrones of the interior of Africa ; and allow an African satrap to strew the plains of Attica with bloody ashes ? If they can , and if they will , then let the friends of liberty , humanity , and religion take up this cause , as one that concerns them all , and each , in his capacity as a Christian and a man . Let them make strong the public sentiment on this subject , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done , by the perseverance and resolution of small societies , and even individual men . Let them remember how small a company of adventurers , unpatronized , scarcely tolerated by tlmir government , succeeded in laying the foundations of this our happy country , beyond a mighty ocean . Let them recollect , that it was one fixed impression , cherished and pursued in the heart of an humble and friendless mariner , through long // years of fruitless solicitation and fainting hope , to which it is owin * , that these vast American continents are made a part of the heritage of civilized man . Let them recollect that , in the same generation , one poor monk dismembered the great ecclesiastical empire of Europe . Let them bear in mind , that it was a hermit , who roused the nations of Europe in mass , to engage in an expedition against the common enemy of Christendom ; an expedition , wild , indeed , and unjustifiable , according to our better lights , but lawful and meritorious in those who embarked in it . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , on those lovely islands and once happy shores , over which a dark cloud of destruction now hangs , the foundations of the christian church were first laid , it was by the hands of private , obscure , and persecuted individuals . It was the people , the humblest of the people , that took up the gospel , in defiance of all the patronage , the power , and the laws of the government . Why should not christianity be sustained , in the same country and by the same means , by which it was originally established ? If , as we believe , it is the strong and decided sentiment of the civilized world , that the cause of the Greeks is a good cause , and that they ought not to be allowed to perish , it can not be , that this sentiment will remain inoperative . The very existence of this sentiment is a tower of strength . It will make itself felt , by a thousand manifestations . It will be heard in our senates , and our pulpits ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the cause of America was mightily strengthened and animated by the voices of the friends of liberty in the British parliament ?

Let it not be operated upon by tales of piracies at sea , and factions on land ; evils , which belong not to Greeks , but to human nature . Let the means of propagating authentic intelligence of the progress of the revolution be multiplied . Let its well wishers and its well hopers declare them-. selves in the cause . Let the tide of pious and Christian charity be turned into this broad and thirsty channel . Let every ardent and high spirited young man , who has an independent subsistence of two or three hundred dollars a year , embark personally in the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // yet worn except by him , who so lately triumphed in the hearts of the entire millions of Americans . Let this be done , and Greece is safe .
