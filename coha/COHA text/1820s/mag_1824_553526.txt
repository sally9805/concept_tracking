ART . XX. - The Miscellaneous Poems of WILLIAM WORDS* WORTH . 4 vols. l2mo . London , 1820 . Iv we have unworthily neglected this original and admira-* ble poet , we have but followed the example of our countrymen , and done our part toward the general wrong , which his merits have suffered . With the exception of the Lyrical Ballads , which were printed many years ago , if we remember rightly , at Philadelphia , and which are not now to he bought , not a single work of Wordsworth has been repuhlished in this country . We have republished Moore and Campbell to their last song , and Byron to his last scrap . Hogg , Rogers , Brown , Milman , Montgomery , Bernard Barton , Barry Cornwall , Leigh Hunt , and a host more of minors , have covered our booksellers ' counters , and been spread abroad throughout our land ; but he , who has done more than any living writer to restore to poetry the language of feeling , nature , and truth , remains unread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this neglect we apprehend to be , the incapacity of the common mass of readers to appreciate many of the most refined beauties of the poet ; the defects into which he has betrayed himself ; and the influence of the severe and unjust criticisms on his poems , which have appeared in that popular work , the Edinburgh Review . We readily allow , that if a poet wishes to be read , he must write so as to be understood ; and if he persists in being unintelligible , he must inevitably pass away into oblivion . But the remark is applicable only to intrinsic obscurity and nonsense , and not to that depth of feeling , which common hearts can not fathom , and that heaven of invention ' to which common minds can not ascend . These are characteristics , which must necessarily mark all great poets , who must yet possess other excellences or attractions , more level with the standard of ordinary apprehensions , before they can be .. - come popular . Now it so happens , that Wordsworth 's high and peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those auxiliaries , which secure a ready fame . They are accompanied by no winning tale , full of // interest and incident , no romantic legend , no wild and fitful story of passion , revenge , and death ; they follow the path .. way of no restless and gloomy wanderer , they are linked with the fortunes of no border chieftain or desperate outlaw ; but are breathed out in lonely musings by the side of mountain streams , or in the bosom of solemn groves , or over some humble flower ; they are spoken in the passing night-wind , the voice of the desert ocean , or the simple answer of a peasant 's child . These are sounds , which , though listened to by many with enthusiastic delight , are heard but carelessly , if heard at all , by the generality of readers . They are rich things , which the world can not value ; and being our poet 's only treasures , the world deems him poor . It has no sympathy with his grand abstractions , his poetical dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Nature utters from her rural shrine ; and as he has little else to offer to its sympathy , it is no wonder , perhaps , that the fellowship between them has been small . This circumstance alone sufficiently accounts for his unpopularity ; and will probably prevent him , at least for a long time to come , from being received into general favor . His striking defects have stood in the way of hisjust repu* tation . We say his striking defects , because we really think them great and obvious . We have no intention of setting him up on the weak and narrow pedestal of our own partiali .. ties , as a golden image of perfection and worship ; we mean not to pronounce his unqurdified panegyric ; we desire to render him , according to our ability , and our unbiassed conceptions of his merit , his due honor ; and we are sensible that we shall rather defeat than subserve this aim , by pertinaciously defending his manifest errors . Among these errors , we should say that the principal , and fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system or theory with regard to the offices and language of poetry . The system itself is true and beautiful , as we hope presently to show ; but its own master has abused it . He is often puerile when he intends to be simple ; and his tenderness sometimes de-* generates into weakness . He is right in believing that the // $3S April , feelings , imaginations , reasonings , occupations , and habits of those in humble life are proper subjects for poetry ; but he is wrong in compelling poetry to repeat their commonplace ideas , and seriously investigate their ordinary household arrangements and domestic implements ; and partictilarly wrong in making her blow a trumpet before every shepherd 's door , and swell out into a vast importance those circumstances , which , if discussed at all , should have been treated with a brevity and indifference suited to their station . Then too he gravely uses many words and phrases , to which custom his annexed low and comic associations . It is no defence against this charge , to say that these associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rescued from their company and dominion ; the words have taken their place , and it is proper that a definite place should be assigned to them ; they are stamped , and must pass for their coined value . It is as fit that there should be epithets exclusively employed to designate mean objects and ideas , as that others should constantly represent those which are lofty , affecting , and sublime ; and it is out of the power of the greatest genius to drag forth the former from their destined rank , and set them , with any show of justice or decency , among the latter . You might as well put the sutler of a camp at the head of the army , and declare that he had as good a right there as the general , and looked as well . It is but fair , however , that we should here allow the poet an opportunity of speaking for himself on this point , in an extract from one of his prefaces ; especially as his confessions are so candid , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general , and that , consequently , giving to things a false importance , sometimes , from diseased impulses , I may have written upon unworthy subjects ; but I am less apprehensive on this account , than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary connexions of feelings and ideas with particular words and phrases , from which no man can altogether protect himself . Hence I have no doubt , that in some instances , feelings , even of the ludicrous , may be given to my readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic . Such faulty expressions , were I convinced they were faulty at present , and that they must necessarily continue to be so , I would willingly take all reasonable pains to correct . But it is dangerous // to make these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals , or even of certain classes of men ; for where the understanding of an author is not convinced , or his feelings altered , this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own feelings are his stay and support , and if he sets them aside in one instance , he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all conf1* dence in itself , and becomes utterly debilitated . To this it may be added , that the reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the poet , and perhaps in a much greater degree ; for there can be no presumption in saying , that it is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through which words have passed , or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other ; and above all , since he is so much less interested in the subject , he may decide lightly and carelessly . ' In answer to the latter part of this quotation it is suffi. - cient to say , that words are the property of the public , and not of an individual poet ; and though the poet may exercise a certain degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their relations , he has no power over those whose uses are definitely settled , Mr Wordsworth has himself furnished us with another answer , by avoiding in his later poems those words and terms , which we have taken the liberty to condemn . Another defect of our poet is , that he talks too much . He follows out his trains of thought through all their branches , and to their remotest points . He appears to be either deficient in the power of discrimination , or unwilling to exercise it . We are presented with *ll his cogitations , whatever may be their character and value , and are left to make our own selections . Thus it often happens , that his beauties are to be dug up from the midst of worthlessness ; like fair statues , and bright gems , and rare medals , from heaps of rubbish and beds of ashes* There is no man , who , if he were to utter all the notions and fancies which come into his head , would not utter a great deal of absurdity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And so it is with him . In the simplicity of his heart he pours out all its meditations , and of course they ' will not all be of equal moment . It is to be questioned , however , whether we are not gainers at last , by this unrestricted freedom of expression ; whether many of his highest imaginations are not struck out in , the course of // this profuse and care1e*ss creation ; whether we should not miss his bounty , if we could check his prodigality . If so , we say for ourselves , let us have both ; we desire no change , and should deplore an economy attended with so great a deprivation . But here we will conclude our notices of Mr Wordsworth 's defects , for we feel it to be an ungrateful task . Neither will we produce any instances of his faults , because that has already been amply done by the Edinburgh R*viewers . And now we come to speak of the third cause of his unpopularity , the treatment which he has received from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We remember perfectly well the blighting influence , which their reviews exerted in this country on his poetical name . It shrunk ax4ay like an early flower from a relentless wind , till none knew that it had a being , except the few who were riot to be shaken from ' their admiration of it by heartless ridicule , and who did not prize it the less because the sun of public favor shone not on it , and it was a shaded and slighted thing . Nineteen out of twenty of those , who were asked : what they thought of Wordsworth , would answer you with a laugh and a sneer . Think of Wordsworth ! What should they think of him , but that he was a puling nursery rhymester , a rival of Mother Goose , a manufacturer of some scores . of foolish verses about Betty ' Foy , and Peter Bell , and a boat shaped like a crescent moon ! Did not the Edinburgh Review say so ? And did it not quote line after line to establish its assertions ? Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partial , mangled , and unfair quotations . The reviewers confessed , to be sure , that Mr Wordsworth 's poems evinced genius , originality , and pathos ; and they made one or two extracts from them , which they granted were fine ; but they took care that their ridicule should obliterate the impressions of their extorted praise , and that the whole effect of their criticisms should be to raise a ' laugh against the poet , and prevent his works from being read or sought after . They notice the Address to the Sons of Burns , after visiting their Father 's Grave . ' Never was anything more miserable , ' say they ; and they quote one of the four verses of which it then consisted , and which is certainly rather // poor . But we will quote the last verse , and ask our readers whether it be so very miserable . Let no mean hope your souls enslave ; Be independent , generous , brave ! Your father such example gave , And such revere ! But be admonish 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The verse quoted by the reviewers was afterwards expunged by the author , and is not contained in the edition of Miscellaneous Poems , which stands at the head of our article . This omission may have been made in consequence of the sneer of the reviewers ; but how much more generous would it have been in them , to have copied the good as well as the bad verse , and then advised the poet to separate them ? They also held up to ridicule an ode , which , in our edition , ends the fourth volume . We can not refrain from copying - a considerable part of the conclusion of this ode , so cavalierly condemned , in which the poet consoles himself for the loss of youthful imagination , by reflecting on the gifts of maturity . What though the radiance , which was once so bright , Be now forever taken from my sight ; Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass , of glory in the flower ; We will grieve not , rather find Strength in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been must ever be ; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering ; In the faith that looks through d*ith ; In years that bring the philosophic n**id . And oh , ye fountains , meadows , hills , and groves , . Think not of any severing of our loves ! Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might ; I only have relinquished one delight , To live beneath your more habitual sway . I love the brooks , which down their channels fret Even more than when I tripped lightly as they ; // The innocent brightness of a new born day Is lovely yet ; The clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober coloring from an eye , That bath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ; Another race hath been , and other palms are won . Thanks to the human heart by which we live ; Thanks to its tenderness , its joys and fears ; To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts , that do often lie too deep for tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know what good poetry is . But the Edinburgh Reviewers could not quote it . Was it because they could not understand and feel it , or because they were afraid that their readers might do both ? At the close of the review , three sonnets , and some portions of the Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , on the Restoration of Lord Clifford , ' are quoted with approbation . But , notwithstanding this lagging and ineffectual praise , their main purpose was evidently to jeer , misrepresent , and destroy . We might exhibit further proofs of this purpose from other articles ; but we have dwelt on the subject long enough . We could not , however , say less than we have done , because we believe that the undeserved neglect into which the poetry of Wordsworth has fallen in this country , is in a great measure owing to the criticisms of the Edinburgh Reviewers ; and because we believe those criticisms were penned with illiberality and unfairness . We will now endeavor to point put some of the excellences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr Wordsworth . One of his great principles is , that nothing is beneath a poet 's regard , which has to do with the mind and heart of man . We have one common nature . The external differences of life may induce various habits , may present objects of thought in various lights , and give birth to various degrees of refinement ; but they can not destroy the original passions , feelings , and capacities , which are common to all men . rrh0 man of highest rank and most finished education must love , and hate , and pity , and be sorrowful or joyful , like the humblest peasant ; and we must all be affected by true and lively descriptions of these imnautable passions and sensations // whether the subject of them be the peasant or the lord . Certain of this kindly interest , feeling its most gentle influences on his own soul , and desirous of cultivating it in others , as a bond of human fellowship and brotherhood , Mr Wordsworth has generally preferred selecting his descriptions from the lowly walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted in that direction , and because passion is there more simple and unsophisticated , more the thing itself , ' than in the cultivated classes of society . These sentiments are expressed in many parts of his poems , as for instance in the three following verses from Peter Bell . Long have I loved what I behold , The night that calms , the day that cheers ; The common growth of mother earth Suffices me-her tears , her mirth , Her humblest mirth and tears . The dragon*s wing , the magic ring , I shall not covet for my dower , If I along that lowly way With sympathetic heart may stray , And with a soul of power . These given , what more need I desire , To stir  --  to soothe  --  or elevate ? What nobler marvels than the mind May in life 's daily prospect find , May find , or there create ? He does not give us complete pictures , however , of rural life and manners , but exquisite sketches , or rather what the brethren of the pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tell the story of a single affection , together with the feelings and reflections excited by the subject within his own breast . Writing in this way , he is of course free to choose his materials ; and these are of a kind to call forth pleasant associations , or such sad and melancholy ones as are not unpleasant . He seems unwilling to dwell on the scenes of squalid poverty and brutal ignorance , which are so often presented among the poor ; and who will blame him for opening his heart , and our own hearts , toward what is innocent and good in that condition of society ? His poetry sheds its light of love over their manners and pursuits , as a // rich setting sun pours its beams upon their cottages , gilding their torn thatch and ragged walls , and blending them with a landscape of peace and beauty . The old Cumberland Beggar ' is a fine example . The Brothers ' is the most touching narrative of fraternal affection which we remember . In The Idiot Boy , ' he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of maternal love in a simple woman for an idiot child , and the recurrences and dialogue are unnecessarily silly . This poem is the most conspicuous instance in the four volumes , in which he has driven his theory too far . Nearly connected with the interest , which his muse takes in the feelings and concerns of untutored men , is that which she manifests in the purity , artlessness , and budding intellect of children . The little ballad , We are Seven , ' which is intended to show with what difficulty we admit in childhood the idea of death , is a beautiful exemplification of his power in simple pathos . His theory respecting the language of poetry , is like that which he entertains with regard to its subjects . The language in which real passion is really expressed , the language of nature and of life , he affirms to be the true language of poetry . He discards those high sounding words , which were once thought to form the only proper poetical dialect , and despises all that vain show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem , or enough of itself to constitute one . He selects those words and phrases , to be sure , which are best adapted to his purpose , and which declare in the most forcible maimer the idea he means to convey ; but he employs those which are plain and in common use , and equally avoids weakening a good thought by an affected and roundabout way of announcing it , and endeavoring to supply the want of thought by a profusion of parade and sound . In this principle we go along with him with our whole heart . Few things are more tiresome to us , than the jingle and flourish which many people call poetry . We think we should choose the penance of hairshirt and whipcord , in preference to that of being obliged to toil through such a peformance as Darwin 's Loves of the Plants . There is as much difference between these preparations of pomp and paraphrase , and true poetry , as there is between // the precise , complimental , ready made speeches of what is sometimes termed a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spontaneous conversation , which flows from a clear head and a warm heart . There are even many words and forms of expression , which , though once highly emphatic , have now , by hackneyed repetition , almost lost their flavor ; and , like certain kinds of fruit in old orchards , have run out . In such cases , the language of fact again becomes the language of poetry , because it is the most forcible . We might give many examples from the volumes before us , in which our poet has given additional energy to a noble thought by simple diction . The following is one of the Sonnets dedicated to Liberty , and is entitled , Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland . ' Two voices are there ; one is of the sea , One of the mountains ; each a mighty voice ; In both from age to age thou didst rejoice , They were thy chosen music , Liberty ! - There came a tyrant , and with holy glee Thou fought'st against him , but hast vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven , Where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee . Of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft , Then cleave , 0 cleave to that which still is left ; For , high souled Maid , what sorrow would it be , That mountain floods should thunder as before , And ocean bellow from his rocky shore , And neither awful voice be heard by thee ! What sublime personification is here , and yet how simple is the language ! The last four lines are grand . They fall on the spirit like the slow and solemn notes of Luther 's Judgment Hymn . We can not forbear another specimen of a different character , in which the calm strength of conjugal love is uttered in quite an imaginative vein of poetry , yet at the same time in the plain language of sincerity . She was a phantom of delight , When first she gleam 'd upon my sight ; A lovely apparition , sent To he a moment 's ornament . // Wordsworth 's Poems . April , Her eyes as stars of twilight fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all things else about her drawn From May time and the cheerful dawn . A dancing shape , an image gay , To haunt , to startle , and waylay . I saw her upon nearer view , A Spirit , yet a Woman too ! Her household motions light and free5 And steps of virgin liberty ; A countenance in which did meet Sweet records , promises as sweet ; A creature not too bright or good For human nature 's daily food , For transient sorrows , simple wiles , Praise , blame , love , kisses , tears , and smiles . And now I see with eye serene The very pulse of the machine ; A being breathing thoughtful breath , A traveller betwixt life and death ; - The reason firm , the temperate will , Endurance , foresight , strength , and skill ; A perfect Woman , nobly planned , To warn , to comfort , and command ; And yet a Spirit still , and bright With something of an angel light . But the great distinction and glory of Mr Wordsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nature . He sees her face to face ; he is her friend , her confidential counsellor , her high priest ; and he comes from her inmost temple to . reveal to us her mysteries , and unravel those secret influences which we had always felt , but hardly understood . It is not merely that he admires her beauties with enthusiasm , and describes them with the nicest accuracy , hut he gives them voice , language , passion , power , sympathy ; he causes them to live , breathe , feel . We acknowledge that even this has been done by gifted bards before him ; but never so thoroughly as by him ; they lifted up corners of the veil , and he has drawn it aside ; he has established new relationships , and detected hitherto unexplored affinities , and made the connexion still closer than ever between this goodly universe and the heart of man . Every person of susceptibility has been // affected , with more or less distinctness , by the various forms of natural beauty , and the associations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , the expanse of ocean , the gladness of a sunny field , The silence that is in the starry sky , The sleep that is among the lonely hills . Wordsworth has taught these sentiments and impulses a language , and has given them a law and a rule . Our intercourse with Nature becomes permanent ; we acquire a habit of transferring human feelings to the growth of earth , the elements , the lights of heaven , and a capacity of receiving rich modifications and improvements of those feelings in return . We are convinced that there is more mind , more soul about us , wherever we look , and wherever we move ; and there is ; for we have imparted both to the material world ; there is no longer any dulness or death in our habitation ; but a sweet music , and an intelligent voice , are forever speaking to our secret ear , and the beauty of all visible things becomes their joy ; and we partake in it , and are elevated by it , and gather from the confiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker of them all . The following extracts from Lines written in early Spring , ' exhibit that part of our poet 's creed , which attributes feeling to material things . To her fair works did Nature link The human soul , that through me ran ; And much it grieved my heart to think , What man has made of man . Through primrose tufts , in that sweet bowers The periwinkle trailed its wreaths ; And t is my faith , that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes . The birds around me hopped and played ; Their thoughts I can not measure ; But the least motion , which they made , It seemed a thrill of pleasure . The budding twigs spread out their fang To catch the breezy air ; And I must think , do all I can , That there was pleasure there // J68 April , The corresponding impressions of natural objects on the human soul , are illustrated in the four verses , which we shall next quote from a poem consisting of seven , in which Nature is represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her own influences ; and these influences are fancifully extended to the corporeal form , as well as to the character of her pupil . She says , This child I to myself will take ; She shall be mine , and I will make A lady of my own . Myself will to my darling be Both law and impulse ; and with me The girl , in rock and plain , In earth and heaven , in glade and bower , Shall feel an overseeing power To kindle or restrain . She shall be sportive as the fawn , That wild with glee across the lawn , - Or up the mountain springs And hers shall be the breathing balm , And hers the silence and the calm Of mute insensate things . The fkating clouds their state shall lend To her ; for her the willow bend ; Nor shall she fail to see , Even in the motions of the storm , Grace that shall mould the maiden 's form By silent sympathy . The stars of midnight shall he dear To her ; and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivulets dance their wayward round , And beauty , born of murmuring sound , Shall pass into her face . Tintern Abbey ' is a variety of the same class . If we were called on to point out our favorite piece among the four volumes , we should name this . We can make no extracts 4 from it , because we are certain , that wherever we might begin , we should not be able to take away our pen till we came to the end of the poem . // The animation and sense , with which Mr Wordsworth endues nature , breathe a living spirit into all his descriptions of scenery . In this walk of poetry he has been compared with Crabbe . Crabbe 's descriptions are as inferior to Wordsworth 's , as the lovely though lifeless image of Pygmalion was inferior to the same image , when celestial fire had sent beat* ing blood through its arteries , a light to its eyes , a smile to its lips , and a voice to its tongue . They both describe accurately , and Crabbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes of the former address the ey* alone ; those of the latter , the eye and the soul . Take for example this picture of a mountain solitude , from a poem called Fidelity , ' commemorating the same instance of that quality in a traveller 's dog , on which Sir Walter Scott has written some beautiful stanzas . It was a cove , or huge recess , That keeps , till June , December 's snow ; A lofty precipice in front , A silent tarn* below . Far in the bosom of Helvellyn , Remote from public road or dwelling , Pathway , or cultivated land ; From trace of human foot or hand . There , sometimes doth a leaping fish Send through the tarn a lonely cheer ; The crags repeat the * croak , In symphony austere ; Thither the Rainbow comes  --  the CloudAnd Mists that spread the flying shroudAnd Sunbeams  --  and the sounding Blast , That , if it could , would hurry past , But that enormous barrier binds it fast . And who but a heaven taught poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcribe from The Pass of Kirk-stone ? ' While the coarse rushes , to the sweeping breeze , Sigh forth their ancient melodies ! Crabbe would have described this field of rushes as exactly as possible ; but his was not the ear to hear them sighing // 370 April , forth the same wild notes , which the Roman and the Druid listened to . And this we say without wishing at all to dis-. parage his poetical talents , for which we entertain the highest respect . We have made our extracts thus copious , not more from inclination than a sense of duty . We believe we can venture on one more , considering that so many volumes of poetry are before us , which have never been opened to our readers . It is one of the Miscellaneous Sonnets describing a morning view of London from Westminster Bridge . It will be perceived , that the same internal spirit is communicated to this picture , as to the preceding sketches of rural stenery . Earth has not anything to shew more fair ; Dull would he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its majesty . This city now doth like a garment wear The beauty of the morning ; silent , bare , Ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples , lie Open unto the fields , and to the sky , All bright and glittering in the smokeless air . Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendor , valley , rock or hill ; Ne'er saw I , never felt , a calm so deep ! The river glideth at his own sweet will ; - - the very houses seem asleep ; And all that mighty heart is lying still It is the author of poetry like this , whom we have been accustomed to hear treated with d6rision or indifference . We trust that many have done so from having been kept in ignorance of the merit which they depreciated . Still , perhaps , there will be others , who in their gravity and wisdom will condemn our taste , and look down on the whole matter as puerile conceit , and a babble of green fields . Let them enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth , and imbibed the spirit of his poetry , can never be made to resign , or be ashamed of his partiality ; for he feels that the principles , on which that poetry is founded , are strong and immutable , that its spirit entwines its roots with the fibres of the heart , and is as enduring and true as devotiGn and love . He knows , too , that however this poet may have // been disregarded , he has borne a most important part ' in giv-. ing its character to the poetry of the age ; he knows that many of the poets , with whose writings this country is so familiar , have borrowed some of their sweetest minstrelsy from strains , which have reached us but rarely and faintly from the mountains of Westmoreland ; and he is continually detecting plagiarisms , both in spirit and in letter , made from the volumes of Wordsworth , by those who have joined to depress him . He regards him , in short , as he would regard an intimate and intelligent friend , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received but little exercise , and met with little sympathy , in the ordinary intercourse of life ; who could address feelings , which had never been spoken to before , but had sat silently in his heart , musing , and solitary , and ignorant of companionship .
