txt ART . IV. - Observations on the Growth of the Mind . By SAMPSON REED . Boston . Svo. pp. 44 . PERHAPS there has been no age , Since the world was estabJished as the abode of man , so generally confident of progress , and so full of anticipations of further advancement , as our own . It looks back on the ages that are past , and asserts that it is wiser and better than they . It looks forward on the ages to come , and acknowledges that they will far surpass it . Though proud of its superiority , it is generous and impartial in its pride , for it is prepared and willing to be excelled . It is conscious of its abundant acquisitions , but it has been taught by many of these , that there is more to be acquired ; and it calls , with a voice of disinterested hopefulness , on the still nobler and more successful exertions of future time . This voice of the age , feeble and stifled in many regions of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which mankind are the most intelligent and free , enjoying the greatest share of light and the greatest li*berty to make use of it . Never was the voice so loud , so united , so cheering . We join in it with all our strength . It is to us the voice of reason and truth . It is our nature proclaiming its origin and its destiny ; it is experience holding high converse with futurity ; it is deep calling unto deep . For melancholy auguries we have no faith ; and for the outcry against innovation , no reverence . We hold courage to be wisdom , and confidence to be true philosophy . We do not doubt , nor fear . And yet we think , that amid the prevailing excitement of the times , there may be occasionally discerned something like extravagance , a passion for the unreal and undefinable , a straining after improbabilities ; as if there were no bounds to human power , no limit to its capacities . There is a disposition in some , who have observed the attainments already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching out all possible attempts and improvements , in all the provinces of art and intellect . - It is a matter of course , that such a disposition should be developed by the fermentations and powerful workings , which have been going on in society . But we find fault with it on two accounts . The first is , that its indulgence is a useless employment of time . It is as idle , as it is easy , to sit down and foretell that // such and such great things may come to pass . It is far more difficult , and far more useful , to go to work in perfecting some improvement already commenced , or in producing dome actual and available invention , in our opinion , the man who adds ever so little , to the real stock of human knowledge , or actively engages in diffusmub and enforcing the undoubted laws of virtue , is beyond comparison a more valuable member of society than the man who merely imagines future glories and attainments , just *thin the precincts of possibility , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain . The second objection which we entertain against this romantic disposition , is , that it is regardless of the checks which do and always must operate to retard the march of improvement , and of the visible limits within which the Creator has confined the human intellect . If we stop for a few moments to take a glance at some of these checks and limits , it will not be because they are not obvious , but because they are so , and that being so , they are nevertheless overlooked and disregarded in the flights of wild conjecture . We may notice first , the boundaries and successive stag es of life . Its utmost extent is but a short period for any considerable advancement in the wide field of knowledge ; and appears much shorter , when we reflect bow small a portion of it can be devoted to vigorous and effectual exertion . What a long blank is denoted by those words , infancy and childhood ! What a large portion of life is consumed in learning how to use the hands , the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strength in the body or discretion in the mind . Years pass axvay before the simplest elements of knowledge are imbibed , or a moiety of that learning is acquired which has been in the world for centuries . We all begin the race of existence on the same line ; we start from the same post ; ignorance and helplessness are the inevitable commencement of all that is human . The first lessons of the spelling book are as incomprehensible to an infant , as the Principia of Newton , or the Analogy of Butler . - Then youth comes , as it always has come , and always will come , fiery , passionate , reckless , headstrong ; refusing counsel , confiding in its own wisdom , and contradicting the best established dictates of reason , prudence , and experience . The most perfect system of instruction imaginable can only in some measure restrain , but it can not eradicate youthful passion ; it voL . XXIv. - No. 54 . S // may point out the safe path , hut it can not prevent the communication between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviation , and encouraging departure . You may look forward , therefore , to what age of the world you xviii , and there xviii still be infancy and childhood to be taught the rudiments of all that is known , and youth as strongly impelled as ever by those forceful passions which are kneaded into our very clay . The middle period of life is somewhat sobered and subdue&amp; it has learnt most of what is useful , and is prepared to take up and carry forward the great work of improvement . But even in this period , how much time is seized upon by the common cares and wants of humanity . The ground is to be tilled ; the sea is to be traversed and fathomed ; the body is to be clothed and fed ; children are to be maintained and educated and provided for . Where will be the end of this ? There xviii be no end ; in the nature of things there can be none . These will be the great occupations of man while the world stands . The chain xvhicli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its links were forged in the beginning ; they are wrought out of the necessities of his nature . Old age is the season of quiet and rest , of repose after labor and fatigue , of peace after contention and tumult . The veteran retires from service , and seats himself by his hearth , and hangs up his arms . He may repeat the story of his battles , but we do not expect to see him again in the field . Old people are generally satisfied with what was ( lone in the time of their activity ; and not only so , but they are persuaded that nothing more and nothing better is to be done . XVe admit that there are exceptions ; but the rule is well established on fact . They are indisposed to exertion ; it is natural that they should be ; as the frame wears out , the spirit becomes exhausted . They think everything is accomplished in the cause of humanity , of which the cause is susceptible ; and this too is natural , for their own part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood follows ; an emptier blank than the first , because it is imbecility without promise . What rational person can predict any su ( Iden improvement , while these are the appointments of the different stages of life ? Why should we roam beyond those limits of our nature which were fixed on the day when man was created , and which will remain till the end of his allotted abode on earth ? // But we have not yet spoken of prejudice , which acts like a law of moral entail , and brings down error from one generation to another . Nor of diversity of intellect , and opposition of opinkirn , which keep truth in a perpetual balance , and divide and parcel out falsehood among all classes and denominations . Nor of interest , which sways a man downward , and hinds his heart to his treasure . Nor of pride , the champion , who is always ready , with visor down and lance in rest , to do battle for self . These are not temporary obstacles , which may be hereafter removed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make its way over and through them ; for they belong to the soil , and rise up in it on all sides and without end . But great men come forward , from time to time , and make great discoveries ; and when they die , they transmit the fruits of their invention , not to children , but to men , who are able to appreciate , apply , and increase them . How many such heirs will they find ? How many who can claim even distant kindred with them ? What portion of mankind understand the works of a great astronomer , or a great metaphysician ? And oUt of that portion how many are there who can correct and enlarge them ? It needs but little arithmetic to compute their number ; they may all be counted on the fingers . And the knowledge of the few is slowly and in small quantities imparted to the many . It is long before the simplest results of their labors are appre-b headed by the mass of mankind . What ocean floods and cataracts of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heavens ; and yet what spare threads of the glorious stream reach us here below , and how many years they have been on their silent descent . Bat there are bounds to the most adventurous and expansive intellect ; heights which it can not scale ; depths which it can not sound ; holy and mysterious recesses of nature , at the fast doors of which it has knocked anxiously and repeatedly for admission , and the hollow echo within has reverberated the notice , that there was no entrance there . What mind has conceived of a never beginning and never ending eternity , beyond the primary and-most general definitions ? Or of boundless space ; or of the principle of gravitation ; or of the essence of the Deity ; or the manner in which he lives , creates , and rules ? Who shall reconcile the Divine foreknowledge with human free will ? Take the sword to the knot , and cut it , and declare that men have no liberty , that they are not free agents , because God has determ // med @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconcile necessity with accountability , and inform us why a man should be punished , either here or hereafter , for a sin which he was foreordained to commit . It is true that they who have written books on these subjects , and have taxed all their ingenuity in attempting to solve the j ) roblems contained in them , have thought that they have indeed worked out a solution ; but we do not see it ; the world does not see it ; there is no approximation to an agreement in the controversy . We are by no means of opinion that such investigations are useless ; but we do think that they will be endless . And how should our researches be rewarded with perfect success , when we are so imperfectly acquainted with that which is the agent in making them ? We talk of mind and its final triumphs . What is mind , and where is it ? What information can the mind give us of its own simple nature ? As little as it can of the nature of Him who formed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent substance , entirely distinct from matter , or whether it is a system of results from material organization . The anatomist may search and dissect , with his nicest instruments , from the surface to the innermost marrow , and when all is over , he knows just as much of the nature of man , as he does of the next bird or quadruped which may come under his knife , and no more . He knows not even what life is , nor how it begins , nor how it is suspended , nor on what it depends . One has his theory ; another has his ; the very word is a confession of ignorance . How does mind act upon matter , if it is really separate from it ; and how is it connected with matter and affected by it ? Why do the diseases of the body sometimes lay the mind in ruins , and sometimes pass over it ; and leave it upright and strong ? But it is idle to multiply these questions . We return to the primitive assertion ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present to take one side or the other of the controversy ; only we hope that we shall never dogmatize on either . We think it probable that the question will never be satisfactorily determined , however positively it may be argued . We would not disturb faith , nor check its generous and holy aspirings . Yet it gains nothing in our eyes , we confess , when it becomes visionary or assuming . A meet companion for it is humility ; and nothing is better adapt*d to assure their fellowship , than a view of the near boundaries of human knowledge . // We remain , as we began , the advocates of human improvemerit ; firmly convinced that knowledge has been and now is in a progressive state ; that in some directions it may advance almost indefinitely ; and that hapoiness and virtue are likewise increasing on the earth . it is only necessary , as it seems to us , to name the bare names of peace , liberty , toleration , equality , and charity , to prove how much more generally these subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much this difilised unde standing of them has conduced to the security , dignity , and enjoyment of man . Why then have we spoken of limits , doubts , ignorance , and frailty ? Simply that a proper apprehension might be entertained of human powers , and of the objects to which they may be most safely and productively applied . It is important that we should know where to devote our exertions ; what is to be accomplished in its due order and degree ; and the best manner in which it is to be effected ; so that life may not be spent in speculation , nor genius wasted in revery . The inquiry of the philanthropist ought to be , what is now to be done ; not , what is to be done a thousand years hence . In this manner he not only renounces the thraldom of old authority and prescription , and assumes that something is to be done , but he feels himself called upon to contribute his own immediate exertions . If we look around us to discover what are the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find that they consist not so much in invention as instruction ; not so much in the promulgation of original knowledge , as in the diflhsion among many , of that which had long been the property of a few . We presume that Jeremy Taylor entertained as clear an apprehension of the principles of toleration and religious liberty as is entertained by any one at the present day ; but those principles are now understood by a thousand , where they were understood in his time by one ; and the consequence of this consentaneous adoption of them is , that they are beginning to be extensively and thoroughly practised upon . Milton perceived the value of education , and its important effects on the community , as clearly as we do ; but how many are there who now enjoy the privilege of abundant instruction , who , if they had lived when he lived , would not have been able to read the word of God , or to write their own names . And that which has been so happily supplied , is still the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *e for the // wider dissemination of existing knowledge . The crying want of society , morally and intellectually considered , is , not for any striking discoveries from individuals , but that the multitude should be raised up to the same attainments which well instructed individuals already possess , and which have been possessed by a scattered few in almost every period of recorded time . Let us infuse into the community at large , precisely the faith and the morals which have been formerly professed and practised hy a small and disconnected company , and we may look on all indefinite schemes and visions with indifference . What greater thing could come to pass , than that all men should be made as rationally pious and practically religious as was Locke , for instance , to say nothing of his less attainable characteristics ? Yet all that would be new in this case would be the universal conformity to a known exemplar . Let us try to lift up as many of our fellow beings as we can to this , or any other exalted moral standard . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task which may gloriously employ the powers of the most gifted and accomplished minds . The happiness of the world is to he expected from the liberal communication of sentiments , views , principles , and motives , which are already in the world . The path of duty is right onwards ; and it must conduct to successively higher stages of improvement , so long as it is honestly and steadily pursued . There is much before our very eyes , and within the compass of our plain ability , which needs to be altered , perfected , or destroyed . What are the best ways of securing these visible objects and advantages ? We must search for them . This is a part of the labor ; and in this respect , we allow , there is an urgent and almost constant call for invention ; hut the invention of means and not of ends ; the finding out how that which is already invented , may be made common and useful ; how prejudices , which have long been under suspicion and displeasure , may be safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be most easily , acceptably , and beneficially introduced to the young mind ; how the best principles may be made the predominant ones ; how the practice of that which is received , may lead to the establishment of that which is hoped for . Thus the objects of effort and invention come plainly and bodily into our presence , and appear in a practicable position and form . We are no longer misled by fancies and dreams , either our own , or other men 's ; theory submits to the ordeal of // proof ; and the genuineness of improvement is confirmed by the signature and seal of experience . Diffusion and dissemination , therefore , are the great designs of the age . Invention is their servant and minister . It is no vain show which is in progress . The gold of the treasury must be more widely thrown out amono the crowd . The heaps yet b of the granary must he yet more generously distributed among the dwellings of the poor . The time has come , when men must have the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . The old notion , that there may be one belief for the multitude , and another for the initiated , now seems to he more glaringly false and empty than ever , and should be indignantly dismissed by every honest man . One simple , serious conviction should take its forfeited place , and be the counsellor of all our exertions ; the conviction that whatever is most reasonable and proper should be attempted and carried through , without even asking the question whether it is new or whether it is old , whether it makes its appearance for the first time to day , or whether it has been acknowledged through a long line of generations . We must look steadily to that which is right , and then we shall no more despise what is old , in a temper of hasty vanity , nor be haunted by the fear of what is new , which , of all fears , is the most unworthy of a mind which pretends to be free , or desires to be just . It will be readily perceived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no objection whatever to originality and boldness , or to anything which wears a feature of improvement . It will also be perceived that our impressions of human life and human nature are such , that we place little confidence in extravagant anticipations , and give little respect to mystical and cloudy revelations of the future . It is not , therefore , against any novelties which there may be in Mr Reed 's pamphlet on the Growth of the Mind , but against its indefiniteness and mysticism that we shall lay our charges . We honor the apparent purity of its purpose , the spirituality and the independence of its character . We admire the force and beauty of much of its imagery ; we are pleased with the general peculiarity of its style , which sometimes throws an air of originality over the thought which it dresses . But if he intended it to inform and instruct the public mind , or even to accompany the progress of the present time , we can not doubt that in these respects he will b* disappointed ; among the number // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be few who will succeed . For ourselves , we found it a difficult matter to get through the fortyfour pages of this work , within double the time which we usually bestow on the same quantity of words . We do not suspect the author of intentional obscurity , but we doubt whether , if he had tried , he could have wrapped up his meaning in a thicker mantle of darkness than that which now invests it . This arises in part from what seems to be the mysticism of a peculiar religious faith . It arises in part also , from the want of a visible connexion between the several propositions of the work . There is no regular succession of clearly defined steps , leading the reader to a firm conclusion . Thought follows thought , and image treads hard upon image , like a hastily assembled crowd , who keep in motion , but without precisely knowing the quarter to which they should go . The author , indeed , proposes to himself an object , but if he keeps it in his own view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we often lost sight of it entirely . It is the object , ' he says , ' of the following pages , not to be influenced by views of a temporal or local nature , but to look at the mind as far as possible in its essential revealed character , and beginning with its powers of acquiring and retaining truth , to trace summarily that developement which is required , in order to render it truly useful and happy . ' p. 6 . This is sufficiently distinct , and prepares us to expect something like regularity and a lucid order ; instead of which we are presented with a set of deep metaphysical discussions , almost every one of which might stand by itself as an independent essay , and almost any one of which , as it seems to us , might be struck out , without being missed . The first dissertation is on memory . With a part of this we were quite favorably impressed ; for it is intelligible and true . It concerns the connexion between the memory and the affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the affections . This connexion is obvious from many familiar expressionsi such as , remember me to any one , by which is signified a desire to be borne in his or her affections-do not forget me , by which is meant do not cease to love me-get by heart , which means commit to memory . It is also obvious from observation of our own minds ; from the constant recurrence of those subjects which we most love , and the extreme difficulty of detaching our // own minds or the minds of others from a favorite pursuit . It is obvious from the power of attention on which the memory principally depends , which if the subject have a place in our affections requires no effort ; if it have not , the effort consists principally in giving it a real or an artificial hold of our feelings , as it is possible if we do not love a subject , to attend to it because it may add to our fame or our wealth . It is obvious from the never fading freshness retained by the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the later periods of life . As the old man looks back on the road of his pilgrimage , many years of active life lie unseen in the valley , as his eye rests on the rising ground of his younger days . ' pp. 6 , 7 . The second dissertation is on time . What is time ? ' Mr Reed asks twice ; and after a deal of refinement and subtilty , he answers that it is nothing at all . Out upon time ! ' exclaims Lord Byron , in a passage which some of our English brethren think very fine ; Out upon time , ' he repeats ; and Mr Reed has taken him at his word . Father Time is severely handled his scythe is snapt ; his hour glass is broken ; and he himself is banished . In the course of this process , we were first carried back in imagination to those pleasant academic scenes , in which we were accustomed , in affirmative and negative array , to prove our youthful powers on that venerable personage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered . We saw Time fold up his wings . Our grandfathers were our brethren ; we became in our dream contemporary with the patriarchs , and shook hands with Adam , and touched our hat to the last man . But when we came to ourselves , we were forcibly struck with the justice , in this case at least , of the Scotchman 's definition of metaphysics . Metaphysics , ' said the shrewd Northerner , is twa men talkin ' thegither . He that 's listenin ' does na ken what he that 's talkin ' means , and he that 's talkin ' does na ken what he means himself . ' Seriously ; if Mr Reed intends to be useful , and that he does so intend we have no doubt , he must be more perspicuous and intelligible in what he writes for the public . Whatever is , or is to be the growth of the mind , ' he must accommodate himself better to its present state , for we apprehend that it is not yet able to profit by his disquisitions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our advice , because he appears to have that within him , which , if properly directed , might exert a strong and healthful influence on others . The following passages , though // tinged with the prevailing mysticism of the piece , are eloquent and beautiful . The natural world was precisely and perfectly adapted to invigorate and strengthen the intellectual and moral man . Its first and highest use was not to support the vegetables which adorn , or the animals which cover its surface ; nor yet to give sustenance to the human body-it has a higher and holier object , in the attainment of which these are only means . It was intended to draw forth and mature the latent energies of the soul ; to impart to them its own verdure and freshness ; to initiate them into its own mysteries ; and by its silent and humble dependence on its creator , to leave on them when it is withdrawn by death , the full impression of his likeness . It was the design of Providence , that the infant mind should possess the germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could hardly be learned . The care of God provides for the flower of the field , a place wherein it may grow , regale with its fragrance , and delight with its beauty . Is his providence less active over those , to whom this flower offers its incense ? No . The soil which produces the vine in its most healthy luxuriance , is not better adapted to the end , than the world we inhabit to draw forth the latent energies of the soul , and fill them with life and vigor . As well might the eye see without light , or the ear hear without sound , as the human mind be healthy and athletic , without descending into the natural world , and breathing the mountain air . Is there aught in eloquence , which warms the heart ? She draws her fire from natural imagery . Is there aught in poetry to enliven the imagination ? There is the secret of all her power . Is there aught in science to add strength and dignity to the human mind ? The natural world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . In books , science is presented to the eye of the pupil , as it were in a dried and preserved state ; the time may come when the instructer will take him by the hand , and lead him by the running streams , and teach him all the principles of science as she comes from her maker , as he would smell the fragrance of the rose without gathering it . ' pp. 19 , 20 . But what can be more irrelevant to the author 's subject , what can be more unnecessary and useless , than the tilt which he soon after runs against rhyme . It may be peculiar , and is said with deference to the opinions of others , but to my ear , rhymes add nothing to poetry , but rather detract from its beauty . They possess too strongly the marks of art , and produce a sameness which tires , and sometimes disgusts . // We seek for them in vain in nature , and may therefore reasonably presume that thay spring out of the peculiar state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mii*d itself ; that they are rather the fashion of the dress , than any essential part . In the natural world we find nothing which answers to them , or feels like them  --  but a happy assemblage of living objects springing up , not in strait lines and at a fixed distance , but in God 's own order , which by its apparent want of design , conveys the impression of perfect innocence and humility . It is not for that which is human to be completely divested of the marks of art ; but every approach towards this end , must be an approach towards perfection . The poet should be free and unshackled as the eagle ; whose wings , as he soars in the air , seem merely to serve the office of a helm , while he moves on simply by the agency of the will . ' * , p. 25 . True it is that every man has a right to his opinion and taste concerning rhyme . This we readily agree to . But why , in a treatise on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel censure , we can see no reason . And how the mind or the morals are to be benefited by the exclusion of rhyme from po*try , is to us incomprehensible . We confess ourselves partial to this kind of music ; for music it certainly is . We wage no warfare against blank verse , or any other species of poetry ; but we should regard the disuse of rhyme , as anything rather than an improvement . This however is not the place for a defence of it ; nor was Mr Reed 's pamphlet the place for an attack upon it . We introduced the passage , because we intended from the first to deal plainly with the writer , and with his whole performance ; and to show how beauty in it was succeeded by defects , and defects were mingled and conjoined with beauty ; to show how a singular acuteness was accompanied by a strange want of precision ; how boldness fought in vain , in the darkness , and usefulness was marred by mystery . We should not have dwelt thus long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not considered it in some respects a performance of more than common merit , and had *ot entertained a sincere respect for the talents of its author . If we have indulg*d a little in remarks which were other than seripus , it is not because we would cast a slight upon his opinions , but because we thought that some of them were inappropriately introduced , and enigmatically expressed . His love of nature , his unaffected piety , his high and manly sense of liberty , his confidence in hu-. // man progressiveness , and his longings after a higher and better state of the world than that which it now exhibits , are entirely delightful to us , and induce us to hope for some future production from his pen , in which we shall find more matter for admiration and less room for complaint .
