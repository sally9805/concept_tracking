txt ART . VII. -. /2 Course of Study preparatory to the Bar and the Senate ; to which is annexed a Memoir on the Private and Domestic Lives of the Romans . By GEORGE WATTERSTON. pp. 240. l2mo . Washington . 1823 . Davis &amp; Force . IN this work we find many things , which accord with our own views respecting the study of the ancient classics , and the place they ought to hold in a system of education among us . It is a subject , as we must believe , of no small importance to those who are fond of letters , and interested in the // advancement of national education . We take the present Opportunity to offer a few remarks concerning it ; and in the outset we ask , does classical learning deserve special encouragement , as a branch of instruction in this country ? This question we answer without hesitation in the affirmative , and proceed to give our reasons and express our opinions . Supposing the merits of the question to be known and allowed so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline of the mind , or esteemed as models of style , we shall pass rapidly over these topics on this occasion , and endeavor to show , that there are particular reasons , why the study of them ought to be promoted among us . We are not disposed to attribute benefits to the pursuits of the learned , which are not a consequence of them ; nor to magnify the advantages , which they unquestionably confer . Be it , therefore ; freely conceded , that in some things they have no very direct practical utility , that they do little towards promoting commerce or manufactures , and that they contribute less towards increasing the national population , revenues , or territory . The noble characters , which distinguished the various epochs of the history of the ancient republics , have been justly held up as models for imitation ; and the constant study *of their writers has been commended by the judicious as the surest means of forming a correct taste , and learning the principles of a good style . And even here- , on the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence of classic learning , we would not represent Greece and Rome as the only mothers of great men , as alone rich in inventive genius or active virtue . There are poets , who have never tasted of Helicon ; politicians renowned for justice , who never heard of Aristides ; defenders of free governments , who have known nothing of the patriotism of the Gracchi ; martyrs in the cause of liberty , who have never been quickened by the example , nor encouraged by the fame of Leonidas . Though the rules and models of fine writing are to be sought in ancient literature , the works of Franklin have still been extolled for their almost faultless simplicity ; and at present our most admired moral writer , who has addressed himself to the best feelings of our nature with winning eloquence and exquisite purity of taste , is not , we believe , indebted to classic learning for the // elegance , or the chastened fervor of his style . We would not substitute ancient literature for the whole of intellectual culture , nor the greatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The dispute respecting the Comparative merits of the ancients and moderns is one of the most idle , that has been recorded in the history of letters . Let us be just to them both . Because Sophocles is another name for perfection in the tragic art , should not the imagination still be charmed by the more free inventions of Shakspeare , or the equally stern sublimity of Alfieri ? The study of Demosthenes will but increase our admiration for Burke ; and we shall never feel a deeper reverence for our own national benefactors and champions , than on rising from the pages of Herodotus . While we thus disclaim any intention to ascribe to classic studies practical benefits , which they do not confer , or to exaggerate the good effects , which they are certainly calculated to produce , we may without fear of contradiction assert , that an acquaintance with them , and the discipline of the mind resulting from the exertions , which are necessary to gain that acquaintance , sharpen and invigorate the faculties , and thus form an excellent preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these studies furnish an elegant and suitable occupation for men , who have retired from the busy scenes of action ; that they form a pleasing relief in the character of the soldier and the statesman ; that Germanicus , for instance , among the ancients* gains more of our admiration for having polished and improved his mind by the study of Grecian letters ; or , to come to our own times and country , that the distinguished diplomatist , who fills the department of state , though learning confers no additional claim to the gratitude of the nation , deserves increased respect for his attainments as a scholar . As none will contend , that the classics should be taught as a necessary bianch in military schools , or in those principally intended for the training of youth for the mechanical or practical arts , so none will deny , that the study of them essentially belongs to that higher education , which proposes for its object the culture of the intellectual man . If the study of languages is of moment , the Greek and Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more ancient , and therefore th' // more nearly original , because they have exercised an influence over all polished dialects of later nations , and because they are in themselves more perfect . To this we add , that they are dead languages , beyond the reach of change ; the seal has been set upon them ; their principles of construction and the force of their words are unalterably fixed ; and , therefore , they best serve to illustrate the abstract principles of grammar . It is also indisputable , that these studies form the necessary basis of education for the man of letters , that no branch of literary history can be perfectly understood without a knowledge of them , that they are indispensable to eminence in at least one profession , and are , to speak moderately , worthy of being pursued by all , who value the culture of taste , and the enjoyment of eloquence and poetry . We may also add , that they have proved themselves the faithful assistants of creative genius , that many of the most tender and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by classic letters . Virgil has been the master of Racine , of Petrarca , and of a spirit of still higher order , of Dante himself ; a refined and enlightened nation has applauded Sophocles once more in the tragedy of Voltaire , and Milton has drawn many of his boldest images and most inspiring thoughts from the same living springs of beauty . ' As it has of late grown too much the fashion to speak of the ancient writers , as chiefly fitted to employ the curious in philology , it is the more necessary to mention , that they have served to enrich , discipline , and embellish the minds of those , who , in modern times , have created or perfected the literature of their respective nations . But we would not be detained too long from our main design . There are particular reasons why classic learning should be cultivated in the United States . And the first of these we find in our very situation , in regard to the ancients . Their writings are their only monuments , to which we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rest our belief of their greatness on the testimony of others . The nations of Europe have visible witnesses . Parts of Germany , Switzerland , and France , possess monuments , and works of art , full of instruction respecting the past . Traces of the Romans are still to be observed in Great Britain , local traditions concerning them are current among the people ; and // the English capital contains at present specimens of Grecian sculpture , which more than divide admiration with the noblest statues at Rome . Besides this , on a large portion of the con* tinent of Europe , the rights of persons are guarantied to the nations , which have no constitutions , solely by the existence of the Roman jurisprudence , of which the elements were , it is true , collected and arranged under an emperor , but were originally created in an age of liberty . And in the southern countries , the Italians , reposing like foreign pilgrims near the ruins ' of their predecessors , are constantly admonished of their degeneracy by the still existing monuments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the plains round the Eternal City are abandoned , gather from the wrecks which surround them sufficient proof , that the land was once occupied by a nation that indulged in vast conceptions , which it possessed the energy to execute . And the modern Greek sees , on all sides objects , which indicate that the former occupants of the soil were the high minded advocates of liberty . But we possess none of the works , with which the ancient cities were embellished . We can not acquire their statues nor their works of art ; we can not learn from the remains of their labors , how persevering they were in all enterprises connected with public utility ; we can not believe in their devotion , their consummate skill , their sublime conceptions , from observing the stately symmetry of their temples . Our hills , our mountainous passes , our towns , our bays , have no associations , which lead the thoughts back to the times , when poetry breathed her earliest accents , and freedom won her first battles . Of Grecian or Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate but their literature . And what more could we desire ? What better inheritance can our country receive from the ancient republics than the writings , which contain the thoughts and sentiments of their finest minds ? We say again , those writings deserve especially to be studied by us ; because their tendency is favorable to free institutions . The Athenians , though they sometimes flattered kings , never eulogised the regal form of government . They cherished the love of freedom to the last , and their regrets at its loss are almost as instructive as their pride in its possession . Nor should we forget , to what class of so voL. xsx. - xo. 44. .17 // ciety the Grecian writers belonged . They were men , who , having enriched their minds by travel and intercourse with the learned of other countries , returned , like Plato , to ripen their powers and their knowledge by reflection . Or they were men , who wrote , after retiring from political or military life , in which they had vigorously defended the rights and liberties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persians ; Sophocles , who led the chorus in celebrating the victory of Salamis , was afterwards distinguished as a soldier and a statesman ; Thucydides did not become a writer , till his country had refused the farther use of his sword ; and Herodotus paused amidst his literary career , to take the lead in a successful revolution against the tyrant of his native city . The best works of the Grecians were produced during their independence ; and in the later writers the spirit of a better age than their own is reflected . In Roman literature we have sometimes cause to be disgusted with servile adulation ; we could wish that Horace had not employed his genius in celebrating the victories of Augustus ; and should cherish Virgil the more , if something of the rustic republicanism of the elder days were discoverable in his verse ; but these are the poets , whose works are to be studied , that the principles of good taste ma5* be observed in their practical application , and the imagination become familiar with beautiful conceptions ; the understanding is stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the ancients prized personal independence and freedom of public debate . Everything of general interest was regularly communicated in the market places ; and the comic theatre was the tribunal before which , as in modern newspapers , the characters of public men were scrutinised with unrestrained boldness . In their works of an elevated tone , in the orations of Demosthenes , for instance , the doctrine of liberty is taught on the principles , which make it of universal value , and is supported , not merely because it makes a nation more prosperous , but because it is essential to the moral dignity and intellectual freedom of individuals , and equally essential to the honor of the state . We can but desire , that such views should be encouraged by all possible means ; we need not fear , though the study of Homer should teach other lessons than those of passive obedience ; we should // find pleasure in being instructed , by the rules of ancient liberty , ' how a people may provide for its prosperity and glory . We may add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . Some foreign assistance is needed in the great concern of national education . But if we make use of none but English books , or if we do not go beyond the literature of living nations , there is danger of being affected with some foreign taint ; of supporting our intellectual existence by aliment not perfectly suited to our condition . The study of the classics deserves , therefore , to be encouraged as a means of preserving national literary independence . A much stronger argument lies in the probable influence , which they would exert on national character . The Greeks preferred beauty to utility , glory to prosperity . Vast sums , employed for works of art , formed a large , and as it seemed to them , a necessary part of the annual expenditure of their states . If the tendency of our age were to ruinous extravagance , in all matters connected with public property , if one state were contending with another in the architectural perfection of its edifices , if the first settlers of the fertile banks of our western rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the same spirit , which raised St Peter 's , or the York cathedral , were at work among our countrymen to the injury of good thrift , and in contempt of rational calculation , it would be the duty of every patriotic citizen to repress even the sublimity of enthusiasm , and to counteract the immoderate love of display , by sober and practical views of utility . But we are in no danger of being carried too far by our zeal for objects , not directly necessary to our welfare . Our fathers have given us excellent political and civil institutions established on a solid foundation ; commerce has enriched our cities ; internal navigation is promoted by the grandest efforts of public and private enterprise ; the springs of the Mississippi have already been turned into the Hudson ; and the chain of the Alleghan ies is to offer , it would seem , hut a temporary barrier to the union of the Ohio and the Potomac . We have done , or are doing , everything to further objects of public and private advantage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide for the other sources of national glory and happiness ; to cherish a disinterested passion for the elegant and ornamental arts , // till our country shall surpass every other , not only in the value of its political privileges , and the prosperity of its citizens , but also in the perfection of its monuments . At this epoch , therefore , while the nation is so rapidly forming its character , and while it is still possible to introduce new elements , the study of classic letters deserves to be encouraged , because it tends to awaken and cherish a love for the arts , by which society is adorned and refined . In a free country , moreover , there should be no limits to inquiry . It is desirable , that the condition of man in every age should be known ; that human nature should be studied under all her aspects ; that every form of society and every revolution in governments should be understood . And the last reason , why we would defend the study of classic literature is , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophers , still remain unrivalled . We look backwards along the wastes of time , and behold them eminent above all others , shining through the gloom of ages , as stars of changeless and unequalled brilliancy . The languages , which were in use before the time of Homer , so far as modern culture is concerned , have wholly perished ; they may have been harmonious and expressive ; but the poet did not bestow on them immortality by breathing into them thought and passion . The Greek was the mother tongue of the Muses , ' the first language , in which the life blood of master spirits was embalmed and treasured up to a life beyond life . ' The ancient literature of Greece has been the fosterer of genius in other countries and ages . The more elevated minds among the Romans comprehended its excellence , and delighted to transfuse its beauties into their native dialect . And from that time to the present , its influence has been directly or immediately exerted on the literature of every European nation , and always with benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than instruction , may be found in its writers . Keep your books , ' says Cicero to Atticus , alluding to the Greek library of the latter ; I do not despair , but I can one day make them mine ; which if I obtain , I shall surpass Crassus in opulence . ' Cicero wrote in the ripeness of manhood , and the Attic tongue was as familiar to him as his own . I have seated Homer , ' says Petrarca , when he was no proficient in Greek , by the side of Plato , the prince of poets by // the prince of philosophers ; and I glory in the sight of my illustrious guests . ' And then he breaks out into lamentations , that his ignorance of the language made him deaf to the voice of M*onides . We know not whether a more honorable testimony be borne to the excellence of the Grecian literature , by the hopes of Cicero , or the regrets of Petrarca . But on this topic we will enlarge no farther , and will only add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another part of the Union , by a writer so judicious and well informed as Mr Watterston . Throughout the whole of his little volume , we recognise a man zealous for freedom of thought and speech , and for the diffusion of knowledge ; carefiil to inculcate good morals , and a respect for the Scriptures . Though some parts of his work are hardly practical , and his advice is sometimes indefinite , he shows a uniform desire of promoting the true discipline of the mind and sound learning . The first object , to which he adverts , is the study of the ancient languages and literature . We quote his remarks at large , as a specimen of his manner , and as containing correct* observations on an important subject . The study of languages is usually and properly the first step in a liberal and enlarged system of education . The youthful mind is peculiarly fitted for the acquirement and retention of words ; but not sufficiently expanded and vigorous to comprehend the nature , principles , and objects , of positive science . Memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most susceptible of improvement . Languages , therefore , as a branch of elementary knowledge , should be early attended to . They are emphatically the key to science , and the spring of life can not be more judiciously or advantageously employed than in acquiring them . A knowledge of what are termed the dead , and some of the living languages , I conceive to be absolutely indispensable to the character of a fine scholar , and an able and distinguished civilian and statesman ; and it is exceedingly to be regretted that these , especially the learned languages , are so much neglected in our country . This has arisen from a mistaken idea , that their attainment takes up too much time , and that the period usually devoted to their acquisition might be better employed in acquiring more solid and useful information . No error can be more glaring than this ; every day 's experience demonstrates its fallacy . The acquirement of the dead languages will be found to be attended with great and permanent advantages ; among which , it will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal faculties of the mind , and to beget a purity and refinement of taste , that no other kind of learning can bestow . The memory , for example , must be invigorated by the habitual exercise it undergoes , in the acquisition and retention of strange words and foreign expressions ; the judgment is improved , from the necessity the learner is under of selecting , out of many , the most suitable word to express the idea of the original-for the original gives the idea only ; the imagination is chastened and improved by the exquisite imagery , and the rich , chaste , and beautiful coloring the ancient authors display ; and the taste is improved by the fine models of purity and beauty , and the refined and delicate touches of nature , everywhere diffused over the pages of the Greek and Roman classics . The most eminent and distinguished men in oratory , poetry , history , law , &amp;c. have been well versed in those languages , and have had their minds early imbued with a love of these chaste and polished models of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; regard not the difficulties that may arise , at first , to impede your progress ; they will soon , by a little perseverance and application , be surmounted , and , when you have reached that point of familiarity with them , which will enable you to relish their beauties , and feel and enjoy their excellencies , they will become a source of high and exquisite gratification that will never forsake you , even amidst the dull and vapid realities of life . In acquiring those languages , it will be necessary to observe the peculiarities of style , the fine thoughts , and daring felicities of expression , which distinguish the authors you are reading , and to endeavor , frequently , to commit to memory the finest and most beautiful passages , that are to be found in the poets of Greece and Rome . This will strengthen the memory , improve the taste , and furnish you with happy illustrations , and apt and appropriate allusions . It will be proper , too , to keep up this practice while reading modern poetry ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orators have found , that it is of much greater advantage than yoa may now be disposed to believe . Of the copiousness , harmony , grace , and beauty , of the Greek and Latin languages , it is unnecessary to say anything . Those who study them , with that care and attention which they deserve , will soon be enabled to judge for themselves , and , of consequence , capable of relishing their various excellencies , without the aid of criticism . But of all the languages , ancient or modern I conceive the Greek to be the most admirable . A knowledge of that language was deemed by the Latins to be an indispensable branch of study , and should be so considered by the present and every future age . It is the foundation of most other languages , and is so blended with the sciences , as almost to form their keystone and groundwork . ' pp. 23-26. // After these general remarks Mr Watterston proceeds to the science of grammar , and then explains the degree of care with which the ancient languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their acquisition . Those persons , who are accustomed to hear the learning of Latin and Greek denounced as an almost impracticable undertaking , for men of common industry and leisure , must not be incredulous on reading the observations which follow , for experience fully supports their truth . We know not with what rapidity it is thought possible to read Homer in our schools ; but Tanaquil Faber says of his pupil , that one hour was sufficient not merely for understanding , but also for committing to memory a hundred lines of the Iliad . While I recommend such a proficiency in those languages as I have mentioned , I do not wish to be understood as conceiving it either important or essential , that you should be profoundly and critically versed in their different idioms and various metres , or be able to write them with fluency . I wish that degree of skill to be left to professors , who make teaching the occupation of life . It is enough that you can read them with such ease , as to be capable of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical writers abound . To this point your efforts must be directed , and if you have even an ordinary tact for the attainment of language , you will be able to reach it without any very appalling difficulty ; and when you have reached it , the acquirement of the modern languages will be a source rather of pleasure than of pain . Of those , the most useful are , the French , Spanish , Italian , and , if you please , the German . These , like the dead languages , may be regarded as instruments of knowledge , calculated to open to your mind a wider field , and more extended range of thought . Experience will show that the labor and difficulty of acquiring the dead , as well as the living languages , exist more in fancy than reality . In the short interval of eight months , Gibbon made himself a complete master of the Latin and French , with which he had been previously but superficially acquainted ; read a great deal in both , went through the Greek grammar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French writer of considerable ability asserts , that with a knowledge of the grammar barely sufficient to distinguish the cases of nouns , and the principal tenses of the verbs , a very competent facility in reading Greek may be obtained in the short space of five or six months . " I experienced , at first , some embarrassments , " says Deleuze , the writer I have alluded to ; " but the difficulties insensibly vanished ; the analogy of words enabled // me to recognise the roots , I became passionately fond of Homer ; the verses , which I had committed , recalled to me his expressions , and accustomed my ear to his harmony . In fine , in less than six months I was in a condition to read Sophocles . " ' pp. 29-31 . Mr Watterston continues to give good advice . In learning the Latin and Greek , I beg you to remember never to resort to translations to enable you to acquire a knowledge of these , or , indeed , of any other languages . Its tendency is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with too much facility , at the meaning of the words you desire to translate . This facility enfeebles the memory , and by thus depending so little upon it , the foreign word is no sooner acquired than it is forgotten , and language , in truth , becomes nothing more than " winged words . " ' pp. 32 , 33 . It is the purpose of Mr Watterston to present a general outline of the studies essential to the lawyer , or the statesman . We can not follow him through the various subjects of which he treats , and we regard his work as valuable rather for the interest it may awaken in liberal pursuits , than as a practical guide to the young inquirer . Private study , however well directed , can never be equal in its results to a public education . It is the advantage of great universities , that , besides the libraries and collections which they possess , each science has its peculiar teacher , whose honor and success depend on his eminence in his own branch ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various habits of thought , yet each thoroughly versed in the department which belongs to him . All narrowness of feeling is thus prevented ; and all fantastic humors and vain speculations are counteracted by collisions with other inquirers after knowledge , and the different views of the instructers . In the progress of his work Mr Watterston recommends the study not only of rhetoric and oratory , but of poetry also , as a means of refining the mind , enriching the imagination , and supplying the imagery , illustrations , and fire of diction , which render a public speaker more impressive . The mathematical sciences are sufficiently commended for their tendency to fix the attention , discipline the mind , and improve the reasoning faculties . A just knowledge of the earth and of physical geography is considered a necessary preparation for a course of history . Music is allowed to have claims to be // regarded in a good education , for nothing serves more to relieve the toil of study , and the gloom of solitude , to soften the asperities and lessen the miseries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton at his harpsichord , to be convinced of the justice of this commendation . In treating of the study of history , it is contended , and we doubt not , with justice , that a course of ancient history should precede the modern . But we can not agree with Mr Watterston in selecting Millot and Rollin as the best compilers of general history . The natural sciences are defended as worthy of being studied by men of business , for the new views which they give of the extent and power of Divine Providence , and the great variety of beautiful forms in which the supreme agency is exerted . To these subjects , add a knowledge of the sciences of morals , of religion , and of civil polity , and in the view of Mr Watterston the preparatory education of a young man is finished . We have left ourselves no room to enlarge on the topics suggested by the author 's remarks . In addition to its literary merits , his book is worthy of much praise for the spirit and temper in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many useful hints to parents and instructers , and as calculated to elevate the principles , guide the inquiries , and quicken the ardor of the youthful mind .
