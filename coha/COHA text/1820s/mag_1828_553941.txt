txt ART . VILI. -l . The United States of North Ilmerica as they are . London . 1828. 2 . The . /Irnericans as they are ; described in a Tour through the Valley of the Mississippi . By the Author of ' Austria as it is . ' London . 1828 . THE two works named at the head of this article are of very different character . We shall presently address our American readers ; meantime , we would advise the English reader , after he has run over ( literally run over ) the first of them , to put it on the grate . If he trust either to the opinions or the facts of the writer , he will be as likely to be misled // as not . There is some truth in the book , but so strangely mixed up with untruth , or so disguised and misrepresented , as to be known only by those , who know a great deal more of the country , than this writer will ever know of any country . When the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to read it again , still more attentively . It is not without defects , even as far as it professes to go , but these are generally accidental , some of them errors of the printer , perhaps ; those of this sort are rather more numerous than they ought to have been . The title of the hook might lead to some mistake , yet , as the route the author took is marked out , no intelligent Englishman will infer , that this is a complete account of the Americans as they are . ' But we have not seen a more correct view of'the western people , ' and also of Mississippi and Louisiana , than is here presented . The Austrian ' has represented what he saw , without disfiguring or disguising it . He disclaims all pretensions to literary merit , like Caesar when lie simply related what he saw and what he did . He writes correctly and with perfect ease . We must allow , that we have read this last volume of a British traveller , with very different feelings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hirelings or speculators , that preceded it . It is not an enlarged , philosophical view of the country , its inhabitants , and its resources ; but it is much better calculated for general readers , book-societies , ' and circulating libraries ; and well informed minds will find in it alimnent not unsuited to their appetite . We commence with our author where he commences his book , at Cincinnati . He says nothing of the states north or east of Ohio . Of course his description of Americans , though accurate , will he as novel to most of the citizens of the United States , as to his English readers . John Bull can with difficulty understand or believe this . With him an American is an American , whether lie live in Maine or Missouri , whether he fish on the Grand Bank , or trap on the Big Horn . The yellow fever is the great pest of the States , equally at Castine and Mobile , if , perchance , his geography has as yet admitted these outlandish words . The soil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kennebec , to the crumbling banks of the Ouachitta . Our author will rectify some of these mistakes . His views of Cincinnati are impartial and correct . One fact is worthy of notice . He visited that town in the autumn of 1826. // The population he states at twelve thousand , perhaps rather below the actual number . In March 1828 , his tour is published in London . The population of Cincinnati had by this time risen to eighteen thousand . The following extract is a fair specimen of his book . The prevailing manners of society at Cincinnati , are those peculiar to larger cities , without the formalities and mannerism of the eastern sea-ports . Freedom of thought prevails in a high de- ' gree , and toleration is exercised without limitation . The women are considered very handsome ; their deportment is free from pride ; but simple and unassuming as they appear , they evince a high taste for literary and mental accomplishments . The Literary Gazette owes its origin ( ? ) to their united efforts . There is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic river , its mild climate , which may be compared to the south of France , and the liberal spirit of its inhabitants , contribute to render this place , both in a physical and moral point of view , one of the most eligible residences in the Union . As much , indeed , may be said of the state of Ohio in general . It combines in itself all the elements , that tend to make its inhabitants the happies*t people on the face of the earth . Nature has done everything in favor of this country . In point of fertility , it excels every one of the thirteen old states , and owin , to its political institutions and the abolition of slavery , it has taken the lead among those newly created . ' There is , nevertheless , not any city in the state of Ohio , to be compared with New York , Philaadelphia , or Boston , nor is it probable there will be . Twenty years will not pass , before Cincinnati probably will number as many inhabitants as Boston now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensated by the absence of immorality and luxury ,  - -  evils necessarily attached to large and opulent cities , which may be said to attract the heart 's blood of the country , and send forth the very dregs of it in return . In Ohio , wealth is not accumulated in one place or in a few hands ; it is visibly diffused over the whole community . The county towns and villages are invariably constructed in a more elegant and tasteful manner than those of Pennsylvania , and the Northern States . Strange opinion this ! One would think that the writer had never seen the interior of New York or New England . There is something grand in their plan and execution , though the prevailing want or insufficiency of means to carry them through , is still an obstacle in th' way . The farms and country-houses are elegant ; I saw hundreds of them , which no English nobleman would be ashamed of . They are generally of brick , sometimes of wood , we should reverse this , they are generally of wood , sometimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in a tasteful style . The turnpike roads are in excellent order . This traveller visited Ohio in Autumn . He would have told another story the next spring . It is astonishing to see what has been done in a few years , and under an increasing scarcity of money , by the mere dint of industry . The traveller will seldom have occasion to rail at bad roads or bad taverns ; I could only complain of one of the latter , which stands upon a road that is seldom travelled . In every county town , there are at least two elegant inns not always the most elegant , and the tables are loaded with such a variety of venison and dishes of every kind , that even a gourmand could not justly complain . The whole state bespeaks a wealthy condition , which , far removed from riches , rests on the surest foundation , the fertility of the soil , and the persevering industry of its cultivators . Although behindhand , perhaps , with the Yankees in literary accomplishments , they are far more liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Their character is in truth , as a whole , Yankee character , under varied circumstances , modified indeed , by extraneous admixtures . ' The resolutions of their Assembly are quite free from that narrow-minded prejudice found in Pennsylvania and the Southern states , which sees in the laws of Moses the only rule for direction , and loses sight of that liberal spirit , which pervades the law of Christ . This may be just so , for we do not know what the writer would be at . The inhabitants of Ohio are not , however , so religious as their neighbors , the Pennsylvanians . Their ministers exercise little influence ; and numerous sects contribute greatly to lessen their authority , which is certainly not the case in the North . The people of Ohio are equally free from the uncultivated and rude character of the Western American , and from the innate wiliness of the Yankees . This state is not unlike a vigorous and blooming youth , who is approaching to manhood , and whose natural form and manners excite our just admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beautiful than true . This writer 's views of the Yankees , we suspect , were picked up at the South and West , and not the result of careful observation among the New-Englan ders at their own firesides . Pedlars and run-aways , or walk-aways , have not been the most winning avant-coureurs , for either the honor or the honesty of those that followed after ; neither were they a very fair representation of those that stayed behind . Yet our untravelled southern and western fellow-citizens have sometimes fallen into an error scarcely less palpable than this ; and foreigners , passing only among them , almost of necessity imbibe the same prejudices . // But we return to our author , or at least to Cincinnati . A year since when in that town , looking over an old Directory ( we forget for what year ) , we were struck with the various origin of its settlers , and tore out the leaf containing an Explanation of the Abbreviations of the Places of Nativity , ' which now lies before us , and which *e transcribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , Connecticut , District of Columbia , Delaware , Denmark , England , France , Georgia , Germany , Holland , Ireland , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan Territory , New York , New Jersey , New Hampshire , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Prussia , Poland , Portugal , Rhode Island , Scotland , Sweden , Switzerland , South Carolina , St. Domingo , Tennessee , Virginia , Vermont , and Wales . ' The population of Cincinnati , at the time this Directory was composed , we judge could not have exceeded six thousand . It may fairly be presumed , that , at the present moment , every kingdom of Europe , and every state of the Union , is represented in this republican congress . It may interest some of our readers to see the comparative strength of the respective delegations . New England 441 ( of which Massachusetts sent 184 , Connecticut 143 ) , Pennsylvania 394 , New Jersey 337 , New York 233 , England 192 , Ireland 173 , Virginia 113 , Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales 21 , France 19 , Switzerland 17 , unknown 42 . The British and Irish combined number 425 , nearly equalling the Yankees . At this xve were somewhat surprised , especially at the large proportion of Englishmen . We suspect in regard to that class of immigrants ( the English have adopted this word after due deliberation ) , that this proportion would by no means hold either in Ohio or any of the Western states . Probably many of those who accompanied Flower and Birkbeck to this country , quitting their leaders , took lodgings* in Cincinnati , and at length made it their home . This mixed and multifarious origin of Cincinnati could only be equalled by its Frenchifled , Latinized , Aboriginal name , Losantroville , which if the reader be skilled in decyphering , he will find to mean Village opposite the mouth of the Licking , a river which empties into the Ohio on the Kentucky side . Who had the honor of inventing this comprehensively descriptive epithet , we are not able to inform the reader . The present name was probably suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , was thought of ominous import // to the state . . /*propos of names , Marietta , the oldest town in the state , and of real Yankee origin and appearance , took its name from the unfortunate Queen of France . Before we leave Ohio with our travelling companion , we will notice a mistake , which we attribute to the printer , but similar ones occur too frequently in his book . Ohio , he says , comprises an area of 4,000 square miles , and contains a population of 72,000 souls . We must , however reluctantly , bid our friends in Ohio good bye , ' and proceed with our author on his tour through Kentucky . We regret the change in his fe clings towards the people among whom he passes ; we regret still more that there should be any occasion for it . We forbear however for numerous reasons , besides the want of space , to enlarge on this consideration . We would rather resume our journey with the author through the barrens of Kentucky . Never was the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the richest and most fertile lands in that rich and fertile state ; at proper seasons of the year , surpassing in the beauty and the fragrance of their flowers , the most highly cultivated gardens of New England . But they are destitute of trees , and hence this name . Our author did not visit Kentucky , at a proper season to witness this gorgeous display of unadorned nature ; yet he , for the most part , correctly describes the beauty and fertility of the soil , the amenity of the climate , the Inujesty of its primeval forests , the wide sweep of its extended and waving plains , the picturesque grandeur of its precipitous and broken streams , and , more than all , he seems to have been gratified with the abundance of its fruits , poured forth with a kind of royal and spontaneous liberality . But we must hasten on with him , or we shall never reach the end of our journey , for as yet we are at the beginning of his tour . He visits Louisville , which he describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents of this prison discipline mode of travelling with na*veU5 . Like a true Englishman he is always ready for an adventure or for sport , in pursuit of which he will plunge into the forest , or jump into the skiff . We select the following extracts as a specimen . We purchased below Troy ( seat of justice for Crawford county , Indiana ) half a young bear , at the rate of five cents per pound . Two others which were skinned , indicated an abundance of these // animals , and more application to the sport , than seems compatible with the proper cultivation of these regions . The settlers have something of a savage appearance ; their features are hard , and the tone of their voice denotes a violent disposition . Our Frenchman was bargaining for a turkey , with the farmer 's son , an athletic youth . On being asked three dollars for it , the Frenchman turned round to Mr B. , saying , " I suppose the Kentuckians take us for fools . " " What do you say , stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laying his heavy hand across the shoulders of the poor Frenchman , in rather a rough manner . The latter looked as if thunderstruck , and retired in the true style of the Great Nation , when they get a sound drubbing . We remarked , on his return , the pains he took to repress his feelings at the coarseness of the Kentuckians . There were two or three Kentuckians , fellow-passengers . Kentuckian is almost as general a word in the West , as Yankee is in the East . He was , however , discreet enough to keep his peace , and he did very well ; but his spirit was gone , and he never afterwards undertook to make a bargain , except with old women for a pot of milk or a dozen of eggs. * It is worthy of notice , that along the Ohio river for a great distance , not a pint of milk , nor a pound of cheese or of butter is to be had for love or money , although multitudes of the inhabitants possess from five to fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , which of course will produce a supply . Next follows a real Western adventure . We had the enjoyment of some sport on the water ; a deer was crossing the river , contracted in this place to about a thousand feet , when it was discovered by three Kentuckians , who were going to do the same . Our boat was about half a mile above the spot where we discovered the game . Four of us leaped into the skiff in order to intercept it . The deer continued its course towards the Indiana side , and it was easy for us to intercept its path . As soon as we were near enough , we aimed a blow at it with our oars , having in the hurry forgotten our guns . The deer then took the direction of the boat ; - we followed . The Kentuckians approaching from the other side , full thirty minutes elapsed before these could come up with the animal and give it a blow . Though its strength was on the decline , it did not relax its efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were more expert in handling their oars , seemed to stun the noble animal ; yet summoning up its remaining strength , it went up the river on the Kentucky side , and reached the shore , but so exhausted by // long swimming and the two blows from the powerful Kentuckians , that on landing it staggered and fell , without being able to ascend the high bank . Instantly one of the Kentuckians rushed upon it , cutting asunder the knee joints . The deer , taking a suddvn turn , made a plunge at the Kentuckian , tearing away part of his trowsers , and lacerating his leg . So sudden was the last effort of this animal , that but for the speedy arrival of his companion , who had been assisting the third Kentuckian in drawing the skiff closer to the shore , it would infallibly have ripped up its aggressor 's bowels . The dirk of the third Kentuckian ended the sport , which had terminated in a rather serious way . By this time we had also reached the field of battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounded Kentuckian with his poniard in his hand . " Part of the deer , which you know you could not have got without our assistance . " They first looked at our party of four , then at our boat , which was already at the distance of a mile and a half from us . The wounded man seating himself , asked again , " What part do you choose ? " " Half the deer with the bowels , and the the tongue for the ladies . " " Have you ladies on board your vessel ? " " Yes , Sir . " Without uttering a word more , they skinned the venison , cleaned and divided it . We stepped aside , meanwhile , collected a couple of dollars , and offered them to the wounded man . lie took the money , thanked us , and the other two carried the venison to our boat . We parted after cordially shaking hands . There was now an abundance of pigeons , venison , and bear 's flesh on board our boat ; the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a sweet and luscious taste . We were all partial to it except the Frenchman , who most likely took us for a species of these animals . But as thoughts are free , even in the most despotic countries , he had the privilege of thinking , without daring to utter a syllable ,  --  assuredly the severest punishment upon one of the Great Nation . ' The Englishman will out . Go where he will , he carries with him an hereditary , instinctive aversion to a Frenchman . We notice this circumstance here , to take occasion from it to observe , that this writer is putting himself ofl or his publishers are putting him off , for a foreigner of distinction . The insinmatiort is , that he is a German nobleman , of what rank we have not seen hinted . In this character he is noticed in the London Literary Gazette , and his Tour reviewed . Whether the reviewer was a bond ficie believer in his Austrian or Continental origin , or whether this is only a trick of the trade , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English as this , we neither believe , nor believe possible . Besides this , it is one of // the few facts testified to , by the first named writer on our list , that the Americans are by nature and by practice spies ; - spies on each other and spies on strangers , spies at home and spies abroad , spies in the market-place and spies at church , spies by day and spies by night , spies on the water and spies on land ; and we own , that we have very considerable doubts , whether a foreigner of distinction ' could pass twice through the United States , running the gauntlet through ten millions of Fouch*s , and escape incog . But we have a yet heavier , a more direct and certain charge to bring against him ; a charge against which he or his publishers can have no honorable defence . The two works named at the head of this article were published , the former about six or eight weeks before the latter . They were most plainly written , as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter has filched the whole preface from the former book , and without so much as a solitary thank ye , has made the same sentences and paragraphs occupy the same place in his own book , with an occasional alteration for purer English , and now and then an alteration for greater nonsense . The reader who will take the trouble to compare the passage about monarchists and monarchism in the two versions of the preface , will have a fair example of what we allude to . The original wisely sets forth , that the two existing American parties are the monarchists or the governors , and the republicans who are the governed . But , instead of this , our wiseacre puts the matter thus , " These parties are the monarchists , who would become governors , and time republicans , who would not be governed . " ' What could have induced our sensible and judicious writer to have thus turned plagiarist and ninny at once , we were for some time at a loss to divine but are inclined to think it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the book had no concern . Our traveller 's own preface is neat , and in character . He styles it , advertisement , and as it is short , we transcribe it . The publication of this tour was intended for the year 1327 . Several circumstances have prevented it . The American is , as far as relates to his own country , justly supposed to be prone to exaggeration . English travellers , on the contrary , are apt to underrate Brother Jonathan and his country . The author has twice seen those countries of whose present state he gives a sketch in the // following pages . He is far from claiming for his work any sort of literary merit . Truth and practical observation are his chief points . Whether his opinions and statements are correct , it remains for the reader to judge and experience to confirm . ' This is as it should be , and we are quite confident that the preface following this advertisement , was inserted either without the knowledge , or against the wishes of this sound-headed observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller at the mouth of the Ohio . The nearer we approached the Mississippi , the lower the country became , and the more imposing the scenery . By degrees the river Ohio loses its blue tinge , taking from the mightier stream a milky color , which changes into a muddy white when very near . This junction itself is one of the most magnificent sights . On the left hand the Ohio , half a mile wide , overpowered , as it were , by its mightier rival ; in front the more gigantic Mississippi , one mile and a half broad , rolling down its vast volumes of water with incredible rapidity . Farther on , the high banks of the State of Misscuri , with some farm buildings of a diminutive appearance , owing to the great distance ; in the back ground , the colossal native forests of Missouri ; and lastly , to the south , these two rivers united and turning majestically to the south-west . The deep silence , which reigns in these regions , and which is interrupted only by the rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , produce the illusion , that you are no longer standing on firm ground ; you are fearful lest the earth should give way to the powerful element , which , pressed into so narrow a space , rolls on with irresistible force . I had formerly seen the Falls of Niagara ; but this scene , taken in a proper point of view , is in no respect inferior to that , which they present . ' We are afraid there is more beauty in this as description , than accuracy as to fact . We detect here , what we but seldom meet with in this writer , a disposition to set off his story to good advantage . He generally relates simply and only the truth . In this instance he has certainly taken the liberty to embellish it ; and who will blame an intelligent Englishman , when passing from the beautiful river into the father of waters , for giving way to the associations of the spot ; for yielding up judgment to the guidance of imagination ? Not we . But when we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a mile and a half wide , after the junction of the Ohio with // it , and the latter having been half a mile wide , it is felt by all , who have had opportunity of personal observation , that the Mississippi seems but very little , if any , broader than the Ohio had been for the last hundred miles . What has struck us more forcibly than anything else , in regard to the Mississippi , except its depth , is the apparent unconcern with which it receives the contributions of its mightiest tributaries . It seems as if , instinct with sovereignty , it received the homage of its subjects without deigning to notice them . Yet the Mississippi is , in but few places and those of no great continuance , over a mile wide . We are quite confident that from the mouth of the Ohio to the Balize , its average width is considerably less than a mile . At New Orleans it is six eleveaths of a mile , and yet all the books , and all the travellers , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult it is to judge of distance over water . The Mississippi , at the junction of the Ohio , we should think of about the same width as at New Orleans . The Ohio can not be much narrower , nearly up to the Wabash . Indeed , passing up the Mississippi and ignorant of the route , we should at present be as ready , when both streams are full , to take the Ohio for the principal and the upper Mississippi for the tributary , as the contrary ; just as the first voyagers took the Mississippi for the main , and the Missouri for the tributary branch . We say at present , because the river is now , as the phrase is , making on the illinois side . This new soil or batture is plainly distinguishable from the old bank of the river , by its younger growth of trees , principally cotton-wood , and extends nearly or quite a quarter of a mile , b thus narrowino ' the channel of the Mississippi , and throwing it over upon the Missouri side , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high banks of the state of Missouri . These , we confess , have been a Terra . ilustralis to us as yet . When he passed into the Mississippi , that stream must have been nearly even with its banks , or he could not have spoken of it as he has done , as rolling down its vast volumes of water with incredible rapidity . ' When the river is low , it is exceedingly sluggish and sleepy . But with an imaginative traveller , it often happens that distance lends enchantment to the view . ' The plain truth is , that the country around this spot is low and sunken , and annually overflowed , except here and there a patch , just large enough for a hut and a retreat from the mighty element . The country is so low , and descends so rapidly and so far , that few spots on the Kentucky and Missouri // side remain unflooded . What the writer says of the colossal native forests of Missouri is most true . Their great height and size , and greater nearness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the writer 's visual deception . The solitude and silence , which reign here , strongly impress a meditative mind . But it is recollection , it is association , imagination ; it is history , it is prophecy , that imparts to this spot a thrilling interest for every American . The politician of any , and the philanthropist of every country , must view it with unusual emotions . We have no rememhrances like those which cluster about York Minster . England has no anticipations like those awakened at the junction of the Ohio with the Mississippi . Perhaps we are extending our remarks too far upon this subject , but as it has not been often referred to in our pages , and as the spot in question is one of unequalled interest in its prospective destinies , we trust we shall be excused for thus dwelling upon it . In Autumn the Mississippi is generally full , at the mouth of the Ohio , considerably earlier than the latter stream . This was the case at the time our traveller was there . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that it was usually so . It plainly results that our autumnal rains commence earlier , the farther west you procecd . We have heard it stated that in the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia , and in Ohio , these rains have , of late years , been more backward in making their appearance than formerly . With the actual facts in this latter case we are not acquainted . But if they be , as thus stated , are not the two facts probably explicable on the same ground ? We shall not pursue this subject , for we do not feel quite adequate to it with our present knowledge , but we suggest the fact to scientific botanists and physical inquirers , as possibly affording a new instance , on a great scale , of the effect of clearing and cultivating the earth 's surface on atmospherical phenomena . We return to our traveller who has quitted his keel-boat and landed at Trinity , a town or a something , near the mouth of the Ohio on the Illinois side , consisting , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . This house is so constructed , that , when the waters overflow the bank , as they never fail to do every spring , the inhabitants retreat to the chambers , removing their furniture , and allowing the water to flow through the lower rooms . In the Spring of 1826 , passengers going on // board steam-boats at Trinity were obliged to pass in a skiff , from the windows in the second story of this house . Many such houses are built along the lower part of the Ohio . The solicitude we have observed , when passing down the river and informing the inhabitants that it was rising above , has been a subject of curious and painful interest . We recollect that in one place the mistress of a rickety log hut , that seemed ready to fall of its own accord , pointed out to us the hole in the chamber floor , and the ladder , by which they had made a hasty retreat a few months before . From the ground floor to the chamber floor , the height was about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet below the bank , to within six inches of the chamber floor . This , it may well be believed , was a season of painful suspense to a mother with her family about her , and to the father too , who was at the chamber window with a skiff , ready to receive them if driven from that retreat . At last the watchful eyes of a little boy glistened with new joy . He had for some time insisted that the water did not rise , which the a-frighted parents could hardly believe ; but when he cried out , It is falling , it is falling , ' tears of joy burst from the father 's eyes , rough and fearless as he was ; and in the course of twelve hours more , the family had descended to their residence in safety . These cabins are sometimes fairly anchored with stones ; sometimes a great weight is laid on the roof ; but more frequently the posts are trees , which are preferred , when they can be obtained in suitable places . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His description of these places is , as usual , correct , but contains nothing new . The following remarks show an observant mind , and will be thought not wholly destitute of novelty . There is certainly not any nation that can boast of a greater disposition for travelling than Brother Jonathan ; and there is , again , nobody more at home than he , whether in a tavern or on board a vessel ; as he is in the habit of considering a tavern , a vessel , or a steam-boat , as a kind of public property . Jonathan is right here . Yet on board a steam-boat he is very tractable . The great difference of fare between a cabin and a deck passage from New Orleans to Louisville , being for the former forty dollars , and for the latter eight , contributes to establish a distinction in this assemblage of people , placing those who are found too light in the upper house , and the more weighty in the lower . The first // have to find themselves ; the others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private institutions for the benefit of the public , are certainly more patronized here than in most countries . If the pecuniary resources of the citizen of the United States do not reach a very low ebb , he will certainly choose the cabin , his pride forbidding him to mix with the rabble , though the expense may fall too heavy upon him . That economical refinement which the French evince on these occasions , is not to be seen in America . When I proceeded four months ago in the Duchess of Angoub*me steam-boat from Havre to Ronen , among the hundred passengers who were on board , more than fifty welllooking people were seen unpacking their bundles , and regaling themselves with their contents ,  --  bread , chicken , cutlets , wine , a frugality which will hardly be found to contribute to the improvement of a spirit of enterprise . The Americans would be ashamed of this kind of parsimony , which must ever impede all public undertakings . Owing to this cause , the American steam-boats are in point of elegance superior to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to compete with them . We observe by the Quarterly Review , that the greatest speed to which the English steam-boats have attained , furnished with the best engines of Bolton and Watt , does not exceed nine miles an hour . We are not able to say how rapidly American steam-boats have been propelled through the water , but we are quite sure that they have much exceeded this rate . We have our doubts , as well as the Quarterly Reviewers , as to the asserted fact of sixteen miles per hour . We have either known or been most credibly informed of boats going from fifteen to eighteen miles an hour , but they were , in all such cases , aided by a strong current . We will here state a few facts . The distance from Cincinnati to Louisville is one hundred and fifty miles . The steam-boat .9merica left the former place a few minutes after six P. M. and reached the latter a few minutes before four the next morning , and stopped twice to take in wood . Without excluding the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate exceeding fifteen miles an hour . The river was at this time neither high nor low , but in what the pilots call good boatable condition , running most probably between four and five miles an hour . This was the first trip this boat ever made , her engine was new , and a part only of its power was applied . We speak of this boat in preference to others , simply from personal knowledge , and by no means as being // the swiftest on the Western waters . We have no doubt she might have been driven through still water twelve miles an hour with perfect ease . An intelligent and observant gentleman informed us , that from point to point , by measurement fifty-four miles , the Car of Commerce had run in three hours . He had himself observed the time of starting and of stopping . The captain of the boat could with difficulty be persuaded that he had made such speed , the boat being reputed , though good , not first-rate . The distance from New Orleans to Natchez is three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended against the rapid current from city to city in forty-two hours , nearly eight miles an hour . The precise distance from Louisville to New Orleans we do not know . It is generally computed at fifteen hundred miles . The shortest passage down , which we recollect to have seen noticed , was four days and a half , including stops , of which there are generally two in twenty-four hours , occupying an hour each at least . This will give an average of fifteen miles and nearly one sixth of a mile to an hour . The passage up , we believe , has been made in eight days and thirteen hours . This will give an average of very nearly eight miles an hour ; and uniting the speed up and down , we shall find that these boats must have been propelled through the water , over eleven miles , on an average . The distance from New York to Providence by water is one hundred and ninety-six miles ; from Providence to Boston by land , forty miles . New York papers were lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time occupied by the land carriage , delay at the boat , &amp;c. , could not have been less than six hours , leaving sixteen hours for the steam-boat passage , which will thus average twelve miles and a quarter per hour . In all these cases we have our doubts as to the actual distance these boats would have run , through still water , unaided or unimpeded by *vind . It is well known in the last instance , that the time of tide on leaving New York , and a favoring or opposing wind will vary the passage a number of hours . The passages on the Mississippi would seem to afford a fairer criterion for judgment , and so they do . But they are by no means a perfect test , as all will allow , who are acquainted with the lVlississippi . It may seem paradoxical , but it is true , that the shortest passages from New Orleans to Natchez and Louisville , are made when the current is strongest , that is , when the river is highest . The reason is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for miles occasionally , and also that there is many a cut-oW ' which at this time admits the largest boats , but which , when the river is low , is impassable . All this tends to render us doubtful , what is the actual distance our steam-boats accomplish through the water in a given time . We think the passages between New York and Albany solve this problem , much more satisfactorily than those in any other part of our country . Till the last season , the boats on the Western waters excelled them . We presume they are now on a par . From New York to Albany by land it is , we think , one hundred and fifty-three miles , varying but little from the distance by the river ; call the latter one hundred and fifty miles . This passage was made repeatedly in the summer of 1827 , within twelve hours , both up and down ; and once we believe in eleven hours arid a half , including the delay incident to landing passengers . This will give a speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . We have seen no reason to believe that any steamboat has fairly gone through the water at a rate beyond this . The average hourly run , in the shortest passages between New York and Liverpool , will vary from eight to nine miles , as the distance is computed from three thousand to thirty-five hundred miles . The most experienced captains have informed us , that they have never been able to get out of the best ship ' more than twelve or twelve and a half knots an hour . But we must return to our traveller , whom we left at Natchez . He pays a merited tribute to the intelligent , liberal-minded , and warm-hearted inhabitants of this city and the country adjacent . We refer to this place now , in order to speak of its pest , and the pest of the southern cities too generally , the yellow fever . The results of our observations upon the health of the Valley of the Mississippi are few , and mostly confined to its immediate vicinity . We are struck with one fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we questioned , from the mouth of the Ohio downward , were agreed in this , that the most healthy spots were on the margin of the river , and the most unhealthy , the knolls and elevated hills , whether back or near the river . We shall not attempt to investigate the quo modo , but from repeated inquiries , we think the fact is as stated . We are not aware whether this favors or opposes any medical theory ; and we do not suspect the settlers in Arkansas were much better informed than ourselves . // Our witnesses generally agreed that the country is healthy , subject to few diseases , and those mostly of the bilious kind , slight in degree and of short continuance . We were fully persuaded that the general belief as to their unhealthiness is incorrect . The facts which we could discover , in regard to the prevalence of the yelloxv fever at Natchez were , that , in those seasons when it made its most destructive ravages , there had been a great quantity of rich vegetable loam uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levelling the unevenness of the broken ground on which that city is built . In 1826 , in addition to this cause , another was found in a large cellar full of putrid hams , near which , either in the same house or that adjoining , the fever first made its appearance , and from which it spread with alarming and destructive rapidity . So far as we could discover , there was nothing peculiar in the winds this season , as blowing more or less from the low and marshy parish of Concordia , than usual . The ordinary health of the country only a few miles distant , would seem to show , that the disease had its origin in some local and limited cause . In New Orleans the case stands thus . The most intelligent physicians , who have been longest in practice and most acquainted with the disease , acknowledge that they know nothing about its origin , nor the cause or combination of causes that produces it . As to the degree of heat experienced , or the state of the river , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , these have at different seasons been so combined with contradictory results , as to satisfy intelligent observers , that , whatever may be this cause , it is not to be found here , though these may , in some circumstances , combine with other causes to produce this result . The only fact , on which we could find anything like a general agreement among intelligent observers , was this , that in those seasons when the fever was most destructive , the prevalent winds had been from the north ; and that southern winds prevailing through the summer months and September , had never been attended with the yellow fever . Whether the facts are quite so broad as thus stated , we are not altogether certain , though we incline to that belief . The reader should recollect that southern winds at New Orleans blow from the Gulf of Mexico , and , it would not be strange , if they should carry health on their wings ; and that northern winds come over marshes , swamps , and lagoons , charged , as he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , to the inquiry // why these winds produce this effect at New Orleans , and not on the margin of lake Ponchartrain , or at the plantations five miles above or below the city , no satisfactory answer has as yet been given . It would seem that some other cause must conspire with the direction of the wind to occasion the yellow fever . It is a well known fact at New Orleans , that this disease generally makes its appearance first in the vicinity of the river , on or near the Levee , or on what is there called the Batture . Since 1824 , no yellow fever ( except a few straggling cases of high bilious fever , nearly approaching the black vomit ) has raged in that city . In the preceding winter and spring of that year , a large space between Tchoupitoulas street and the river , was filled up with mud taken from the river when low , and spread over a large surface , and thus exposed to the action of the sun . The succeeding summer was unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter fact we give rather as highly probable , than as perfectly known to us . This season , as usual , witnessed the first cases of the yellow fever in the immediate vicinity of this new-made land . Considering the parallel case at Natchez , we confess that we feel inclined to ascribe more to the influence of this rich earth , thus exposed to the heat of the sun , than to any one or to all other causes . Yet who can answer this question ; Supposing the heat of that summer had been moderate , and the direction of the winds from the south , would the effect have been the same ? Since the year 1824 , very little earth has been laid open anexv , as it was that year ; the heat of 1825 equalled that of the preceding year , and no yellow fever has ( as before observed ) raged since 1824 . Whether these facts , thus combined , afford any light upon this much agitated point , or whether they may serve to direct future investigation , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther , what we have caught from general rumor , that the yellow fever which occurred at Pensacola a few years since , contrary to the expectation of every one , was thought to be owing to the putrefaction of a large mass of salt fish , exposed needlessly and without thought to a burning sun . Neither before nor since has the yellow fever visited Pensacola , the police having learned wisdom by terrible experience . The yellow fever has been unknown in Savannah since the draining of the rice-lands in its immediate vicinity . In regard to the characteristics , the type , and the treatment // of the disease , the most experienced physicians in New Orleans allow there is great variety , and , in regard to the treatment , contrariety ; the disease in different seasons greatly differing from itself ( if self it can be called ) , and even in the same season exhibiting a widely different aspect . From all this we have sometimes been disposed to ask , if there may not have been some logomachy in relation to this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded by the most intelligent physicians in New Orleans , that this fever is infectious but not contagious , that is , the atmosphere of a given space may be so impregnated with noxious effluvia , that the disease is taken by breathing it , but that simple contact with the person diseased will not communicate the fever . If this be so , what more ridiculous than for the city authorities of Natchez to lay a quarantine on steam-boats and passengers from New Orleans ; except a similar regulation by the latter city upon those coming from Havanna and St Domingo ? We believe this latter city has grown wiser within a year or two past , and removed a worse than useless regulation . Facts , general and discriminative , in regard to what goes under the somewhat vague , but appallingly comprehensive term , yellow fever , as it exists at Tampico , Vera Cruz , Alvarado , Havannah , &amp;c. , should be collected and examined with a degree of care , which we suspect , after all that has been written and speculated upon this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add one remark that may startle Boston folks , ' to wit , the unhealthy city of New Orleans , for the last four years , has been much more healthy than the metropolis of New-England . We have , in our remarks , rather anticipated our traveller , reaching the capital of Louisiana and the South before him . His description of New Orleans is more full and more accurate in its details than any we have yet seen from either a foreign or an American hand . His topographical view is accurate ; and his historical sketch of its condition under the Spanish government , the transformation consequent to its becoming American , its rapid growth and probable future extension , his description of its aspect , habits , and character , its mixed but unmingled population , is generally true . But we fear , had his acquaintance been more extensive , his commendations had rather been lessened than increased . His views of its society , as a whole , are , for the most part , correct ; while his character of individuals is as generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , // have a wonderful effect even on fair minds in giving characters to those , who in religion or politics , either differ from ourselves , or agree with us . Second-hand information in regard to personal character is often of little worth . This is a blemish accidental in its nature , and not at all affecting the general merits of the book , or the designed impartiality of its author . But we are obliged to pass over many interesting topics of remark , and hasten to a conclusion . We see by the London Monthly Review , received since the first portion of this article was written , that the author is put with the other anonymous scribbler , who is named first at the head of it . That reviewer , knowing nothing of the subject about which he was writing , and stumbling upon the Austrian's* unlucky stolen preface , very naturally concluded that his veracity was on a par with his honesty . The conclusion is reasonable , but it does not hold in the instance to which we are about to allude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bursting in 1826 , has brought into disrepute the most feasible and profitable propositions , if they be at all out of the ordinary course of business . Our author proposes to the capitalists of England , who wish to invest twenty-five thousand dollars , so as to quadruple it in the shortest time , that they embark in the sugar plantations of Louisiana . His views are thought by the reviewer either selfish or sanguine . We think he has stated rather too highly the usual income of sugar plantations . It is not common for planters to realize fifty thousand dollars from their sugar crops . Yet some do , and a few beyond that sum . General Hampton , we believe , has disposed of his sugars of one year for one hundred thousand dollars . But ten , fifteen , and twenty thousand dollars are the most common incomes . Now as to the expense , it may interest New England readers , and instruct English adventurers in search of a fortune , while it must give a pang to every considerate philanthropist , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money-making probabilities by sugar cultivation . Land suitable for growing the cane can be obtained in abundance for two , three , and four dollars an acre ; and strong working hands , men and women , at an average of four hundred and fifty dollars , together with mechanics at six hundred dollars each . The annual cost of the slaves to their owners , even of those best treated , does not exceed fifty dollars . The usual annual return of profits from the labor of each working // slave , so far as we have been able to learn , varies from two hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty dollars , the probable average is about two hundred and seventy-five dollars . A French planter in Attakapas received for his crop of 1826 , made by seven hands , nearly two thousand five hundred dollars . It is generally held that the molasses made must defray all the expenses of the plantation . As to the fixtures requisite for making sugar , recent experiments have shown conclusively , that impressions , heretofore entertained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent to market very nearly , if not quite , as cheap as cotton . Our author 's opinion is erroneous upon this subject , and this unfavorable error xviii at least balance his other too favorable statements . We believe there are very few Americans , residing in the free states , notwithstanding we are charged by some foreigners with being beyond all other nations desirous of getting money , who would be disposed to adventure twenty-five thousand dollars in this way , even under these alluring prospects , and golden promises . XXThether this reluctance would spring from satisfaction with present possessions , or from an unwillingness to hazard a certainty for an uncertainty , or from the fear of possible failure , or dread of the climate , or aversion to slavery , we shall not attempt to say . Perhaps most of these considerations would operate on New England men to prevent such an enterprise . Twenty-five thousand dollars in New England , is an independent fortune ; it is so even in Boston . In London it is a mere trifle . We doubt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred men could he found in London , to ten in New England , willing to establish themselves on Bayou Teche , with fifty negroes , under a cloud of musquitoes , in swamps that can not be drained , and among alligators innumerable , under a broiling sun , and in a hot-house atmosphere , if they could only be reasonably persuaded that in ten years they could turn their five thousand pounds into fifty thousand . We are not at all anxious to have them go , either on their own account or our own . But , so far as our information extends , we agree with our author , that no part of the British empire presents such a prospect of immense returns for money invested , as Louisiana presents to the cultivator of sugar . This assertion is now still more true since the revision of the tariff of duties . That this is not a visionary opinion , we think // the facts already stated warrant . We have no pleasure in stating these facts , relative to the profits to be drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undying souls like ourselves . Before we quit the topic we would observe , that we dissent from the opinion of our author , who has only retailed the heir-loom opinion , which passes unexamined from father to son , that white men can not bear exposure to the sun in Louisiana , and of course can not cultivate the cane and make sugar . Now this , we happen to know , is untrue . White men , even from northern latitudes , and still more creoles , do bear exposure to the sun ; do also cultivate the cane and make sugar in some parts of the state , though not to a great extent ; enough , however , to show the entire hollowness and fallacy of this assertion . The remarks of our traveller upon the climate of Louisiana are commonplace ; and one of them might lead into error those disposed to emigrate . He represents the plantations as perfectly free from danger to immigrants from colder climates , if they use proper precautions . We now refer to his opinion without having the book at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression , that he had hardly expressed the whole truth . The fact is , however , that the climate is neither so salubrious as old settlers there would persuade you , nor by any means so noxious as is represented and thought at the North . The author states that , on one occasion , the thermometer fell twenty degrees below zero . We need hardly say this is a traveller 's story ; perhaps he mistook twenty degrees below the freezing point . in February 1822 , we think , it stood at fourteen above zero , the lowest degree recollected by the present generation . The cold of this season killed all the orange trees in the state , which are just now beginning to hear again . June is the hottest and most oppressive month . Judge Martin , in the first volume of the History of Louisiana , ' which contains also a history of the French and Spanish colonies from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of St Lawrence , says that one hundred is the highest point ever reached . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood at ninety-five , and on the third , at ninety-six . In the summer of 1825 , which was distinguished for its heat throughout the country , the highest point was ninety-seven . We have never seen evidence of a higher degree of heat . But the atmosphere of New Orleans , with the thermometer at ninety-five , is more oppressive to a northern man , than that of Boston at one hundred . // In concluding our notice of this volume , we will only add , that , after seeing the condemnatory notice of it in the Monthly Review , which has already been quoted in some of our respectable journals , and circulated through the country , we took it up again and read it , both with care and with an increased conviction of its designed impartiality and general correctness . We think it due to a foreigner and a gentleman , no matter whether of distinction or not , to rescue his remarks from undeserved English censure , and American misapprehension . Were his volume republished in this country , it could not fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in regard to the states , bordering on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers , especially of the states so little known of Mississippi and Louisiana , than any other volume with which we are acquainted , if , perhaps , we may not except the Ten Years ' Journeyings in the Valley of the Mississippi . ' Our author is not so good a landscape-painter as Mr Flint , but we think he takes a better profile . Mr Flint wrote from recollection and without book . ' Our author took notes , and has made good use of them . The West , the South , and the North are already under great obligations to Mr Flint . We hope he will increase them still more , and that a liberal public will not suffer one of the most enlightened of its citizens to go unrewarded . We intended to give an extract from the book entitled The United States as they are . ' But it is needless . Its character may be given in two words , vile trash . The hook entitled The Americans as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle involved in its concluding sentence , with which we will close this article .
