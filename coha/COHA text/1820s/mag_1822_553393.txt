txt AI*T . VIII. -. - Julia S6v&amp;a , ou l'sln quatre cent quatre vingt Souze . Par J. C. L. Simonde de Sismoncli. 3 vols. l2mo . Paris 1822 . IN the course of some remarks in a former number on Mr Hope 's Anastasius , we could not help dwelling a moment on the change , which has taken place in the department of novel writing . We repeated the names of some of the most distinguished writers , English and continental , of the last genera* tion , who had exercised their talents in this way ; till novels and romances had become the vehicles of the finest efforts of the understanding. - As far as the strict novel form is concerned , this may be considered an innovation of the present day ; a new course struck *out by the ever active invention or changeful caprice in mane But the operation of that general principle , whereby we seek to make grave truths attractive , by the form in which they are delivered , may be traced hack to the oldest periods of written literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Plato strove to secure for their moral and metaphysical discussions all that interest , which the names of some of the most distinguished personages in grecian and Roman history , or of their most celebrated eontemporaries // could add to the philosophical dialogues carried on in their names . Xenophon gave his political theory the clothing of a gorgeous oriental romance ; and if we judge from the internal character rather than the outward form , the Iliad itself is a primitive Waverly novel , and if there is any faith in German lore , its authorship is as great a secret as that , which is so admirably kept at the present day . It would not be easy to say , to which of the prominent nations of modern Europe the palm should be assigned , in this species of composition . Some of the very first geniuses of all of them have cultivated it ; and if the Waverly novels upon the whole be accounted the most wonderful for the united considerations of their great number , rapid succession , wonderful excellence and concealed origin , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wieland are names able to sustain almost any competition , and that Foscolo 's single effort has appeared in London in the fifteenth edition . It is not without some feeling of national pride , that we are able to add , among the names of the most popular writers of the age , that of our own countryman , the ingenious Mr Crayon , who has also consecrated his delicate taste and happy fancy to a kindred department of fine writing . In the work before us , M. Sismondi has entered the same field ; but we doubt whether his appearance there will add to his own reputation or that of his country in this branch of literature . It has been supposed that the illustrious unknown in England , with a modesty as noble as his genius , at first concealed his name through fear for the reception of his work . And we do now most distinctly remember that many nice judges , whose opinion of a work is much prompted by a knowledge of the author , who have a sort of intuition at finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can tell at a glance that ingenious writers produce curious books , were extremely in doubt when Waverley appeared , whether the thing would do . ' We are not sure that M. Sismondi would not have done well to imitate the reserve , even if he had no occasion to feel the diffidence of the great author , with whom he ventures in some degree to compare himself . Few writers of the present day can boast a more extensive popularity than M. Sismondi . And if the number of his works of historical research , make it necessary to give him the name of compiler , it can not be denied that he stands highest on that // list , and needed but to have written less to have been ranked with the classical historians . We are even aware that we can not expect to carry all our readers along with us in denying him a place among the latter ; and our brethren of the Edin*. burgh Review have bestowed on his history of France such encomiums , as show , whether just or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation at stake . Had he concealed his authorship in this new department , till he had ascertained his success , he would , we think , have better consulted the interests of this reputation . In order lo justify this opinion , we beg leave to offer our readers an extract from the preface , as a guide to M. Sismondi 's views in the composition of this work . While , ' says he , in a work of a more serious cast ; * I have attempted to exhibit more clearly , than has yet been done , the connexion of public events , the great historical characters , the victories and the disasters , the exalted virtues and the crimes of the French people and kings , I was desirous at each grand revolution , to be able to exhibit to my readers the common life in an imaginary sketch , and in fabulous personages ; under the guidance always of historical researches , and in scrupulous conformity , as to opinions , and national characters , with contemporary writers . The work then , ' continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended to paint the condition of Gaul , at the period of the invasion of Clovis . It is the fruit of the researches and labors , which I had devoted to the composition of the first volumes of my Thstory of the French . The historian is obliged , in some degree , to live in the age which he proposes to describe , while the effort necessary to this is scarcely expected of the novelist . Had I had no other design than to write this novel , I certainly should not have read three times in succession Gregory of 7roui*s , nor grown pale over all the Chronicles , and all the codes of law , and all the lives of the saints of this period . The mottoes , which I have attached to each chapter in imitation of the author of those admirable Scottish novels , which I wish mine resembled more , are all drawn from contemporary authors ; they are designed to show how nearly the scenes , which I have presented to the imagination , approach to the realities of that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Franrais , of which the first portion appeared last year , in three volumes , containing the history of France from the fourth to the tenth century , under the Merovingians and CarIovin* gians-The work is to he continued in portions of from two to thr. * vol. unics. // NI . Sismondi also informs us , in his preface , that the principal personages and incidents of the tale are imaginary . With regard to the general character of this work , it ap* pears to us that what merit it possesses is that of an antiquarian essay , and not of a novel . In other words , NI . Sismondi appears to us wholly to have failed in solving the problem , which was involved in the composition of such a work ; namely , to write an interesting novel , of which the scene should be laid in the age of Clovis . We are not disposed to question the accuracy , with which he has painted the manners of the age , nor the fidelity with which he has derived his materials from monkish chronicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has been able , in consequence of these studies , to draw some instructive sketches of the manners and opinions of the age . But here his success stops . The story is of ordinary merit , and sinks , for the greater part of it , to the common machinery of the works of the Minerva press . There is in the composition of the work , if we mistake not , a visible difference between the former and latter portion . The first is far more antiquarian and learned , and the author probably felt , as he proceeded , that it was getting to be a laborious and uninteresting essay . He accordingly plunged into the opposite extreme , and conjured up at once the whole apparatus of ruined castles , subterraneous passages , spring doors , sliding pannels , robbers , and convents . Had this thing come by study , he mi6ht have learned of the admirable Scottish novels , ' that antiquarian lore and romantic adventure could not thus , by mechanical admixture , be made to balance each other , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the learning impart its gravity to the romance in another ; but that by a wonderful chemistry , of which that author alone seems fully to posses the secret , they should be amalgamated , and a strong human interest of character and incident he breathed into the manners of ages past . What , if possible , renders NI . Sismondi 's course more fatiguing to the imagination is the downright honesty , with which he informs us in the title of each chapter , of the point in antiquity , which forms the topic of the Essay , an error not unlike that of our most excellent countryman , whom we are too pleased to keep i*aming , who has inserted in the index of his Bracebridge , some more titles than there are subjects to the chapters . NI . Si , mondi , too , has plainly mistaken the object of the mottoes of // the Scottish and other British novels , if he supposes it to be that , at which he has aimed in his own . In the Scottish novels , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers contemporary with the action of the story . When they are not inserted only as a part of the artificial form of this species of composition , the design of them we presume merely to be , after affording a faint indication of the business of the chapter , to amuse the reader 's mind with a beautiful quotation , applied in a sense different from that in which it was composed , and ( as it has been held by an ingenious American writer ) , as a quotation always always ought to be , in an acceptationyarce de*orta . An amusing essay will we doubt not one day be written , on the mottoes of the author of Waverley ; and some future Alexandrian of England or America will , as likely as not , attempt to publish in an uniform edition the fragments-quotquot supersunt-of the Old Play . ' Meantime M. Sismondi appears to have taken that name too literally ' in garnishing his chapters with long quotations from monkish chronicles and lives of the saints . It is , however , time to proceed from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story as , with a translated specimen , will enable our readers to estimate its merit . Julia Severa is the only daughter of Julius Severus , count ef Chartres , a titular Roman senator and wealthy lord in Gaul , at the close of the fifth century . While her father had left his home at Chartres to repair to the court ef Clovis at Soissons , to negotiate a treaty with that barbarous monarch , the chief of one of the tribes of Francs , another tribe of the same nation , falls upon Chartres , and Julia Severa is compelled , with the rest of the inhabitants , to fly before them . Their flight is arrested by the Loire , and the gathering band of fugitives is there perceived on the opposite bank by Sylvia Numantia and Felix , her s a , noble and wealthy proprietors of Noviliacum , a rural villa between the Loire and Cher . Felix , prompted by humanity , but ignorant of the cause of the assembly on the opposite bank , crosses the river to the relief of the fugitives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterestedness succeeds in transporting the whole company in his boats across the river , at the moment when the advance of the barbarians had well nigh overtaken them . Julia Severa immediately attracts the notice of Sylvia Numantia and her son , is lodged with becoming attendance at the castle of Noviliacum , // July , and a few pages afford the reader , expert in affairs of the heart , sufficient indication that Felix and Julia are the hero and heroine of the piece , and of course destined to marry each other . To bring about this happy event is the author 's design at the end of the third volume : the delays thrown in its way are to make up the business of the tale . The first obstacle arises from the circumstance that Julius Severus , while negotiating for the confederate cities of Gaul a treaty of peace at the court of Clovis , conceives the design of bringing about an union between that young , ambitious , and insinuating bar. * barous prince and his own daughter Julia Severa . It sufficiently comported with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful Gaulish family , while means enough would offer themselves , at any future time , to disembarrass himself of the connexion , should it prove onerous ; the law of divorce , to the great scandal of the jurisprudence of the Franks , having been as lax in the days of Clovis , as in those of the empress Josephine . Julius Severus , having acquired the confidence of Clovis , soon succeeds in awakening the desire of this barbarous prince to espouse his daughter . Felix , meantime , in the manner we have mentioned , becomes attached to her , she is equally sensible of the merits of the young Roman lord , and their hearts are pledged to each other . For the sake of entering into some capitulation for the protection of the country between the Loire and the Cher , Felix also repairs to the court of Clovis at Soissons , and there becomes acquainted with the projected union of his mistress and the king of the Franks . This is the first distress in the plot ; and as it opposes to the desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of a barbarous conqueror , the book might seem in danger of drawing to a speedy close . It happens , however , that Julius Severus , though openly a convert to the not yet universally established belief of christianity , is secretly devoted to the ancient gods of Rome , a fact suspected by the neighboring christian priesthood . Anticipating injury to christianity , should Clovis , the barbarous conqueror , ally himself with the daughter of a worshipper of the ancient gods of Rome , the archbishop of Rheims and the bishop of Tours exert themselves to prevent the union of Julia Severa and Clovis , and this measure of ecclesiastical policy forms a considerable portion of the business of the work , and is conducted as follows . Julius Severus , having concluded with Clovis a treaty of marriage // with his daughter , sends a matron to conduct her from her place of refuge at Noviliacum to the court of Clovis at Soissons . Felix , who , as we have said , was also on business of state at Soissons , in despair at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noviliacum , to enjoy one last interview with his mistress , or if possible concert means for their escape and union with each other . They appoint a meeting at Hesodunum , a ruined and desolate city on the banks of the Loire , built by the Celis , and amply furnished with secret passages and subterraneous communications , once contrived for defence , but now made use of as the covert of the numerous hordes of banditti , with which the distracted country is infested . Toward the close of a happy day passed together , Felix and Julia are descending from the citadel of the ruined tower to the river side , by means of one of these subterraneous passages , preceded at a short distance by Sylvia Numantia , who has the matronly discretion to allow the lovers to talk over their matters , without the embarrassment of a witness . On arriving at the outlet of the passage , followed as she thought at a short distance by Felix and Julia , the matron looks round and beholds , with bewildered feelings , that a massy door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all further egress . She sends her slaves to the other extremity , and finds it closed in like manner . No art or skill suffices to open these heavy portals thus mysteriously closed , and she is left to the distressing conclusion , that the party had been waylaid by a band of robbers , and her son and Sylvia surprized in the passage . A day or two is passed in forcing and exploring the vaults ; and when they are at last penetrated , Julia and Felix are nowhere to be found . They had , in reality , not been waylaid by robbers , but by the emissaries of Volusianus , bishop of Tours , who , to prevent the union of Julia and Clovis , adjudged it the most effectual step to shut them both up privately in the walls of a convent at Tours . Here the story halts a little , since it does not appear why it was necessary to confine Felix , whose liberty and marriage with Julia would have promoted the policy of the priesthood , as effectually and less violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both by stealth transported , under the guidance of father Andre , , As we consider the entrance into the convent as one of the best chapters of the work , we shall extract nearly the whole of it : // They arrived at last at Tours , about the break of day . There was as yet no movement in the streets . The heavy gates of St Martin opened to them . They entered , and it was not till then that the hoods were removed from their faces , their arms untied , and the bandage removed from their mouths . Felix and Julia perceived themselves to be in a square court , surrounded on three sides by very lofty buildings , and closed on the fourth by a wall as high as the highest of the edifice . Opposite the wall could be recognized the side of a cathedral church , and on either side a house , which , by its grated and narrow windows and thick walls , were known to be convents . The one was the convent of the nuns of St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clothaire 1 . rebuilt and richly endowed a century after ; the other , where monks of different order and costume relieved each other , in the uninterrupted chanting of psalms in the cathedral , was the celebrated convent of St Martin of Tours , the most famous , the most strict in its observances , and the richest in Gaul . At the moment that Felix and Julia recovered the use of their eyes , they measured at a glance these high walls , which dampness had blackened , these narrow windows , by which so little light was admitted into the cells of the unhappy inmates , these grates , these bolts which seemed so many precautions taken in advance against the repentance of those , who had voluntarily condemned themselves to eternal captivity-against their efforts to escape , this silence , this stillness in a place where so many living beings were confined , even the grass and the moss which covered the pavement of the court and showed how little it was traversed . All these objects produced a profound impression of sadness on the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other to recal the promises of mutual fidelity , which they had made the preceding evening ; but Felix perceived the tears , which glittered in the eyes of Julia , and felt that the power of the will might be weak , in opposition to the power of monkish despotism , to which they were now subjected . * ie * " he fa*ther , who conducted them , knocked at the door of the convent , crying out to the porter , " a penitent son and daughter , by order of the most holy bishop Volusianus . " The lovers pressed each other 's hands , while they bid adieu ; they entered the two convents , and heard the heavy portals and bolts close behind them . The porter , who had introduced Felix into the convent of the men , conducted him , without speaking a word , into a long hall , which appeared to be the refectory of the monks , and there left him alone . Felix , on seeing him depart , recalled him to ask him some questions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await the orders of the abbot , left him , wi ' hout deigning farther reply . After about two hours , twenty monk* entered the hail two and two ; their eyes were cast down , their hands joined on their breasts , and they repeated a prayer . Felix approached several of them , to ask them what he ought to do himself , or what he was to expect . Every one repulsed him with a motion of ira . patience , indicating that he did not wish to be interrupted . The prayer at length being finished , the monk at the head of the file deigned to notice his presence , and said , " Art thou Felix Florentius ? " " The same . " " Sit down . " At thr* same time all the monks sat down to table , with the exception of one , who ascended a sort of pulpit , and began to read the gospel . Several lay brothers entered , wit a md of religious gravity , bringing dishes in their hands . The table was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being prepared with care . Every monk , and Felix also , had his portion by itself ; the bread , the wine , and the dishes in equal amount . It seemed as if care had been taken that th' monks should never have to ask of each other those little offices , which guests render each other at table , and never be in danger of losing each his due share by the voracity of another . For the rest , the portion assigned each was abundant enough to satisfy the most inordinate appetite . Felix witnessed , however , its rapid disappearance from the plates of each of his neighbors , while he scarcely touched his own . The reading went on , but the monks , much occupied with their meal , gave little a*en tion to it . Their eyes were fixed exclusively on their plates . No lookof affection , intelligence , or complaisance was exchanged between them . Condemned to pass their lives together , they were as entirely strangers to each other , as if they had never met . They were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief had mentioned aloud the name of Felix Florentius , all eyes turned mechanically toward him , without , however , dwelling upon him , or even again returning to survey him . His appearance in the assembly had not occasioned a question , or led even to a whisper between any two present . Felix nevertheless thought , that , in alluding himself to his singular adventures , he might awaken their ( lorinant curiosity , and bring on a communication with his new hosts , " When I was borne off , " cried he , " last night , in the caverns of Hesodunum " " Tush ! " cried the monk , whom he addressed , pointing to the reader , but to whom he had not before paid the least attention . Felix thought , however , that he had at least said enough to awaken the curiosity of his neighbor , and that , after the reading should be interrupted , the monk himself would resume the conversation . The repast , however , being done , the reader took his place at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had addressed , // joining his hands before him and twirling his thumbs around each other , remained silent , without so much is turning his head toward Felix . The latter , after having observed him for some moments , cast his eyes upon the others , and found them all in the same attitude of repose . Out of patience , he raised his voice and demanded of the dean himself what they intended to do with him . " Tush ! " replied the monk , pointing to his brethren , " do not disturb their holy meditations . " Felix was silent . These meditations lasted half an hour , and Felix observing the eyes clOse ( 1 , and the sonorous respiration of the monks , and of the dean himself , felt himself authorized to conclude , that what was called holy meditation in a convent , bore another name in the language of the world . At length a clock struck . The monks aroused themselves , and with a voice half asleep began to chant an anthem , as they rose from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the refectory , in the order in which they entered . The dean then turning to Felix said , " follow us to the quire . " Felix followed them . As he advanced , he found himself placed between two files of monks , who chanted with a loud voice . They traversed the interior corridors , which connected the convent with the cathedral , into which they entered behind the high altar . Another band of monks had been chanting three hours in the church . The latter did not wear the same dress , nor were they subject to the same rule , though they lived in the same convent . They left the seats where they were bestowed , to make way for the new corners , without however ceasing their psalTnody ; and they left the church in procession still singing . Felix now found himself in the same church , in which but a few weeks before he had seen Volusianus , when he held with this prelate a conference , in which the latter had seemed to yield him entire confidence . Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities of Gaul , with an honorable mission . He had just returned from executing it . He had not yet even had time to render an account of it to his constituents , and he found himself now a captive , a penitent , a monk , or he knew not what , in the quire of this same cathedral , from which to all appearance he was not to be permitted to withdraw himself . On the spot where he had entered he felt himself a prisoner , though in the sight of the public . He was in the inner row of seats against the wall . On the left and on the right , and in the row of benches before him , there were monks that surrounded him and almost hid him from the sight of the devout in the church . Besides , the latter , separated from the quire by a high screen , were sufficiently remote from Felix . Notwithstanding this , he determined , should Volusianus appear , to demand justice of him , in a loud voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose // the moment , when the church should be crowded with devotees , to proclaim his name , complain of a shameful violence , and demand his liberty . Nevertheless he soon judged that this last step would be a desperate measure , and that he ought not to hasten to have recourse to it , when he heard the dean saying to the beadles , ushers , and monks , " The most holy bishop orders , that if the penitent disturb our sacred functions , or make any attempt to escape , he be immediately confined in the dungeon under the tower . " Reply was made to this order by an inclination in token of obe .. dience . Notwithstanding this threat , which he was made distinctly to hear , Felix calculated , that if he could defend himself a few moments against the monks , the tumult he should raise in the church would procure him protectors . But he was restrained by the consideration , that in this way it would be publicly known where he and Julia were to be found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detain the latter , should Clovis demand her . He accordingly thought it more adviseable himself to submit to a captivity , which could not long endure . For the rest , the opportunity of making an effort to recover his liberty did not present itself . Neither Volusianus , nor any of the ci ergy whom Felix in a former visit to the cathedral had seen in his train , made their appearance . it was the hour when the inhabitants of Tours , hiving begun the day 's work , scarcely came to the church . He only saw some old women at prayer at the foot of different altars , or at a distance the pilgrims crawling on their knees about the tomb of St Martin , and from time to time the horrid forms of the murderers and robbers , who had found an asylum in the temple . The latter seemed to look with astonishment and envy on the riches that surrounded them , without daring to raise their hands to commit a sacrilege , which they supposed would be punished with instant death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony greatly seconded the effect of the fatigue of Felix , who from the time he left Soissons had taken no repose , who had travelled on horseback to the banks of the Loire , and who had felt little inclination to sleep while so near to Julia , or in the ruins of Hesodunum , or in the boat in which they had been carried away captive , in spite of his uncertainty , his strange recollections , and the fears not less strange which filled his imagination , his heavy eyes closed from time to time in the church . This the beadles failed not to observe , and the moment they saw him dropping asleep , touched him with their wands , and this painful struggle lasted for the three hours during which the chant of the monks continued . It seemed to him as if he had neither waked nor slept , and that ho had remained in a long reverie . // At length he heard , at a distance , the approach of another band of monks , who advanced chanting in the same order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remarked that between the files of those who arrived , was led a penitent , clothed in a frock like that which had been thrown upon his own shoulders at Hesodunum , and which he had been forced ever since to wear . This penitent was not a monk , he did not chant , he seemed to move forward with reluctance , and to resist the monks who conducted him . All at once he raised his voice and cried , " rescue me , citizens of Tours ; deliver me from a shameful violence . " But his voice was drowned in that of the monks , who began to chant or rather to yell the psalms , with all their might , at the same time that they overpowered with blows the unfortunate person , who resisted them . A stunning music from the orchestra aided in completely drowning his voice , while the good women on their knees in the temple crying out , " a demoniac , a demoniac , a demoniac ! " dropped their eyes , and redoubled the fervor of their prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was altogether unknown to him , arose quickly , as if to run to his aid . But the monks at his side seized his arms and obliged him to resume his seat . The demoniac also submitted to superior strength , and the new quire of chanters took the place of the preceding . The latter left the church , chanting as it had entered , and Felix marching in the midst of them , found himself again in the corridors of the convent . Here the procession separated , and each monk departed for his . cell . The dean pointing to Felix an open door , said to him , " Behold your cell , be ready at noon for the exercises . " " What exercises , " cried Felix , astonished ; " what further do you demand of me ? " " That you chant in the quire , or at least attend the chanting , in the morning from eight o'clock till eleven , in the evening from four o'clock till seven , and in the night from twelve o'clock only till two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at eight o'clock . " " What object can you have in thus tormenting me ? I am not a monk ; I have no design to become one . By ahat right- " " It is the order of the house . All the unhappy persons in your condition are equally obliged to submit to it . " " In my condition , say you , what then is my condition ? " " Perhaps if I tell it you , I shall but cause the unclean spirit to descend upon you . Address yourself rather to God , and be submissive . " " No , tell me what is my condition . " " Since you will have it then , you are a demoniac . " " Strange infatuation . I , Felix Florentius , a demoniac ? I , whom your bishop charged to represent himself before Clovis , and who am just returned from an embassy , on which I protected the rights of the church ? " // " Yes , you , Felix Florentius , who last night , with sacrilegious hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this execrable crime abandoned yourself to the powers of hell . You , Felix Florentius , who descended those caverns to render a service to unclean spirits , who there met with a familiar of Lucifer , presented to your eyes under the image of a woman , who were so completely enslaved by her seductions as to sacrifice your immortal soul to her , who were immediately seized by devils and plunged into a dreary guiph , made the prey of I know not how many illusions , who were hurried rapidly towards the infernal abyss , when a holy man of this convent , who was in prayer before the tomb of the glorious St Martin , had knowledge of your danger , and delivered you miraculously by his prayers , in reward , perhaps , of the services you had just rendered the church . The devils were thus compelled to deposit you this morning at the door of our convent . You see , Felix Florentius , I know your history. * ) " How is it thus you dare relate a scandalous arrest ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur is but as the grass when it is withered , or the dust which is borne on the wind . Here you are but a man , and while the impure spirit retains his dominion over you , you are less than a man Here we dare speak the truth ; we shall dare , if need be , subject you to the rule of the house More than once we have employed force to compel demoniacs to assist in the sacred offices ; but at the end of a few weeks , the unclean spirit always yields to our efforts , the paroxysms become less frequent , the intervals of repose , like that which you enjoy at present , more protracted , and he whom we were obliged to bind to drag him to the church , comes at last to repair to it with pleasure . " " Is it possible that so grave a person should not doubt the reality of facts so strange ? You relate them without testifying the least astonishment . " " A servant of St Martin soon ceases to be astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here more accustomed to miracles than to natural events . When we see every day the sick returning to health and the dead reviving to life ; when we see the sacrilegious struck at the foot of the altar , dying on the spot as if blasted by lighting , floating in blood or groveling in foam , for having lifted a profane hand toward what was consecrated to St Martin , we have no room for wonder at adventures so ordinary as yours " " And these adventures , so common , are they known to the whole convent ? " asked Felix . " Doubtless , " said the deai , " yet you have witnessed that they excited neither astonishment nor curiosity among our brethren . " Such is , with the exception of a few sentences at the begin* ing and close , one of the best chapters in M. Sismondi 's Julia // Severa , and we doubt not our readers will agree with us that it sustains but an indifferent comparison with the great model that involuntarily suggests itself , and which M. Sismondi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story , we add , that father Andrf* , under whose care Felix and Julia had been conducted from Hesodunum to Tours , aroused from his lethargy of implicit obedience and faith , by the enormity of the transaction , betrays to Julius Severus the place where his daughter and Felix are confined . Julius Severus immediately repairs to Clovis at Soissons to demand his interference . Clovis , already engaged in a new treaty of marriage with Clotilde , daughter of the king of Visigoths , discovers great indifference to the appeal of Julius ; but Theuderic , one of his attendant princes , with a band of hardy Franks , engages with zeal in the cause . They march to Tours and procure the release of Felix , but Julia 's presence in the convent is steadily denied by the bishop , and when search is made by Julius and Sylvia Numantia , the mother of Julia , who by permission of this crafty prelate explored the convent , she is no where to be found . The reader of course anticipates , that she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not till she had experienced treatment at once artful and cruel , to entrap her into an avowal of paganism , or a resolution to take the veil . She resists both , and is conveyed to another retreat , where after various adventures , in the common style of romance , which we have not time to relate , both on her part and that of Felix , she is happily discovered by the latter . Such is a very brief analysis of the story , the least valuable part we know of a novel of this class . To avoid the charge of injustice in the present case , we have been induced to make an extract of nearly a whole chapter , hoping that the fame of the author , and the little probability there is that his work will find a translator , will be our excuse for so doing . We are unable , in this or any other part of the work , to discover even the di**ecta membra of a genius gifted for this department . In many passages , Julia Severa has strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a whole , to be quite inferior . This inferiority is especially apparent in those passages which best admit of comparison . And the reader has but to contrast the incantations of Pona in Valerius , with the inspi .. rations of Lamia , the priestess of Bacchus , to feel the weakness // of M. Sismondi 's pencil , compared with that of the anonymous author of the fine work in question . The philosopher Eudoxus is a Xerophrastus , but of far less choice absurdity . The fine topic of the conflict between christianity and paganism , is turned to little advantage by M. Sismondi ; though the blind veneration professed by Clovis for religion of any and every kind , is well conceived and in true barba .. nan character . In recalling to recollection the personages introduced , we can not fix upon one striking character . Since the merit of the work , as a romance , is so inconsiderable , it needs scarce be added that , as an antiquarian essay , it is rather injured , than profited by the novel form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite opposite branches of literature , that in the combination the essential features of either are sacrificed .
