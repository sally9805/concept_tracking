Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp Oft seen by charnel vaults and sepulchres , Lingering and sitting by a new made grave .  --  Milton . CHARACTERS . Euneric . Hugostern . Demetrius .

Cocytto End note 1 : 2Kb Whither do they tarry ? The night comes on Troubled and dark ; with gloomy mists she veils The mountain tops , and hastes , with giant strides . To fling her mantle o'er the earth .  --  Whither do they tarry ? The hour hath come when we should meet in wild Unearthly scenes , impenetrable to the dull Cold eye of mortal vision , and seal The secret destinies of men .  --  Whither do they tarry ? Mounted upon the hollow sightless blast , Or horsed upon the sweeping storm of clouds . With tempest , war , famine , and desolation In their wither 'd hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mighted nations ; Or , on the whirlwind 's wing , sweeping the dark And measureless waters of the deep , they snatch The toiling mariner from his last hold of life , And whelm him in a grave , whose welterings Hurtle forth his requiem , in wild confusion Mingling earth , and air , and heaven . FIRST SPIRIT , First Spirit ( entering . ) Gay is the crowd within thy walls , A thousand harps their descants ring : The eye of beauty gems thy halls , And fortune lights thee with her wing . Oh ! little think ye of the cloud , That lowers o'er thy fated head ; Soon will it wrap thee like the shroud That hangs around the mould'ring dead . SECOND SPIRIT . Second Spirit The web is wove  --  thy thread is spun  --  And thou shalt fall e'er set of sun ; Thy lamp is out  --  thy time is past  --  And the next hour shall be thy last : The howling storms thy death cries swell And thunder spirits ring thy knell , Thy smiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye thy race is run . THIRD SPIRIT . Third Spirit I gather 'd a blast from the chamber of death ; On the bick'ring flash of the lightning I rode ; From the lips of the plague I sought but a breath ; And o'er thy fall'n ruins in triumph I strode . Midst the roar of the thunder , I mock 'd at thy ruin  --  When thy walls burst asunder , And death 's work was doing  --  With the beak of the vulture I drank thy hearts ' blood : And o'er thy dead corses in triumph I strode . Cocytto , Spirits . COCYTTO . Cocytto And ye are come  --  Whither have ye loiter 'd ? E'en since the sun dropt his last light Upon the water 's bosom , and sought his couch Within the crimson chambers of the west , Here have I kept my lonely vigil . FIRST SPIRIT . First Spirit I stood amid the ruins of Palmyra ; Around me lay the splendors of the great Of elder time . The dying beams of day Shone on the broken arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics Of man 's pride , lay crumbling ' neath my feet : fallen  --  Desolate  --  like thy fortunes , mighty city . The pale ivy in its sickly loveliness Clung around the rich mausoleum , like A dying infant on the marbled breast Of its dead mother . The foul night bird within The proudest tower of the citadel Had housed herself , and her shrill music came On the arms of the wind , like the long lost Melody of forgotten joys ; but tinged With a saddening melancholy , as though Some spirit that had revell 'd , in its former Day of grandeur , had strove to wake the stillness Of the tomb , with the wild wailings Of a funeral hymn . The thistle , the wild brier , And the foetid weed , choked the lone court-yards ; The halls , where once a thousand vassals fed , The lacqueys of some high chieftain 's luxury , Were cold and uninhabited , save where The slippery adder had coiled himself Amid the canker 'd stones , mocking the desolation . There was a chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; where no voice Sounded , save what told in wizard strains Of harmony ; where foot tired , with falling Upon down , and the eye dazzl 'd , with gazing On the glories of the golden-threaded hangings : The gorgeous palace of some fair eye 'd beauty ! But now ' t is roofless  --  and for the bright canopy That decked its golden ceilings  --  The measureless concave of the heavens Spreads its broad blue bosom . And for its music  --  oh , it hath music too , The savage laugh of the wild hyena , And the long scream of the famish 'd eagle As he swoops o'er it . And where those sumptuous couches once Ministered unto their idle luxury : The venomous spider hath wove his web ; And the shaggy lion hath made his lair . I stood , and looked , And smiled , to think that all the mightiest works Of men must come to this . SECOND SPIRIT . Second Spirit A white and shadowy cloud , hung beneath The surface of the sun ; I floated on it O'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I planted , blossoming in ripeness : My breath had bid foul rancour creep , with adder 'd Coil , around the tendrils of men 's hearts , Blasting each goodlier feeling , and turning To bitter seated gall , the love that they Should bear each other . My voice had bid The finer powers of the noble mind sink Into baseness , and crouch e'en like some starveling Cur , beneath the iron trample of a lord , Were he but trick 'd out in gold and imagery . Joy !  --  joy !  --  I saw men pull at each other 's Heart-strings , and think it pastime ; yea ! they did tread In the broad blaze of day with unwiped daggers In their girdles . The cloud sail 'd onward ! There lay stretched out the ruins of a city Newly sacked ; the red gore still smoked upon The pavement , the sad cry of infants , shrieking For their cold , dead parents , were yet unhushed ; I cast mine eyes , where a pale bride lay wrapp 'd In the clotted shroud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuptial feast !  --  the song and dance Went merrily on  --  the smile of hearts , that shone From dark blue eyes , was gay as the first sunlight Of a summer 's morning ; but now ' t was gone ! And that bright hall , that echo 'd to the beat Of fairy music , sent up a sheeted cloud Of smoke , that mocked in sadness , the silvery Garments of the air ; and where rich viands Had deck 'd the tables of voluptuous Appetite , there lay a banquet , but it was Of mangled corses , on which the vultures whet Their wild voracious beaks . I gazed ! a ruffian Tore from its mother 's grasp , her little one ; Her cries were shrill and piercing , as the robb 'd Bird at evening , and might have melted A soul that had one touch of nature in it ; But I mark 'd the smile that quiver 'd on his lip , Even as the lightning beam , that glares , Precursor of the storm ; he seized it , shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated on ! THIRD SPIRIT . Third Spirit I kept my watch o'er the dying couch of one , That did serve me faithfully ; a man of blood ! One who ne'er hugged a drop of gentle pity To his breast , until the choke of death Did parch his throat , and fill his veins with fire : Then , then , I woke the spectre fiends to worry On his chords of being , and called the buried Ghosts of those his hand had slain , to burst The cerements of the grave , and throng around , With beamless eyes , the place where he did lay , And peal with bloodless lips dark hymns of triumph . I heard the feeble rattle in his voice  --  I saw the white foam hang upon his lips  --  The clammy death dew beaded on his brow , Like the cold rain drops on a penthouse ; he raised His shrivelled hand in agony to heaven  --  It trembled like the withered leaves of autumn : A mist did float before his sunken eyeballs . And blind like dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , then to hear the lengthen 'd Howl , that burst from him in horror ; for , with full And perfect vision , he beheld the unclaspt Portals of eternity , where uncouth shapes Did startle forth , to catch his passing soul  --  He died . COCYTTO . Cocytto I too have not been idle ; Deep in the vale there dwells a dark brow 'd man . With yet a darker heart : a peasant he ! And fashion 'd out in such a rude unshapely Manner , that he doth seem a blot upon fair Nature 's face ; so ill finished and deform 'd , That his fellow boors do make a jest o n't . Yet is this being teized with an appetite Of power , love and pleasure beyond his state , Whose fortunes are shrunk and crooked as himself : And withal endued with such deep riches o'th ' mind , Intensity of thought , and strong wrought feeling , That e'en our hidden mysteries have not Escaped his piercing ken  --  his precious knowledge Ranks him high , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed in an unseemly Casket  --  him have I watch 'd . FIRST SPIRIT . First Spirit And is he such , and doth he live ? What eye Of clay dares pry into our mystic works , Or ape our secret doings , and not die ? COCYTTO . Cocytto Nay ! I have mark 'd him a fit instrument , To wield the avenging thunders of our wrath ; For he is one whose every gentler stream Is turn 'd to venomous poison , and whose Every thought , breathes daggers for his fellow : For the bright flowers of his young hopes , That once did bud in glowing loveliness , Have wither 'd in the sunless glance of cold Neglect , and changed unto the bare and Shrunken shrubs that decorate a blasted heath ; Let 's send him forth into the bustling world , New formed in some airy mould of angel richness , Whose etherial beauty shall outparagon The fairest sight the earth hath ever gazed on . SECOND SPIRIT . Second Spirit But we will turn his heart to marble , That , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his savage maw with the deep groans , And tears of blood , that man shall shed . THIRD SPIRIT . Third Spirit Let it be so ! The Spell . FIRST SPIRIT . First Spirit In the hidden caves of sadness , Where is seen of life no form  --  Where is heard no harp of gladness , Where sighs and tears are ever warm  --  Where the spirits shriek in horror , Where the deadly nightshade 's growing , Where the lone heart nought can borrow , To quench the tear forever flowing : Charms I 'll seek out spell to weave Man 's heart to tear  --  man 's heart to grieve : Hope 's tree I 'll deck with fruitlings fair  --  Which touch 'd brings frenzy and despair . SECOND SPIRIT . Second Spirit Where the storm rides fierce and dreary , Where the thunders never weary , Where the whirlwind 's ever blowing , Where the hurricano 's growing , Where the earthquake 's ever shaking , Where the lightning 's ever waking , Where the clouds are always forming , Where there never beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wing  --  And from the cavern 's deepest breath , I 'll seek a charm man 's bosom to wring  --  Fraught with sighs and woven by death . THIRD SPIRIT . Third Spirit Where the sweltering toad doth hide , Where the brindled cat doth bide  --  Where the lizard makes his nest , Where the fenny snake hath rest  --  Where the owlet holds his court , Where the forked adders sport  --  Where the wolf doth make his wail , Where the dragon drops his scale  --  There will I , Quickly fly  --  And e'er night , Has ta'en her flight , From their noxious breaths a charm I 'll blow ; That shall work for man both weal and woe ! COCYTTO and the THREE . Cocytto , Three Spirits Weave the woof , and weave the spell . Come ye hags of earth and hell  --  Wind the thread and raise the charm . Hither come for good or harm  --  All ye spirits of the earth !

Odofriede This deep intensity of feeling , by some , Is thought to madden men , but with me ' T is recreation ; oh ! could I , but shake off This badge of frail mortality , and mounting , Like some airy spirit , to the great cupola Of the clouds : peep thro ' the starry eyes of heav'n . And pierce with unslaked vision , e'en to The chrystal portals of the vast eterne . For when I look to earth . And scan the rude mishapen form , that Envious fortune hath allotted me ; which like A prison-house doth case , and clog the pure Mind 's immortal essence , that else its flight Celestial , would have ta'en , unto the daylight Realms of honor and of fame ; and see Wealth , love , beauty and health , in sick profusion Fall upon the wanton earth ; yet shun this Scathed and blighted weed , whose life of sickness Misery only tends , and with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expels not the disease  --  I could burst this melancholy bondage Of my weariness , and seek me out A kennel shadow 'd from all eyes , Then lay me down in the stern pride of Wretchedness , and doglike die . ' Sdeath ! I can not look upon the noontide curtains Of the blue serene , by the divinity 's own Fingers pencilled there , nor breathe the coolings Of the summer breeze , that travels with light foot The mountain 's top , least every reptile peasant . That doth cross my path , should hoot derision At me . Oh , there 's no pang doth strike upon The soul , so deep as when the rude tongue doth wag Its biting scorn , in jeer of our deformity : It doth burst in flow of gall upon the Breaking heart , sapping its young shoots of Kindness , and turning its green fields of hope , Unto a barren , fruitless wilderness : Oh , it doth crack the fibres of the brain , Wrenching its thoughts from the right course of nature : Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . ) And I have seen the holiday and silken Gallants of the hour , glide in pleasure 's gay And glittering barge , adown the dull course Of life , like insects sporting in the sunbeam , Untouch 'd by the pealing thunderbolt , and Unharmed by the red blazon of the lightning , Reckless of the coming storm , while I in vain Have tugged , to gain e'en the shadow of a joy , And strove to shake off the iron chords , that Bind me to my destiny . ( the owl hoots without . ) Hail , bird of darkness ! Sole companion of my solitary fate ! That like me doth shun the garish light of day  --  No other voice doth wake the stillness of my home , And when I gaze upon the pale moon 's Watery eye , thy song alone salutes me : No foot doth cross the threshold of my door  --  The dock and nettle grow before my gate  --  And thro ' my unsashed windows , the low music Of the wind peals mournfully . Chill neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness ; No mother 's kiss e'er brushed the dew of love From off my infant lip ; no father 's arms Did shield me from the wintry blast of sorrow , Or bid my young heart thrive ; there was none to clasp My hand in friendship , or echo back The throbs affection kindled in my breast ; For I was born an outcast ! At the extremity of the hovel a mist arises and a voice Voice is heard to sing the following : Where the red coral 's growing , In the ocean 's blue deeps  --  Where the sea flower 's blowing , And the pale mermaid sleeps ; There spirits are weaving A garland of charms  --  To sooth thy soul grieving , And shield thee from harms . ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Hark ! what sound is this ? it steals upon mine ear In sweetness , as though some wandering angel Of the night , had struck his golden harp , and bid Its spheral tones awake the silken echoes Of the air . It can not be ! sure ! ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast ; no sounds like these are wont to cheer the Melancholy of my house , or fall like Drops of balm upon my bruised heart ;  --  once ! Once alone ! such rial music stole Upon my senses , but ' t was in the fond Dotage of a coz'ning dream ;  --  too sure ! too sure My eyes grow dim  --  my sight doth thicken , As if old age had wrapped his mantle O'er my brow , and deaden 'd every pulse ; A mist doth hang before me , and the cold blood Doth curdle in my veins , and lay like ice Upon my strings of life :  --  my hair doth straiten On my head , like bristling pikes that deck An armed battle . The mist slowly forms , and Cocytto appears . Ha ! What horrid form Doth glare upon me , to sear mine eyeballs ? In sooth , my brain is crazed , and thou some phantasy That madness builds ;  --  I 'll gaze no more . ( covers his eyes . ) COCYTTO . Cocytto Odofriede ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what voice is that ?  --  it called me From the grave where I had taken rest ; and Thou canst speak too ;  --  oh God ! What art thou ? That doth come to blast me in a shape so Terrible ?  --  see , see the writhing snakes that deck Thy brow like locks of hair ; oh , they do hiss Perdition at me , and now thy glazed eyes , Their beams sepulchral in fixed hollowness . Do turn upon me  --  and that dark mantle That like a burial garb encloses thee , What new terrors doth it hide : yea ! those lips If lips they can be call 'd , if aught can bear A human name , that is not so , do move , And give unto mine ear a sound like The low muttering of a charnel-house . COCYTTO . Cocytto Child of clay ! deep and sad have been thy woes , Thou man of many sorrows ! the hour hath come , Which the fond vision of thy hopes so long Hath looked for , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be quenched , and thick clouds That curled around thy natal star , and dimm 'd Its shiv'ring brightness , shall melt away , like The last dew that gems the morning flower .

Oh , I have look 'd long for thee ; I 've gaz 'd Whole tedious days and nights , and when I bared My scath 'd breast , unto the forked torches Of the storm , it was in the hope that thou Wouldst come : when the odour breathing gales of Summer fann 'd with light wings my burning brow , I watched to hear a voice like thine ; yea ! when The winds of winter froze my uncover 'd Body , and the tempest fiends rav 'd along The heath , I stretched mine ear to catch thy footsteps .

Cocytto Mortal , thy days have been number 'd in sadness . That heaven , that doth send its golden shafts of Lighted fortune , enriching others of thy race , Hath veil 'd its bright blazonry , and look 'd on thee With eye of dark and withering malice . Unhappy one ! and wilt thou then , an outcast , Wreck 'd upon the breast of hope , still cling with Mad idolatry unto that heaven , which Doth frown upon thee ;  --  End note 2 : 2Kb unto that God who Hath abandoned thee .

Yet men 's eyes , that so late upon my pale Evanid fortunes , gazed with cold and Lustreless intelligence , now seek the Tricks and changes of my countenance , with Oraisons of breathless reverence , and In all the lowliness of adoration , As if it were a bright burst of vision That had drank the meteor light of fate , And wore the cherub smiling form of some Fine creature o ' th ' elements .

My soul is languishing for blood , and I Will work in death , and cleave with either hand Whole billows of blood , whose red and welt'ring Tides toss and heave beside me  --  oh I will run Fearless as the summer wave , until my eyes Grow hot and blistered with doating on My triumphs .

And then those fairy locks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of envious Moonlight , make thee seem one of those pure and Hallow 'd visions , revealed to dying blessedness . Go , view these  --  then tell me that I flatter . ANDRASTE . Andraste Yet beauty , my lord , ne'er should covet praise . It is a gem frail and perishing  --  bright and Transient as the web of the gossamer , When by the morning dew impearl 'd , and in The morning sunbeam quivering  --  nor does it Merit love , save when by the veil encircled , That purity 's white hand hath woven for it . ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede ( not heeding her . ) Oh ! what soul of man could mark thy Graceful step , that glides with all the speechless Eloquence of motion , and view those twinkling feet , That like some light-winged angel scarcely brush The delicate hues from off the flowers , where nature 's Hand bath painted them , and not adore thee ! Oh , Andraste ! thy presence , like a gleam of paradise , O'er creation comes , cleansing the air of pestilence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bow to thee , Andraste ! for thou art a thing To knee and worship ANDRASTE . Andraste Oh talk not thus ! It is not meet that you should speak , or I Should listen to such words . To believe thee Would be a crime against all love and honour . You know my faith is to the young Demetrius pledg 'd  --  Why will you then pursue me ? Odofriede . Odofriede Because I love thee ! Fiercely  --  madly love thee . Who can restrain The soul 's strong current , and bid the swelling Flood of passion sink ? Who can lock the burning Throb that desolates the heart , within that heart , Nor give one sign of outward sorrow ? Who Can quench the wild volcano of the soul , Where drops no tear of hope nor sigh of pity On its flame ? Who would wear away a life Of deep , impassion 'd agony , whose mental throes Drive the hot brain to desperation , and Not give vent , e'en to a breath , to ease that Anguish , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e'er loved like me !  --  for I do love thee , As man hath never loved . ANDRASTE . Andraste Nay , my lord ; I must not  --  ought not  --  will not hear thee ! ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Oh ! had I known thee E'er thy troth was to another plighted ; E'er another 's lip had claimed thy spousal kiss : E'er another 's voice Love 's breathings whisper 'd In thine ear ; or e'er the fatal vow was pledg 'd , That waits but for a holier sanction to bind Thee his forever , and wreck my hopes on the lone And rugged crag of desolate despair :  --  But what avails all these , didst thou but love ? There have been those , e'er now , who lightly rent The bonds of faith that knit their hearts in Closest unison , nor deem 'd it sacrilege . Friends ! rarest friends have sunder 'd and forsook Each other . Yea ! parted wives have coldly met Their lords , long lost in perilous absence , And reck 'd not of it ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tear of pity , To ease the luxury of anguish , that floods My brain with blistering fire . Thou art not wedded yet  --  quite wedded yet  --  Oh pause awhile , e'er the last dread seal , never To be recalled with life , that dooms thee to Another 's arms , and me to ransomless Perdition , is put unto my destiny . ANDRASTE . Andraste I dare not hear thee longer . Farewell ! ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede And wilt thou go , and leave thy blighting scorn To dry the fountains of my heart , and turn The kindness of my desperate passion To the dark and bitter throb of utter agony ? And wilt thou go , and leave me here , to burn Away with no companion but Despair ; No earthly thing to cling to me but wretchedness ; No beam of parting light to fall upon This withered heart , robb 'd of all brighter fancies , And peopled with the dark images of Desolation ?  --  and wilt thou go ? To-morrow 's morn will deck thy bridal couch ; To-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze shall swell thy bridal hymn ; All reckless that the self-same blast doth bear The hollow echoings of my funeral knell ; While my pale , sheeted corse within the stark And populous homes of death shall lie , nor Hear the gay beating of thy step , as down The church 's aisle thou glidest , the bridal smile Still sitting on thy cheek . ANDRASTE . Andraste I dare not leave him thus  --  For I do fear these wild and unrestrained Energies of passion , whose utterance Betokeneth such stern tendency .  --  I can not go !  --  the arm of some unknown , Mysterious agency is on me , and Doth hold me back . Prithee be calm , my lord ; Time will have power  --  ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Yes , time will have power To change the raven plumage of my hair , Unto the whiteness of the feathery spray , That crowns the storm-swept billow : Yea ! time will have power to freeze the joyous Current of the blood , that paints the cheek with Crimson , and change it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plough deeper Still the furrows of the brow that hopeless love Has planted there . Aye , time will have power to wear Away the liquid lustre of the eye In wail and woe , and the stern faith of weeping Banishment , until their glazed bails , fixed In the dull stare of ghastly hollowness , Move heavily in their leaden sockets , Like the dim glare of lamps that burn in sepulchres . Yea ! time hath power to change all these .  --  But can it cure the lacerated heart  --  From the breast pluck out the deep disease that Rankles there , or quench the burning throb of high Devotion , that intense passion in the pulse Hath kindled ? No  --  no  --  no ! Instead of pouring Balm upon the beating wound , time doth but Barb it deeper and deeper , until the brain , O'ercharged with sorrow bursts , and sleeps the Dark sleep that dreams awake not . Oh , Andraste ! Thou canst not be so cruel . There is a gentle Spirit in thy look , that can not doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop Doth float all silently , pure as the last Pale tear that gems the paler cheek of dying Infancy . Oh , thou dost surely pity me , And pity is akin to love . ANDRASTE . Andraste I know not What to do ! strange feelings come rushing o'er me ; A subtle flame is creeping , through my veins , Whose luscious poison thrills through every nerve , And riots in my blood : the memory of that Which I do owe Demetrius should call me hence , Did not some spell of syren potency Withhold me . ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Oh , Andraste ! many a time I 've gazed upon that angel face , where nature Sits in throned beauty , until my soul Dissolved in love , and o'er my ravished eyes Thy features swam , in rapid , indistinct Career , like the bright image of scattered Thought , and present things did seem like those of Yesterday . Minstrels have swept their rich toned Lyres , and , in all the wild enchantment of Their breathing numbers , sang of love , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their golden chords ; but , oh ! The wildest witchery of song  --  the flights Of brighter poesy  --  all were vain , the rapture Of this soul to paint , when one kind smile of thine Hath shed its softer glories there . And wilt Thou then , Andraste  --  canst thou the last sad Boon of passionate love refuse ?  --  one smile ! One little smile !  --  a star from Hope 's high heaven . Fall'n , the desert wilderness to light , Where I do stand alone , with thoughts of many That I love , but none to love me . Thou weepest !  --  Oh , blessed drops ! Would I might kiss them off  --  I ask not much , Andraste ; one cold kiss  --  And I will bear it to my grave  --  one kiss  --  The sweetest , saddest , and I will not chide thee If thou leavest me . ANDRASTE . Andraste I can not speak to him ; And though I should , I can not leave him , For with a witching eye the serpent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I still Linger round my ruin . ODOFRIEDE Odofriede There is a troubled light Upon thy face , and o'er thy varying cheek The rose and lily ever and anon Come fitfully  --  Thou lovest me , and yet I dare not think it . Thou tremblest , and beside Me standest thus palely too  --  thy shaking limbs Do scarce support thee  --  lean on me , love ! May I not hold thee to this throbbing breast ? May I not press thee to this beating heart ? May I not feel thy tears upon my cheek ?  --  ( They soon may dew my grave . ) May I not clasp Thee in these outstretched arms  --  one kind embrace  --  And it may be our last  --  one silent , kind Embrace  --  and we will make it worth whole years Of speaking love . ( she falls in his arms . ) Andraste , Odofriede , Demetrius . DEMETRIUS . Demetrius Ha ! ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Now thou art mine  --  mine  --  DEMETRIUS .

Demetrius That voice  --  my name , too  --  when shall I go mad ? Ha ! have I caught ye , vipers ? ANDRASTE , Andraste ( shrieking . ) Demetrius ! DEMETRIUS . Demetrius Aye , Demetrius !  --  dost know me , beautiful wickedness ? ( Will my heart break ? ) Mildews and cankers light Upon you , false one  --  curses and the livid Plague strike every limb  --  from the hot bosom Of the sun shoot blights and blistering flames , And scorch up all your beauty  --  contagion And the breath of foul disease infect you To the death .

I had no other joy but thee ; on earth No other joy ; no hope but what clung like The ivy to thee , and they are dead  --  dead  --  Would I were so ! ANDRASTE .

My wits are almost gone  --  almost  --  almost Not quite  --  no  --  no  --  no !  --  not quite  --  ha , ha , ha ! ODOFRIEDE . Odofriede Count Demetrius , this is but delirium .

I have heard mysterious sayings , And dark imagining o ' him  --  legends That to list would change the quick and healthful Currents of the hearer 's blood unto The frozen tears that deck the ice-bound rock 's Wintry visage. 1st Servant . 1st Servant What ! then thou believest The dark story of the multitude ?

HUGOSTERN . Hugostern But doth not the noblest and the fairest , In breathless tendance round him throng ?

Yet , hath not this man been as a mildew To all his worshippers ?  --  coming not in th ' storm , But in the inmost core lurking , to eat The heart away . Who hath dealt with him , That hath not mourn 'd it ? Where hath his eye Lit , that it hath not blasted ? Where hath his word Come , that sorrow follow 'd not ?

HUGOSTERN . Hugostern Yes ! Remember me , a narrative told from The hinds , that in the neighbouring forest 's Tangled thickets dwell , a dwarfish boor , A melancholy man within a ruined cot , Hovell 'd himself , by his fellows shunn 'd , Who held in mockery the rudeness of His creation . Neglect soon planted Its weeds before the door that moody Passion closed , and credulous wonder 's thirst Drank down most giddy things . At length , by Persecutions tired , he left his cheerless Hearth , for the wolf to make his litter , And his undeck 'd walls for ruin and Decay to lead their ivy , and wander 'd No man knew whither . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peasant would sooner face the horrors Of the battling elements , than bide There in the dead stillness of the midnight . But the illumin 'd festal and the luxurious Banquet quitting at the dead hour , when All , but the eye of revelry is closed , This Odofriede , t is said , doth take a lonely And untended journey , and a long vigil Keeps , within that bleak and darksome place , No mortal eye hath on his doings pry 'd ; No mortal step hath broke the charnel rest That shrouds his watchings ; no voice of life , Or breathing thing hath stole upon his loneliness , ' Cept from the owl , as he sits hooting on The crumbling wall , that gives a dismal echo To his cry , or as by dreary fits The gaunt ban dog howls to the broad round moon Whose brightness swells his frenzy .

I was happy once The high blood stray 'd joyous through my veins , In all the magic of youth 's lightness . And visions ( Oh what blessed ones they were ) Of brilliant hues and colorings , danced blithely O'er my path ; pleasure 's young and lambent fires . In every fibre play 'd with exquisite Harmony , and my heart , unmov 'd to Any touch of sorrow , revell 'd in all The opulence of love ; but now it throbs Heavily  --  heavily  --  swinging to and fro ' Like the deep tolling of a muffled bell .

Did she not upon the altar of eternal Faith pledge the first throbbings of her young heart 's Virgin tenderness , and swear that heart was mine ?

She was happy , and her life glided on Sorrowless , hour after hour , as a summer eve , And she wist not of it ;  --  star after star roll 'd Circling round and round the heaven of her fate In excellent glory  --  at last came one , Brighter than the rest , before whose exquisite Lustre the other orbs all did bow and sink , As ' t were in adoration , till it did plough The bright and trackless course alone , all nature Worshipping its splendour  --  that star ( oh ! need I tell its name ? ) was Love ! Yea ! she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as holy As the faith of dying martyrs , and as pure As the sparkling cluster of transparent Gems the starlight gilds upon a summer Ocean , that seem the cheerful eyes of the Young sea nymphs , peeping smilingly from forth A silvery veil of waters  --  and he , The brave and noble youth that held the true Devotion of her young affections , returned That feeling of the heart 's sincerity , With all the burning faith and plighted truth , And the high throbbings of unearthly love .

Thus they sat ( his arm had stole about her waist ) And listened to the pensive song o ' th ' love lorn Nightingale , that perch 'd upon a slender Bough above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the warblings of departed spirits . Oh ! in that hour they were blithe and happy As the living orbs , that sing forever As they shine  --  and they did talk of love , and Tenderness , and faith , eternal constancy , And blissful times to come , and wove gay garlands For futurity , until the very wave That rippled at their feet , lit by the young And broken branches of the pale moonbeam , Murmured in echoing tones of love . Then thus they sat , the ponderous canopy Right o'er them , and the many eyes of Starlight deities looking down unto Their vows of passionate solemnity , ( The impress of diviner thought that wore , And brighter , and empyreal purity , Just tinctured with the frailty of human feeling ) Twinkling and listening  --  aye ! on that very night They were betrothed one to the other .

Then did he pour his poison In that lady 's ear  --  aye ! deadly , venomous Poison , like that with which the star bright apostate , The ruin 'd leader of the lost angelic host  --  The arch revolter of the skyey rebels  --  When as the world began , in Eden 's bowers The first of womankind beguiled .

Then came that evil one , and buzz 'd into His brain a tale  --  ( the last hope of the shipwreck 'd Wretch destroying ) a tale of rankest poison ,  --  Damn 'd and detestable  --  how she who was once Pure as the sea nymph from her coral bed Unto the surface of the water rising , The fresh drops still clinging to her beauty , Was black and begrimm 'd as the dark Afric 's Sable locks , and spotted as the vile leper 's Rotten skin , and frailer than the changing wind .

Arthur I am a farmer , sir . Mr. B. Mr Barlow Very well ! Farming is the chief thing we have to depend upon .

We can not do without either of you . But do you understand shoeing horses ? Delville . Delville I hope you will find me not only skilful in this business , but merciful too . I do not curse and swear and beat with my hammer the faithful horse , when , if annoyed by flies , or pricked by a nail , he happens to cringe or start . Nor do I fit the shoe by burning away the hoof ; this detestable practice so generally followed by ignorant blacksmiths saves them some trouble in using the butteris , for the hot shoe , by heating , softens the hoof and renders it more easily pared .

Mr Barlow Though we may live in log houses at first , we shall want brick work , or stone work , for chimmeys , hearths , and ovens , so there will be employment for a mason . Can you make bricks , and burn lime ? E. Edward I will try what I can do , sir . Mr. B. Mr Barlow No man can do more . I engage you . Who is next ? Francis . Francis I am a shoemaker . Mr. B.
