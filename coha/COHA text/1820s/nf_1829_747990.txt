txt In the third number of the new series of your Work , dated July , 1829 , 1 have met with a piece , on the General Board of Education , and the American Education Society , deeply interested my feelings . Whoever the writer of that piecfe may be , I take the liberty to tender him my most sincere and hearty thaiik* fot tbe very valuable considerations which he has suggested , at the ' c ( 5jnpt / mencement of his strictures , respecting the present aspect of the moral ' : and religious world , and the duties and obligations of Christians which result from it . I do most entirely concur with all his remarks , respecting the past failure of the churches to perform their duty in regard to spreading the knowledge of the gospel abroad : and in regard to their error in seeking , at any time , to sustain themselves by leaning on the arm of civil power . For one , I rejoice that God has taught them so instructive lessons on this subject ; for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , that they will not again seek for help from a quarter which will never afford it ; and which , if at any time it condescends to put on the appearance of affording it , exacts more as a return for its favours , than conscience can allow , or the interests of religion permit without injury . The picture of the religious wants of our country ; the call for pastoral labours , made from thousands of places that are destitute of the word of life ; the interest which Christians are taking in this subject , the importance of immediately furnishing our new settlements with faithful , spiritual guides ; the necessity of having these well instructed and disciplined for their great work ; and the imperious duty of all Christians , who are praying the Lord of the harvest to send forth more laborers , to be active in furnishing all the means of training up such laborers ; are drawn , described , and urged in a manner which satisfies the most ardent feelings and wishes of my heart . I fully concur with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the manner in which our spiritual wants are to be supplied . It is true , that our first duty is , to raise our humble and earnest cries to the great Lord of the harvest , that he would multiply the number of laborers ; and equally true , that the Christian church is under the highest obligations , while she prays for this , to do all in her power to promote it , by taking pious and indigent youth under her care , and providing for their education in an adequate mapner. // With the writer I do also sympathize most entirely , on the subject of beneficed livings in the church . If a graceless ministry is to be raised up ; if the church is to be thronged with aspirants after her fa  - -  vours , whose hearts are rankling with enmity at the strictness of her principles , and filled to overflowing with insatiable desires after worldly and sensual pleasures ; then let her provide livings which will afford the means of ease and luxury . She will thus hold up a premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying these ; and will never fail to have at least as many ifainisters , as she has benefices to bestow upon them . - - ' : qwq  --  in choosing the ministry for a profession . There is scarcely a salary in this country , at least among the Presbyterian and Congregational churches , which could be the object of ambition to any man of a worldly spirit , and of talents above mediocrity . It would give me much pleasure , if I could proceed through the whole piece , on which I have commenced making remarks , and find nothing which I could not sincerely commend , and with which I do not fully agree . But when the writer comes to make his remarks on the principles and proceedings of the American Education Society , T am constrained to difier fi-om him here , and cherish views materially diverse from those which he has disclosed . I take it for granted , that a man , of such an able mind and excellent spirit as is developed in that part of the piece on which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberty which he has himself taken , in the free remarks which he has made on the principles and proceedings of the American Education Society . He will cheerfully grant me the privilege of examining the facts and principles which he has brought forward , by way of supporting his objections to the Society in question ; first , because he himself wishes only to come at a correct view of the whole ground , and to know what can be said in its defence , as well as against it ; and secondly , because the public , who have now had one side of the question placed before them , are entitled to know what answer the friends of the American Education Society have to make to the allegations thus produced against their measures . I enter with much reluctance on this task . It is always unpleasant to entertain , or to express differences of opinion , when these dif ferences have respect to men for whom we cherish a high and Christian regard . It is an unwelcome task , also , to come before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians shrink instinctively from every thing which looks like dispute . The world are /z/ /q/ Tery ready to speak with exultation , on what they are pleased to call the quarrels of the church . Distrust , unkind feeling , alienation , coldness , or suspicion , are very apt to creep in , while the professed disciples of Christ are engaged in discussion , ( not to say dispute ) ; and especially is this the case , when discussion grows animated , and the cause stands committed before the world . On all these accounts , I advance to the task before me with undissembled reluctance ; fearing , lest the declaration of opposing sentiments , or the correction of mistaken facts , may possibly be understood by some as an exhibition of feelings which are unfriendly , or as a manifestation of party spirit , which , reckless of truth or union , or peace , seeks to defend its own views at all adventures . I cast myself , therefore , after these remarks , on the generosity of the writer in question , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while I endeavour strictly and faithfully to examine the allegations made respecting the American Education Society , they will not do me the injustice to believe , that I have any personal motives in view , or am seeking the interests of any supposed party in that quarter of the country to which I belong . I am , indeed , a friend of the American Education Society ; and I have been so from its very rise . But it is not because I have been in any way connected with it , or have ever received , or expect to receive , any direct benefit from it , nor am I in any way responsible for its measures . It is true , that having lived near the centre of the Society 's operations , and having an intimate acquaintance with all who are actually concerned in the immediate and principal management of its interests , I have been , from the very first , acquainted with its principles , measures , and proceedings . From a sincere approbation of these , I can subscribe most heartily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their proceedings makes p. 354 , and which I beg permission here to quote . " We admit there is something very magnanimous and captivating in the idea of s great societv , laying aside sectarian names , collecting and disbursing funds in Mucatingpious indigent young men for the gospel ministry , regardless tf sect or party , we admit the energy and success of the American Education Society , that it has done more in exploring the spiritual wants of our country , in enlightening public sentiment on this subject , in pressing home on the conscienees of Christians , the indispensable duty of enging heart and hand in this mighty work , than has been done by all others . With unqualified pleasure , we admit also , that the concerns of this Society are managed by men in whose intelligence , piety , and energy , we have the highest confidence . " Agreeing most fully with this writer ; in his views of those to whom the management of the American Education Society is entrusted ; and cherishing these views , after having for a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the remainder ever since they have come upon the stage of action ; I acknowledge that it is not without some degree of pain and reluctance , that I perceive the measures they have taken are virtually called in question , and our country is warned against the dangers to which they are thought to be exposing it . /z/ But it becomes their friends , and therefore myself anumg thttB , to examine the charges preferred against their princijdes and with impartiality ; and to listen to every sober and friendly sug gestion which may be made by any , who are disposed to call in tion the wisdom or the correctness of their measures . I have endeavoured to do this . The result I beg leave to communicate in the following order ; viz. I. I shall examine iie facts alleged , in regard to the measures and principles of the American Education Society . II . I shall make some remarks on the fears which are expressed with respect to it . And , III . I shall briefly consider the method which the Reviewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts alleged by the Reviewer , I shall proceed in the order in which he has presented them . It is my design to leave no material circumstance out of view ; for on a question of so great importance as the present , the public are entitled to information minute and circumstantial enough to lead them fully to make up their opinion . The first allegation of the Reviewer is , that ** the details of expenses and receipts , of clothing , of books , of donations from other societies and friends , of profits of teaching and labour , of debts contracted and paid , which young men under the patronage of the Society are required to make , every quarter , are unnecessarily and painfully minute , " p. 356 . The grounds of his chief objection are , ' ' that the plan holds out a powerful temptation to the beneficiary , to conceal the amount of receipts and expenses , so as to form a stronger claim on the aid of the Society , " and that ' ' it places him in the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolefulness of his story . " ' Young men of delicate and ingenuous feelings , " it is averred , * ' shrink from this public developement of private and personal circumstances , " p. 356 . On this subject , I would remark , that the details required of beneficiaries in Academies and Colleges , and which are in some respects more minute than those required of Theological Students , may be summed up in general , under the following heads , viz. stage of study ; number of weeks engaged in study during the quarter ; price of board , with its amount ; tuition ; expenses for washing , room , fuel , lights ; also for books and stationary ; incidental expenses ; debts at the beginning of the quarter , exclusive of those due to the American Education Society ; receipts from the- Society during the quarter ; receipts from any other source , either of money , or of clothes or books ; the number of weeks in which the beneficiary has been engaged in teaching school during the quarter , with the receipts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; together with a general summary at the close , of the whole debts due , exclusive of those to the American Education Society . The applicant subscribes , also , a declaration of his intention to devote his life to the ministry of the Gospel , and he asserts that he solicits patronage for this end . Printed schedules of all the items are furnished for the use of the /z/ /q/ beneficiary , who makes his returns under each head This is handed by him to the Principal of the academy or College with which he is connected , who eaiamines it as minutely as he pleases ; and then certifies the correctness of it . In addition to this , he certifies that the beneficiary in question sustains , in all respects , such a character as is required by the Constitution and Rules of the American Education Society in order to receive their aid . This is forwarded every quarter , to the Directors of the Society ; and on this is predicated their vote in relation to the aid that is sought for . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , it is forwarded only once in WL months . Such are the facts , in relation to the details in question . Let me now , make some remarks on these facts , and examine the pnr tendency of them . ( 1 ) It is obvious , that as the Society is called upon to %id those mfto sioMd in need of aid , and as it was instituted solely for this purpose , so it can , with fidelity to its trust , bestow aid only on such as affinrd adequate and saHsfactary evidence of such need . But how is this evidence to be obtained 1 The answer is , By a knowledge of the character and entire pecuniary circumstances of the individuals wlio apply fi ) r aid . If they are themselves indigent , but have fi'iends able to assist them , and liberal enough to do it ; if they are able to obtain money enough to help themselves , by any personaJ efforts which they can make at labour or otherwise , consistently with honesty and integrity of character ; then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , if they are in debt ; if they have no friends of the character described ; if they fiiil in the means of aiding themselves in an adequate manner ; then it is plain , that they need the aid of the Society . If moreover they are prodigal , or excessive in their expenses for clothing , in the purchase of books , in their incidental expenses , or in their room-rents , or any thing of the like nature ; it is the proper business of the Society to know this . It is impossible to know whether they are the deserving subjects of aid , unless all these facts are examined . I would a &k; the Reviewer to point out a single article in the Schedule of the student 's returns , which is not concerned with an estimate either of his pecuniary condition , or of his ckartuter . If this can not be done , ( and I venture to say , it can not ) , then does it follow , of course , that the Society have only taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trust oblige them to take . There is not a single item here , which any honest and ingenuous youth should ever be ashamed or afraid to disclose . That he is poor , it is no ground of reproach . I had almost said , it is the contrary . That the whole extent of his indigence should be known to those who are to aid him , is a matter of as plain equity and propriety , as that a man who borrows money of his friend , should not conceal from him his true pecuniary condition . The most open , honest , and ingenuous proceeding , in all such cases , is to keep nothing back which can throw any light on the real circumstances of the case . The Reviewer thinks that the Committees of examination , or the /z/ teachers under whose inspection the youth are , could judge of these matters with sufficient accuracy . But without attempting to show that the same amount of information never could be obtained in this manner with uniformity and correctness ; it may be asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made responsible for the distribution of funds , to know and judge for themselves , as far as they may , whether those whom they aid are in real need of assistance 1 Upon the present plan , both Instructers and Directors are supplied with the means of forming an qinion on this subject ; dispense with it , and there is no certainty that either will be regularly and thoroughly made acquainted with the facts upon which such an opinion should rest . ( 2 . ) Returns of such a nature as those in question , are of serious benefit to the individuals concerned . Need it be proved anew to the world , that the virtues of industry , frugality , regularity of life , and caution as to unnecessary and injudicious expenses , are best taught in a practical way ? What can all the preaching in the world do , at Colleges , Academies , or any where else , while young men and boys have their pockets filled with money which is at their own disposal ? The most weighty and well enforced precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such cases . Every instructer in any Seminuy of learning in our country , I will confirm this statement . I What then is to be done ? What measures will effectually teach young men to enter on life , with firugality , with industry , with a judicious and uniform foresight in regard to all their pecuniary responsibilities and embarrassments ? I answer . Let them set out , from the very first , as soon as they are able to take care of themselves , with a responsibility for doing so ; and with a responsibility , too , which will amount to something ; which will be felt in all their measures , and will have a controlling influence over them so as to make them guarded and sober . The responsibility to parents of most young men educated in public , for the manner in which they spfend money and time , is but little felt , and is , in roost cases , made so light , as to afford no serious obstacle in the way of their extravagance and profusion . A frown or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety ; a murmur at the unexpected amount of them , and a kind of half serious , half joking complaint of extravagance , constitutes the weight of the penalty on the part of parents , which most youth have actudly to suffer for extravagance and idleness ; and the responsibility to a tribunal which inflicts only such a punishment , is but little dreaded , and has therefore but little influence on such as are disposed to be extravagant . How different the condition of a youth , whose character , whose prospects , whose success , whose all , depends on the strictness of his discipline , and the rigid watch which he keeps over all his powers and passions of body and mind ! I appeal to facts . From what class of youth do our most shining characters in church and state spring ? From the children of the rich or the poor ? Almost exclusively from the latter . Debauchees , and profligates , and blockheads abound among the ; AMERICAN EDUCATION SOCIETIT. the children of the rich ; while among the poor in our Seminaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been intimately connected with the instruction of youth for more than thirty years ; and I have very often been led to believe , that the greatest misfortune which can befal a youth , endowed by nature with promising talents , is , that his parents should , be rich . The failure , in some respect or other , as to the requisite strictness of discipline in such a case , is almost certain , in a great majority of instances . But the beneficiary of the American Education Society has a powerful stimulus acting constantly upon him , and operating to produce habits of sobriety , and frugality , and industry ; habits on which depend , in a great measure , his prospects of usefulness and success in life . I feel the more certain of all this , because of the numerous young men , aided by benevolent societies with whom I have been intimately acquainted , I have observed some , who have been aided only in the way which the Reviewer would prefer , that have evidently been injured as to their habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury of their benefactors would not be closed against them , unless they should exhibit some palpable acts of extravagance , they have felt that a nice attention to frugality was unnecessary . The fact , also , that they had been taken up , as it were in their infancy , and dandled in the lap of more than parental kindness , contributed to inspire them with exalted ideas of their own talents and deserts . They did not seem to me so much to accept of charity in the way of a gratuity , as to claim it as a debt . Nay , one might well say , who knew the whole developement of their feelings , that they regarded the church as debtors to them , on account of their high importance to her , and of their elevated worth ; and that they really deemed it a matter of condescension on their part , to accept of what was gratuitously proffered to them . Yes , I have seen this ; and my soul has sickened at the sight . The blasting influence of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for the ministry , is self-evident ; and it is my heart 's desire and prayer to God , that the church may keep as clear from presenting such a temptation , as the accomplishment of the great ends which she has in view will permit her to do . It is plain , beyond all doubt , that young men , who are to be ministers of the gospel , need to be educated in habits of frugality ; in which condition , it is absolutely certain that their salary , in any ordinary case , will never be adequate , without the strictest economy , to their wants . How many pastors are every year dismissed ; how many inflict deep distresses on themselves and on their families , for want of early discipline like that which the American Education Society requires , unhappy experience daily testifies . It is my full belief , that the Alumni of the American Education Society will present fewer cases of such melancholy facts , than have heretofore been usual . I am aware of the objection which has been made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz. that a mode of educating young men subjected to so many restraints , will make them niggardly and covetous . But I am not prepared to believ , that attention to /z/ ( ragality and industry ; strict attention to all one 's pecuniary responsibilities and expenditures , so necessary in all the business of life , and so much applauded by all men ; can have any proper tendency towards the vices of covetousness and pusillanimity . Beyond a few instances in which men love money merely for its own sake , covetousness , rapacity , extortion , and niggardliness , belong mostly to those who are greedy to obtain something to lay out on the means of sensual pleasure , or of gratifying some ambitious desire . In a word , I confess myself exceedingly slow to believe , that the Gpd of nature has so formed us , that the insisting on the practice of certain virtues should , in itself , have a tendency to lead to certain vices . Facts disprove this . Of all the classes of men in society , I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to their means , than such as have been the beneficiaries of the American Education Society . Nay , I can say more ; I can say that their purses , light as they are , with scarcely sufficient to pay their letter postages , and to purchase enough of stationary to write to their friends , are opened to the calls of charity and religion ; and the simple mites bestowed , with such views and such a spirit , I trust will prove to be , in the Saviour 's estimation , like the widow 's mite , cast into the treasury of God , in the view of the astonished disciples . ( 3 . ) I must add to the considerations already suggested , that an accountability like the one in question , is absolutely necessary to secure the confidence of the community , and particularly of men of business , who are accustomed to responsibilities . The experience of the American Education Society determines , that those who are able and willing to give , will not do so to any great extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time , unless a high responsibility is created on the part of those who are to receive their bounty . The allegation of the Reviewer against such a measure , is the first and only serious one of this kind , which the Directors have ever heard . With one consent , the community , so far as I have any knowledge , have applauded their measures on this point . Nay , of the hundreds of young men on their list , no one has as yet , so far as they know , ever raised his voice against the measure , or made complaint of its oppressive nature . So far have they been from this , that they have often testified their most hearty concurrence and approbation . If the American Education Society are wrong then , in respect to the measure in question , the whole community , givers and receivers , are wrong along with them . All men of business , especially , are fundamentally in error ; for it is from these in particular that the high and imperative demand has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly in its power . They demand all the security which from the nature of the case can be afforded , that their bounty will not be squandered nor misapplied . That they are in the right , I do most heartily believe ; and that the American public will justify this view of the subject , and support it , I am fully persuaded . ( 4 . ) I may remark , in the last place , that the Schedule of rer* THE AMB &ICAN; EDUCATION SOCIBTT. li larns under discussion , is very important to the Directors of the American Education Society , in as much as it furnishes them with a large number of facts which must serve as the basis of many of their calculations and their measures . The average amounts of expenses are made out from such statements . The probable and possible means which young men possess of helping themselves by labour , otherwise , comes in this way to be known . The comparative expenses in different parts of the country are developed . In this way the Directors come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of the Reviewer , when he says , that " the aid afforded by the American Education Society is not sufficient to pay hcUf the expense of an education , in the cheapest college in the United States . " The answer to this is , that it does not comport iihfcLcts thus disclosed . I must not quit the topic under discussion , without noticing the two great difficulties which the Reviewer suggests , as standing in the way of the requisitions in question . In his view , ' The plan holds out a powerful temptation to conceal the amount of receipts and expenses , so as to form a stronger claim on the aid of the Society ; placing the beneficiary in the attitude of a common beggar , whose success depends on the doleful ness of his story , " p. 356 . But how would this evil , ( if it be a real one ) , be cured by a di ferent method of management ? If the minuteness and the greatness of the responsibility expose a beneficiary to the evils here mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these respects would relieve the evil . But I have always been accustomed to believe , that minuteness of responsibility , and the greatness and certainty of it , is the highest and most effectual of dl means to keep men honest and straight in their business . And I appeal to the whole world for a spontaneous decision on this point , without a single argument upon it ; for it certainly needs none . If you wish to tempt men to dishonesty and partial statements of their concerns or their management , hold them at loose ends in their accounts ; if not , then create a high responsibility . I am utterly unable to see how the temptation is now any greater to give a false account of expenditures , than it would be under a system of inspection less rigid . And as to ' ' placing the receiver in the attitude of a common beggar , whose success depends on the dolefulness of his story ; " how is this dolefulness made any greater or less , by the fact that a man is accountable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be any " hitting the point " here , I am notable to perceive it . Nay , if there be any thing in the revolting idea of " common beggary , " which is applicable to the subject in question ; then let me ask , who is most like a " common beggar ? " He who comes with a piteous story of his wants in a lump , without entering , or being able to enter , into any particulars , which are in any measure probable , or will bear the least scrutiny ; or he who brings along with him CLccredited vouchers for all his wants and woes , and can definitely show how they come to exist , and to be urgent ? The case is too plain to need comment ; and the /z/ Statement must have escaped from the Reviewer , in a moment when imagination had strong predominance over reflection . But when the Reviewer proceeds , in connexion with the allegations just examined , to say , that " young men of delicate and ingenuous feelings shrink from this public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shews a want of information in respect to the subject on which he has commented , that might well have led him to hesitate and examine before he ventured to speak in this way . And what is the public developement ? " Just this ; viz. that the beneficiary goes with his Schedule to one who is or ought to be his most confidential and paternal friend , to the head of the school or College in which he is , and obtains his certificate as to the credibility of the statement ; and this certificate comes before the Directors of the American Education Society who are also in loco parentum , and who vote of course in accordance with it , unless they have some special ground to suspect that there is collusion or fraud . And is this a public developement ? " I know not , indeed , that the Reviewer meant to convey so much as his words do convey . I understood by them , an intimation that the Schedules of all the beneficiaries of the American Education Society are published to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular documents of the Society which are to be made public . I may be mistaken in my apprehension , but I predict , that thousands in our country will understand it just as I have done ; and if so , may I be pardoned for suggesting , that the Reviewer is accountable for an impression so much at variance with fact , and tending to cast odium on the Directors of the American Education Society , as men wanting in delicacy of feeling , and disposed to be rigid , to an unreasonable degree , in their demands . I trust he will , therefore , pardon me , and indeed thank me , for making public the correction of such an error . I certainly do not charge him with any intended error ; I acquit him altogether of this . But I must still believe , that when such great interests are concerned as are called in question here , men are bound to know that what they state as facts , is correct . I have one more remark to make on this subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reviewer has made , about the reluctance of young men to submit to the accountability in question . More than 900 young men , educated in 77 Academies , 23 Colleges , and 10 Theological Seminaries , during the last 14 years have submitted to an inspection of this nature , and for half that period , the present Schedule has been in actual existence , and yet it is not known as I have before said , that any complaints have been made . If the Reviewer has found " more than one young man of unquestionable piety , " who declined asking aid of the American Education Society because of the strictness and minuteness of accountability to which he would be subjected ; then I can only say , that his experience differs widely from that stated above . I can not refrain from adding , too , that if accountability/ will deter any young man from asking aid , it is my earnest hope and wish , that the American Education Society may never hav# any beneficiaries of this character . /q/ They want such , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shrink not from every responsibility that is requisite to give confidence to the public and to the world . I come now to the Second Objection of the Reviewer against the measures of the American Education Society . This is , that the principle of " refunding the monies advanced to young men patronized , is a doubtful , if not a dangerous feature of this institution , " p. 356 . The reasons for this measure he represents as being two ; viz. ( 1 ) To relieve the beneficiary from the mortification of being considered a charity student . ( 2 ) To augment the means , and perpetuate the benefits of the Society . But are these all the reasons ? Certainly not . In the eleventh Report of the Society , the Directors say , that " because , after much experience , they are convinced that loans will exert a more happy influence upon the character of those whom they patronize , " they have embarked in this measure . They tell us , that the same experience proves , that more strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be promoted by it . This I do most fully believe . Nay , from long experience and observation , I might say , I do certainly know it . And if this be correet , it is a very important reason for their measures , which the Reviewer has not at all suggested . He is mistaken , also , when he speaks of the loan , as designed to be a " shelter for charity students , from the unmerited reproach often attempted to be cast upon them . " The young men in this condition , are now too numerous , and too respectable for worth , and for talents , to need any such shelter . The voice of the church and of the community is too much in their favour to render it at all necessary . Disgrace is out of the question . But delicacy of feeling is not out of question , and to my certain knowledge , many a young man , that would have abandoned his education rather than obtain it by gratuity , now has no scruples in receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , which the American Education Society have adopted. * In regard to the " high ground " which the church should take , in the opinion of the Reviewer , and educate gratuitously all that are needed for the ministry , as our government educate young men in their naval and military schools ; this is desirable then , and only then , when it becomes necessary . The question whether it is necessary , is * The following extract of a letter from the President of one of our Colleges ; affords a striking illustration of the truth of the above remark . It is published in the Quarterly Journal of the Society , Vol . I. p. 32 , and relates to the case of a peculiarly needy young man . " He tells me that he has been repeatedly advised to apply for aid to your Society , but never could so far sacrifice his love of independence as to consent to it . He was , however , from the difficulty of getting along without too ' much loss of time from his studies , becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public usefulness . I explained to him the method of loaning money now adopted by the Society , as calculated to save the feelings of young men , and advised him to apply . He concludes to do so , and has gone to to procure the required testimonials . " /z/ the very one in debate . And if such ground should be prejudicial to the character of beneficiaries , ( and experience it is beheved has established this fact ) , then is a different ground preferable , unless it can be shewn to be the occasion of formidable evils . The money that would be expended on the wholly gratuitous education of young men for the ministry , may now be appropriated to missionary objects , to building up our waste places , to helping our feeble churches , and to providing for their starving pastors . The Reviewer does not see the propriety of calling the loan made to beneficiaries a parental loan . He wishes to know what is meant by such a loan ; and suggests that obligations , like those demanded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents , p. 358 . Is it then true , in the first place , that the young men of the church have the same relation to her , as to support which children have to their parent ? If so , then why may not the rich as well as the poor , claim support from her ? Indeed , the case of the cadets , which the writer presents , who are supported at the expense of the government , would seem designed to justify this principle ; for all are equally supported in this case , whether they are rich or poor . Would the Reviewer say , that a church struggling with poverty , and not adequate to maintain its own pastor ; or that an individual in circumstances of indigence , who belongs to any church , should contribute money or labour to help educate the son of a rich member of the church ? This can not be done ; it ought not to be done . And if it be said , in reply to this , that the rich ought to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the end , the poor man will be more than compensated for his contribution toward educating the sons of the rich ; the answer is , that justice indeed would require this ; but how is it to be enforced ? Are all professed Christians , who are rich , and who may have pious sons , willing voluntarily to contribute in such a way ? Facts speak a loud and appalling testimony against such an assumption . There remains no way , then , if the principle of the Reviewer be adopted , but for the church to tax her members , and make out the regular proportion which ought to be paid , and must be paid by them . Any other method than this , can never be just and equitable , provided the cadet'System to which the Reviewer has appealed as affording so noble an example , be adopted by the church . It is by taxation and by compulsion , that this system is supported . Can the churches resort to similar measures ? Does not the specious object , then , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the midst of the shining mist in which it was enveloped , assume a form entirely different , on near approach and after minute inspection ? The proposal of the Reviewer , I must regard as chimerical and impossible , unless we are to have a religious establishment , supported and rendered compulsory by the civil power . The Reviewer would himself be among the last men , who would desire any thing like this , or who would cease to oppose and resist it . Things must remain then as they are , in regard to charities . /q/ Those who give , must do it voluntarily not by assessment or compulsion . And while this is the case , it is quite certain , that the church will consent to educate only the indigent part of her sons . These she ought not to educate , I trust she will not , without efforts of their own , and without a high responsibility as to the manner in which they dispose of her bounty , and high and sacred obligations to become what she desires them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the loan should be called parental . He wishes to know , * whether patents lend money to their children ; and then , whether , in case they do , they demand written obligations of re-payment . ' The answer to this might be , that it is no new thing for parents to make loans to their children ; and to insist on it , that they shall be repaid , in case there is ability to do it . I could appeal , in proof of this , to my own experience . I have sons to educate ; but I am unable to complete their education , unless the older ones do themselves contribute to assist the younger . I make this a condition of completing their education ; and I have no scruples in doing so , although I would hope and trust that I am not deficient in parental tenderness . I even consider it a serious advantage to my children , to be placed under such a responsibDity . Let it be remembered , however , that the property in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entrusted with the sacred bounties of the church . They are under the most solemn obligations to see that nothing is squandered , nothing is left insecure . They must , therefore , on the principle of loaning , require a written security . If the sum in question , in any case , be lost to the Society for want of due care , they are responsible for it . In these respects , therefore , it is far from being fair , to compare their situation with that of a parent . If it be still asked . Why then call the loan parental ? The answer is ; Because it is truly so , in some very important respects ; i. e. it is an accommodating loan ; it is afforded from mere motives of kindness ; and is very different , in regard to the conditions attached to it , from common loans . No interest is required until a reasonable time after , the young man has entered the ministry ; the only surety is his own note ; and it is further expressly provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future condition of those who are patronized hy the Society , in consequence of any calamity , or of the service in the church to which they may be providentially called , or the peculiar situation in which they may he placed , shall in the judgement of this Board be found to be such , as to render it unsuitable for them to be called upon to pay the debt contracted for their education , it shall be understood to be the right , and duty , of the Board to cancel such debt , in whole or in part , whenever they shall judge proper . " Ilth Rep. p. 22 . What more now can reasonably be asked , than is here granted ? It will be agreed by all that such beneficiaries as can repay , ought in justice and in conscience to do it . But how will it be with those , who may be in a state of extreme poverty and dependence ? Why the debt will be cancelled . Here is ample provision , express legal provision , for this purpose . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case ? There can surely be none , unless the Directors are so lacking in humanity as to shut their ears against any complaints of indigence and misfortune which their beneficiaries may make . Has this ever been done ? I ask this question fearlessly . I know the Directors too well to have any apprehensions about the answer . Nay , I challenge the whole world to produce an instance , where this imputation justly lies against them . The oppressive nature of the loan in question , then , is only in fear in anticipation , not in fact . It is indeed possible , that the Directors may abuse their commission to be compassionate ; it is possible for any man or body of men to abuse any trust committed to them ; but the probability of this , in the case now before us , is certainly one of the remotest that can be imagined . And even supposing it actually to take place , there is an appeal from the Directors to the whole Society , composed of members from at least 20 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and displace them from office . I have been minute on this part of the subject , because I am well aware , that there is an appeal in the representations of the Reviewer to the compassion of the community toward the beneficiaries of the Society . Their case is presented as one , which must bear exceedingly hard upon them , after they are settled in the ministry ; and they are made to appeal to our sensibilities , on the score of a family who are suffering for want of bread , an empty library , an inability to aid the charitable objects of the day , and other things of the like nature . Now all of this has some foundation in reality ; but all cases of this nature are actually provided for , as we have seen above ; and this , even to the utmost extent which a considerate man can desire . I must believe that the Reviewer had never studied or contemplated the provisions so fully made , when he wrote the paragraphs on which I have now been commenting . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our subject . This is , that facts contradict the theory which the Reviewer has here presented . As a specimen of the idJiy facts which lie before the Directors of the American Education Society , I present the following extract of a letter from one of their beneficiaries . " Enclosed is dollars , which added to what I have given the last year makes the amount of the benefactions I received from your Society . My donations for several years previous , whether more or less , you may regard in the light of interest ; and in the same light you may regard all my future donations , which I purpose to continue , annually , as long as I have any thing to give . " My salary is small ; and though my family is also small , we have to consult the principles of economy and to deny ourselves many things , in order to have an agency in the various great departments of Christian charity . Our rule is , first , to economize ; eronc ? / , to give * bountifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9* 6 ; and then , thirdly , if we have any thing to spare , to lay it up , until the Lord shall call for it ;  --  and we find so much enjoyment in this course , that we shall probably continue it . " This is only a specimen of the manner in which I trust a great /q/ part of the beneficiaries of the American Education Society feel and will feel . They would be among the last , I verily believe , to propose the giving up of their obligations to the Society . And this applies to those who have gone out from Theological Seminaries , and have settled in parishes , and know by experience all the difficulties with which they must struggle , and to which the Reviewer adverts . Testimooy from these is worth more than all the theory in the world . The gentleman , whose testimony is cited above , and who holds a conspicuous place among the labourers in the great Missionary cause , is one who has had difficulties to struggle with . Is such experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Education Society ? Or are they to shape their measures , solely by principles deduced from reasoning a priori ? In regard to the allegation oflhe Reviewer , which stands connected with this part of our subject , viz. *that the loan system will tend to create a calculating , craving disposition , ' I have already remarked upon the subject above . I can only say again , that the cultivation of economical habits , of frugality , and industry , is one of the last things which can ever make misers and niggards . I must have overwhelming evidence to induce me to believe that the God of nature has so formed us , that the cultivation of virtues necessarily leads to vices . As a test of the ability and willingness of the American Education Society 's beneficiaries to repay the loan which they have contracted , I would add , that within little more than two years , ( although the system has as yet begun only partially to operate ) , more than $2000 have been cheerfully repaid into the Treasury . So much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Society . The Reviewer has suggested , also , under his second objection , that Colleges and Theological Seminaries must likewise aid young men , who are indigent , in obtaining their education ; and that , in case they do this , the young men will be utterly unable to discharge their obligations both to the American Education Society and to these Institutions . Suppose this to be true ; then it follows that the American Education Society must abandon their claim , according to the pledge which they have given to the young men and to the world . The Colleges and Theological Seminaries must do the same , in some cases of imperious necessity . But in ordinary cases , a young man of real industry and good talents , ( no others ought to be educated by the funds of the Church ) will find ways and means to help himself , so that he need not receive more aid than it will be safe for him to be obligated to pay . Experience abundantly testifies this . It is well known that some young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society or individual for assistance ; and surely it is practicable for young men situated as are the beneficiaries of the American Education Society to do what is required of them . Besides , means are now used , and the prospect is now opening , for young men to aid themselves by manual labour ; which is very useful to them both in a physical and intellectual respect . To this source the Directors of the American Education Society are anxiously di- /z/ rectin young men . Between nine and ten thousand dollars have been earned in various ways the past year , by the beneficiaries of the Society . The Reviewer seems to be , and doubtless is , unacquainted with these and the like facts ; otherwise he could not reason and assert as he does . The American Education Society do not wish to conceal it from the public , that it is a favorite principle with them , to induce , so far as in them lies , all their young men to help themselves in every honest and becoming manner , and to the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country will certainly justify them in this . But the Reviewer asks , " What becomes of the monies when refunded ? " He then goes on to aver , that they are all returned to the treasury of the Parent Society ; and that , in consequence of such an arrangement , this Society will finally have an unlimited capital at their exclusive control . Add all the loans returned , to the permanent funds and to the scholarships , and , he thinks , in half a century ' * a height of independence must be attained , sufficient to make even good men 's heads turn giddy , " p. 361 . In particular , he suggests , that ' if all the Presbyterian Churches in the United States were to become auxiliary to the American Education Society , the monies refunded by all their beneficiaries , as well as their annual surplus , must go to the Parent Board , and be entirely beyond the reach of the Branches , p. 361 . I shal not take the liberty to impute any special design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles and the assertions , on which it is grounded , are proper subjects of examination . If there be any one thing , which the Directors of the American Society have particularly aimed to accomplish in all their measures with respect to the Society , it is this , viz. that it should be guarded as effectually as possible against a perversion , or monopoly , of the funds . In order to effect this , the ultimate responsibility in all cases y is vested in the Generai Society , To them all questions may be referred ; and before them , every alleged grievance or perversion be laid , for their final and irreversible decision . Who then are the men , that constitute this General Society ? They consist of evangelical clergymen and laymen , throughout the United States . The whole number of members entitled to vote , is , at present , about 350 . These belong to at least 20 States of the Union ; and 111 of these are either clergymen or laymen of the Presbyterian church . This church would have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally set out on the same ground on which it now stands . The Society originated in the heart of New England . For many years , ( down so late as 1826 ) , a certain sum of money , given by way of donation , entitled any one to the privilege of voting . The Society was thus at the mercy of any party , whether evangelical or not , that might choose to create members enough at any time , to come in and take entire possession of all its funds . In 1826 , the Constitution was changed , and only members elecU ed were in future admitted to the privilege of voting ; although a donation to a certain extent still constitutes honorary membership . None /q/ originaUy entitled to vote , were excluded from this privilege , by the new arrangement . And as to the future , the Society , ( not the Direo tors , as the Reviewer seems to understand it ) , elect by ballot those who are to be members . Before 1826 , when this important change was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many more donations in NewEng  - -  land which entitled to membership , than elsewhere . In fact , during the first ten years of the existence of the Society , out of $100,000 con* tributed , $70,000 were given in Massachusetts . This accounts for it , why the number of members of the Society , belonging to the Congregational is greater than that of any other denomination . And this is the only reason ; for since the change in question , 94 members have been elected ; and of these , 74 are out of New England , and only two belong to Massachusetts . Fyty of the newly elected members belong to the States of New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . Does this look like sectional partiality ? Or is there any party ambition or pur* poses , discoverable in this ? I repeat it , in order that neither the Reviewer nor his friends noAy overlook it . The Directors neither nominaie nor choose any of the elect ' ed members of the Society . From these plain facts , it is very obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presbyterian church may have , and in all probability will have , a controlling influence , in the American Education Society . Every act of the Board of Directors is subject to revision , directly or indirectly , by the General Society . Every choice of members , and every choice of officers , ( who , let it be noted , are elected only for one year at a time ) is by the same Society . How then can its funds be perverted , or applied to party purposes ? Never  --  until all branches of the General Society , including evangelical men of at least five denominations , become corrupt throughout ; and when such a universdl corruption takes place , the American Education Society will at least be as safe as any other Society , whether Presbyterian or not . Let us now , for a moment , examine in another point of view the power of the Directors of the Parent Society , which is an object of so much dread . We have seen how entirely their doings are subject to revision by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of Branch Societies . All applications for aid , toithin the limits of Branch Societies , must first be made to the Branch Societies . The Directors of these appoint a mcgority of the examiners of such applicants ; on whose certificate depends the success of the application . When a favourable certificate is obtained from these examiners , it is remitted to the Board of the Branch Society first , who receive or reject the applicant , and if the former , they make an appropriation . The application is then forwarded to the Board of the Parent Society for their concurrence . If they think it their duty to reject the application ; they remit the case back to the Branch Society , with their objections . Should a final disagreement take place between the two Boards , the case may come before the General Society at their annual meeting , at which are present mem- // bers from all parts of the United States . This has an ultimate juris* diction over every question of this , or of the like nature . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ; and the General Society has a supervision and ultimate control of the whole 1 In addition to this , there is an article of the Constitution , which expressly provides , that Presidents of Branch Societies shall be , ex officio , voting members of the General Society , and also honorary members of the Board of Directors ; thereby giving to each Branch Society a perpetual representation , of its own selection , in the councils both of the Society and of the Board . Is this aiming at the concentration of power in the hands of the Directors of the Parent Society ; or does it look like a most guarded distribution of power , and a cautious check upon it , not unlike what the structure of our nap tional government exhibits ? Are not the Branch Societies , however , dependent on the Parent Society t They must , of course , conform all their proceedings to its Constitution and fundamental Rules . But they elect their own officers , from the least to the greatest , and as often as they please ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own funds ; they recommend and receive their own candidates . The Parent Board has , indeed , the power of nominating a part of the Examining Committees ; but it is a minority of them : and this right is retained only for security in regard to the Constitution and Rules which they are bound to see observed . The Parent Society , except in an extreme case which is provided for , can not take up a single candidate within the limits of a Branch Society , without its consent and approbation ; while , on the other hand , the concurrence of the Parent Society is necessary , in order that the appropriation may be actually made ; unless , indeed , in a case of appeal , the General Society revoke their decision where they may have refused aid . Biht what control have the Branch Societies over the monies given ? I answer , that all monies raised within the limits of a Branch Society are paid into its own treasury . If permanent scholarships are endowed , the property vests in the Parent Society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of the said Scholarships stands pledge td to the Branch Societies , tdthin whose limits thy have been raised and is subject to their disposal as stated above . Can the Parent Society adopt a more impartial method of proceeding than this ? Look , moreover , at the operation of this principle . When a Branch Society has more monies in its treasury than is needed for beneficial ries within its own limits , it remits the overplus to the treasury of the Parent Society . But , on the other hand , if it have less in its treasury than is needed , ( an occurrence that frequently happens ) , then it is entitled to draw out of the treasury of the Parent Society , just as though the money were in its own . If this be not generous impartiality , it would be difficult to say what is so in the management of such matters . In regard to the Examining Committees , whose peculiar province it is to recommend beneficiaries to the American Education Society , I would state , that at present there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , 14 only are in New-England , and 27 out of it . And when /q/ we Call to mind , that a majority of each of these committees , on whom the appropriation of all monies to beneficiaries depends , are appointed by the respective Branch Societies , in all cases where such Societies exist , this must be proof satisfactory enough to every candid mind , that the Parent Society is not aiming at power and control . While I am on the subject of the organization and powers of the American Education Society and its respective Branches , I would state , that the General Society , constituted as above , has recently held its annual meetings , alternately in Boston and New York during the week of their respective anniversaries . This arrangement will probably continue  --  and by means of it the Society will be brought into the vicinity of a very large part of all the voting members . Should the next meeting be held in the city of New York , more members will probably be in the city having a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will compose the next General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church . The meeting for the choice of officers , and for the transaction of special business , is distinct from , and antecedent to , the general meeting , when addresses , etc. are made , as is customary in other Societies . At this previous meeting , any business whatever may be taken up ; all proceedings of the Directors may be examined and canvassed ; any objections can be raised , which any member of the Society chooses to raise either against any part of its proceedings , or of its principles . No officer whatever is chosen for a longer period than one year at a time ; and , if the Society see fit , every Director , Secretary , Treasurer , or other officer previously appointed , may be displaced , and others substituted in their room . If there be any aim in all this at dictatorship , it is not , at least , to be perpetual dictators . From a review of the Constitution and principles of the Parent and Branch Societies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or party appropriations of monies should be made by the Directors of the Parent Society , without a speedy and adequate accountableness and punishment for so doing . The General Society , at its annual meeting , coming from all parts of the United States , must be an impartial body ; and in their hands are Directors , Secretaries , Treasurers , Examiners , funds , and every thing else . Can an imagination which is not heated , sea any phantoms of a frightful aspect rising up out of such ground as this ? To the important question , " What becomes of the monies refunded ? " we may answer , then , that they go into the treasury of the Parent Society for the present , and are paid out from this to all the Branch Societies in the United States , according to their respective wants . They must ever continue to be so appropriated , until the General Society cease to do their duty at their annual meeting ; and until all parts of our country become heretical or corrupt . If , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt a plan , which would allow the monies returned within the limits of each Branch Society , to be paid into the treasury of such Society , this measure would remove even the semblance of the difficulty which the Reviewer suggests . The Directors , I have no doubt , will be en- /z/ iirelj disposed to adopt this , or any other arrangement , which may promote the interests of the Society . In thus detailing the Constitution and principles of the American ESdacation Society , I trust that I have obviated most of the difficulties which the Reviewer suggests under his Third head of objections . The substance of this head is , that the voting members of the Society are eligible to office ; and that their election must depend on the Directors of the Parent Society ; that such an arrangement is giving them a power to perpetuate their own office , and their own control over an immense sum of money , which may be appropriated to purposes destructive to the welfare of the church . And this organization is represented to be such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and manage and direct the whole Christian community , south and west of the Connecticut , interested in this concern , " p. 364 . The answer to all this is found in the preceding statement . It is built on misapprehension of the Constitution and Rules of the American Education Society . The Directors , as such , have no control at all over the election of any new members of the Society , nw over the number who shall be chosen . They have not even a nomtnoHon of such members confided to them ; and should they undertake to make one , any other member of the Society has an equal right , and I may add , an equal chance of success . After such a view as has been given above , of the manner in which membership and the rigki of voting in the Society , is now constituted , and of the number of members , their partition among different denominations of Christians , and their diffusion among 20 States of the Union ; can it well be sup posed , that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reviewer are well grounded ? Is there no check here ? Are there no honest men among all these members of the American Education Society , chosen from leading men in church and state in our country ; no independent men there , who can not be flattered or misled by any electioneering of the Directors ? And are there not men enough , among the present members of the Society , of sufficient wisdom , pm* dence , and integrity , to secure the interests of the Society in future , by the choice of members like themselves ? To deny either of these , would be one of the last things which I would venture to do . On serious revision of what the Reviewer has intimated with recqpect to this subject ; I do hope and believe , that he will withdraw even an implied insinuation of such a nature . Representations of this kind may , indeed , be a forcible appeal to the jealousies of men , and of parties ; but they must be distressing to those who look seriously at the tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to fill them with groundless alarm ; and , of course , to quench their ' zeal in behalf of the American Education Society . I have thus examined the facts alleged by the Reviewer , as grounds of distrust and fear , in regard to the American Education Society . I know I am in danger of protracting the subject too much ; but the importance of the discussion induces me to cast myself on the patience -f the public , until I make a still further developement of the pro- /z/ ceedings of this Society , in regard to loans and permanent funds , which may serve to vindicate them in the view of the world . Originally , the American Education Society appropriated their monies in the method advocated by the Reviewer . They made the whole a pure gratuity . They even adopted the principle of paying the hills of their beneficiaries . Soon , however , experience shewed the imprudence of this measure . They then adopted the method of requiring a note from the beneficiary , to repay one half . This took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle was adopted , in 1826 , of loaning wholly , the American Education Society , by their Secretary and Directors , held an extensive correspondence with the heads of Colleges and Seminaries in different parts of the United States , and with distinguished clergymen and laymen of several States , in regard to this and other subjects . In this manner they laboured faithfully to ascertain the sentiments and feelings of the community ; and especially of those who had superintended the education of beneficiaries of the American Education Society . As a. specimen of the communications which they received in answer to their applications , I would subjoin the following extract of a letter , addressed to the Directors of the Society , by the intelligent , judicious , and excellent President of Union College , at Schenectady . It is dated Nov. 1825 . " In general , I am very favourably impressed with respect to the wisdom of the plans of the Board , and the prudence and the energy with which those plans are executed ; and , in conclusion , I have therefore only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen of the effect of public charity on the physical , moral , and religious character of young men , I am of opinion , that appropriations from such a charity should be sparingly made . A greater number can then be assisted , and the motive to personal exertion will not be entirely removed from any . In the free and long continued distribution of a public charity , there is danger that an opinion will be insensibly induced , that the amount distributed is the payment of a debt due , requiring no special gratitude in the receipt , or economy in the application ; and there is also danger , lest those accustomed to be taken care of by otliers should insensibly cease to take care , and lose the habit of taking care of themselves . In a country like ours , where the support of the ministry must be voluntary , and where the people , if supplied at all , must be generally supplied by ministers who can live on small salaries , it is wise , as far as practicable , to raise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gone over were to be acain gone over , it might be a question whether a system of loans , in toto , on a low interest , would not , on the whole , be wiser than a system of donations . Perhaps more would not then be refunded than will now be ; assistance , however , would be equally within the reach of the persons who needed it ; self-interest would operate more strongly to narrow their expenditures , and an increased stimulus to personal exertion would be applied during the whole preparatory state ; the incumbents on the fund would be ki ; iown , not as paupers living on charity , but as indigent young men , struggling with poverty , and calculating to repay the favours done them out of the n'uits of their future earnings/ ' Many important testimonies of the like nature were received , also , soon after the measure in question was adopted ; as may be seen by referring to the Appendix in the Eleventh Report of the Society , where will be found the testimonies of no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of many other gentlemen of high reputation , besides communications expressing the views of about 70 /z/ beneficiaries belonging to four Colleges , and highly approving the measures in question. * Several other Societies had also adopted similar principles , or have adopted them since.f The business men of the community called aloud for such an arrangement . Before it was adopted , the treasury of the Society began to languish . Since its adoption , the receipts have been greatly augmented . Some who doubted about the princif at the outset , have come fully into the approbation of it , since it has been put to the test of experience . Such were the efforts of the Directors of the American Education Society to learn their duty , and such the results of these efforts . Will any one say , in view of these facts , that they ought to have hesitated about acting as they have done ? Nay , I may make the appeal nearer home to the Reviewer ; I may refer him to the General Assembly . In their Minutes of this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every beneficiary to remember , that his duty to the church , to his younger brethren who seek the same holy office , and to his Saviour , requires that so soon as he is able he should refund the benefaction conferred on him with interest . Every beneficiary shall be furnished with an attested copy of this resolution . " The Reviewer will perceive that the General Assembly 's Board of Education have here recognized , in the most distinct manner , the duty of its beneficiaries toward " the church , their younger brethren , and the Saviour " himself , to refund not only the sums of money furnished them by the Board , but to return the same " with interest , " in all cases where they are able . How does this differ at all from " the principle of refunding " adopted by the American Education Society ? They cancel the debt , in case of inability to pay it ; the Assembly 's Board do not think that more than this ought to be done . And although they do not require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be furnished with a copy of this resolution , which certainly amounts to a printed obligation . If there ye any advantage in this latter measure over the former , I confess myself unable to perceive what it is . Indeed I have difficulties , of serious import , in my own view , in respect to this measure of the Assembly 's Board . The young men , who , on the score of duty , thus become their debtors , are left * These testimonials are sisned by Presidents  --  Day  --  Nott  --  Davis  --  Griffin  - -  Humphrey  --  Bates  --  Tyler  --  Wayland , and Allen  --  by Professor Rice of Virginia  --  Rev.

But lest I should be tedious , I will cut short the farthef 5 ) fteration of facts alleged by the Reviewer , and come to the consideration . II . Op fears . - " The Reviewer is afraid of the immense power , which he thinks the Parent Society will ultimately attain . These fears he has unequivocally expressed in the following language . Speaking of the election of members by ballot , he says , * Whatever may be the effect of this arrangement in preventing or retard* ing the perversion of the funds from the original purpose , it certainly increases the power of the Officers and Directors to an most unlimited extent . It enables them , if so disposed , to select the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that in fact they might as well be elected for life , with the power of nominating their own successors . Suppose that at any time a majority of the acting members of the Society are in favour of the measures adopted by the Directors , the Directors can , through their friends , have new voting members chosen , favourable to the same course ; so that it will in the end amount to the same thin , as to give the Directors the power of appointing their successors . The distant members , who have a right to vote , can seldom attend the anniversaries ; so that from the nature of the case , the election of officers and new members , can always be under the control of those residing near the place of holding the annual meetings . If at any time the concerns of the Society should be mismanaged , it is evident , from the very terms of the compact , that the branches and distant contributors , have no means of effecting a reformation ; because they have voluntarily surrendered their rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts . And as this corporation can hold real estate , whose annual income shall equal ten thousand dollars ; can increase permanent funds and scholarships to any extent ; can dispose at pleasure of the annual surplus of the auxiliaries , and the monies returned by beneficiaries , and has also a veto on the appropriations of the branches ; its power must become immense . And the organization is so adjusted , the machinery is so admirably arranged , as to concentrate the whole power in a single point ; so that the hand of an infant , touching a lever in Boston , can control , and manage , and direct the whole Christian community , south and west of the Connecticut , interested in this concern . " As to the facts here alleged , they have already been examined . The amount of the /gars is , that there may be , or will be , perversion of power and funds . Again , in canvassing the subject of monies loaned being returned to the general treasury , he says , ** Add these monies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate care of the Parent Society , and it seems to as , tnat if this process were to go on for half a century , a height of independence must be attained , suffiicient to make even good men 's heads torn giday .

Letis suppose that some twenty or thirty years hence , one half of the ministers of the Presbyterian Church shall have been educated under this system , and tliat the bonds of many of , them remain unpaid in the hands of the Directors in the vicinity of Boston , - zCnd that in these circumstances a proposition were made in the Greneral Assembly.ofthft Presbjrterian Church , to change some important feature in her dis ' pUne.or* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So  --  i6l ; y ' . ivsre known to think favourablv of these chan- Ses  --  what would be the conseouence ?

I am glad the writer has been ingenuous enough to speak out thus plainly the difficulties which he feels on this subject . On facts , his difficulties , as it seems to me , can not rest , when he comes to review them . If so , then they must have their basis iu fears . I do him honour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a testimony so frank and noble , in regard to the present Directors and management of the American Education Society , as is the following : ' We are far from intimating that any such influence is now intended to be attained , and if it were attainea , that it would be improperly used . We have the happiness to be personally acquainted with some of the Directors of this great concern , and we know the reputation of all ; and we believe them to be as pure in their intentions , as single m their purpose , and as devoted to the cause of evangelical piety , as any men on earth ; and we disclaim any knowledge of a single act in their management of this great charity which has the most remote sectarian bearing . " And again ; * ' As lon as the Directors remain , such as we believe they now are , intelligent , active , and devoted to the cause of evangelical doctrine and vital piety , every thing , which the interests of the church and of the world demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most heartily agree ; and I sincerely thank the Reviewer for having given them to the public . It would seem now , that in his own view , with all his caution and apprehensions , there is , at least , no present danger . But then who can certainly secure us for the future 7 None , I answer unhesitatingly , but the Great Head of the Church ; none but God . And in this respect the American Education Society do not stand alone . Every College , Theological Seminary , and Academy in this country , stand on the same footing as to the future . Who knows whether the distinguished College and Theological Seminary at Princeton will not , before the next generation passes wholly away , go into the hands of Arminians or Unitarians ? None but God , I answer boldly . Experience in other States and countries will support this answer . The Reviewer has referred us to the University at Cambridge , as an /z/ example and a proof that fiinds may be perverted , and the Societies who manage them may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deep distress . But what b the remedy ? As a member of the Presbyterian Church , he may answer , ' Tha remedy is in our creed/ and in our formulas of discipline and doctrine . " - But have not the church in Scotland been in possession of these for almost two centuries ? And is the Reviewer ignorant of the fact , that the Moderates , i. e. the Arminian and ArianisA party have had the predominance m that church , and swayed all its General Judicatories for many years , if not at the present period ? He is surely not ignorant , that there are a large number of Scotch churches , which are seceders from the General Assembly of their church , on the ground that the majority had become corrupted . Or , if he pleases to refer the public attention to the establishment in England , and the 29 Articles of the Episcopal church , will this ui any measure help the cause ? Who that knows any thing , does not know , that the Church of England , in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arminian , I had almost said for ages , ' not a few , ( if we may credit the statements of some of its own ministers ) and that for no small period of time , a decided majority were Arian ? And if one goes to the Creeds and Confessions of the Dutch and the German churches on the continent of Europe , is the argument helped at all ? One glance at the Neology of the continent will answer this question . I am , indeed , not one of those who have any prejudices whatever against Creeds and Confessions , when used within their proper limits , and assigned to their appropriate places . In fact , whenever I hear a man declaiming against them in a loose and general manner , I always take it for granted , that it is because he wishes to have the liberty , in some way or other , of inculcating what is opposed to them . But on the other hand , I have no apprehension that we can put them into the same scale with the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of the churches with respect to doctrine and practice . When all is done and said , they are only paper ramparts about the citadel of God ; and men wUl batter them down , whenever their passions or their prejudices are armed against them . What then is to keep the Theological Seminary at Princeton from ultimately turning apostate ? Is it the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ? How can we any more put our trust in this , than the good people of Scotland could in theirs ? Once , men of God filled nearly all the pulpits in their land ; but what has been the fact for a century past ? Now , most of the members of the Presbyterian General Assembly I hope , and verily believe , are men of God , and devoted to the interests of truth ; but how can this prove that it will always be so ? And if the General Assembly in the United States should take the course of the established churches in Scotland and in England , then what is to become of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its scholarships , which already amount to more than one half of the permanent funds of the American Education Society ? What a tremendous engine will it be , to prostrate in the dust every advocate of the truths which it now defends ? // And does not the very same argument , ( if it be any argument at all ) , apply to every College .. Theological Seminary , Academy , and benevolent Society with funds , in the whole country ? Most certainly it does . The next generation  --  who can tell what they are to be 1 God only knows . What is the result then 7 Why , if we are to reason as the Reviewer does , the result is , that we must have no Colleges endowed ; no Theological Seminaries of this character ; no Academies ; no Scholarships ; no benevolent Institutions , for even such as are without permanent funds , may be ultimately perverted . Nay , the very straoture of our government should be altered ; for the powers now oommitted to our legislators and judges , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the causes of immense and incalculable injury to the community . Can any man , now , on sober consideration , adopt or give assent to an argument or a principle , which is connected with such tremeiidous consequences as those to which the argument of the Reviewer does roost plainly and certainly lead ? * ' What proves too much , proves notin ing , " says the old proverb of the logicians ; and it says this very truly. * The reasoning of the Reviewer on page 368 , in order to remofe suspicion that the General Assembly , as well as the American Education Society , might possibly betray their trust in process of future time , furnishes no answer to the above suggestions ; nor is it grounded on any * An opinion has sometimes been expressed ( and it will be well if the re* marks of me Reviewer do not strengthen the belief ) that Institutions ought not to have permanent funds . In regard to some Institutions for promoting religion and benevolenoe , this is doubtless true . But is there no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church by an indiscriminate condemnation of these important aids in building up the kingdom of the Lord Jeeue Chriet in the world ? The experience of the beet men in all ages , has shown that such fiuide are exceedingly necessary and useful in promoting some objects of ereat and perBMUient interest . As an example , may.oe mentioned , the work n edtauUum in nearly all its Branches . The American Education Society , it is beliered bjf very many , comes to some extent at least within this class of Institutione . It M not formed for temporary purposes . SLuuld the millennium commence the nMt year , the object which it has in view would be increased , not diminished in importance . " For the poor ye have aXtoays with you . " The means of educating them will always be needed . The responsible duty of supervision , the negleet of which will more than any thing else lead to a perversion of the funds , can aerer be thoroughly discharged by the officers and agents of Education Societies , unless they are m a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of carrying forward the youth under their patronage . The American Education Society has adopted no new principle on this subject . The plan of establishing Scholarships is of long stajiding . The Qeneiml Assembly of the Presbyterian Church have warmly approved it ; and the Tmetees of that Judicatory already hold 16 such foundations for the use of the Seminary at Princeton , amounting to a pennanent fmd of f 40,000  --  which is more than half of all the money invested by the American Education Society and its Branches in this manner  --  and within $10,000 of as much as has yet been aetoally paid into the Society . Four fifths of aU the Scholarships belonging to the JhntT ' lean Education Society and to its Branches are merely temporary ; annual subecriptions binding only during the pleasure of the doners . But three permanent seholarships have been given out of New England , and one of these was by a benevolent lady in Great Britain . In this respect , therefore , those who have iealoasies about permanent funds , may find manj other Societies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point m question , more ground of jealonsv than the Ameriean Education Society . /q/ appeal to the history of the General Assembly in past ages , and in other csountries . How can all this history be overlooked by intelligent and candid men t The grand remedy proposed by the Reriewer , for all the erils which may occur in the Gieral Assembly 's Board of Education is , that they do not perpetuate their own body ; and that the General Assembly , on whcnn they are dependent , b emnmalfy elected . But is not this precisely the case with the Directors of the American Edu cation Society t And after all , who can , in either case , give assurance that those who elect anmuiUffy will not , in process of time , become corrupt ? Was not this the case in Scotland ? And have we any better security in this country ? None , I answer ; none that can be better , so as merely human arrangements are concerned . What then is the antidote for our fears as to itii future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Society , or body of men , or Statutes , or Creeds , or Constitutions . To trust in God , and to do our duty , is the only ground of hope that we have , or can have , or that we need , in regard to the time future . Had Christians OKHre faith and less ftoTy the world would be revolutionized in a short time . The treasuries of Gkxi would be full to overflowing ; and all hands would be set to work , and all hearts engaged in the glorious enterprise of spreading abroad the knowledge of salvation . In view of all this , I am constrained to wonder , that such an objection to the American Education Society should be brought forward . The argument is simply this ; ' Take care how you build up this S ( ciety ; fir should it once become corrupt , it will be a tremendous engine in doing evil . ' And can not this be said of every good Institution which adorns society or blesses mankind ? Nay , can not Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the destruction for time and eternity of millions and millions ? But shall there be no Christianity , because it may be abused ? Shall there be no endowed Academies , Cdleges , and Theological Seminaries , because they may be abused t If so , then let the Reviewer use his eloquence and his influence with the next General Assembly , to take away all the funds from the Princeton Seminary , and to return its Scholarships to the owners . It is vain for him to say , that there is , or can be , any other security that they will not be perverted , than that which the American Education Society have , that theirs will not be . I have a word to say , on the fears which he expresses , that at some future period , the beneflciaries of the American Education Society , who settle in the South and West , and who are indebted to the Society , may come forward , and , out of ccmiplaisance to the Directors who live near Boston , may vote in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian churches . In the first place , who are to license and settle these young men , in the Presbyterian connexion ? Of course the several Presbyteries belonging to the General Assembly . Will these Presbyteries , then , ordain young men , most of whom will be educated in Presbyterian Seminaries of learning , who will sell their consciences and their integrity , and break their solemn vows , in order to please the Directors of the Parent Society in and around Boston ; and all this because /z/ they owe them a smaU sum of money ? The fact that the Society has no Institutions of its own , hut educates yoiing men wherever they pursue a regular course of study , is sufficient proof that the direct influence which they may have over young men will ever be secondary . The society has assisted forty young men the present year , in four Theological Seminaries belonging to the Presbyterian church ; but who wUl imagine that the influence which the Society holds over these young men , is equal to that of their Instructors , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who considers in what manner the Society is constituted , and how entirely the Directors are dfr* pendent upon it , can seriously apprehend any evil from this source . But I have other questions also to ask . Whence comes the soicion that the Directors in and about Boston may wish to intermeddle with the doctrines or the discipline of the Presbyterian churches ? To my certain knowledge , it is habitual with those who now hold that oi flee , to recommend to all the young men who go from New England into the boundaries of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian charch , to unite with the Presbyteries , and not to hold on upon Congr gationalism . A greater mistake can not be made , than to suppose they have any zeal on this subject . And should the American Educatimi Society elect others like them , ( which they certainly may do , when they leave the stage or resign , or whenever the Society chooses to supersede them ) , then these same views will be still cherished . Nearly ooe half of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary have become Presbyterians , and the Seminary allows of a Presbyterian Professor , and never has uttered , and I trust will not utter , one word against Presbyterianism . Let us now turn the tables . The Reviewer calls on the General Assembly to educate their own young men , and not to leave them to others . In this he is in the right . And it is exceedingly cheering to know , that very many individuds and churches , belonging to the coonezion of the General Assembly , have long ago embarked in the ed work which the Reviewer recommends , and now assist in bringing forward at least 200 young men for the ministry , in harmonious connexion with the American Education Society . The Reviewer has said , that nothing , or nothing to the purpose , has yet been done by the Assembly 's Board . But while our western country is starving for the bread of life , and the world is perishing in wickedness , the American Education Society have believed that something is to be done and have tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent Societies t Have they ever suggested one syllable , which could raise a suspicion about their motives , or alarm the public about the danger of such Associations ? Let it be produced ; and for one , I will give them my still share of disapprobation . On the contrary , they will lift up their hands and hearts to God , with devout thankfulness , when the exhortation of the Reviewer shall be fully heeded by Presbyterian churches , and they will come forward and take charge of a great host of laborers for the vineyard of the Lord . But suppose now , when they do this , the Congregationalists should /q/ 8ay ; ' * See , the Presbyterians are filling our country with their pupils and friends . They have a great Society , great Seminaries , many Scholarships , and great zeal ibr Presbyterianism ; and if we wait much longer , they will be too strong for us , and Congregationalism will be driven from the land . What is to be done ? ) hy this we can do : We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an apprehension of future dangers to their religious fireedom , and their welfare . We can easily excite the jealousies of the West on this subject , who are already filled with apprehension . We can thus make the candidates of the Presbyterian minbtry objects of suspicion , and cause the public zeal in favour of raising them up greatly to abate . And thus Congregationalism may still be safe . " What could the Reviewer object to this ? It is difficult for me to see ; ( or has he not , by implication , done the same thing 1 The rectitude of his intention , I do not mean to call in question . The correctness of the principle , on which his popular appeal to suspicion and party feeling is evidently grounded , ( although he may not be conscious of it ) , is what can never for a moment be defended , until it is decided , that Congregationalists are heretics , and that they have a design to destroy tl Presbyterian churches . In a day like this , when every opposer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a hue and cry about ' ' religious combinations , ' ' and * ' religious establishments , " is it prudent , is it wise , is it becoming , is it brotherly , to make such objections as these ? But I must come to a close . And this I shall do , by a few words on the last topic proposed for consideration ; viz. III . The method which the Reviewer has chosen , in order to accomplish his object . I frankly confess , that I have a deep feeling on this subject . The obligation to communicate serious doubts and fears , about the tendency of any measures so important as those of the American Education Society , I do fully recognize . The privilege of doing it , is an undoubted one . But how shall this be done ? Shall the tocsin of alarm be sounded through the United States ; and all the enemies of religion be set in motion , and have their mouths filled with matter of accusation against the American Education Society ? Thousands will read or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , or to any answer whatever . Is it best to afford matter of clamour to such men ? If the Reviewer had serious objections , why not make them directly to the American Education Society or to its Directors , and have them canvassed in the meeting of the Society , or of the Board ? Is there any ground to suppose , that they would not have received an earnest and respectful attention 1 None . Why then should the public mind be awakened to suspicion , or be agitated about this matter , before it had been canvassed by the Society ? If it be proper to accomplish objects of this nature in such a way , then may such members of the Presbyterian Church as approve of the writer 's views , find hereafter deep reason to regret , that they have sanctioned a principle , which allows all their efforts to endow Seminaries of learning , classic or sacred , to be held up as objects of suspicion and of danger . /z/ But I do believe , I may say , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church never will , and never can , approve either of the reasoning and arguments of the Reviewer , or of the method which he has chosen , in order that they should be felt by the public . Est modus in rebus , A great concern like this should not be transacted by an appeal to popular feeling ; above all , by an appeal which has its basis in a view or facts altogether imperfect , and in many respects entirely erroneous . As a friend of the American Education Society , as a disinterested friend , I feel that this Society has reason to complain of such a proceeding ; and , if I may judge of the sympathies of others who have read the Reviewer 's remarks , I believe its friends will complain aloud , and far and wide too , that justice has not been done the Society , and that it is not guilty of the mistakes laid to its charge , nor any more exposed to future dangers , than every Society and Seminary in the country , and throughout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainness of these remarks , after the plainness with which he has expressed his own views . That they are published to the world , is the necessary result of his own Strictures having been published . Whoever he may be , I honour his talents , and the warmth of his heart in the great and good cause , although I differ widely from him as to some focts , and some principles of reasoning . If any thing which I have said bears hardly upon him , it results from necessity , not from choice . I could not help endeavouring to shew the true result and bearing of his allegations and his reasoning ; and if in doing this , there may now and then be something which presses hard , it is not because I wish it , but because the nature of the case demands it . After all , the American Education Society fear no corfvassing , either in public or in private . They exclaim with one voice , if our cause can not be sustained by appeal to reason and argument , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be sustained , I do most fully believe ; and I have here proffered my feeble aid , to assist in this great object . But I am most fully aware , that neither my aid nor that of all its present friends will be adequate to accomplish and to secure all the important objects which it has in view . To God and the Saviour , I would most sincerely , most devoutly commend it ; and it is my earnest supplication , that the smiles of Heaven may be continually afforded it ; that all its benevolent measures may be blessed ; that its n'iends and its opposers , ( if it should have them ) may yet be united in rejoicing over it as the happy instrument of turning many to righteousness ; and that future generations may rise up and call it blessed . /z/ Thb above letter was written , and forwarded to the Editors of the Biblical Repertory for publication , before the close of last September . After waiting a considerable time beyond the period when the Repertory was expected to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the foregoing letter was found to be accompanied by thirtyseven pages of ** Remarks " upon it , purporting to be made by the Editors . That the Editors of any work have a right to control the manner of its appearance , and to select the matter which it shall contain , is , - in the abstract , a very plain principle , and one which I should be among the last to question . But , after inviting discussion on a point of deep interest to the religious public , and having given in very strong terms their own views respecting it , that they shoiSd refuse to publish a reply which held up to view a different side of the question , and ill such a way as to let it take its course in the same manner as the origi* nal Review had done , the friends of the American Education Society could hardly have expected . The manner of publishing the Remarks in question , however , is a matter of minor importance . The merits of the subject under discueh sion , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public . I have read with great care , dnd more than once , the Remarks of the Editors . After deliberating on the subject , I have satisfied my own mind , that an effort on my part to answer them at lengthy is not called for . The reasons for this I shall state , after taking , a summary view of the Remarks , and making a few observations on the most important topics . In general , the Remarks are merely a repetition and expansion of the thoughts contained in the Review , which is the subject of exami nation in the foregoing letter . The main points and arguments are the same . In both cases , the grounds of objection are , the system of mi* nute and thorough ( iccountability required by the American Elducatioii Society ; the system of parental loaning ; and the mode of organiza Hon adopted by the Society . 1 . The same objections , which had been made by the Reviewer to_the the schedule of accountability required by the American Education Society , are , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jections , if I were designing to make out a full reply , I should havd very litUe to say in addition to what the foregoing letter contains . One thing only I shall notice here , in respect to argument . The Editors say that they do not at all object to accountability ; bat to thi /z/ kind and minuteness of it , as demanded by the American Education Society , p. 609 . By the preceding letter of mine , they were called on to point out any one article in the schedule , which has not an immediate connexion with the evidence that fairly respects either the character or the indigence of a beneficiary . This was reducing the complaint to a question about matter offat , instead of leaving it afloat on the ocean of general terms . But on the matter of fact they have chosen to be silent , while they have reiterated the complaint itself , in a tone still more decided . On p. 607 , the Editors tell us , that ** extreme caution " as to the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully believe . But does not the manner in which a young man expends the resources which are furnished him , ( and furnished , it may be , from the hard earnings of Christians ) , go to make up a part of hu character 7 And how is it possible to judge of this , without any knowledge of particulars 7 And when the Editors suggest , tliat the Examining Committee might do all that is requisite in regard to ascertainr ing the claims of beneficiaries ; do they intend that this shall be done only by general inquiries , or by particular ones 1 If by the latter then what plan is more easy , obvious , and impartial , than that of the schedule ? If by the former , will the donors to the American Education Society be satisfied with such a method of executing their trust 1 But besides all this , Examining Committees are appointed chiefly with the view of placing candidates upon the funds , and not of superintending their future applications for assistance . The local situation of these Committees prevents them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Afler admitting , however , that extreme caution is necessary in regard to the character of beneficiaries , the Editors observe , on the next page , that ' ' the way to make men worthy of confidence , is to treat them with confidence . " But if this confidence consists in a remission of minute accountability , how is ' ' extreme caution " respecting the character of beneficiaries compatible with it 1 Extreme caution necessarily implies minute and circumstantial inquiry ; and if this be a proper matter of umbrage to a beneficiary , in regard to his pecuniary a fairs , will it not be more so , on points of greater delicacy , and in which his feelings are much more deeply concerned 1 Are not all officers of the public , who in any way receive or appropriate monies , minutely accountable ? And yet , is requiring this to be construed as treating them in a manner which shows a want of confidence in them 1 Nothing can be farther from reality . Minute responsibility and the highest degree of confidence may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must go so , through all the gradations of agents , from the highest to the lowest , by the universal laws of civil society . On p. 607 seq. , the Editors represent young men ** of delicate and ingenuous minds , " as shrinking spontaneously from a responsibility such as that which the American Education Society requires ; and they bestow their marked commendations on this characteristic . But when the inquiry presents itself , which very naturally arises , how nine HUNDRED young men should have submitted to the requirements of the /z/ Society , they answer ; " That a sense of duty , and a desire to promote the Redeemer 's kingdom , have Jed them to do this , " p. 610 . This I admit ; but then I have another inquiry to make . If piety has led the NINE HUNDRED youHg men in question to submit to the accountability required by the American Education Society ; then what has led others to refuse such a submission ? Some other principle , it would seem , which must be different from piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hundred young men must be wanting as to a praiseworthy degree of delicacy and ingenuousness , or the others are wanting in piety ; that is , this must be so if the statement and reasoning of the Editors be correct . I might say much on a topic of this nature , for I have a deep feeling of the importance of it . I would ask , whether the pride , independence , and unwillingness to feel obligation , which are natural to the human heart , * are to be palliated , I might even say , justified and encouraged , by being saluted as ingenuousness , and delicacy , and noble mindedness ? But to pursue this question would lead me beyond the boundaries which I have prescribed to myself . I can only say , that if there be any , who prefer a system which is adapted to foster such feelings as those in question , and to encourage young men to shun a responsibility like that which the American Education Society requires , I must be allowed to prefer that " sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which will lead the youth in question cheerfully to submit to such responsibility ; nay , to regard it as a privilege. * I shall notice but one more remark of the Editors under this head . The Reviewer has asserted , that the sum afforded by the American Education Society is not sufficient to meet half the expense of an education in the cheapest College in the United States . To this it was replied in my letter above , that such an assertion does not agree with facts as disclosed by the schedules of the Society . On this the Editors remark ; " We regret that so much of these reports has not been published , as would inform us where these Colleges are to be found , which afford the advantacres of an education on terms so accommodating . " Had the Editors been better acquainted with what the Society has already published , they would have suppressed this remark ; at least , the implication that no such College exists , would have been expressed in more guarded language . In the Appendix to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses of beneficiaries at different Institutions , as ascertained from the schedules of the Society , is mentioned ; from which it appears , that at one respectable College , the amount for board , tuition , and every other expense named by the Editors , instead of being $144 , as the Reviewer 's assertion implied , was * The writer of this Postscript , it would seem , is not alone in his views of this subject . While the Repertory has been publishing its objections , a respectable and entirely independent Education Society , a Society which is second only to the American Education Society in the number of its beneficiaries , has adopted these very Schedules , and required them to be used by all under its patronage . Report of Mass . Baptist Society , for 1829. 3j$ POSTSCRIFT. but $106,22 . At another College , at which bo charge was made tof tuition , ( a privilege which has since been granted in several Colleges ) , the amount was $112 , . The actual expense of an education to beneficiaries , it is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question ; and consequently , the remark of the Reviewer is more incongruous with hci now , than it would have been at that period . 2 . On the subject of loans , the Editors have come out fully with a principle , stated indeed by the Reviewer , but not made so prominent as in the remarks . The doctrine b avowed and advocated ; That the churches are as much obligated to pay salaries to those who are prepay ingfor the ministry , as to pay salaries to pastors . ** Whenever any man devotes his whole time and talents to the service of any conmwbnity , at their request , it is obligatory on that community to provide for his support . " This is the general principle . But this is not the only principle advocated ; if it were , the discussion might be more easily settled . The obligation in question , it is maintained , extends not only to those who are engaged in actual service , but to those who are mer ly preparing to engage in service at some future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the Editors has not been misapprehended , the following extxacts will show . Speaking of the prinp ciple in question , they say ; ' ' It is recognized by every civilized government in the world , in regard to those who are in actual service , amd to those who are preparing for it . If this principle be just , it applies as well to young men preparing for the ministry , as to pastors . We can see no reason , why the support of the one is more a matter of eha rity , than that of the other . " Again , in remarking on the loaning system , they say ; ' ' It b unjust in principle ; as much so , as it would he to make every servant of the civil or religious public , refund their several salaries " pp. 612 , 614 . Of course , the sons of the rich who are preparing for the ministry , are as much entitled to the support of the church , as the sons of the poor ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annuity . This is perfectly clear , unless the Editors will shew us that pastors who possess property of their own , have no right and no claim to salaries . To guard in some measure against this difficulty , they have intimated , that they ' ' should be glad to see the rich preaching the gospel gratuitously ; " and also , that they ** are glad when young men prepare for the ministry at their own expense , " p. 613 . But then , supposing that ministers and students , having a competence , decline to supply the means of support from their own funds , on the ground that * ' the church is bound to support all who devote themselves to her sei vice ; " must not the church grant annuities as much in one case , as in the other ? But even if this difficulty were removed , the principle of the Editors is liable to overwhelming objections . In order to render the argument valid , it must be admitted on the same grounds of reasoning , that all our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of preparation for the service of the public , in whatever capacity , ought to be maintained at thejpii6/tc expense , during Ihe whole term of their preparation- Of course , the youth of all our s P0ST80BIPT. 3 ? Colleges , and of all our profesuonal Schools , whether of law , medieine or divinity , who are praring ht public service , should be maintained from the public treasury , and should each receive a salary adequate to his comfortable support Hold out , then , the proict of salary from early life , to the young men of our country at large , and see what the consequence would 1 , in one year . Why , there would be more statesmen , magistrates , lawyers , physicians , and ( may I not add X ) preachers too , in the bud , than there would be citizens to support * them . Private effort , the great source of individual and of public prosperity , would no more be made by professional men ; and society would sink under its own burdens . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own church . If any doubt , let the experiment be made . Conn mission the agents , and send them forth to the churches with the sped ' jic and avowed object of raising salaries to support young men who are preparing for the ministry , and those who are applied to for the money will decide whether they have so understood the obligations of the church . No Education Society has yet ventured to put Ibrth its claims to public patronage on such grounds . The doctrine advocated by the Editors , is as much opposed to the principles of the Board of ucation of the General Assembly , as it is to those of any other Education Society . That Board declares , as has been stated in the preceding letter , that **duiy to the church , to his younger brethren who seek the same holy office , and to his Saviour , requires that so soon as he the beneficiary able , he should refund the benefaction conferred on him , with interest ; *  --  and in order to impress the obligation more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be furnished with an attested copy of this resolution . ' ' I leave it for the Editors to reconcile this fundamental recognition of duty and obligation by the Assembly 's Board , with the principle avowed in the Repertory , that salary is due to beneficiaries /rom the church , instead of their owing the sum ex* pended on their education to the church . If this can not be done , ( and certainly it can not ) , then I appeal to the public to say , whether an objection , which , if raised at all , is common to Education Societies generally , can with fairness be represented as belonging exclusively to the American Education Society ? I have another remark to make on this part of the subject . The exemption of beneficiaries from all feelings of gratitude , by teaching them to look on their pecuniary supplies , as a debt due to them on the part of the church , would probably have an influence over the minds of the young , that would be of a fearful nature . What would more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of that species of independence which refuses gratitude and subordination than measures like those which the Editors recommend ? I think I may venture to predict , that neither the Board of the ' Assembly , nor the American Education Society , will relinquish the just and excellent sentiments , which they have alike professed on this part of the subject ; and that the churches can not be persuaded into measures of a nature so entirely opposite , as those recommended in the Repertory . The question . In what manner indigent young men of piety shall /z/ be assisted in obtaining an education for the ministry t seems to me to be intimately connected with the question , What shall he the future character of the ministry itself , for purity , for energy , and for self denial ? Were this the time and place , it would not be difficult to shew , that to principles like what the American Education Society h ? e adopted , and to the salutary discipline which such principles have ex- . erted , the church is indebted ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eveiy age . To this class belong most of that noble band of missionaries , whose labours have of late years , by the blessing of Crod , changed the aspect of large portions of the Pagan world . To the same class belong many of the ablest and most successful ministers and pastors , now on the stage in our own country ; men who , in obtaining an education for the ministry , would have felt themselves " rich , " ( as one of their number has expressed it ) , could they have enjoyed the facilities of a pecuniary nature , which are now afforded by the American Education Society . Neither the Reviewer , nor the Editors have done justice to the Board of Directors , in their observations on this part of the subject . The obvious misapprehension of the former , in stating the principal reasons which led the Board to adopt the system of loans instead of a system of entire charity is pointed out in the preceding letter . The Editors refuse to admit the correction , and say , they * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from the smaliness of the loan , and not from the loan itself , that the Directors anticipated a happy influence on the CHARACTER of those they patronize. "  --  Here the reader will recollect , that the question is not , what were the reasons which led the Directors to fix upon a small loan , instead of a large one ? but what was the principal reason for adopting the system of loaUy in any form , in preference to a system of charity ? And although the Editors " will not waste words on this point , " but leave their readers to look after the Report to which reference had been made and judge for themselves , I must be permitted to lay the extract itself before the reader , that he may judge how far the assertion of the Editors is correct . ** It is because the Directors , after much experience , are convinced that it will exert a more happy influence upon the character of those whom they patronize , and render the Society more extensively and permanently useful , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loans , instead of gifts . Experience shows , that dependence on charity is not only a painful lesson for noble and independent minds to learn , but , in some cases , a dangerous one . Not a few who have taken the deepest interest in the prosperity of Education Societies , have looked with apprehension to the ultimate influence of a system of entirely charitable education , upon the energy and devotedness of the Christian ministry . It has been often observed , that those who have " been compelled to rely chiefly upon their own efforts , in obtaining an education , have acquired a strength of character which has eminently qualified them for usefulness in after life , and proved a full remuneration for all their toil and self denial . It is natural that those who are familiar with instances of this kind , should express soliitude when motives to personal effort are taken away . Besides , it is /q/ possible that the door to the ministry may be opened so wide , and access to it so easy , as to prove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way greatly to endanger the purity and safety of the church , " 11th Report , pp. 20 , 21 . Thus far the Directors proceed in stating the reasons which have led them to adopt the system of loan , in preference to a system of charity . The reader will decide whether character be not the principal reason , as stated in my letter above . They next consider the influence of the loan in connection with the smallness of the sum granted ; and they infer , that similar effects may be produced by this also upon the character and efforts of young men . But the smallness of the loan , as I before observed , is not the point in debate . I perceive that I am unconsciously becoming engaged to make out a full reply ; which is what I Lave , on the whole , thought it not necessary for me to attempt . I shall therefore pass over this branch of the subject by remarking only , that I can most cheerfully submit the question at issue , to the sober and enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been already very widely expressed . Since the preceding letter was written , documents have been published from which it appears , that three Education Societies , viz. the Massachusetts Baptist , and the Societies under the direction of the Synod of Virginia , and of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod , have all declared in favour of the principle of loan . These are in addition to the examples quoted in my letter ; and they are so many independent testimonies in favour of the system of the American Education Society , from enlightened members of three religious denominations . While such testimonies are spontaneously afforded by Christians of difTere n't denominations , and living in widely distant parts of the country , who can doubt what the general voice of the community is , in relation to this subject 1 3 . Another , and a fruitful topic of remark with the Editors , as it was with the Reviewer , is the organization of the American Education Society , and the power which , in consequence of its permanent funds , and the system of loans , this mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few . On this point , I have no doubt the public mind will be satisfied , whenever the subject comes to be fully understood . The same reasons which have decided me to take only a summary viey of other Remarks made by the Editors , will render it necessary that I should be very brief here ; but the principles and facts upon which the whole discussion turns , and upon which the decision of the religious public must ultimately rest , may be compressed within narrow limits . These I shall endeavour to state . First , then , the intelligent reader will perceive , that much which the Editors say under this head , depends entirely , for its effect , upon their objections to the loaning system . If these fail of being supported , the remarks growing merely out of them can have no weight . Besides , if money is to be refunded , whether it be in the way prescribed by the Board of Education of the General Assembly , or in any other method , the power to receive and appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Society has no /z/ more concern with the Remarks on this point , than all other Edocai tion Societies which have adopted the principle of refunding . In the next place , as it regards the accumulation of power in the hands of a few , in consequence of monies refunded , and the income of permanent scholarships , the following /ac5 , in connection with what I have said in the preceding letter respecting checks , will enable the reader to form his own opinion of the merits of the question . One of these facts is , that with the exception of those cases where a donor chooses to prescribe a different method , all monies refunded form a part of the contingent , and not of the permanent fund ; and they are , fbre , expended as fast as received . Of course , there can be no aceiH mulation from this source , any more than from other contingent funds . Another fact is , that a part only of what is appropriated to ben ficiaries , can be reminded ; inasmuch a9 the Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numerous class of young men , such as missionaries , and others , who , with a bare support , devote themselves to self denying labors for the benefit of the church . These ; it is to be hoped , will be greatly multiplied , as the work of evangelizing the world advances . But their increase must necessarily diminnh the amount of money , to be refunded by the beneficiaries of Educar tion Societies . Another fact is , that monies refunded by beneficiaries of Branch Societies , are pledged , by a recent vote , to the Branch Societies by whom the money was appropriated , to be used by them in the same manner as other funds raised within their limits . In my letter , I expressed an opinion that such an arrangement would be cheerfully entered into by the Board of the Parent Society ; inasmuch as their measures have uniformly been distinguished by an enlarged and liberal policy , and they could not be supposed , as yet , to have had occasioil to act on this subject , the whole system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard this ' * concession , " as they are pleased to term it , ' ' worth all the attention which they have paid to the subject . " I am happy that their labour can be so easily recompensed . The reader , however , will decide whether the resolution of the Board , does not , as stated in my letter , " remove even the semblance of the difficulty which the Reviewer suggests . " The following is the resolution , as published in the Quarterly Register and Journal ; Voted , that monies refunded by beneficiaries , appropriations to whom shall have been made by a Branch Society , shall hereafter be pledged to the Branch Society by which the money was appropriated , in the same manner as is now provided for in regard to other funds raised within the limits of Branch Societies . Another fact to be noticed in this connection , is , that the entire permanent fund of the American Education Society is small . Thus it appears from the last annual Report of the Treasurer , that the whole amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f 4812d,58 . Compare this with the amount vested in the same description of funds , at the single Seminary of Princeton . From the minutes of the last General Assembly it appears , ( and for one , I rejoice in the fact ) , that the number of scholarships belonging to that Seminaf /q/ J is NiNBTBBN , ( not sixteen as I stated in my note ) , which , at $2500 for each scholarship , amount to $47,500 ; i. e. within less than seven hundred dolltLts of the whole sum , which has yet been paid to the Scholarship fund of the American Education Society . And yet the funds of this latter Society are held for the benefit of young men , in nearly every evangelical Seminary and College in the United States . Nor are all these funds subject to the Board of the Parent Society ; for the income of scholarships raised within the limits of Branch Societies , is pledged to such Branch Societies , as has been repeatedly mentioned before . At the same date with the above , the Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining Permanent Fund to be $26143,79 . If now , as the Editors say , the permanent funds of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions are ** so insignificant that they could hardly live a month without the contributions of the Christian community , ' ' ( which is undoubtedly true ) , pray , how large are the permanent funds of the American Education Society , and how long could they live and redeem their pledges to 400 young men pursuing their studies at 60 or 70 Institutions , with no resources but what they are able to derive from permanent funds , and from monies refunded by beneficiaries ? * Let these facts be considered , and I willingly leave it for the candid and Enlightened of every community to determine , whether a Society , like the American Education Society , surrounded with numerous checks , with an income from permanent funds and loans which is insufficient , even if its most favourable anticipations should be realized , to cover one half of its expenditures , and pledged to assist young men of suitable character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , is likely to become " independent of public opinion " and patronage , as the Editors of the Repertory suppose . The withdrawing of thai patronage , for six months , would absolutely paralyze the Society , and spread embarrassment and distress among the hundreds of young men who are depending upon its funds . Thus far I have confined my remarks to the subject o funds , A few words now , in regard to the mode of organization which the American Education Society has adopted . Two objects are to be aimed at in all well organized bodies ; efficiency , and security against future perversion . That the organization of the American Education Society is well adapted to secure the first of these objects , even the Editors of the Repertory will probably allow . That it is equally well adapted to the last , admits of as clear proof , as any proposition which is supported by probable evidence . For , granting , as the Editors do , that those who now compose the voting members of the American Education Society are enlightened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as reported , at their late meeting , including foundations for the support of officers , is $73067 , 58 . The whole amount of permanent funds , including scholarships reported by the American Education Society at the last annual meeting is $74273,37 . It should be mentioned , also , that the income of $20,000 of the general permanent fund of the American Education Society , is appropriated to the support of officers , until other means can be specially provided for this end . /z/ good men , to whom the community may safely confide important terestSy the simple question at issue is , Whether such a body of men is mare Ukely to err in choosing its successors and those who are to man ' age its concerns , than bodies depending upon popular election and con " tmuaUy varying their aspect 1 On this subject , what do the corporations of nearly all our Cceges and Seminaries speak ? The interest felt concerning the late decision of the Supreme Court of the United States , in the case of Dartmouth College , will answer this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilized world has settled in the appointment of the higher officers of justice . Why is it , that the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions deserves to be characterized , in the strong language of the Editors , as an Institution ' * of all others a ferding perhaps the least temptation to abuse ? " They choose their successors , and the community very confidently and justly expect , that they will choose men of like views and like spirit with themselves . The Reviewer has referred to Cambridge as an unhappy instance of the perversion of funds ; but did he know when he made the reference , that Cambridge was wanting in the very arrangement for its trusts which the American Education Society has made ? The Board of Overseers of Harvard College , when it changed its character , had not the right of electing its own members , but depended upon popular election . The pastors of the six neighbouring towns ( including Boston ) together with the Councillors and Senators of the State chosen annually , were ex officio members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different character to the College , when a majority of them departed from the faith of their fathers . I might appeal to other cases ; but the principle is too obvious to require illustration . So long as the maxim holds true , in the moral as well as natural world , that like causes are adapted to produce Uke effects , so long human experience and human testimony will decide , in favour of the mode of organization which the American Education Society has adopted , as best suited to guard permanent funds of any kind against future perversion . It were easy to show , that the very thing on which the Editors place their ultimate reliance for safety , in regard to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , viz. popular annual election , ( supf ) Osing the church in general should become corrupt , and that this is possible , the history of the church in past ages affords sufficient proof ) , would of itself be a most terrible engine of evil , and a most formidable obstacle in the way of reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities of the Presbyteries from * ' changing the doctrines and discipline of the Presbyterian church , " and throwing all its funds , Seminaries , and every thing else pertaining to it , into the hands of the enemies of evangelical truth ? The Editors and the Reviewer seem to have no fear of the future perversion of this mighty power in the hands of the General Assembly ; and they challenge a comparison of its mode of organization , with that of the American Education Society . Comparisons of this nature are always to be avoided , if possible lest they should seem to be invidious . Biat /q/ - ince the subject is forced upon my attention , I hope I may be allowed to inquire , without being supposed to be unfriendly to the Presbyterian Church , Where lies the ultimate security against perversion , accoiding to the Constitution of that Church 1 Tbe Reviewer and the Editors both build their hopes upon the annual election of Commissioners to the General Assembly by the Presbyteries , But how are the ' byteries constituted ? The Book of Discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders , within a particular jurisdiction . " By whom are these pastors and elders chosen ? The same authority answers , that di pastor is to be chosen by " the electors of the congregation , " over which he is to be settled . And how are the ruling elders to be chosen ? Why , ** every congregation shall elect persons to the o fice of ruling elders ; " and the mode of election is to be ' * the most approved and in use in that congregation . ' ' ( Form of Gov. and Dis . Chap . XII . and XIV . Now the congregation consists of tfiose who are church memllers , and of those who are not ; and nearly always , to say the least , the latter exceeds the former in point of ntimhers . The power , then , of electing those who are to determine what men shall constitute the General Assembly , lies ultimately in the hands of the CONGREGATION ; i. e. as the Book of Discipline explains it , the pew holders or proprietors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public worship ) , a majority of whom , in most instances , are not professors of religion . The church aw such , and by her separate vote , elects neither her pastors nor her ruling elders . Will it be said , now , that those who are to be elected , must be members of the church , and give their assent to the Confession of Faith ; so that church membership and the creed become a check upon the congregation , i. e. upon the world ? I answer , this may be ; and it is equally true , also , that it may happen otherwise . To confirm this , I bring the testimony of the Editors themselves , in a previous article of the very number of the Repertory in question , who tell us , that ' The Lutherans have their Confession of Augsburgh : the English Church , their Thirty-nine Articles ; the Scotch and the French Cal* vinists have a Confession still more extended and minute : but the Zitftherans are Neologists ; the English are Arminians ; the Scotch have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arminians ; and tha French , as a church , have now , if we are rightly informed , no creed at all . Philosophy , as it is called , has produced these changes . And it is not in human wisdom effectually to guard against them . We see corresponding changes taking place , even in the best constituted churches in this country . Our own denomination the Presbyterian Church affords a very striking instance of this kind , ' ' p. 490 . The Editors have said much about what is possible in regard to the future character and fate of the American Education Society . It is possible , I admit , that ' * eleven men " of corrupt or sectarian views may , at some future time , constitute a majority of the members present at an annual meeting of the American Education Society , and may take advantage of their accidental ascendency to change the Constitution , and to elect hundreds of men into the Society of like character with themselves ; and all this may take place in a way so sudden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members will not have taken the alarm in time to prevent the mischief . But surely the Editors will not now deny , that it is possible , ( must they not admit it to be even probable ? ) that , at some future period , the world may break through the slender barrier of a Confession of Faith , and elect pastors and elders for the Presbyterian churches , who will give her tears to drink , instead of the water of life ; and who will commission men to represent them in the General Assembly , with whom those now on the stage , and who for the present annually constitute that venerable body , would refuse to hold communion for an hour . When that gloomy day comes , then who shall wield the vast and accumulating power which is subservient to the will of the General Assembly ?  --  a power which has at its disposal , seminaries , professors , students , funds , and every other means of influence pertaining to a denomination , wealthy , powerful , and spread over all parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights by parish influence , ( that very influence which now elects the pastors and elders of the Presbyterian church ) , and looking in vain for protection to Confessions of Faith , and long established usages , once fully acknowledged as valid even by the civil power , afford a lesson of admonition on this subject , which should never  --  never be forgotten . It would be easy to enlarge ; but this would draw me aside from the course , which , on the whole , I have thought it my duty to pursue . Some passages in the remarks of the Editors , not immediately connected with the foregoing heads of discussion , claim attention . On these I shall make a few observations , and then bring my remarks to a close , P. 616 , the Editors intimate , that because the salaries of ministers in this country must , in the great majority of cases , be small , therefore the ability to refund can not exist , except in a very limited degree ; and consequently that the principles of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , that I ' ' appear strangely to have forgotten " my own remark on this subject , in arguing that young men of good talents may , with proper diligence and economy , return into the Treasury of the Society what they have received . To this , it is sufficient to reply , that ability to refund , has ordinarily quite as much connexion with economy , as with the amount of salary received . Many whose salary is barely sufficient to meet their wants , even with " the strictest economy , " have nevertheless found the means of cancelling every debt contracted for their education , by prudent management ; and , especially , by not injudiciously increasing their responsibilities , as soon as they have entered upon their public labours . How often has this been done by the indigent young men of talents , in other professions , whose efforts no Education Society ever aided or encouraged 1 If there be any one particular reason , why the American Education Society should maintain the principles which they have adopted , this is one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his letter , quoted by me , p. 23 , as a reason for preferring a system of loans to a system of donations , viz. that , in a country like ours , the people , if supplied at all , must be supplied by ministers who can live on small salaries ; and that it is wise to raise up men /z/ who can so live . Compare now the salary system of educating students in a course of preparation for the ministry , ( so earnestly recommended by the Editors ) , and the system adopted by the American Education Society ; and can there be a doubt , which of them is best calculated to promote such an object ? The Editors more than intimate , in several places , that the power which the American Education Ssciety possesses , is a power to control the place of education to which every student shall go ; and consequently , to control their principles and views of theology , as well as to build up , or pull down , any Seminary or College . But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all its operations , is impartiality/ and uniformity , in regard to its treatment of young men and Institutions ; and which has encountered no small amount of objection and prejudice , in consequence of adhering inviolably to this broad and catholic principle , and extending it to different evangelical denominations ? And this , too , when the American Education Society is the only Education Society in the United States , which is known to have acted on the same broad and catholic ground . If , in any instances , " the friends and officers of its tributaries and Branches " have departed from this principle , ( as the Editors say ) , let the cases be point ' ed out , and the Society will doubtless use whatever influence they possess , to guard against a recurrence of the same evil in future . But let not the Society be charged with doing , or attempting to do , what they utterly disclaim in their fundamental rules of proceeding , and what they , as at present constituted , have no lawful " power " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academies , twenty-three Colleges , and ten Theological Seminaries , in which have been aided nine hundred young men , the natives of almost every State of the Union , including individuals of fve or six evangolical denominations ; all this , too , by funds obtained chiefly from one denomination , and I may add , from one State ; ought not such facts to shield the Society against imputations of local or sectarian perversion ? The causes which led to its formation , and which have produced its enlarged and truly Christian policy , are to be traced to higher and more benevolent views of the wants of our country and of the world , than pertain to a sectarian spirit . The Editors have taken much pains ( pp. 626  --  629 ) , to shew that what I have said respecting some assertions of the Reviewer relative to the unrestrained power of the Parent Society over all funds in its treasury , is irrelevant , and therefore require no answer at all . But what are the assertions of the Reviewer ? Not merely , that monies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are placed " entirely beyond the reach of the Branches . " It was proved , if I mistake not , that this is not a just view of the case ; and numerous checks were pointed out , which were intended to prevent the evils referred to by the Reviewer . In what other way should assertions of this nature have been answered ? Every candid reader , on comparing the two articles , will be competent to judge . I might go on to comment , in a similar manner , on many other passages ; but it is unnecessary . I shall notice but one more remark of the kind to which I now refer . /z/ On p. 635 , the Editors , after disapproving the methods pursued bj the American Education Society , tn regard to the establishment of permanent scholarships &c.,; say ; ' ' Our mode of carrying the same principle into effect , is to collect all the money which the Christian public is able and willing to give for the purpose , and to expend it imr mediately in educating youth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Society can surely have no objection , since it is the mode which they have most commonly practised . But do the Editors mean to say , that this is the only or the principal method which has been pursued , at the distinguished Seminary in their neigh* bourhood , and with which some of them are connected ? Where then are the nearly hfly thousand dollars invested for the benefit of that Seminary , in permanent scholarships 7 Have the funds thus raised for charitable purposes , * ' been all expended immediately , ' ' so soon as received ; or , has only the interest been applied ? A word , on the defence made by the Editors of the manner in which the attack was commenced upon the American Education Society , and I have done . The Editors entirely mistake , if they suppose that the friends of the Society wish to ' * hush up " the subjects under discussion . They , as well as all others , may rest assured , that from whatever quarter serious objections may come , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to suppress them , even when they might wish the manner in which they are made to be different . Having no end in view but the highest good of the Redeemer 's kingdom , they only wish to know the best way in which this can be accomplished , and they will feel themselves bound to adopt it ; and this , whether they come to the knowledge of their duty by open rebuke , or by private conference and kindly admonition . But the abstract right to attack openly a benevolent Society like the one in question , and to make a public impeachment of its measures , does not prove , and can not prove , that Christian confidence and fraternal regard are not due to it . I can not help feeling , that an attack of such a nature , and on the ground of such a right , is one of those cases , in which civilians would say , Summumjus , summa injuria . The Editors say , " We might as well have placed our objections in the fire , as presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , in different parts of their remarks , they intimate that the objections , which they bring forward against the American Education Society , are so forcible , so plain , and so convincing to all men of candour , that none of this character can refuse to feel their weight . What sort of men , then , must the ** Board " be , before whom objections so plain would do no more good than if they were " placed in the fire ? " And are these the men , too , of whom the Reviewer , from his personal acquaintance with some of the Directors , and from information obtained concerning them all , has said , ( and the Editors tell us they are not disposed to call these assertions in question ) ; " We believe them to be as pure in their intentions , as single in their purpose , and as devoted to the cause of evangelical piety , as any men on earth ; and we disclaim any knowledge of a single act in their management of this great charity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And again ; ' ' As long as the Directors remain such as we believe they now are , intelligent , active , and devoted to the cause of evangelical doctrine and piety , every thing which the interests of the church and of the world demand , will be done , " p. 361 , 364 . I do not know to which of the Directors objections against the American Education Society may have been made , as the Editors declare ; nor whether the Secretary may not have heard the doubts of some men expressed , in regard to the measures of the Society . But this I know , that neither Directors nor Secretary have felt , that they had a right to expect a sudden and public attack ; least of all , have they anticipated this , from any objections before made on the points exhibited with most prominence , by the articles published in the Repertory . I may ask , moreover , have not the Editors themselves suggested an important reason , why the mode of attack resorted to by them and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace or to the prosperity of the church ? On p. 632 they say , and very justly ; " There is no subject on which jealousies are so likely to arise , as respecting the education of young men for the ministry . ' ' Could any thing now be better suited to produce such a result , than the manner which has been adopted in the Repertory of attacking the American Education Society ? The present organization and measures of the Society have not been adopted without long deliberation , and faithful exertion to learn , as widely as possible , the views of the Christian community . The objects of the Society are , by the Reviewer and the Editors , acknowledged to be excellent ; the management of it able , and , as far as Christian intentions are concerned , correct . I may add , too , that it has expended fourteen years of great labour , and ceaseless effort , in order to accomplish its objects ; and that the acting members of it have made sacrifices , which few if any of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , none but the great Head of the Church will fully estimate . In this state of things , to be publicly impeached , and held up as an object of terror and suspicion , was not what was expected . Is it wise , in such a day as this , to adopt a course which is calculated to divide and distract the churches , and to set those who really love the Saviour at variance with each other ; and all this , while the common enemy is pressing on all evangelical churches , and endeavouring to overthrow them ? All this , too , while the world is perishing for lack of vision , and millions have none to break to them the bread of life ? How easy , now , for any man , without claim to any thing more than a mediocrity of talent , to make an appeal that should excite the jeal ' ousies of the east and the west , of the north and the south , in regard to the " power which is necessarily confided to each and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with Christian wisdom , and kindness , and propriety ? If brethren honestly differ in their views of conducting these Societies , is it not on all accounts preferable , that the strife be , to " show a more excellent way , " by each endeavouring to hold up the light of a holier , and brighter , and more /z/ energetic example of benevolent action ? Wlien this is done , those who ore wandering may see the error of their wajs ; and until it bo done , tJiose who tlirongh denial , and high and strenuous and long continued effort , arc striving to save the perishing souls of men , are entitled to sometliing different from being made the objects of suspicion and jealousy . But I hasten to bring tiiese observations to a close , by briefly stating my reasons tor declining to enter into a more extended examination of the Remarks of the Editors . The fear that the present discussion may come to be a real controversy is one reason why I decline a continuance of it . In addition to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to leave me no time for a controversy on a subject foreign to them , however important . At least , I can not go any further than I have already gone , without neglecting previous and paramount obligations . A third reason is , that should further discussion be judged necessary or expedient , the subjects in question ( not the controversy ) will be discussed by another writer , who is mure thoroughly acquainted than myself with all the principles , and rules , and business of the American Education Society , and in whose candour , sound judgement , and ability to discuss , the public may reasonably put great confidence . A fourth reason for not pursuing the subject is , that having , for a lone time , been in the habit of the most brotherly and confidential intercourse with some gentlemen , whom I suppose to be amonf the Editors of the Biblical Repertory , and cherishing towards them most unfeigned respect , confidence , and fraternal afibction , it would be a sacrifice to which nothing but the most imperious duty would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dispute ; for dispute , unhappily , seems now to be the next stop , if indeed it be not alreadj begun . I may also add , that I have given my name to the public , and thus stand directly and avowedly responsible for all that I say ; but the Reviewer , and the writer who comes forward in the name of the ' Editors , " have declined doing this , and , consequently , have shunned to meet the discussion on equal terms m responsibility . My last reason for declining to protract the discussion beyond its present limits , is one of which I must leave my readers to judic . In various parts of the Remarks , there occur expressions of the following nature ; ' ' We might as well have placed our objections in the fire as presented them to the Board , " p . G03 ; which has already been noticed . So again ; ' This appears very muen like throwing dust in the reader 's eyes , " p. 609 . ' But unless we are greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admission of facts not fully substantiated , " p . G24 . ' We are not the only persons who write about important concerns without correct information , " p. 6iil . " We were obliged to show how far his arguments were from reaching the point , and how little we were disposed to take dicta for proof , " p . G38 . Of these and the like expressions , by no means sparsely scattered over the Remarks of the Editors , the public are competent judges . They will probably see in them some reasons for my fears that controyersy is near at hand , if the subject be farther pursued in its present attitude ; and also a good reason why I should decline to pursue it , when it is assuming a form like this . Ever since I entered on public life , and engaged in polemics of any kind , it has been my fixed resolution , when any thing of this nature begins to develope itself , to decline further discussion ; because I have a full apprehension , that no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the present case , for departing from this resolution . I take my leave , therefore , of the discussion in question , sincerely hoping that I have not given occasion for the public to censure the manner u they do not approve the matter j of what I have published . But should they disapprove of eitner , or of both , I only stand responsible ; the American Education Society are gailtless . As my name appears before the world , they will know whom to censure . If it be not an evidence of a man 's cavtion , to be thus open in the cause which he pleads , it is at least some evidence of the sincerity of his opinion , and of his full persuasion that it can be honestly supported . A cause that will fully bear examination , needs no concealment .
