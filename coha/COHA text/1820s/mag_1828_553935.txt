txt ART . 11. - The history of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England , to which is added an Historical View of the Affairs of ireland . By EDWARD EARL OF CLARENDON . A new Edition , exhibiting a faithful Collation of the original MS. ; with all the suppressed Passages ; also the unpublished Notes of Bishop Warburton . Oxford , at the Clarendon Press . Reprinted by Wells &amp; Lilly , Boston . WE shall make no apology for the few remarks we have to offer , on the appearance of the first American edition of The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars . ' The demand for books of this description is one of the best proofs of the progress of good taste , and the spirit of inquiry . It is in the works of contemporary writers that tr&amp;e history is to be found and this of Lord Clarendon is most valuable of its kind ; whether we consider the importance of the events treated of , their peculiar relation to the early history of our own country , or the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults is admitted ; but in the very admission is implied no small compliment to the author , since , in spite of them , it is universally acknowledged to be one of the noblest works in our language . His diction , ' says Johnson , is neither exact , nor in itself suited to the purpose of history . It is the effusion of a mind crowded with ideas , and desirous of imparting them ; affd therefore always accumulating words , and involving one clause and sentence in another . But there is in his negligence a rude , inartificial majesty , which , without the nicety of labored elegance , swells the mind by its plenitude and diffusion . His narration is not perhaps sufficiently rapid , being stopped too frequently by particularities , which , though they might strike the author who was present at the transactions , will not equally detain the attention of posterity . But his ignorance or carelessness of the art of writing , is amply compensated by his knowledge of nature and of policy ; the wisdom of his maxims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctness , and strength of his characters . ' However we may be disposed to agree in the truth of these remarks , there are serious defects in Lord Clarendon 's History , as we shall presently show , which the political bias of Johnson led him to overlook . The particularities , ' which he thinks objectionable , do not appear so to us , excepting perhaps in a few instances . On the contrary , one of the great charms of the // history , consists in the vivacity , and even humor , with which this great man dilates on the personal adventures of himself and his friends . The object of history , ' says Voltaire , is the human mind ; and if the work before us be examined by this standard , it will be found that these episodes are full of the most useful as well as delightful matter . We see in them , not only the hearts of other men , but that of the historian himself , laid open to our view . What true lover of history would willingly give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colchester , or of the truly romantic siege and capture of Pontefract Castle , or the curious details of the exiled Charles 's little court , where many a politician may read his own character , and many a family its own history ? Still more highly do we value those effusions of tenderness which the author pours out , whenever he has occasion to deplore the loss of a friend in the contests of that dreadful period . His description of the character and death of Lord Falkland is not surpassed in any language . Never did a friend more faithfully fulfil the duties of friendship , and never was a character more deserving of such devotion . Led on by his feelings , the historian runs out into many little details and anecdotes , which at once illustrate the character he is describing , and do honor to the goodness of his own heart . The reader , yielding to the irresistible force of genius , is carried back to the time and place of action . He sees Lord Falkland in the House of Commons , urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it is resolved to decide the contest by arms , he seems to watch his manly form , wasting with anxiety and distress for the fate of his country ; he hears his perpetual and mournful ejaculation of ' Peace , Peace . ' He marks the alacrity with which he prepares for the fatal battle , goes with him to the field , sees him fall before his eyes ; and for the moment forgets , even the cause he espoused , in sympathy with his fate . It may be worth while to stop for a moment to compare this character with that of Hambden , an equally great and virtuous man of the opposite party , as drawn by the same hand . It is curious in this latter character , to observe the force of prejudice contending in the mind of the historian with a sense of justice and the love of truth . Dr Warburton truly observes , in a note on the character of Hambden , that while the author applies to him in conclusion what was said of Cinna , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hand to execute any // mischief , ' every line shows that tbe historian believed him to he a man of honor and virtue , acting on wrong principles . There is a singular train of resemblance running through the fortunes and characters of these two interesting and ill-fated individuals . They were both distinguished by birth and fortune ; Lord Falkland being allied to the greatest names in the kingdom ; and Hambden , as Lord Clarendon tells us , of an ancient family and fair estate in the county of Buckingharn . ' They were both men of great bravery and accomplishments , distinguished talents , and most winning address . They were both remarkable for a certain frankness and openness of demeanor , as well towards those they despised , as those they esteemed . What is said of Lord Falkiand in this particular , is also true of Hambden , as appears from his well known course of conduct . Of the former the following characteristic anecdote is related by lord Clarendon . The truth is , as he was of a most incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to good , and worthy , and entire men ; so he was naturally ( which could not but be more evident in his place , which objected him to another conversation and intermixture than his own election had done ) adversus malos injucunclus ; and was so ill a dissembler of his dislike and disinclination to ill men , that it was not possible for such not to discern it . There was once , in the House of Commons , such a declared acceptation of the good service an eminent member had done to them , and , as it was said , to the whole kingdom , that it was moved , he being present , " that the speaker might , in the name of the whole House , give him thanks ; " " and then , that every member might , as a testimony of his particular acknowledgment , stir or move his hat towards him ; " the which ( though not ordered ) when very many did , the Lord Falkland ( who believed the service itself not to be of that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stooped to it for any recompense ) , instead of moving his hat , stretched both his arms out , and clasped his hands together upon the crown of his hat , and held it close down to his head ; that all men might see how odious that flattery was to him , and the very approbation of the person , though at that time most popular . ' To pursue the comparison ; the difference between them in political opinions is by no means so great , as the circumstance of their both meeting death , the one in the king 's army , the other in that of the parliament , would seem to indicate . In this , as in every other revolution , the shades of difference in // opinion are as various as the characters of individuals . In the early part of the long parliament , as in the preceding one , Hambden was remarkable for mildness and moderation . This , of course , is imputed by different writers to different motives . That he was sincere , may be inferred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he was among those members accused by the king of high treason , he was much altered , his nature and carriage seeming much fiercer than it did before . ' This the historian sets down to deliberate design , and his former dispassionate conduct , to observation that the season was not ripe , rather than that he approved the moderation . ' An unprejudiced writer would have adopted the obvious solution , that the absurd conduct of the king in the impeachment of the five members , satisfied Hambden , as well as every other clearsighted man , that the die was cast , and that either the king or themselves must be reduced by force . As Hambden in the first stages of the dispute , excited the distrust of his party by attempting , to use lord Clarendon 's expression , to moderate and soften the violent and distempered humors , ' so the Lord Falkland , as the same historian tells us , by some sharp expressions he used against the archbishop of Canterbury , and his concurring in the first bill to take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave occasion to some to believe , and opportunity to others to conclude , that he was no friend to the church and the established government . ' He further says , The great opinion he had of the uprightness and integrity of those persons who appeared most active , especially of Hambden , kept him from suspecting any design against the peace of the kingdom , and though he differed from them commonly in conclusion , he believed long their purposes were honest . ' It is worth observing upon how slight a difference in the outset these two disinterested lovers of their country were driven to take arms against each other ; and to complete the parallel between them , if any thing were wanting to add to the horrors of civil war , it is the reflection that two such men , formed to esteem and respect each other , to walk hand in hand in a noble emulation for the good of their country and the happiness of mankind , should each have fallen in arms against his own countrymen , in a petty skirmish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus related by lord Clarendon in describing the engagement of Chaigrave Field . And one of the prisoners who had been taken in the action said , // " he was confident Mr Hambden was hurt , for he saw him ride off the field before the action was done , which he never used to do , and with his head hanging down , and resting his hands upon the neck of his horse ; " by which he concluded he was hurt . But the news of the next day made the victory much more important than it was thought to have been . There was full information brought of the great loss the enemy had sustained in their quarters , by which three or four regiments were utterly broken and lost . The names of many officers , of the best account , were known , who were either killed upon the place , or so hurt as there remained little hope of their recovery ; of which Mr Hambden was one , who would not stay that morning till his own regiment came up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were upon their march , and was the principal cause of their precipitation , contrary to his natural temper , which , though full of courage , was usually very xvary ; but now carried on by his fate , he would by no means expect the general 's coming up ; and he was of that universal authority , that no officer paused in obeying him . And so , in the first charge , he received a pistol shot in the shoulder , which broke the bone , and put him to great torture ; and after he had endured it about three weeks or less time , he died to the most universal grief of parliament that they could have received from any accident . ' The death of Lord Falkiand , in an action near Glocester , occurred shor.tly afterwards , in the same year . In the morning before the battle , ' says Lord Clarendon , as always upon action , he was very cheerful , and put himself in the first rank of the Lord Byron 's regiment , who was then advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides with musketeers ; from whence he was shot with a musket in the lower part of the belly , and in the instant falling from his horse , his body was not found till the next morning , till when there was some hope he might have been a prisoner ; though his nearest friends , who knew his temper , received small comfort from that imagination . Thus fell that incomparable young man , in the four and thirtieth year of his age , having so much despatched the business of life , that the oldest rarely attain to that immense knowledge , and the youngest enter not into the world with more innocence . Whosoever leads such a life , need not care upon how short warning it be taken from him . ' Our regret at the untimely fall of Falkland and Hambden is lessened , when we call to mind , that the former was spared the disgrace and ruin which overwhelmed his party ; while the latter was taken away before those clouds arose , which soon after veiled the hopes of the friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced on succeeding events , it is useless now to conjecture . We have been the more minute in following out this parallel , as it illustrates not only the characters of the two individuals , but the progress of public opinion in the course of the dispute between the king and the parliament . At the opening of the long parliament , the discontent caused by the arbitrary and illegal conduct of the king and his ministers was universal . The impeachment of the Earl of Strafford , which may be considered as the declai*ation of hostilities , was carried in the House of Commons by an unanimous vote . No fact can more clearly speak out the state of public feeling . A most able and powerful minister , possessing , besides his great personal accomplishments , the highest favor with his sovereign , and the fullest assurance of his protection , is impeached in an unusually full house , without one dissenting voice . Save only , ' says Clarendon , that the Lord Falkland ( who was well known to be far from having any kindness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present accusing him of high treason , modestly desired the house to consider , " whether it would not suit better with the gravity of their proceedings , first to digest many of those particulars which had been mentioned by a committee ; ( declaring himself abundantly satisfied that there was enough to charge him ; ) before they sent up to accuse * To this a decisive answer was given by Mr Pym , that the delay would be fatal , as the earl would either persuade the king to dissolve the parliament , or make his escape , and thus frustrate their design . Even Mr Hume , in speaking of the state of opinions at this juncture , has the following remarks . So little apology would be received for past measures , so contagious the general spirit of discontent , that even men of the most moderate tempers , and the most attached to the church and monarchy , exerted themselves with the utmost vigor in the redress of grievances , and in prosecuting the author of them . The lively and animated Digby displayed his eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modest and candid Palmer . in this list , too , of patriot royalists , are found the virtuous names of Hyde Lord Clarendon and Falkland . Though , in their ultimate views and intentions , these men differed widely from the former Pym , Hambden , and others- , in their present actions and discourses an entire concurrence and unanimity was observed . ' A little further on the same writer adds ; Every meeting of the Commons produced some vehement // harangue against the usurpations of the bishops , against the high commission , against the late convocation , against the new canons . So disgusted were all lovers of civilliberty , at the doctrirtespronioted by the clergy , that these invectives were received without control ; and no distinction at first appeared between such as desired only to repress the disorders of the hierarchy , and such as pretended totally to abolish episcopal jurisdiction. * After some farther observations , Mr flume , with what seems to us strange inconsistency , closes his remarks on the subject of religious disputes with the following para*raph . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near that age , or what perhaps is more decisive , all authors , who have casually made mention of those transactions , still represent the civil disorders and convulsions as proceeding from religions controversy , and consider the political disputes about power and liberty , as entirely subordinate to the other . It is true , had the king been able to support government , and , at the same time , to abstain from all invasion of national privileges , it seems not probable that the Puritans ever could have acquired such authority as to have overturned the whole constitution . Yet so entire was the subjectioii into which Charles was now fallen , that had not the wound been poisoned by the infusion of theological hatred , it must have admitted of an easy remedy . Disuse of parliaments , imprisonments and prosecutions of members , ship money , an arbitrary administration ; these were loudly complained of ; but the grievances which tended chiefly to inflame the parliament and nation , especially the latter , were the surplice , the rails placed about the altar , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath , embroidered copes , lawn sleeves , the use of the ring in marriage , and of the cross in baptism . On account of these were the popular leaders content to throw the government into such violent convulsions ; and to the disgrace of that age , and of this island , it must be acknowledged that the disorders of Scotland , entirely , and those in England mostly , proceeded from so mean and contemptible an origin . ' How this last quotation is to be reconciled with the fact stated in the foregoing , that the friends of the church in the outset were as eager for redress of grievances in general , as the most rigid of the Puritans , we leave to others to determine . We shall not undertake to expose minutely the sophistry and misrepresentations of Mr flume in relation to this portion of English history . That task has already been thorou*hIy l ) erformed by several writers , particularly by Mr Brodie in his History of the British Empire from the Accession of Charles the First , to the Restoration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // elegance of Mr Hume , to be one of the most entertaining , as it is one of the most valuable productions of the present day . With regard , however , to the particular class of grievances on which Mr Hurne is so sarcastic , we have a few remarks to make . XVe agree entirely with that historian , that all writers who bave made mention of the transactions of that age , have attached great importance to the religious controversies which then agitated the nation . The violent and oppressive proceedings of the High Commissioners had swelled up a dispute , in its origin trivial and unimportant , into a grave question , involving the liberties and lives of a considerable portion of the community . In this point of view it is immaterial whether the act of oppression is one which affects mind , body , or estate . If the rights of either are invaded , resistance is as justifiable in the one case as the other . We can not , therefore , perceive the propriety of iMr Hume 's distinction between this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Whatever the extent of the evil may have been , it formed a perfectly just ground of remonstrance ; although we have been unable to discover the authority on which Mr Hume asserts , that it was the dispute about religious ceremonies which chiefly tended to inflame the parliament and people . Lord Clarendon , who is of the same party , in describing the state of feeling on the opening of the long parliament , gives a very different account , so far as regards that body . In truth , ' says this historian , in the House of Peers , there were only at that time taken notice of , the lords Say and Brooke , and they believed to be positive enemies to the whole fabric of the church , and to desire a dissolution ; the Earl of Warwick himself having never discovered any aversion to episcopacy and much professed the contrary . In the House of Commons , though of the chief leaders , Nathaniel Fiennes , and young Sir Harry Vane , and shortly after Mr Hambden ( who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and branch , which grew shortly after a common expression and discovery of the several tempers ; yet Mr Pym was not of that mind , nor Mr Hollis , nor any of the northern men , or those lawyers who drove on most furiously with them ; all who were pleased with the government itself of the church . ' Among the leaders of the same party were John Selden and Algernon Sydney . The author of Table Talk will not be charged with fanaticism , and Sydney is thought to have been a // free-thinker . Whatever causes of exasperation may have arisen afterwards , it is certain that the evils growing out of the aggressions of the church , were not then looked upon as of paramount importance . To make this appear , we shall in the first place point out some of the leading causes of discontent , independent of religion , and afterwards endeavor to show , that whatever may have been the origin of the theological controversy , it had come , in the year 1640 , to involve something more than the rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lawn sleeves . It will require an authority greater even than Mr Hume , to convince the world in our time , that the degree of exasperation which is admitted on all hands to have then pervaded the British empire , is to be attributed to matters of this sort . It is an anomaly which is contradicted by all experience . We will now take a nearer view of the state of England at the period in question , and see what were the causes of uneasiness , as they are gathered from public documents and the testimony of historians of all parties . We shall thus be able to form our own judgment as to the importance of those political disputes about power and liberty , which Mr Hume would have us believe were entirely subordinate to religious controversy . First on the list , we shall place monopolies , because they constitute the most obnoxious and impolitic of all grievances . it hardly need be stated , that it had been the habit of English sovereigns to provide for a rapacious favorite , or raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individuals or companies the exclusive right of making and selling certain articles , without the least regard to the claims of those who had gained their livelihood by the same means . This abuse had by degrees become so intolerable , that in the reign of James the First , monopolies were declared illegal hy act of parliament . Charles , however , in his necessities , not only revived them , but went beyond any of his predecessors in this odious species of exaction . To show the effect of this one item in its full force , it may not be amiss to give the articles thus granted to monopolists in the time of Queen Elizabeth , to which soap and linen rags were added by king Charles . The following is the list of them , as enumerated by Mr Hume . Currants , salt , iron , powder , cards , calfskins , felts , pouldavies , ox-shin-bones , train oil , lists of cloth , potashes , aniseeds , vinegar , sea-coals , steel , aqnavitn , brushes , pots , bottles , saltpetre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blubber , glasses , paper , // starch , tin , sulphur , new drapery , dried pilchards , transportation of iron ordnance , of beer , of horn , of leather , importation of Spanish wool , of Irish yarn . ' These monopolists were so exorbitant in their demands , ' continues Mr flume , that in some places they raised the price of salt from sixteen pence a bushel to fourteen or fifteen shillings . ' In order to secure themselves against incroachments , the patentees were armed with high and arbitrary powers , from the council , by which they were enabled to oppress the people at pleasure , and to exact money from such as they thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent . ' And while all domestic intercourse was thus restrained , lest any scope should remain for industry , almost every species of foreign commerce was confined to exclusive companies , who bought and sold at any price that they themselves thought proper to offer or exact . ' Besides all this , King Charles 's privy council , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of impost , called tonnage and poundage , but , by its own authority , added fifteen per centum to the Tariff or Book of Rates . In addition to these burdens , the city of London had been , in the most arbitrary manner , deprived of its charter , which it was obliged to repurchase by the payment of a heavy fine . If these were vexatious impositions on the trading and commercial classes , we shall find that the other orders of citizens were by no means exempted . One of the well known expedients of this monarch to supply his necessities , was that of forced loans , by which every subject in the kingdom was doomed to pay any sum the privy council should think proper to exact . At the period in question , many of the first men in England were lying in prison for having refused to submit to this oppression . Ship money too had been introduced , under pretence of public danger , in time of profound peace , and each county was assessed a given sum to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the obsolete demands of knight 's fees and wardships ; the landlords generally were in a state of alarm , in consequence of the seizure of large tracts of country to make additions to the king 's forests ; while the tenantry were equally exasperated , by the billeting of soldiers upon them without consent or remuneration . To complete the general disgust , commissions had been issued in the several counties with authority to supersede the established tribunals , and to try and punish offences by martial law . When it is considered that most or all the foregoing were matters cognizable in the Court of Star Chamber , and that the king by consenting to the petition of // right in 1628 , twelve years before , had expressly abolished them ; it can not but strike every man of reflection with surprise , that Mr Hume should so far have lost sight of the duty of an historian , as to throw these circumstances into the shade . It was the obvious design of this accomplished writer to justify the Stuarts , particularly Charles the First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odious measures of that unhappy and misguided prince . In order to bring about this object , he is obliged to resort to some unworthy expedients . All the enormities of Queen Elizabeth 's government are enumerated by him with great exactness , and condemned in the broadest terms , while the instances in which the Stuarts went beyond that princess in the exercise of the prerogative , are either palliated , or passed wholly by . We shall cite one instance out of many . It is that of ship money . In relating the events of the year 1626 , the second of King Charles 's reign , Mr Hume says , In order to equip a fleet , a distribution by order of the council was made to all the maritime towns ; and each of them was required , with the assistance of the adjacent counties , to arm so many vessels as were appointed them . The city of London was rated at twenty ships . This is the first appearance , in Charles 's reign , of ship money ; a taxation which had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when carried afew steps fart her by Charles , created such violent discontents . ' Here is a statement which is not absolutely untrue , and yet it is not difficult to prove , that Charles is the first English monarch who ever exacted ship money of his subjects as a source of revenue . A faint resemblance to this tax is found in the ancient Dane-geit , a primitive kind of tax , resorted to when the kingdom was threatened with an incursion of the Danes ; the proprietor of a given number of acres being called on to provide a horseman , those of a greater amount to furnish a ship . This had , however , been long disused , and no precedent can be found later than the reign of Edward the Third , for anything resembling it . Even the writs of that period merely authorized the crown to impress ships in the seaports on any sudden emergency , to be paid for by the public . The only precedent then was to be found , according to Mr Hume , in the reign of Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigency , the invasion of England by the Spaniards ; one of those emergencies when all laws are suspended ,  --  when the lives and properties of all are surrendered up for the general defence . // That great princess , in this appalling crisis , did no more than second the zeal of her subjects , every class of whom was called on to contribute its share to the public service . The only question was , how it could be most effectually employed , all men seeing that their liberties and property were at stake . At this time , ' says Mr Hume , the royal navy consisted only of t*venty-eight sail , many of which were of small size , while the Spanish fleet amounted to one hundred and thirty galleons . All the commercial towns in England were required to furnish ships to reenforce this small navy ; and they discovered , on the present occasion , great alacrity in defending their liberty and religion , against the imminent perils with which they were menaced . The citizens of London , in order to show their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were commanded to equip , voluntarily fitted out double the number . The gentry and nobility hired , and armed , and manned , forty-three ships at their own charge ; and all the loans of money which the queen demanded were frankly granted by the persons applied to . ' This is Mr flume 's precedent ; which , it may be observed , extends equallylto forced loans , as to ship money , the former of which , he himself expressly states , was once recommended by Lord Burleigh to Queen Elizabeth , but never carried into effect . This is a most extraordinary authority to bring forward for a tax of any sort . Upon the same principle , the military associations formed throughout the kingdom , when threatened with invasion by Bonaparte , would at any time be a sufficient precedent for a levy en masse . But allowing Mr Hume the advantage of it as far as it will serve him , we will proceed to examine the few steps taken by King Charles in advance of Queen Elizabeth , in this species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , as will be seen by and by , is not thought worth mentioning at all by the historian ; namely , the altering of the patents by which the judges held their offices , from the tenure of good behavior , to that of the king 's pleasure . Another very important step , was demanding this tax at a time when no immediate danger existed , which certainly could not be said in the case of Queen Elizabeth . The first writs in the reign of Charles were directed to the seaport towns only , demanding , not ship money , but a given number of vessels . The next step was in 1634 , to levy ship money upon the whole kingdom ; each county being rated at a particular sum , which was afterwards assessed upon the individuals . This caused universal // discontent ; insomuch that the king , in order to discourage all opposition , proposed this question to the judges ; Whether in case of necessity , for the defence of the kingdom , he might not impose this taxation ; and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' These guardians of the law and liberty , ' says Mr Hume , replied with great complaisance , " that in a case of necessity , he might impose that taxation , and that he was the sole judge of the necessity . " ' Here was a stride which at once overstepped all the boundaries of law , and left the subject completely at the mercy of the crown . In this stage of the question it was , that Mr Hambden resolved , rather than tamely submit to so illegal an imposition , to stand a prosecution , and expose himself to all the indignation of the court . The case was argued twelve days in the exchequer chamber before the twelve judges , who gave judgment for the crown , four of them dissenting . The observations of Lord Clarendon on this decision , and on the characters of Noy and Finch , principally in reference to the matter of the ship money , although too long to be here inserted , discover a candor and sincerity we in vain look for in Mr Hume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , in regard to the main origin of the civil wars . We will now proceed to take a very general view of the progress of this controversy , and the actual state of the question , when the long parliament was convened ; by which we think it will appear , that so far from being the puerile affair Mr Hume xvould be glad to represent it , the narrow policy of King Charles and his predecessors had raised np , from a small beginning , a system of persecution , which was only equalled by the enormities already enumerated . The complaint of the nonconformists , from the accession of Queen Elizabeth , had always been , the compelling by law , the use of habits and ceremonies in themselves indifferent . When the Protestant religion was rei3stablished , on the accession of that princess , very little difference of opinion existed among the members of the English church in regard to articles of belief . A large body , however , both of the clergy and laity , were disposed to follow the example of their neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , in laying aside , not only the faith , but the vestments and ceremonies of the Romish church . A very strong party was equally bent on retaining them , among whom was the queen herself , who so far forgot her usual good sense , as to enter // warmly into the controversy . In the first year of her reign were passed the acts of supremacy and uniformity , by the former of which the queen was authorized to establish a Court of High Commission , with full power in ecclesiastical matters , to visit , reform , redress , order , correct , and amend all errors , heresies , schisms , abuses , contempts , offences , and enormities whatsoever . ' By virtue of this act , a Court of High Commission was soon raised , and not long after , the clergy were assernbled in convocation , to settle the articles of belief , as well as the rites and ceremonies of the church . The vote for retaining the ceremonies passed the lower house of convocation by a single voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their adherence to all the forms prescribed , which gave so great offence to some of the bishops , that the matter was laid before the queen . Among other things equally momentous , it was represented to her majesty , that some administer the communion with surplice and cope ; some with surplice alone ; others with none ; some with chalice , others with a communion cup ; others with a common cup ; some with unleavened bread , and some with leavened . That some receive kneeling , others standing , others sitting ; some baptize in a font , some in a bason , some sign with the sign of the cross , others sign not ; some minister in a surplice , others , without ; some with a square cap , some with a round cap , some with a button cap , some with a hat ; some in scholars ' clothes , some in others . ' The queen was highly displeased with this report , and gave orders that all ministers who did not comply with the act of uniformity , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Court of High Commission should direct . Here was a door opened for the most serious disputes , both parties as usual being tenacious and intolerant , just in proportion as the matter in question was futile and insignificant . The nonconforming ministers were hunted and vexed , until they began , to use Mr Neal 's expression , to break off from the public churches , and to assemble as they had opportunity , in private houses , or elsewhere , to worship God in a manner that might not offend against the light of their consciences . ' Here , ' lie adds , was the era or date of the separation , ' the inevitable consequence of the previous coercive measures . Thus matters went on for nearly twenty years , until the vexations of the nonconformists were become so intolerable , that notwithstanding the well known prejudice of the queen , in the year 1593 , the subject was brought before parliament . // Morrice , chancellor of the dutchy , and attorney of the court of wards , made a motion for redressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the High Commission ; where subscriptions , he said , were exacted to articles at the pleasure of the prelates ; where oaths were imposed , obliging persons to answer to all questions without distinction , even though they should tend to their own condemnation ; and where every one , who refused entire satisfaction to the commissioners , was imprisoned without relief or remedy . ' This step threw her majesty into a great rage ; she charged the speaker , ' says Mr Hume , on his allegiance , if any such bills were offered , absolutely to refuse them a reading , and not so much as to permit them to be debated . This command of the queen was submitted to without further question . Morrice was seized in the house itself , by a sergeant at arms , discharged from his office of chancellor of the dutchy , incapacitated from any practice in his profession as a common lawyer , and kept some years prisoner in Tilbury Castle . ' The queen , ' continues the same historian , having thus expressly pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commons were as obsequious to the one as to the other of her injunctions . They passed a law against recusants ; such a law as was suited to the severe character of Elizabeth , and to the persecuting spirit of that age . It was entitled , An act to restrain her majesty 's subjects in their due obedience ; and was meant , as the preamble declares , to obviate such inconveniences and perils , as might grow from the wicked practices of seditious sectarians and disloyal persons ; for these two species of criminals were always at that time confounded together , as equally dangerous to the peace of society . It was enacted , that any person , above sixteen years of age , who obstinately refused , during the space of a month , to attend public worship , should be committed to prison ; that if , after being condemned for this offence , he persist three months in his refusal , he must abjure the realm ; and that , if he either refuse this condition , or return after banishment , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy . ' This act should have been entitled , An act for the encouragement and propagation of heresy and nonconformity. ' it is unnecessary to recite the instances of suffering and injustice during the remainder of this , and a part of the subsequent reign , resulting from this law ; but it should never be forgotten , that it was shortly after the passing of it , that the migration to Holland took place , which more than twenty years afterwards led to the settlement of New England . We have just seen Mr Hume 's opinion on this subject in the reign of Elizabeth . In that of Charles , he thinks resistance to such incasures // reflects disgrace upon the age ; an age in which the very paragraph just cited might have cost the free-thinking historian his head . King James , with all his faults , was not of a persecuting temper , and happily , not long after his accession , on tile death of Dr Bancroft , the primacy fell into tile hands of Dr Abbott . During the life of this mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative peace . in the year 1633 , the bigoted and intolerant Laud succeeded Abbott in the primacy , and , as if the unhappy Charles was doomed to inevitable destruction , rekindled the slumbering fires of religious persecution . This haughty prelate went beyond any of his predecessors in his zeal for conformity , insomuch that great numbers of the Puritans were driven to seek relief in exile . Even this , which was permitted by the act of Elizabeth , was denied them at last , and nothing was left for them , but to wait with patience for some favorable turn of affairs . This was the state of things with regard to religion , in 1640 , when the long parliament met . Now , that the origin of this controversy was altogether trivial , we readily grant . The omitting to wear a cope or a surplice , is certainly a small matter ; what then are we to think of a government , which punishes such an offence with fine , pillory , and imprisonment ? The more insignificant the question , the more atrocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism , it is the interference of the state in the common concerns of life , and punishing as crimes , actions in themselves innocent . We have seen in our own days an example of this species of legislation . The late Emperor Paul the First carried his paternal care of his subjects so far , as to regulate the most minute article of dress by an imperial decree . Instances occurred during his reign , of persons of the first rank being executed or sent to Siberia , for appearing in the streets with a shoe-tie of an illegal shape , or with the cock of the hat a little out of the line of the nose . Upon Mr Hume 's principle , what had the gentlemen to complain of ? They knew the law , or might have known it , and had nothing to do but wear their clothes agreeably to statute . Yet can there be the least question , if we may suppose such a thing as a Russian House of Commons , that these would there have been insisted on , and justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister who recommended , and the officers who enforced them , have been the first objects of popular vengeance ? No man can doubt it ; and yet some Russian Hume one hundred years // afterwards , might with great plausibility , after enumerating some of the grosser measures of the government of that day , observe , that these were loudly complained of ; but the grievances which tended chiefly to inflame the nation , were shoestrings , and cocked hats . ' This state of affairs in policy and religion may well account for the unanimity which prevailed at the opening of the long parliament . Beyond that period we have not room to extend our remarks . From what has already been said , it will be seen that Mr Hume 's account of this epoch in English history , is to be received with great caution . Lord Clarendon , with all his bigotry , is a much safer authority . He avows his object to be the defence of the royal cause . Mr Hume , with equal prejudice and partiality , has a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the question after the fashion of his day , upon the basis of divine right . He advances his creed with an honest bluntness which puts the reader at his ease . He confesses many things of his party , without any expression of disapprobation , which no party at the present time would have the effrontery to acknowledge . Accordingly we find that Mr Hume makes but little use of Lord Clarendon in the early stages of the dispute . He prefers to cite the popular historians even for undisputed facts . The change which had taken place in public opinion when Mr Hume 's work appeared , will easily account for this circumstance . That sagacious writer well knew , that the Stuarts were not to be defended at that time of day , by the doctrines of Sir Robert Filmer . The most he could hope for was to palliate and gloss over , what he had not the hardihood to defend , a task which he has accomplished with an address worthy of a better end . The train by which the reader is led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with such adroitness , that , before he is aware , the wily historian has him in his toils . When the mind has been thus deluded , the syInpathies are artfully plied with the sufferings , in themselves sufficiently moving , of the individuals who fell a sacrifice to popular vengeance . The fates of Strafford , of Laud , and of Charles himself , are placed before us , by the partial historian , in so moving a way as to disarm our resentment at enormities which , if presented in their proper colors , would make even the True blue Cluh'turn pale in their seats . It must not be inferred from these remarks , that we are insensible to the merits of Mr Hume as an historian . His exqui // site skill in unravelling the labyrinth of early British history ; the masterly discrimination with which he has exposed the absurdities of monkish invention ; his clear and lucid view of the progress of the English constitution ; his able developement of the foreign policy of Great Britain ; and the pure and elegant language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be classed among the best writers of ancient 6r modern times . His authority , on most points , may he relied on until we come down to the rise of the party distinctions , which have existed in England under various modifications for more than two hundred years ; since which time , it is but justice to Mr flume to say , that an impartial English history is not to be found . We should be glad to pursue the subject still further , and to trace the progress of opinion during the stormy period which succeeded the assembling of the long parliament ; the events of which are feelingly and minutely described by Lord Clarendon . We have , however , only room to add , that the American impression of Lord Clarendon 's hi*tory is a reprint of the late Oxford edition , excepting that the passages in the original manuscrIpt , which were suppressed in former editions , are , in the American copy , incorporated with the text . This we think an improvement upon the English edition , in which these passages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Warburton are inserted at the foot of each page , instead of being collected at the end of the volume , as in the English copy . rfhesenotes seem not to have been intended for publication . We should suppose them to be cursory observations , noted down , as they suggested themselves , in the margin of the hook . They are for the most part of no great value , excepting as they discover a degree of liberality , which the general tenor of the Bishop 's writings would hardly lead one to expect .
