txt ART . VII . Spe*ckes in Congre&amp;r , as published in the . TV'ewspapers ; 1826 , 1827 . THE range of the human mind is almost infinite , but the particular departments to which it may be directed , especially in most branches of literature , will sooner or later be filled , and no resort remain but to repetition . Some critics have asserted , for instance , that epic poems , which would be read , can no longer be produced . Homer , Virgil , Milton , Tasso , and Camoens , without citing more recent names , have exhausted the process . Tragedy also has no field untouched , and though the French , with their crowds of theatre-going idlers , now and then sustain a new one for a few nights , by the aid of *n occa-* sional political allusion , which seriously alarms the court and the police of that volatile nation , it falls into oblivion with the modes of the season . Even comedy , which perhaps has more numerous combinations , in the proportion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even every princi-* pal comic emotion , pursuit , situation , or trick , has been exhausted in the many thousands of comedies , which Spain , France , and England have produced , without taking into the account other nations ancient and modern . The result is , that formal epics are abandoned for irregular lyrical narratives , while tragedy and comedy have given way to melodrame and pantonume . Forensic oratory and parliamentary debating seem to be quite as much exhausted&gt; ; the great masterpieces of Greece , Rome , and England , together with some specimens in our country , have gone over all the great topics , exhibited all the m*sterly resorts of rhetoric , and nothing remains to make a debate endurable , but the accidental occurrence of some really powerful , momentary excitement ; which , however , is too often attempted to be raised by the mere feverish turbulence of par* tisans , while their insipid commonplaces , and mock attempts at dignity that neither they nor the subject possess , occasion their harangues to fall stale , fiat , and unprofitable , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to greater extent with us , is not confined to our country . The abuse is very great in England , and the public there seem equally tired of it ; and as the ministers in that country have a seat in one or the other house , it // falls with oppressive weight upon them . Indeed , we recollect a few years since , when a great many changes had been rung on the same question , though under the form of a different motion , being prolonged through many nights , that the Lord Chancellor seriously insinuated , that there seemed to be a determination to incapacitate his majesty 's ministers for per forming their duty during the day , by harassing them every night with a debate . There is an opinion on this topic , expressed in a posthumous letter of Lord Byron , which is by no means confined to him . After briefly describing , with adruirable discrimination , some of the chief contemporary speakers , he concludes ; But among all these , good , bad , and indifferent , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditors , and not very intelligible , except here and there . The whole thing is a grand deception , and as tedious and tiresome as may be , to those who must be often present . ' Yet the aristocratic and arrogant habits of the British parlia .. ment keep down the evil in part ; it is only a chosen few , who have fought their way through many a combat , whom the majority will yawn at* with forbearance . If a man unknown to fame , a mere prosing , jury-confounding arguer , or vain , tiresome country gentleman , or conceited cit , should attempt a display , he would be coughed and scraped down ; and all these classes , which dilate with impunity among us , would be com* pressed into silence . Though to some we may appear to write with too much frankness , we apprehend that a majority of the nation will agree with us , and would be glad to have the proposition estab .. lished ; that , speeches in Congress have increased , are increasing , and ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , immediate guardians of the people ,  - -  but who are to guard the guardians ? Undoubtedly There is more than one member of that important body , who would be startled at a charg* of abuse against it . They indeed have their professed censors and tribunes , who are perpetually imput .. ing corruption and abuses to other branches of the government . They are constantly smelling and winking , and on the eve of detecting some enormity . From the excessive salaries of the secretaries. - ( we must save our feelings by speaking strait forward in a parenthesis  --  the despicable , parsimonious stipend paid to the highest labor , and most intense anxiety , not equalling the gains of mediocrity in many of the ordinary // professions of life ) , from these splendid emoluments , down to the moderate , decent remuneration of the clerks , no winter escapes without some magnificent attempt at reduction , some huge effort at economy . Now we really believe our government in all its branches to be freer from abuses , than any other in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by time , no privileges radicated beyond the power of extraction ; and , besides , to its being subject to a publicity the most unsparing and uncontrolled . Yet we are equally of opinion , that in the abuses which do creep in , by far the largest and the most costly proportion is to be found in the legislative branch ; in the department occupied by the guardians and representatives of the people 's rights . We allude not now to the paltry considerations of their daily pay , of their expenses of printing , &amp;c. &amp;c. , but to the evils produced by this pestilent abuse of debating . We ask the nation to judge between their representatives and us poor critics ; we ask men conversant with public affairs , to look back for a few sessions , and see how many great measures of national importance have been delayed , or are still postponed , by this vile prurience for debate . And if these questions are too general to be felt , we come to suffering individuals , with real or imaginary claims , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month after month in expectancy , and at last have been put off to another and another session , because there was no time for investigation ! This evil has gradually gained upon the Senate , until it is al .. most as much infected as the other house ; and the course is still more unwise in them . Surely they may disdain the poor display , the ignoble triumph of common disputation . When the smallness of their number , the independence , the bodies and interests represented , and the functions of which they constitutionally partake , are considered , we think it no exaggeration to say , that they are The most respectable parliamentary house in any government . True it is , a temporary shade has passed over them , but this , like other shadows , will leave no mark . If , then , this body would relinquish the superfluity of debate , their greater progress in public business would be a salutary check on the other house , and goad them to a more punctual and efficient discharge of public duty . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this abuse of what Bentham would call speech jfication , does not exist , we refer him to the speeches of the members for any one session ; he will see that they themselves are conscious of their offences , and that three out of four begin with an excuse , or some attempt to excite commiseration by complaints of ill health , but that their sense of public duty is so strong , that they will speak , though they sink under the effort . It would be something gained , if ill health could be considered as an excuse , or enforced as a disqualification . There is no aristocratic remedy , as in England , of scraping and coughing ; but they connive at and bear each other out , having the same object in view ; and there is no intrepid reformer to take the part of the nation , and ask them , Why do ye so ? The obvious remedy for the evil would be found by not publishing the speeches in extenso . Because , in most cases , it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debater thinks or cares about . His object is to get his speech into the newspaper , and besides its circulation in that shape , the printer , for a trifling fee , breaks up his endless columns into a dingy , pamphlet page ; and these precious missives the member despatches to sundry of his constituents , who stare with pleasure at the efforts of their representative , and have their pride gratified in receiving a communication free . ' Were the postage demanded , most of them would be inhumed in the dead-letter office , and come back to that bourne , the general post office , whence they proceeded . If only the substance of the speech was given , the real arguments of the speaker stated , as there would he the three grains of wheat in the five bushels of chaff , a most salutary corrective would be applied , and the editor besides enabled to devote a large part of his paper to useful and entertaining miscellanies , and his readers would get a much clearer insight into public affairs . But the printers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repository of words furnishes them matter , without the pains of selecting or originating more valuable materials ; and , besides , the same types undergoing the easy evolution of change of column , and broken up into little octavo or duodecimo squads , are paid for by the garrulous member , for the purpose of being distributed as we have before mentioned ; and this fictitious new edition gives its emolument . But the journal , by becoming more valuable , would in the end gain more by giving the abstract we have recommended , fairly stating all // the arguments , and omitting merely the excuses , the declamation , and the sad inanity of faded commonplaces . The public unquestionably would be better instructed , their passions would be less excited , and they would understand more clearly , and judge more wisely of the chief topics of national concern . In this manner one column would condense and rectify the be- wildering confusion , that now spreads over four ; while the journal would become brighter , more varied ' , more edifying , more valuable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to nine out of ten of the subscribers , to the metropolitan journals , during , and for some time after , a session of Congress ; we ask them with what emotions they see those wide , folio pages of a desolating debate , unbroken , unvaried as a wild heath or interminable prairie , with no apparent resting-place , or object in relief , whether they are not glad to thank misery for a change , and hail with delight the appearance of one of those treaties in which Eho-che*nunga , the Madman , ' or Sho-mon-e. - ka*- sa , the Prairie Wo ( 1 ' assents to the exterminating progress of civilization . lATe repeat it , the common routine of parliamentary speaking is no longer tolerable . The forms of oratory are as much used and worn , as the epic , the tragic , or the comic . The evil we deplore is increasing ; the nation must set their faces against it , insist on having their business attended to , and not trifled with in debates . There will still be ample space left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . There , in serving as jurymen , from which none are exempt , we may submit to the hammerers , and splitters , and spinners , who satisfy litigants that they earn their fees by laboring in their vocation , and as quiet citizens he resigned to our fate , when our turn comes to hear law , justice , and equity so bethumped with words . ' But the same individuals must not transfer the same habits into the halls of congress . Nothing , however , short of a general rising in public feeling , will intimidate the offenders , and pro* ' duce a reform ; because , though there are some who have a better sense of the matter , there are many among them , who , it would seem , from their simplicity , confined reading , and a social intercourse limited to very narrow circles , really think they are making a pretty display , and are quite unaware how jejune , tedious , and rediculous these harangues appear to persons of larger experience . Let them inquire of some one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be astonished // to learn , like Molii*re 's Bourgeois Gentilliomme , that in these labored discussions they have been most sadly prosing all the time . We have already hinted at some mechanical checks , which is is in the power of the printers to interpose in behalf of the nation . But we have an idea , that whenever some oNginal mind with adequate talent and sagacity , takes up this subject , that a great and favorable change may be produced by striking out an entirely different course , and M'Adamizing the worn*. out , jolting path . We can not go further now than throw out the hint , from the fear of being tiresome , a quality , which reviewers should bear in mind is not confined to speaking ; and also from our plan being as yet imperfectly conceived ; and because we may possibly be in a situation to attain the glory of introducing it ourselves . However , to put those whose eyes are still bandaged in the right direction to grope for it , we will refer them to the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet not only enjoyed great influence from his wisdom , but produced most powerful effects on assemblies by the mode of illustration he adopted . Let them reflect on this subject , and see if they can not invent a new style of persuasion , introduce a very eloquent if not oratorical method , and cause the abandonment of effete , exhausted practice . If none of them will take advantage of these suggestions , we shall be half tempted , from patriotic motives , to make the reformation ourselves ; and , should we succeed , we should wish no higher claim to gratitude , than to have it inscribed on our tablet ,  --  IIe reformed the congressional mode of debating , so that it was compressed into one fourth of the space it formerly occupied .
