txt ART . V.-Letters on the Gospels . By Miss HANNAH ADAMS . l8mo. pp. 216 . Cambridge . Hilliard &amp; Metcalf. 1824 . THE author of these letters has long been known to the public , as a successful writer on theological subjects , and as having rendered essential service to religion , by the productions of her pen . Her Views of Religions , or , as she denoinmates it in the last edition , her Dictjonary of all Religions and Religious Denominations , has been a popular work from the time of its first publication . It has passed through four editions , the last of which is enlarged and greatly improved . It was published in England , with a preface and additions , by Mr Andrew Fuller ; and also in another form by Mr Thomas Williams , who likewise made alterations . To both these edi-. tors , Miss Adams acknowledges herself indebted , for some of the improvements of her fourth edition . This work is the best manual with which we are acquainted , for giving information respecting ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have prevailed in different ages , since the origin ot Christianity . It has the peculiar merit of the strictest candor and impartiality ; and so completely has the author divested herself of all individual prepossessions , that it may be doubted whether , from a single passage in the whole work , her own religious sentiments can be inferred . This freedom from personal bias , in exhibiting the views of others , especially on topics rarely touched without calling out private opinion , in- // spires confidence in her statements , as well as respect for her judgment and christian charity . The public is also indebted to Miss Adams for a History of the Jews , from the Destruction of Jerusalem to the J'V'ineteenth Century . This is a judicious and well arranged compilation from the best authors , and brings to the knowledge of the reader , all the important incidents in the history of that remarkable people , from the destruction of their city , down to recent times . It speaks of the persecution suffered by the Jews , their religious ceremonies and tenets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adhering , under every vicissitude of fortune , to their national peculiarities . Miss Adams 's Summary History of JVew England has been commended for its accuracy , and the perspicuity of its style . The reputation , which she has acquired by the above works , will not suffer by her Letters on the Gospels . She professes to have written them for the improvement of the young , and to this end they are exceedingly well adapted . Every one knows , that throughout the writings of the Evangelists , perpetual allusions are made to the customs of the times , local circumstances , the religion of the Jews , and habits of thinking peculiar to the age ; and that , without a knowledge of these particulars , the meaning of Scripture is , in many parts , obscure and uncertain . Had facts of this sort always been sought out and carefully studied , by those who have undertaken to interpret the Scriptures , the world might have been spared a thousand absurdities , which have gone abroad in the garb of commentaries and annotations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor and ingenuity , that have been wasted on its unreal forms . In her first letter , Miss Adams has the following just remarks ; While attentively perusing the New Testament , always bear in mind that the Gospel was first preached to the Jews , in Judea , and that the Evangelists and Apostles , with the exception , perhaps , of St Luke , were all of the Hebrew nation . Much of the peculiar beauty of the inspired writings can not be perceived , unless the history , condition , and character of the Jews have become objects of your attention , not only during the period of the Mosaic dispensation , as recorded in the Old Testa // ment , but at the time of our bord 's appearance . It is also Important to understand the frequent allusions in the New Testament to their opinions , habits , manners , and ceremonies . A view of the darkness and depravity which prevailed in the world , both among the Jews and Gentiles , at the period when our Saviour appeared upon earth , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the christian dispensation . ' To supply the means for making these acquisitions , and arriving at a clear understanding of the New Testament , is the special purpose of the author . She begins with a general description of the state of ' the world , at the time our Saviour appeared , in regard to the government , learning , philosophy , superstitions , and objects of worship among the Gentile nations ; and also the civil and religious condition of the Jews , the sects and parties into which they were divided , the Pharisees , Sadducees , and those whose opinions were tinctured with the Oriental philosophy . She next proceeds to a short geographical sketch of the Holy Land , and of the principal cities , villages , mountains , and other places , that are made famous in the history of our Lord . This is followed by a brief history of Jerusalem since that time . Several lettei*s are then devoted to the discourses of our Saviour , in which the numerous allusions to the opinions and habits of the Jews are pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is calculated to lend important aids to the young student of the Gospels , as well as to instruct the more practised reader of the Scriptures , who has not turned his thoughts to these subjects . The miracles next come under notice . This head might have been enlarged upon to advantage , but as far as the author goes she speaks to the purpose , and throws light on several texts of Scripture . The parables engage more of her attention , and she explains in a very happy manner , and by numerous illustrations , this beautiful mode of conveying instruction , so successfully practised by our Saviour . Some of the more important parables% such as those of the good Samaritan , the prodigal son , the rich man , the marriage supper , and the pharisee and publican , are separately considered , and the meaning of their particular parts deduced from the circumstances under which they were delivered . A series of miscelk*neous letters embraces an account of // the funeral rites of the Jews , the character of Herod and of Pilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salutation in the East . The whole is concluded with a body of questions , adapted to the leading topics of each letter , and designed for the use of instructers in examining the progress of their pupils , or to refresh the reader 's own recollection . Such is an imperfect outline of this little volume . It will be seen , that its subjects are important ; they are treated in so direct and familiar a manner , as to be brought down to the entire comprehension of every mind . Considering the cheapness of the volume , the agreeable manner in which it is written , and the numerous illustrations of Scripture which it contains , it may safely he recommended as claiming a place in the library of every family , where there are young minds to be instructed , and older ones that love to read the Scriptures with a clear sense of their meaning and force . In this place we are tempted to add a few words on a point , which the perusal of these letters has brought strongly to mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christian religion at its origin affords in favor of its divinity and truth ; not that there is anything new in this argument , but that the examination of the topics above enumerated presents it in an imposing light . The success of the christian religion , in the first age of its growth , becomes a matter of surprise , when we look at the obstacles with which it had to contend , the means by which these obstacles were encountered , and the fact that these means were effectual . As to the obstacles , which opposed the introduction of christianity , they were formidable beyond what can now easily be imagined . They existed in the customs , opinions , prejudices , and perverseness of the Jews , to whom it was first preached , and in the spiritual darkness , and moral degradation of the Gentiles . The Jews had early received the books of Moses as of divine authority , and the writings of the Prophets were considered no less the word of God . It is certain , that the descendants of Abraham separated themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , were governed by laws essentially different from other nations , and became distinguished by modes of life , and habits of thinking , feeling , and acting , peculiar to themselves . The demonstrations , // which they had perpetually before them , of being under the special guidance of the Supreme Being , quickened their pride , caused them to magnify their privileges , and to fancy themselves superior to other nations . From numerous intimations in their prophetical writings , they had long expected the coming of the Messiah . In him they were looking for a prince , a judge , a redeemer , a deliverer ; but it was from their political troubles , and their distresses as a nation , from which they fondly imagined he would deliver then . When Christ appeared , they had become a degraded province , and were suffering under the cruei tyranny of the Romans . Such was the political condition of the Jews , such their national prejudices , and such their expectations in regard to the character of the Messiah , and the objects of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religion , like that of Jesus Christ . How would the people believe him to be their long expected Messiah , whose character and conduct were so opposite to all their anticipations ? Instead of coming in the splendor and power of a prince , he appeared an humble peasant of Gallilee , a province proverbial for its poverty and insignificance , and from which it had long been the belief , that no good thing could come . He did nothing to promote their political aggrandisement ; he placed before them no prospects of military glory and conquest ; and instead of offering to rescue them from bondage , he chided them for their rebellious spirit , and commanded them to submit to their condition . And further , the religious impressions of the Jews presented another obstacle . They believed their religion to come immediately from God . With them , civil and religious laws were the same . Their national concerns , their religious ceremonies , and the occupations of private 1i1*e , v*ere regulated by the same rules . The religion of the Jews mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , their habits , their manners . In this consisted the whole compass of their education . It was an entire system of law and morality , of faith and piety . No Jew had any conception , that it could be improved or altered . It was the glory of his nation , the foundation of its present existence , and the hope of its future greatness and prosperity . With these im // pressions , nothing could be more remote from the minds and feelings of the Jews , than that any change was either necessary or possible in their religion . But these are a part only of the obstacles , with which the christian religion had to contend . It was , also , to be preached to the Gentiles . And what was there in its character to recommend it to them ? Or rather , what was there , which was not at war with all their prejudices , prepossessions , and religious ceremonies ? In the first place , the Jewish nation itfelf had become a byeword to the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , had raised barriers between them and every other nation . The con* tempt , with which they affected to regard their neighbors , was returned in full measure . Next , the character , which Christ sustained while on earth , was not one , which would command the respect of the Gentiles any more than the Jews . How could they believe the divine nature and authority of his doctrines , when they had no knowledge of the God of Israel , by whose power he acted , and by whose spirit he was enlightened ? Confirmed in a mythology and worship of their own , which were rendered sacred by the most cherished associations , and all that was dear to them in the memory of their ancestors , how could they believe , that a Jew of Nazareth had been sent from heaven to proclaim a system of divine truths , that should overthrow , and root up the system , which they regarded with so much veneration ; and that should work an entire revolution in the morals , manners , and religion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calculated to excite abhorrence in the minds , both of the Jews and the heathens , or Gentiles . The death of the cross was one , to which only the worst of criminals were condemned . No doctrine could have been proposed to the people , at which they would so suddenly revolt , and which they would so immediately reject , as the doctrine of the cross . And yet , this doctrine was a prominent feature in the preaching of the Apostles . No doctrine could be more unpopular , or do greater violence to the prejudices of all parties , the high and low , the wise and ignorant , yet the Apostles persevered in preaching it ; they resorted to no schemes of compromise ; they maintained a stern integrity , and firm adherence to trutl* , // without yielding to the vices , the follies , or the weaknesses of men . They preached the Gospel , as it had seen delivered to them by their divine master , leaving it to find its own way into the heart and the understanding , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood like the mountains of ages to oppose its progress . It may he added , also , that the moral character and the purifying spirit of the christian religion , its precepts and commands , were totally at variance with the morals and manners of the whole world at that period ; so that the religion of Jesus had not only to contend with the prejudices , the firmly rooted opinions , and the hereditary customs of all nations ; but also their passions , their vices , their inclinations , their worldly propensities , and worldly affections . Considering the formidable obstacles , at which we have but partially hinted , what means should we expect would overcome them ? Should we look for anything less , than the highest efforts of human wisdom and learning in the persons , who should attempt to remove the prejudices , and correct the vices of a world sunk in depravity and darkened with error ? Should we not even then say , that success would be wholly beyond the reach of human probability ? But what was the fact ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , without patronage or aid , without any countenance from the wise , or strength from the powerful , set out to accomplish a revolution greater than ever had been contemplated , by the most enthusiastic and fortunate conqueror ,  --  .  --  a revolution , which had for its object , not the downfall of nations and the glory of conquest , but the peace , harmony , virtue , and happiness of the whole human race . The preachers of Christianity , to all human appearance , were absolutely the last men , who could be supposed qualified for so extraordinary an enterprise . And what kind of people did these preachers go abroad to convince and convert ? The age was not more remarkable for error , superstition , and wickedness , than for intellectual refinement . It was a proud era of the arts and sciences in Greece , and the meridian glory of Roman greatness . Phi .. losophy had taught men to reason *nd think ; eloquence and poetry to invent , define , and adorn . The Apostles , unlettered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // learning , ingenuity , wit , eloquence . Imagine to yourself a small band of fishermen from Genesareth , going into the cities of Greece , reasoning with their wise men , confuting their arguments , and drawing after them multitudes of followers , adherents to a cause , which was held in universal contempt , and which subjected every person , who embraced it , to privations , reproach , and sufferings . Imagine these men in the synagogues of the Jews , reasoning with the learned doctors on the most difficult points of the law , and proving the truth of their doctrines from the very arguments brought to confute them . Imagine St Paul , who tells us he was rude in speech , and weak in bodily presence , imagine this man standing before a powerful king , and uttering his sentiments in a strain of bold , nervous , manly eloquence , which made the heathen monarch himself exclaim , Paul , almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian . ' Imagine him in the enlightened city of Athens , boldly chiding the Athenians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the resurrection , and making known the existence , attributes , and glory of the one true God . By what power did Paul and Barnabas preach and teach in Lystra , till the people exclaimed , The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men * By what magic did these Apostles , uninformed and unpractised in the arts of the world , impress with conviction and fill with astonishment the minds not only of the ignorant and simple , but of the learned , the wise , the powerful ? What sufferings did they not endure ? Imprisoned , scourged , and stoned ; reviled and mocked ; persecuted and despised , what influence could we expect they would have , in preaching the unwelcome doctrines of the cross , convincing the world of error , conquering the omnipotence of opinion , subduing the pride of knowledge and wisdom , destroying the dominion of prejudice , and in severing the unhallowed union of religion and vice , of unprincipled ambition and morals , of devotion and debasing ceremonies ? But they succeeded ; prejudice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the obstinate convinced ; and the religion of Jesus rapidly spread itself throughout the whole civihised world . The Apostles themselves travelled over many parts of Asia and Africa , and to the remote regions of Europe . One generation had not // passed away , before churches were established in all the land of the patriarchs , in Greece , Italy , Egypt , and the far distant countries of Ethiopia ; and this , by the means we have been considering . The spirit of persecution breathed Its venom ; the arm of tyranny was raised in anger , and the followers of Jesus were led to martyrdom . They triumphed in their fate , and gloriously tested the strength of their faith , the firmness of their principles , and the joyful hopes of their religion , by a sacrifice of their lives . And notwithstanding these appalling obstacles , this religion advanced with a celerity altogether beyond any anticipations , which could have been warranted by the most fortunate circumstances . Had it been sanctioned by the belief , and supported by the edicts of princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest worldly wisdom and attainments ; had it flattered the vanity and encouraged the vices of men ; had it appealed to their passions , their interests , their feelings ; even then , the broadest latitude of human probability could never have encouraged the hope , that its success would be so rapid , extensive , and permanent . What then shall we say , when we compare the obstacles , the means , and the results ? Is nothing but the power of man here ? Since the foundation of the world , when has the power of man been adequate to such effects ? It was a remark of one of the ancient fathers , who lived fifteen hundred years ago , to the unbelievers of his time ; If ye will not believe the miracles of the Apostles , ye must at least believe this miracle , that the world was by such instruments , without miracles , converted . ' In his opinion it was not a less wonderful , and in itself , a less incredible fact , that the Gospel should succeed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles recorded in their writings . Without referring to a supernatural agency , one is comparatively as unaccountable as the other . But the fact of the success of the Gospel is before our eyes . It is confirmed by authentic historical records . The experience of every age has given additional proof ; and one simple question remains . How is it to be accounted for ? To this question there is but one answer , and it is short . What the Evangelists wrote was true ; Christ was the power of God and the wisdom of God ; ' his religion was from Heaven , and the Apostles published it // to the world as they were instructed by him , and assisted by the Holy Spirit of the Most High . The religion of Jesus has gone forth to every quarter of the globe , taking up its abode especially in the most enlightened and civilised countries , where its claims could be examined , and its excellence estimated . It has made reason its champion , and enlisted the affections on its side . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines ; its support is in the convictions and consciences of men . Where has it prevailed , and has not carried light to the ignorant , consolation to the afflicted , and hope to the desponding ? If such a religion be not true , well may we exclaim , with the astomshed and inquiring Roman , What is truth ?
