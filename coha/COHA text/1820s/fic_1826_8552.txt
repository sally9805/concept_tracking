The principal incidents of the following humble attempt at a Domestic Tragedy , are said to have actually occurred in New England , in the latter part of the 17th Century . If objections be made to the catastrophe as improbable , the best answer is , that such an event is found recorded in the authentic history of that dark period . The author would willingly have made his lovers happy , if , as a faithful chronicler , he could have done so ; but he thought he was bound to give the story as he found it . Perhaps it may not be so well calculated for scenic representation ; but it is still more likely that any failure observable in stage effect , may be owing to the author 's want of dramatic skill .

Mary Nay , come away dear Alice , every moment Of your brief visit must be wholly mine ; Let 's leave our fathers to their grave discourse Of witch and wizard , ere we laugh outright . Alice . Alice It is a subject that the country round Deems a most solemn one . Mary . Mary True : but to me , ' T is not the less absurd on that account . Alice . Alice This levity 's misplac 'd : your father claims Your love and reverence  --  Mary . Mary And I do revere him , And love him dearly , Alice ; do I not ? How often have I striven to melt his sternness ; And , when my heart was sick of its own cares , Lock 'd up my selfish sorrows from his view , And tried , by every filial endearment , To win his smiles . E'en when his brow was darkest ; I 've brav 'd it 's terrors ; hung upon his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were methought , even to weep with him . Alice . Alice You 're an enthusiast , Mary . Ah , beware , Lest this impetuous current of your feeling Urge you , one day , against the perilous rock . Mary . Mary I 'm young , and youth is ardent , and should be Cheerful , and full of bright and sunny thoughts ; I would be if I dared . You too are young , Yet may be happy ; for you have a parent Who , tho ' he guide you safely down the stream , Does not , like angry pilots , chide , e'en louder Than the loud storm . Alice . Alice His high and holy office May , haply give to your good father 's manner , A grave solemnity , perhaps , a harshness  --  Mary . Mary And why a harshness ? Sure , ah sure , Religion Descends not like the vulture in its wrath ; But rather like the mild and gentle dove , Emblem of peace and harbinger of joy , Love in its ' eye and healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , downy soft , To nestle in the bosom of its votaries . Alice . Alice I can not argue ; I 'm content to follow Where e'er our fathers lead . For you , I fear You 've learn 'd too much from this mysterious stranger . Mary . Mary O Alice , join not you with the slanderous crowd , Against a noble lady , whom you know not . For me , be satisfied I never more Perhaps , shall see her : I 've obeyed my father ; And must , tho ' it should break my heart : tho ' Charles  --  ( Pauses , crosses to L. H. ) Alice . Alice And what of Charles ? Mary . Mary Her son  --  Alice . Alice I know : her son , And what of him ? Mary . Mary This very day , ' t is said He will be here  --  Alice . Alice Expell 'd , they say , from college . Mary . Mary Disgraced  --  ' T is false : Charles can not be disgraced ; If envy , persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not poor Charles . Alice . Alice Mary ? Mary . Mary Yes ; take my secret ; take it quickly , Or it will burst my heart . Alice . Alice Nay , but be calm . Mary . Mary You shall know all  --  surely you 'll pity , Alice , And perhaps , pardon me . Three years ago When Charles 's mother first came here to live ; From England , was it not : The village then Had scarce begun to hate her , for as yet She had not lavish 'd charities abroad , To purchase up ingratitude and envy . Being her nearest neighbour , ( my dear mother Was then alive , ) there rose at once between us That intercourse which neighbourhood compels At times , e'en with the most reserved . The lady I know not why , unless out of her goodness , Graced me with her regard , and when my mother Died , she took the desolate child to her bosom . Alice . Alice ' T was kindly done . Mary . Mary O she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she spoke , Alice , methought I saw my sainted mother Lean o'er the bright edge of a silvery cloud And smile upon her happy orphan girl ,  --  And there was Charles , so busy still around me , Exhausting all his boyish gallantries , With brotherly affection .  --  Alice . Alice Charles , still Charles ? Mary . Mary Can I forget it !  --  Alice . Alice Nay , go on . Mary . Mary The winter Soon pass 'd away , and then the spring came on With all its flowers , and still the earliest blossom Was cull 'd for me . O , we were then so happy  --  I always lov 'd the spring . Young nature then Came to me like a play-mate . Ere the snows Had left the hills , I 've often wander 'd forth , And , all impatient for the verdure , clear 'd A patch of infant green ; or even turn 'd With mighty effort , some recumbent stone , To find the fresh grass under it . Alice . Alice This is childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  would I were e'en now , As then I was  --  my life , I fear will prove A wintry waste with no green spot to cheer it ; Alice . Alice More visionary still . Mary . Mary Well , to my story :  --  My father took me home , I think it was About the time you came into the village , Fell superstition now had spread around . Reports  --  I scarce know what they meant  --  arose Concerning Isabella ; and my father Made gloomier by my mother 's death , and yielding His strong mind to the doctrine of the times , Grew daily still more stern , until at length , At peril of his curse , he bade me never To hold communion with that family . Alice . Alice And you obeyed ? Mary . Mary All that I could , I did . But O the tales they tell  --  the horrid stories  --  Her very virtues they distort to crimes . And for poor Charles , his manliness and spirit , The gayety of youth and innocence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing them as I did :  --  all others hating , Could I help loving !  --  Alice . Alice Loving , Mary ? Mary . Mary Ay ; Most deeply , strongly loving Charles and his mother . Alice . Alice But sure you have not seen this Charles ? Mary . Mary Not often .  --  Nay frown not friend , for how could I avoid it , When chance insisted on an interview ? Alice . Alice Have ye met lately ? Mary . Mary Yes . Alice . Alice What pass 'd between you ? Mary . Mary A plight of faith : A vow to live or die , Each for the other . Alice . Alice Lost , lost girl . Mary . Mary Why , ay , It may be so ; if so , ' t is Heaven 's will . You have my secret Alice . Enter from the House , Ravensworth and Walford , L. H. Alice . Alice Peace ; our fathers .

Rave . Ravensworth O , by all means , come , your romance . Mary . Mary ' T is truth . It was a wintry day , the snow was deep , And the chill rain had fallen and was frozen , That all the surface was a glittering crust .  --  We were all gather 'd in the lady 's hall , That overlook 'd the lawn ; a poor stray fawn Came limping toward us . It had lost , perhaps , It 's dam , and chas 'd by cruel hunters , came To seek a refuge with us . Every bound The forlorn creature made , its little feet Broke through the crust , and we could mark that one Of its delicate limbs was broken . A rude boy Follow 'd it fast , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose but wish its life were sav 'd , And at the word Charles ran and took it up , And gave it to me , and I cherish 'd it And bound its broken limb up ; and it liv 'd , And seem 'd to thank me for my care of it . Rave . Ravensworth But was this all ? Was not the village lad assailed and beaten ? Mary . Mary He was rude and churlish , And would have forc 'd the animal from Charles . And tho ' ' t was on his mothers ' grounds , Charles proffer 'd him The price of the fawn ; But nothing would content him , And he struck Charles ; he was a larger boy , But did not prove the stronger  --  so he went And made the village all believe his story , That Charles had robb 'd and beaten him , for Charles Had none to speak for him .

George . George Egerton But uncle , Is that your character ? Sir R. Sir Reginald Egerton Much the same thing , In christian countries , nephew ; I 'm a spy . George . George Egerton The devil ! Sir R.

I was deceiv 'd . Night came upon me ; yet , I travell 'd on , For by a civil horseman that pass 'd by I had sent letters bidding them expect me Briefly , when I had fairly lost myself I met a hunter , whose bark cabin stands A few miles hence . He put me in the track , And pointed out a cerain star to steer by ; But passing clouds , and intervening boughs , And perhaps thoughts of home , and those at home , Marr 'd my astronomy .
