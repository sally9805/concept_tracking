txt ART . IV. - The . lmerican Farmer , containing Original Essays and Selections on Rural Economy and Internal Improvements ; with illustrative Engravings and the Prices Current of Country Produce . JOHN S. SKiNNER , Editor . 5 vols. 4to . Baltimore . 1821-1824 . THE wealth of a nation , and consequently the prosperity and happiness of the community , depend on three sources of industry , usually denominated agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial . The labored discussions i , into which political economists have entered , respecting the comparative import .. ance of these modes , and the zeal with which each has been defended in preference to the other two , have been more frequently marked with local predileotions and love of theory , than with consistency and broad views of the subject . In its general and abstract sense the topic can not be discussed ; that is , it is wholly impossible to decide , upon any general principles , whether agriculture , manufacture , or commerce , affords the best field for human industry . A union of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of civilised society , and it depends wholly on the circumstances of any particular ' country , or district , whether one or the other ought to receive the greatest degree of attention . A good govern .. ment will take care to encourage them all , and to strengthen each in proportion as the others may be gaining an undue as .. cendency ; and the largest amount of public happiness will be enjoyed by that nation , in which these several branches of industry flourish together , and with nearly an equal degree of activity . It was the theory of a class of French writers on political economy , of whom Quesnai was at the head , that the only productive labor was that bestowed in cultivating the earth . // Agiieukure alone they deemed the source of the increase of v*ilue or capital , which they supposed to constitute wealth . They did *net deny that the manufacturer , who faahioned rnaterials into other forms , gave them an additional value , but they*maintained that this amounted to no more , than the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was added to the general stock of wealth . And as for merchandise , it was considered as a mere exchange , in which things of equal value were given for each other , and of course nothing was gained to the original mass . Tillthe time of Adam Smith this theory was supported with much pertina. city , and it was gravely and acutely argued , that whatever direction labor might take in accommodation to the order *ed progress of society , it actually produced nothing in the shape of wealth or capital , except when employed in the cultivation of the soil . This theory is built on an unsound basis , a false notio , vof what constitutes wealth , and the value of effects produced by labor . What is the wealth of a community but the means of subsistence , comfort , hapjiness ? That nation , which has the ability to enjoy all these in the greatest degree is the tich*st ; and labor bestowed in any way to increase the comforts and conveniences of life , is at the same time enlarging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cott. * tributes its due share in this work , but in no state of civilised society does it accomplish any more than a part . Agriculture alone wonld supply us with the necessities of life , the means *f subsistence , and here its agency would stop . Shall we call this wealth , and the only valuable product of labor ? Do we not need raiment and shelter , and is there no value lit these ? But the moment we begin to fahricate garments and build houses , we become manufacturers . Indeed , the agri .. culturalist himself must first manufacture , or procure to be manufactured , his implements of husbandry , or his labor will produce nothing . We thus see in the first place , that the product of agriculture is in itself but a small part of national wealth , and in the second place , that this can not be made to minister even to the common necessities , much less the com . forts and enjoyments of life , without the aid of manufacture . The result is very plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // This conclusion will be confirmed by eonsiderin* in what national wealth actually consists . As we have above hinted , eyerything , which can be converted by human agency into the effective means of social comfort , prosperity , and happi.4 ness , is so far an item of the wealth of the community iii which it is found . The facilities possessed by a nation for obtaining the necessaries and conveniences of life are its wealth ; or , as Mr Raymond has expressed it in a single word , it consists in the capacity for attaining these ends . A nation has lands , navigable waters , roads , canals , portions of soil devoted to agriculture , streams giving motion to machinery* harhers , . towns , and shipping suited to commerce , gold , sjlver , merchandise , and a healthy , industrious , intelligent , enterprising pQpulation engaged in all the numerous employ nients , which the organisation of society demands ; these are its capacity for supplying the wants , and multiplying the comforts of life ; these are its wealth . Labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this weakh , 1kw it is by this that all the other elements are made productive . The theory of Adam Smith differs not in reality from that of the economists . He states it in different terms , and under a modified aspect , hut when pursued to its natural limits it will run to the same extreme . He divides labor into two kinds , which he calls productive and unproductive ; the former denotes that labor , which produces a raw material , or adds to the saleable value of a material already produced ; the latter is that which leaves nothing behind it , but whose effects terminate with the exertion . The practical agricultur. * ist and mechanic are productive laborers , because they add a permanent value to some existing material ; whereas the house servant , or the man employed merely for the convenience or gratification of others , is an unproductive laborer ; he does not increase the aggregate amount of value in the community , nor of course the general stock of wealth . The unsoundness of this theory will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the author 's principles would distinguish as productive and unproductive labor . Where shall this line be drawn ? Dr Smith says between that labor , which adds value to some material , and , that which adds none . But why fix the limit here ? The author would // reply , because the first kind of labor increases value and thus accumulates wealth . Here is the fallacy . What he calls the wealth of a nation is wealth , it is true , but it is only a part of the whole , and other parts are to be sought in other sources , one of which is what he denominates unproductive labor . All labor is productive , which promotes the end it designs , and when this end is a benefit to the laborer himself , or to any other individual , it has value , and as far as it ministers to the wants or comforts society , or any members of society , it is an item of the general wealth . The labor of the servant is as really productive labor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a different way . It produces the means of living for himself , and the means of comfort for his , employer , and for every person , who is benefited by his services . That is , it adds to the mass of national wealth , not in food , or clothing , or any kind of manufactured fabrics , but in keeping up the order of society , and increasing the happiness of human existence to a certain number of individuals . So with the professional musician ; his labor accumulates nothing ; it produces the means of his own subsistence , and gives pleasure to others ; or , in other words , it produces such results , in regard to human enjoyment , as accumulated wealth would produce . The same may be said of other professions , employed in preserving the intercourse of society . They add nothing to the amount of agricultural or manufactured products , they bring no new combinations of matter into existence , yet it would be a great error to say that they are unproductive , since they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence the distinction set up by Dr Smith between differ* eat kinds of labor does not exist . The labor , which he calls unproductive , has the same properties , and produces the same effects , as that denominated productive . The purposes of social being are equally promoted by both . The division itself is arbitrary , and , if made at all , can be fixed only at one point , and that is between agricultural and all other kinds of labor . At this point the difference is sufficiently marked , inasmuch as agricultural labor is especially productive in bringing something out of the soil , which did not exist before , and thus increasing the quantity of available materials ; whereas , every other kind of labor only modifies these materials , // or puts them into new shapes , and thus gives them a value by changing their forms , and not by producing their substance . In this arbitrary sense the terms productive and unproductive may possibly be used as applied to labor . The theory will then be identical with that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agricuF. ture alone . To this extreme Dr Smith was evidently unwilling to be carried ; but , although he attempts to controvert the doctrine of the economists , his principles lead to it , and the force of his illustrations is mainly derived from their tendency to con. firm it . He estimates the value of agricultural labor as greatly superior to that of any other , because in agriculture nature labors along with man , ' whereas in manufactures nature does nothing , man does all . ' The product of this work of nature in agriculture he considers as net gain , not to be derived from labor employed in any other pursuit . It is on this ground , that he ascribes to agriculture the chief power in producing wealth , and thus leaves his theory open to all the objections urged against the economists . His mistake consists in limiting to agriculture what he calls the labor of nature , when in reality nature works as much for the artist , the mechanic , and the mariner , as for the farmer . Let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and in bringing to maturity the products of the soil ; it must also be allowed , that she works equally for the me*. chanic in sustaining the properties of matter , and enabling it to be wrought into such forms as skill or fancy may dictate . She works for the manufacturer by upholding the mechanical powers , and by lending her streams , the agency of her fires , arid her great law of attraction , to put his machinery in motiep , and give efficiency to his enterprise . She supplies the bounties of ber forests , her mines , and fields to the shipwright , and freely offers her waves and her winds to waft the goods of the merchant from one clime to another in obedience to his will . In short , without the helping hand of nature nothing could be brought to puss ; she works everywhere and at all times* and that is a fallacious theory , which claims her partiality to any particular branch of human exertion . If she does more for one than another , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more effectual control over her agency . There are two things , which give advantages to manufae-. turing industry , not common to the other branches ; first , the multiplication of machinery ; and , secondly , the division of labor . In modern times these have been carried to a great extent , and are every day increasing . Simple machinery , constructed at a comparatively small expense , and kept in motion by water power , is made to perform the labor of a vast many hands , thus leaving to be turned into other chan-* nels a large portion of labor , which , without the aid of improved machinery , would be required to produce the same effects . This advantage has no limit , as machinery may ' be multiplied indefinitely , and the power of putting it in motion , either by water or steam , is inexhaustible . The division of labor creates skill , and rapidity of operation , by concentrating all the powers of mind and habit within a small compass , and thus enabling a certain number of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish more in a given time , than it would be possible for them to do , if each were employed in constructing the entire fabric . Now these advantages , immense as they are in saving labor , are nearly confined to manufacture . The division of labor , it is true , is necessary to a certain degree in mercantile transactions , and the use of machinery adds something to the facilities of shipbuilding , yet the benefits to be derived from these sources are within a narrow space , and can never be extended far . And in regard to agriculture , the same remark will have still more force . Machinery here can do very little under any circumstances ; the implements of husbandry must always be simple , and such as will require a large portion of manual labor to use them with effect . Nor in cultivating the earth can the division of labor take place to such an extent , as to produce much benefit ; the change of seasons , and the nature of the employment , render it necessary for the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of his profession . It thus appears , that it the means of creating value , and increasing national wealth , with the least amount of labor , manufacture possesses in some respects a decided advantage over the two other branches o* industry . ' // Thi* adv*$**ge is doubtless sometimes ba1*neod*by others pertaining to agriculture and commerce , but not uniycrsally . Politic*d changes may give facilities for profitable commercial enterprise , which the manufacturer does not possess , and * *uncommonly fruitful season may enlarge the average incoriw of the farmer . The manufacturer is not affected by incjdents of this nature , any farther than they produce a fiuctualion in the market , and this is as likely to operate against him , as in his favor . These remarks apply to the different branches of industry , as they relate to individuals engaged in them , but . when we look at each in a national point of view , w*shallfind that the results of commerce have an importance by no means to be surpassed by those of either of the QtlWr branches . Society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say with Count Destutt Tracy* that commerce is the whole of society , ' any more than we , would assent to his position , that labor is the whole of riches , ' yet *ve*may venttwe to say , that all the main operations of society *se ca*ri4*d cin by commerce . A thing is valuable to us , because we can exchange it for something else , which we value more ; and whether the exchange is made in our own neighhorJ*qod , or on the other side of the ocean , the benefit is the same to us , and the purposes of life are equally answered . If aman could not exchange the proceeds of his labor , for the proceeds of the labor of others , which he wants more , he wonki gain nothing by society , nor receive any equivalent fox the independence he resigns in submitting to the social compact . The advantages of a national commerce reach to the most trivial interests of society ; it stimulates every species of industry ; the farmer labors and thrives , because the merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange articles more valuable to him . The manufacturer works for the merchant , and if commerce or exchange should stop , his labor and his profits would be at an end . Commerce aids the successful prosecution of manufacture , the fabrics of which must be widely dispersed , before they can come into the hands of the consumers . Besides , the great advantages above described , as peculiar to manufacturing industry , can only be enoyediq proportion as an outlet shall be found for manufactured products . A limit would be fixed to the multiplication of ma VOL .

Commerce not only affords employment , subsistence , and comfort , to the large portion of population engaged in its concerns , but contributes most largely to the general wealth and prosperity , strength and happiness of every country where it is pursued , by taking away such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best market for them , and returning in their room articles esteemed of more value , and producing a greater amount of social enjoyment . Industry is quickened , habits of activity encouraged , and the powers of body and mind stimulated to a more vigorous , healthful , effective exercise . But whatever may be thought of the comparative , importance of these three branches of general industry , it will not be doubted , that each is essential to the political well being of a people , and that improvement in either or all of them should be hailed as favorable to the public good . Indeed , so close is their dependence on each other , that the gaining prosperity of one is a sufficient indication of the successful progress of the other two ; agriculture must languish , if the active spirit of manufacture does not remove as fast as produced its surplus raw materials , and manufacture and commerce must flag , if the supplies of agriculture are not adequate to their demands . It is plain that agriculture is the basis of the other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise policy would bestow any extraordinary encouragement on this branch at the expense of the others , inasmuch as the state of greatest prosperity is that in which they are all mutually and equally active , yet , as the art of husbandry , like every other art , is susceptible of continued advancement , any exertions made to this end by individuals or classes of men are highly honorable and meritorious . In this country , in particular , where land is so abundant , and the labors of the agriculturalist are diffused over so wide a space , and expended with so little regard to sy*em or methodical principles , the talents and time of any one can hardly be devoted to a better service , than that of inculcating a spirit of improvement in agriculture , by collecting and making known the results of experience , drawing the attention of practical farmers to subjects of useful inquiry , leading each // to profit by the knowledge and attainments of the others , and thus teaching the art of extracting from the soil the greatest quantity of products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view of the subject , that we are inclined to approve highly the agricultural work , published by Mr Skinner in Baltimore , entitled the American Farmer . This journal was commenced in April , 1819 , in a weekly quarto sheet , and five volumes have already been given to the public . It may be stated as no equivocal test of its merits , that within the above period three editions of some of the earlier volumes have been printed , and that the demand is increasing . It has been the editor 's plan to collect from all parts of the United States such facts as he could , on practical agriculture and domestic economy , and also to give short notices of the latest agricultural improvements in Europe . In looking over the pages of his journal we have been struck with his success , particularly in executing that part of his plan relating to this country . His industry has been unwearied in bringing together facts from every quarter of the union , derived from the highest sources , and almost uniformly possessing a strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eminent farmers , expressed in their own language , and accompanied with such judicious remarks , as add to their inherent value . The work contains , also , many well written essays on the theory and general principles of agriculture , as well as on the economy of its particular departments , and in these will often be found decided marks of scholarship and science , no less than of observation and research . It is Mr Skinner 's princi .. pal aim , however , to collect and communicate facts , and thus to convince the cautious , hesitating farmer what may be done , by proving to him what has been done . In this aim he judges rightly ; the force of habit is to be broken before improvement can be expected , and in nothing , perhaps , is habit more tyrannical and obstinate , . than in traditionary modes of agriculture . Reason , and speculation , and theory will do little towards conquering these . Repeated appeals to the senses , and reiteration of facts , touching at the same time the springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unclose the eyes which prejudice had sealed . Farmers must see the path broad , and pla.in , and open , before they will venture to // Oct. walk in it , however intricate or unpromising may be the old one to which they are accustomed . This mode of combining the scattered results , which experience has brought to light in solitary instances , and putting into the hands of individuals the power of profiting by the practical skill and knowledge of numbers , affords the best and perhaps the only means of awakening attention , and ensuring a general improvement . In looking over the volumes of this work , and comparing the contents of different parts , especially the first volume with the last , it is evident that it has excited much inquiry and a spirit of observation among the farmers at the south , and turned the thoughts of many to a more careful and scientific culture . Excellent communications on subjects of husbandry are more numerous as the work advances , and minute details of the modes of successful cultivation , or of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , in the shape of essays and remarks , scattered throughout the work , on the various methods of cultivating the staple commodities of the country , such as wheat , cotton , tobacco , and Indian corn , which can not fail to be of great utility , by reason of their almost universal application . The raising of cattle , the growth of garden vegetables , the properties of different soils , the best modes of enriching lands and adapting them to particular products , these , and every other topic connected with the business of practical farming , are discussed in their due measure with such degrees of accuracy and intelligence , as the editor has been able to attain by his zeal , industry , and perseverance , through a wide correspondence . Well executed drawings are also frequently given of models , machines , agricultural implements , and of animals remarkable for their breed or other characteristics . On the list of contributors we observe the names of some of our most eminent men in all parts of the union , whose labors it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the years of care and toil , which they have spent in the high duties of political life , gaining the independence and securing the glory and happiness of a nation . The work , it would seem , is particularly patronised by agricultural societies , which are springing up in many places , and which make this paper the vehicle of their communications to the public , and some of which have chosen its volumes as agri // cultural premtums . The legislature of North Carolina has recently authorised an appropriation , to be expended in purchasing a certain number of copies for the use of the state . These testimonies are such as would of themselves prove its importance and growing influence ; and it is to be hoped , that Mr Skinner will daily find the rewards of his enterprise increased by the increasing circulation of his journal , and that his success will be such , as to . encourage him to pursue his task with the same indefatigable exertions , which have hitherto characterised his labors . In closing these remarks , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eloquent passage from Mr Biddle 's Address before the Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture , which is printed in the fourth volume of the American Farmer . If I have failed to prove , ' says Mr Biddle , that the pursuits of agriculture may be as lucrative as other employments , it will be an easier task to vindicate their pleasures and their importance . I need not dwell on that retirement , one of the purest enjoyments of this life , and the best preparation for the future , on those healthful occupations , on that calmness of mind , on that high spirit of manliness and independence , which naturally belong to that condition . These are attractions which must have deep roots in the human heart , since they have in all times fascinated at once the imagination and won the judgment of men . But I may be allowed to say , that in this nation agriculture is probably destined to attain its highest honors , and that the country life of America ought to possess peculiar attractions . The pure and splendid institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , who in other times and in other lands have lamented or struggled against oppression ; they have realised the fine conceptions which speculative men have imagined , which wise men have planned , or brave men vainly perished in attempting to establish . Their influence in reclaiming the lost dignity of man , and inspiring the loftiest feelings of personal independence , may be traced in every condition of our citizens ; but as all objects are most distinct by insulation , their effects are peculiarly obvious in the country . The American farmer is the exclusive , absolute , uncontrolled proprietor of the soil . His tenure is not from the government ; the government derives its power from him . There is above him nothing but God and the laws ; no hereditary authority usurping the distinctions of personal genius ; no established church spreading its dark shadow between him and heaven . His frugal government neither desires nor dares to oppress the soil ; and the altars of reli // 336 Oct. religion are supported only by the voluntary offerings of sincere piety . His pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directed to the common benefit of all . In multiplying the bounties of Providence , in the improvement and embellishment of the soil , in th*care of the inferior animals committed to his charge , he will find an ever varying and interesting employment , dignified by the union of liberal studies , and enlivened by the exercise of a simple and generous hospitality . His character assumes a loftier interest by its influence over the public liberty . It may not be foretold to what dangers this country is destined , when its swelling population , its expanding territory , its daily complicating interests , shall awake the latent passions of men , and reveal the vulnerable points of our institutions . But whenever these perils come , its most steadfast security , its unfailing reliance will be on that column of landed pro. * prietors , the men of the soil and of the country , standing aloof from the passions which agitate denser communities , well educated , brave , and independent , the friends of the government without soliciting its favors , the advocates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rooted like their own forests , may yet interpose between the factions of the country , to heal , to defend , and to save . ' These views are full of interest , and afford abundant materials for serious reflection . When we look at the moral bearing of the three branches of industry , their comparative power over intellect , virtue , character , habit , they stand at a wide distance asunder . Agriculture undoubtedly takes precedency far above the other two , in its salutary influence on the mind , the heart , the affections , and indeed on all the principles , which adorn and dignify human nature . Agriculturalists pursue their labors singly ; they are seldom thrown together so closely , as to be subject to the irritating circumstances incident to people living in compact bodies , where every evil passion finds nourishment , and the contagion of vice spreads rapidly , and sinks deeply into many hearts unprepared to resist its attacks , and unconscious of its secret ravages . It is a remark of Mr Jefferson , in his notes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators is a phenomenon , of which no age nor nation has furnished an example . ' That history will bear out this remark in its fullest latitude we doubt not , for it accords with reason and the nature of things . In regard to manufacture , to say nothing of its effects on morals , which are allowed on all hands not to be favorable , its tendency is to narrow and degrade the mind . // It converts man into a machine , in which no more intellect is necessary , than enough to direct its physical motions . The division of labor , from which manufacture receives one of its main advantages , operates directly to confine the range of the mind , and compel all its powers to act on a single object , however minute or insignificant . The  |p6int  of Mr Say 's observation , that to have never done anything but make the eighteenth part of a pin is a sorry account for a human being to give of his existence , ' will apply with more or less force to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a soil . This is an evil not to he avoided , and since the interests of society require it to exist , it is the part of sound policy and humanity to diminish it as much as possible by wise regulations , and an effort to direct labor into its most salutary , as well as its most profitable channels .
