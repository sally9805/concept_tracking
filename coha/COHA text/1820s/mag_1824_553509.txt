ART . V.-Greek Grammar , translated from the German of Philip Buttmann , by Edward Everett , Eliot Professor of Greek Literature in Harvard University . Boston , Oliver Everett , 1822. pp. 292 . THE grammar of the Greek language , with which the Eliot Professor has here favored the public , can not but be interesting to all scholars in our country , and particularly acceptable to instructers . Its appearance we take as a good omen , both that the pursuits of classic literature are making advances among us , and that the difference of language is not to debar us from profiting by the profound learning of the Gerinans . That the Greek grammars , which have hitherto been used in our schools , are deficient and unsatisfactory , is apparent from the frequency with which they have been changed ; and no one has yet so far supplied the necessities of instruction , as to make a new work unnecessary . The imperfections of the treatises now in use may be traced , at least primarily , to two sources . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philologists by scholars , who were not themselves acquainted with the whole extent of the subject . This is no trifling consideration ; for however easy it may be to form a new book by compilations from several others , works thus framed are inferior in clearness , method , and accuracy to those which are founded on original research . The understanding does not find its proper food in ideas , which are given at second hand ; where principles are adopted on authority , instead of patient investigation , and baldness and obscurity take the place of the clear results of continued reflection and inquiry . The other source of the deficiencies in our common Greek grammars is to be found in the circun*-stance , that the books , from which they are principally copied , were written before the authors had gone Uwough all the necessary preparatory studies . Particular grammar is a science of observation ; it can not receive a perfect form , until the whole number of individual facts has been observed and classified . To those , who first studied the subject , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed almost infinite ; the anomalies ap* peared too numerous and heterogeneous to admit of 1*ein* // arranged in a few comparatively simple divisions . But the more close investigations of modern scholars , some of whom still live to do honor to our age , has introduced order into every branch of the science , and exhibited the Greek grammar in its vast extent and beautiful simplicity . Among those , who have most contributed to the advancement of this science , the first place is justly due to Herrmann , no less for the vigor of his mind , than the variety and accuracy of his learning . In a celebrated treatise , * he called the attention of his countrymen to the subject of Greek grammar , and has not only enriched it with many original observations and acute criticisms , but by opening new views of it , has showed others in what manner the study can be successfully pursued . His work on the metres is unequalled , and may justly be taken as the most favorable standard , by which the researches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measured . His edition of Vigerus on the Greek idioms is the most esteemed , and derives no small part of its value from his own corrections and additions . But while throughout the writings of Herrmann , we admire the manly understanding of this bold and independent critic , we find ourselves sometimes appalled by his daring conjectural emendations , sometimes bewildered by bis theories , and we often desire to escape from his speculative positions to the matters of fact , which have been collected by less ingenious men . It is only as a grammarian that Matthiae can be mentioned with Herrmann ; for he holds by no means one of the highest places among the proficients in philology . In his Grammar , of which an English scholar has given a translation , we find no very profound views , not much original thought , nor proofs of a very superior understanding . Still he has been a most accurate and patient inquirer ; and he holds in his department of learning the same rank , which belongs in the natural sciences to the careful but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , for it contains an explanation of almost every form that occurs , and can be consulted as a magazine of minutest criticisms on the uses and applications of words , when taken separately , or connected // in sentences . But he is no philosopher ; and his Grammar is chiefly useful as a book of reference . But that , which Matthiae had not sufficient genius to perform , has been done by Thiersch , who is one of the most accomplished scholars of the day , possessing an elegant mind and pure taste , no less than various and profound learning . His Greek Grammar , as improved in the new edition , seems to us , not only the best of that language , but the best of any language whatever . After treating of the Attic dialect , and every subject connected with it , he has subjoined an elabo-* rate account of the peculiarities of the Epic dialect ; tracing the forms to their origin , illustrating them historically , and giving a concise hut most satisfactory analysis of the Homeric verse . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched with a few strokes , by enumerating and explaining the points in which they differ from the Epic . In the syntax , proofs of careful reflection and unwearied diligence in conducting his researches are visible on every page . The greatest order prevails throughout the whole , one proposition following the preceding with as much method as in books of geometry . A philosophic spirit pervades every part of the grammar ; and yet he never pauses to theorize or contend for speculative notions on language ; but is always true to his purpose of writing a grammar of the Greek . In his preface he laments , that ten years of his life , and those the most precious years of early manhood , should have been occupied with the pursuits of grammar ; but he has been encouraged by the general interest excited by the results of his investigations ; and now , that he has gained a high reputation as an accurate and sagacious critic , he is still young enough to enjoy the more pleasing studies , which relate to the ancient poets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Everett has given a translation , though originally designed for schools , is no abridgment or compilation , made from the works of others , but offers the fruits of long continued observation . It is now many years , since Buttmann first published his elements of the Greek language . His object was to prepare a work , which should contain only the information needed by beginners . But his plan was enlarged in consequence of the reception given to his labors by the public . Like so many of // 102 Jan* his countrymen , who concentrate the whole energies of their minds in their studies , and devote to some favorite branch of learning the best years of their lives , and all those precious moments , which others give up to pleasure , politics , or gain , he has passed a laborious life in the pursuits of grammar and criticism . As his work became extensively used throughout the best schools of Germany , he was enabled to make in it many improvements at the suggestion of practical men , or of the learned teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean time the treasures of knowledge , which are semiannually collected at the great literary mart of Leipsic , have always contained valuable additions to every branch of philology , and especially to every branch connected with the Greek language . Buttmann is an older scholar than Thiersch , and his Grammar is more firmly established as a school book . It departs , also , very much less from the usual track , and being less offensive to those , who are opposed to innovations , is best adapted to the wants of our country . We earnestly hope it may be introduced into our higher seminaries . There are two things , which may reasonably be expected in a grammarian of the Greek language ; an accurate acquaintance with the principles of general grammar , and a thorough knowledge of the peculiarities of the Greek dialects . Both these the learned Prussian possesses in an eminent degree . His countrymen , at least some of the newest school of criticism , do not think him sufficiently philosophical ; but that only means , that he does not go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent theories of the moods and tenses , and the latest definitions of the cases . Good sense and sound criticism characterize his work ; he is always clear and methodical ; repeating nothing , equally avoiding redundancies and omissions , and discussing every point with admirable brevity . Reliance may always be placed on his accu*. racy ; and where his positions differ from the usual ones , ( and in many parts , particularly in the paradigms of the verbs such differences may be found , ) the reader may be sure that the difference is the result of careful research . If any are desirous of comparing this Grammar with those now in use , we would refer them especially to the part which treats of the verb , and to the syntax . // 1824 . It would hardly become us to say h&amp;w well the Eliot Pro . fessor has performed his part as translator . His wide reputation as a scholar , and his station in the ancient and distinguished University to which he belongs , are sufficient pledges , that the translation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but mention one excellence , which is entirely his own ; we mean the distinctness and precision with which all Greek words and examples have been rendered into English . He fully expresses the idea of the original , and , without doing violence to our own idioms , translates with almost verbal accuracy those important little phrases , which illustrate the rules . When the instructer compares this with the loose manner , in which the Greek peculiarities are rendered and explained in our common manuals , and perceives how much it assists him in teaching his pupils to comprehend and translate with careful accuracy , he will feel that Professor Everett merits no small thanks for his clearness and exactness . The practical instructer may inquire , in what manner the present Grammar should be taught ; and what is the course of studies to be pursued by those who make use of it ? It is obvious from a moment 's inspection of Buttmann 's Grammar , that it requires more close application than those , which contain only the accidence and plainest principles . A judicious teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be learnt by heart , and that much must be omitted by the beginner . Those parts , which are essentially necessary , before an attempt at translation can be made , should be pointed out , and thoroughly taught ; while the rest should be reserved for a more advanced state . When this has been done , the next step is to take an elementary work , beginning with the simplest combinations of words . There should be no translation annexed , for if the learner has been properly grounded in the declensions and paradigms , he will be able without difficulty to give the root of any regular form , which he may meet , and his attention should not at first be directed to the anomalies . From the simplest sentences he should be led to those which are variously modified , and at last to those of the most artificial construction ; care being taken , that the examples selected for use illustrate the rules of grammar in regular succession . The instructer should refer to the rule , which is. to be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by frequent repetition , and show its bearings , its limits , and the exceptions . It must then be committed to memory by the pupil ; and in this the greatest accuracy and strictest adherence to the words of the book must be required ; for confusion and uncertainty follow , if the pupil be allowed to substitute expressions of his own . The first school books used in the study of every language are arranged by the Germans on this principle . With us , those of French and Spanish are so , at least in regard to the writing of exercises , and the teachers are able to say , with how great advantage . For the study of Greek , such an elementary work has been prepared by Professor Jacobs , of Gotha , and expressly adapted to the Grammar , which Professor Everett has translated . This is already announced as on the eve of being published , and will much facilitate the study of Greek , by conducting the learner methodically from the simplest union of subject and predicate , to the full harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus become acquainted with the accidence and the syntax , and learnt their application from a judicious selection , like that of Jacobs , he should at once be introduced to Homer . The Odyssey contains a variety of stories , well suited to interest and delight the boyish mind , to teach lessons of prudence and virtue , and awaken a taste for learning and literary pleasures . When we consider the influence of the Chian bard on the characters of men , the brave and disinterested spirit , which he gave to his countrymen , the many poets that have caught their inspiration from him , the critics that have become conversant with beauty and sublimity through his works , the artists , who , from the days of Phidias to our own , have found in his immortal inventions the best subjects to employ the chisel , we can not but wish , that the works , which have produced such glorious fruits wherever they have been cherished , should be studied , and understood , and valued by our young countrymen . So long as bravery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family and friendship shall be acknowledged , so long as the mild and gentle affections shall be esteemed the best safeguards against the haughty actions of men , so long as liberty shall be prized and defended , the poems of Homer will awaken sympathy and admiration // They present as a mirror the purest qualities of our nature , and since their beauties rest on the true delineations of the human passions , working within the mind , or expressed in action , they have been welcomed by every age and every nation , and are hardly less grateful to the innocence of boyhood , than to the maturity of scholarship . Herodotus , too , will have charms for the youngest ; for he unites an almost childish simplicity with an acute and inquisitive mind , a manly love of liberty , and the accuracy of a discriminating historian . In our schools and colleges we are already accustomed to read extracts from this delightful writer ; but we do not read enough , nor the proper parts . Nothing better can be i*ead in the years when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grecian victories , which began at Marathon . We should not entertain the young students with the fables , which are scattered through the first books of Herodotus , but direct him to the more inspiring matters of fact , which are contained in Erato and the three following Muses. * There is one other author we would willingly put into the hands of the young student , who desires to become acquainted with the spirit no less than the character of the Greeks ; we mean the elegant biographer of the herpes and statesmen of antiquity . Plutarch , under the disguise of translations , has gained a place in almost every modern library , and though our English version of his Lives is deficient in spirit , he still seizes on the attention , and is read with delight . It seems established by universal consent , that he is much to be recommended ; and if the Attic dialect is really to be taught , why should not this eloquent moralist be presented to the young in the polished elegance of his native language ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learner will receive no impressions but those , which are favorable to virtue and liberty ; and he will have become so far possessed of the idioms and syntax of the Greek tongue , as to be able to understand the tragedians . Thucydides is so much of a rhetorician , that he will serve as the best author , preparatory * The history of the first invasion of Darius commences at the 94th section of the sixth book . No better school book for the Greek language can be put into the hands of the young , than might be made of the residue of this book and the three following , which constitute the history of the wars with Persiti JV'eu ' Series , *L7V'O. 17. 14 // to the study of the orators . The diligent will soon mastet the difficulties of his style , and enjoy his strength , his eloquence , his rapid narration , and his skill in estimating the motives of action , and delineating the characters of men . But after all , the choice of authors should in a great measure be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business as a teacher , and understands his branch , will best be able to select those , suited to the capacity of his pupils , and calculated to excite an interest in the study of Greek letters . It is our misfortune , that we confine the attention of all to the same dull round of elementary books , instead of introducing them to the Grecian Muse herself . Our youth have the means of contemplating solitary fragments , but not of learning to admire the symmetry of a perfect whole . We instruct in a few compilations , and leave the great body of Greek literature to remain unknown , or to make friends for itself . We are in consequence exposed to many evils ; while some regard with undue admiration everything that is ancient , others depreciate the whole study of classic literature , and declare it of no practical value , because little profit has thus far resulted from the imperfect methods , by which it has been pursued . It is an intimate acquaintance with the Grecian literature , which will prove useful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seen floating at a distance in shadowy sublimity , and hold them fast , till they assume distinct shapes and intelligible voices . The Attic Muse delights and instructs as a bosom friend , when close acquaintance has worn away all that is foreign in her air , when she admits us to her confidence , and shows us by what arts she has gained her perennial youth and beauty .
