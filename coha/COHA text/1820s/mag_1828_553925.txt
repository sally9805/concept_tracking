txt ART . VII. - The Red Rover . By THE AUTHOR OF THE P1* LOT , Svv , &amp;c. 2 vols. l2mo . Philadelphia . Carey , Lea , * Carey . 1827 . WE venture but little , we apprehend , in saying that the public is exceedingly obliged to Mr Cooper for these volumes . For ourselves , we shall not he backward in declaring , that he has , in this instance , done more and better things for his name , than upon any former occasion . We the rather rejoice at this , as we have sometimes had fears of his falling off as he advanced , by a sort of &amp;helon , that is melancholy in any writer , and eminently so in the novelist . Happy the popular writer , who is thus able to stand the test of frequent appearance at the public bar ; and who , if he sometimes falter , is yet able to renew his strength , and resuscitate his slumbering energies at those secret fountains of power , that are ever flowing clear and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of genius . He thus comes with something like surprise upon a world that is getting even weary over his books , and at one wave of his enchanter 's wand ' dissipates every shadow of distrust as to his efficiency , or of conspiracy against his good fame and empire ; as an energetic king may be supposed to put an end to all treasonous murmuring against his authority and name , by his sudden appearance among the malecontents , in his panoply , and with all the ensigns of his royalty about him . It may be observed , moreover , though not an unfailing concomitant of superior powers , that this alternation of excellence and mediocrity in their productions has been common to eminent writers . Sir Walter Scott has evinced this peculiarity to a degree quite uncommon , which , in one less gifted , would have been absolutely dangerous . Some of his works anterior to the C*usaders , ' had been singularly tame and nerveless , considering their lineage and pretensions . But , in the mean time , // Maturin , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) d forthwith we find Sir Walter before us again , in his strength and stateliness , and in the transcendent grace and vigor of the Talisman , ' not only outdoing himself , but defying the possibility of being outdone , and , by one masterly effort , vindicating his great name . nil5 alternation may very naturally be the effect of a tendency to relaxation , consequent on strenuous exertion ; and in the instance of Sir Walter Scott , to recur to the standard illustration , we think we can easily discern the author of ' Napoleon ' taking some hours of gaiety and ease to himself , when he determines to dedicate a little work to Mr Hugh Littlejohn , and to write essays on agriculture . As to his Sermons , ' he needs frame none better , or more effectual , than he has aforetime put into the mouths of his own Covenanters . Upon the same principle therefore , that we have ever hailed the return of an author to the style of composition in which he seems peculiarly adapted to excel , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite element . It strikes us , that there is something a little peculiar ih the history of novel-writing in this country . Starting with a principle , correct in itself , hut like other correct principles requiring judicious application , that works of imagination should repre-* sent the character and manners of the country where they are written , our novel-writers , at least those of the second class , have made their works too purely of the soil . As though treason lay in too near an approach to the waters , or as though there were a fear that something transatlantic would there creep into their fancies , they have even avoided the lakes themselves , and make a dry-land story of it , among woods , and ravines , and wigwams , and tomahawks . The Indian chieftain is the first character upon the canvass or the carpet ; in active scene or still one , he is the nucleus of the whole affair and in almost every case is singularly blessed in some dark-eyed child , whose convenient complexion is made sufficiently light for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made to talk like Ossian for whole pages , and measure out hexameters , as though he had been practising for a poetic prize . Now , though we may applaud the spirit which has led some of our novelists to place the scene of their stories invariably and pertinaciously somewhere between the Rocky Mountains and the Atlantic ,  --  and the deeper in the forest the better ,  --  still we // must wonder at the taste that peoples them with such a mass of wild and copper men ; and moreover question the necessity , on the whole , of going hack , as a matter of course , to the precise time when the struggle was the fiercest between the colonists and these barbarians . We are aware that we are disputing the first principle which these writers set out upon ; but it appears certain to us , that there is a barrenness of the novelist 's peculiar circumstance in the life of a savage , which can not he easily got over , when we set about a story of him in his hut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome tax upon the ingenuity to throw a moderate share of interest round a narrative , founded upon events connected with these simple , silent creatures . This tax has rarely been paid to our satisfaction . In fact , the species of writing , we believe , began in mistake ; heretical as it may seem , it strikes us that there is not enough in the character and life of these poor natives to furnish the staple of a novel . The character of the Indian is a simple one , his destiny is a simple one , all around him is simple . We use the expression here in its most unpoetical sense . But mere simplicity is not all that is needed . There must be some event in the life of a hero , to keep us from growing weary of him . He must not lie upon our hands ; the author must keep him in business , and he must have more business than is comprehended in the employment of the scalpingknife or the paddle , to become the subject of our refined sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentally engaged . The savabe says but little ; and after we have painted him in the vivid and prominent colors which seem necessary to represent him amidst his pines and waterfalls ,  --  after we have set him before our readers with his gorgeous crown of feathers , his wampum , and his hunting-bow , it would seem that we have done as well as we could for him . Beyond this bare description , which indeed may be one of the most beautiful in the world , it is not easy to advance . Nature leaves us , as soon as we leave nature , in this case , and put our calm , taciturn son of the desert into the attitudes of civilized life . The Indians , as a people , offer little or nothing that can be reasonably expected to excite the novelist , formed as his taste must be on a foreign standard . View them in New Zealand or Otaheite , go through all Australasia , and then come to the wilderness of America , and the native will still be found nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . The cannibal or the rude hunter will alternately present himself ; but neither , we apprehend , with much distinctness or individuality of character . Occasionally an individual will *start forth from the herd , whom skill or strength may have raised to eminence among his brethren , and whose mind gives token of what it might have been and might have done under the hand of civilization . But the Indians exhibit little of that mixture of character in the same person , which arises from an acquaintance with the arts and artifices of life and the world , and which is the source of that adventure and interest , that must belong to a good novel . Such seems to be the insuperable obstacle in the way of those , who venture into our early wilderness for a plot . They leave the abodes of civilization , the places where incident grows out of the nature of circumstances , and where it is probable we may realize many of those pictures and variations of life that give interest and grace to the works of fancy ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian , to hurry a hero through the ordeal of Indian cruelties and indian mummery , through a series of scenes that have been a thousand times presented to us , and which admit of no change . Apart from the impossibility of remaining true to his subject , and still making the native a being of true interest in the bustling and social parts of his book , the Indian novelist has to contend with the spirit of the age , which demands , for the most part , descriptions of real life , and the display of characters who talk and act like ourselves or our acquaintance , and who have not cast off allegiance to common sense . Many by no means grey-haired among us , can remember reading the works of Mrs Radcliffe , and of Lewis , with all due reverence for their secret passages , their murtherous castles , their spectres , trap-doors , and dungeons . We can ourselves recollect , with what supreme horror we read the Mysteries of Udolpho ' in broad daylight . But how does our terrible respect for Ambrosio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose its glory beside the Tolbooth of Auld Reekie . The reign of terror is over . Eidolon has but waved his wand , and the castles of romance , those formidable piles of mystery and mischief , have vanished before its flourish , as monks and monasteries vanished before the heretical hands of the defender of the faith . ' But the public taste has undergone a change . Manners , as peculiar to some chosen period , and associated // with certain events of importance that have become matter of history , must now fill up the descriptive department of works that aspire even to the title of romances . Dialogue has superseded narration ; and in the true spirit of the drama , into which many of the best tales of the day may be resolved , characters are made to act their parts . This change of taste subjects the Indian novelist to an arduous task . He will feel the necessity of going wide of nature , in any attempt to make a varied and imposing story out of such materials as the situation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relation to the Indians , would probably afford . Hardly , indeed , from our young annals could a tale be woven , that should meet the prevailing feeling of propriety and interest in relation to this subject . Moreover the elements of society , considered implicitly as the society among the early settlements of this country , offer little in the shape of sects or classes , that is calculated to meet and satisfy the popular taste . Our retrospection affords us no privileged and important tribes of togati , full of lore and prophecy ; no bands of merry archers whose very thievery is full of romantic adventure ; and no minstrels overflowing with chivalry and song . We have no Robin Hoods , or Blue Gowns , no Vidals nor Cadwallons , and no gypsies to lend just mystery enough to our stories , and preside over the destinies of our heroes and ladies . We have none of these dim and ancient things to season our fiction withal . But it will he said , if we have anything like legendary lore , we must seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good reason that it is nowhere else to be found . But there is a fallacy in this . We belong as a people to the English school of civilization . It is not necessary that the scene of an American work of imagination should be laid in America . It is enough that it represent our character and manners either at home or abroad . Whatever of romance , or tradition , or historical fact England may boast , as material for her novelists and poets , rightfully belongs as well to us as to herself . Neither would we he understood to say , that a stirring novel may not he drawn out from Indian life and character . It can be , and it has been done . But we hold , that once done , it is , comparatively , done for ever ; and our complaint is , that we are overdoing the matter , or have been overdoing it . It is a mistaken idea also , that to constitute an American novel , either the scene must be laid in the early wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date as those connected with our // revolution , must occupy a prominent portion of its pages . It is the author , not his theatre or his matter , that nationalizes his work . Our accomplished countryman Geoffrey Crayon in his beautiful Sketches of Old England , has given us a book as essentially American as it is possible for any book to be , which is written in good taste , by a person belonging to the English school of civilization . An American work of taste can not differ from an English , as a tragedy of Racine differs from one of Shakspeare . We have been thus diffuse in our observations upon this species of fiction , which we can not better distinguish than by the denomination of indian novels , because a class of our best writers have been drawn to it , by a mistake , as it seems to us , of principle , that ought to be corrected , and because our author himself has contributed his share to this class of productions . On him , indeed , the severity of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as coming within the scope of them . He had portrayed to us enough of the Indian before the appearance of the Prairie , ' and we mistake if the public had not begun to give signs of impatience . With full sensibility to the merit of Mr Cooper 's occasionally admirable and extraordinary descriptions , we believe that Indian life and character have never been touched off to better effect than by Brown , and we doubt whether any one can improve upon his portraits . The great difficulty now is , that to fit the savage for our modern novel , the author can not rid himself of the idea , that he must strip him of half the solitary but still homely and revolting royalty of his nature ; and when he does that , he is apt to render him ridiculous . The case is still worse with the native heroines of the forest , in the attempt to bring them upon the stage , arrayed for eyes polite ; and thus , instead of a faithful example of Indian character , we have before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poetic savage , instead of the true aboriginal in the naked and strong relief which he naturally presents . While we acquit Mr Cooper , therefore , of gross violations of probability and truth , in these delineations , and charge them upon others , who may be called his imitators , still we can not release him from all responsibility on this score . We are consequently disposed to greet him the more heartily on his own element . We are always well inclined to take a sea-breeze , after toiling for long days in tangled wildernesses and heated towns . To no one , moreover , are we better inclined to submit // ourselves on ship-board , surely with no one are we more ready to pass away the time , either above or below , in calm or tempest , than with our author . The quarter-deck is his home . Upon an element that has been heretofore occupied by a spirit of poetry rather than real life ; where fancy has found little else to revel in , save the solitary and the mighty ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry through a substantial plot , as it would have been to establish houses and highways ,  --  even here has our novelist contrived to keep us through nearly two sizeahie volumes , not only contented , but absolutely delighted ; and not only with enough to see and wonder at , but with as much to interest the active mind , as can be found in the complicated intrigues of the thronged world . Throughout this tale , the interest excited is intense and untiring . There is in the very movement of a war-ship through the waters , something stirring and beautiful . The dangers she may encounter , and the glory she flings over the deep in her prosperous career , come upon us with their peculiar associations of anxiety and wonder . But when , in addition to this , the characters of the drama are all clustered on the narrow deck , and our regards are thus concentrated , it is difficult to conceive of a locus im quo of deeper or more absorbing interest . The management of the vessel , the descriptions of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low , black hull , her gliding approach to her prey , and her various graceful evolutions upon the bosom of the ocean ,  --  all these things are sketched by the hand of a master . The opening scene of the Red Rover is laid in the ancient town of Newport , on a day of mingled rejoicing and sorrow , at the capture of Quebec , and the fall of Wolfe . A mysterious looking vessel , reputed to be a slaver , is anchored in the outer harbor , and becomes an object of speculation to three individuals who are early introduced . One , and the most imposing ' of the trio , is a youth of some seven and twenty seasons , ' with a fine hearing , and an intellectual expression ' ; the second , a decided sailor of the full swing , and the other a black , very properly called Scipio Africanus . These two last , are the attached followers of Mr Wilder , so called , the person first named . While speculating on the character of the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stranger in green , who , as he is one of the important personages of the book , we shall allow the author to introduce . // He was a man between thirty and forty , and of a mien and attire not a little adapted to quicken the already active curiosity of the good-man Homespun . His person was slight , but afforded the promise of exceeding agility , and even of vigor , especially when contrasted with his stature , which was scarcely equal to the medium height of man . His skin had been dazzling as that of women , though a deep red which had taken possession of the lower lineaments of his face , and which was particularly conspicuous in the outline of a fine aquiline nose , served to destroy all appearance of effeminacy . His hair was like his complexion , fair , and fell about his temples in rich , glossy , and exuberant curls . His mouth and chin were beautiful in their formation , but the former was a little scornful , and the two together bore a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being prominent , and though in common placid and even soft , there were moments when it seemed a little unsettled and wild . He wore a high conical hat , placed a little on one side , so as to give a slightly rakish expression to his physiognomy , a riding frock of light green , breeches of buckskin , high boots and spurs . In one of his hands he carried a small whip , with which when first seen he was cutting the air , with an appearance of the utmost indifference to the surprise occasioned by his sudden interruption . ' Our new acquaintance , who according to his own story , is no more than an unworthy barrister in the service of his majesty , ' after some biting intercourse with Wilder upon maritime matters , suggested by the appearance of the slaver , is left to the prying mercies of a certain honest and warrior tailor of the neighborhood ; and it is finally agreed between them , that the ship is the ship of the Rover himself , and that by their concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be taken to secure her . We are next accompanying our barrister to the Newport ruin , a circular tower ' that overlooks the town and harbor . Here , having again fallen in with Wilder , who we now find is a young mariner in search of employment , they overhear the conversation of certain females near them , from which it appears tliat the youngest of the party , a daughter of General Grayson , of Carolina , with her governess , is about to leave the protection of her aunt , the widow De Lacey , for the residence of her father . They are interchanging remarks upon the ship in which the voyage is to be made . The author has contrived here to be quite sarcastic upon female pretensions in nautical matters ; and the affectionate propensity of the relict of the Rear Admiral , is excellently developed . The dowager de // dares her enthusiastic admiration of a ' vessel cutting the waves with her taifrail , and chasing her wake on the trackless waters , ' a doctrine that seems to operate very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party retires , is manifested in a fit of clamorous merriment , that caused the old ruin to ring as in its best days of windy power . ' The barrister here suddenly takes leave of his companion , descends , displaces the ladder , leaves Wilder in the attic of the mill , and hurries toward the town . The prisoner is soon released however by his followers , Fid and the black . We have here something of the profession . Wilder inquires if they had observed the direction the stranger had taken . " Do you mean the chap in boots , who was for shoving his oar into another man 's rullock , a bit ago , on the small matter of a wharf , here away , in a range , over yonder house , bringing the north-east chimney to hear in a line with the **26;351;TOOLONG of the ship they are warping into the stream ? " The very same. ** " He made a slant on the wind until he had weathered yonder bit of a barn , and then he tacked and stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with studding sails alow and aloft , as I think , for he made a devil of a head-way. *** That night Wilder discloses his intentions . He seeks the pretended slaver , accompanied by his faithful adherents . Here we have a sea-picture , and a sample of that fine descriptive power in which our author has never been excelled . Wilder is then shown to the cabin , and finds himself in the presence of our old acquaintance the barrister . After some preliminaries , it is settled that Wilder shall fill the place of lieutenant on board the Rover , and under promise of secrecy , and a return in the morning , he lands again in Newport . Here he seeks the residence of the dowager , and endeavors to dissuade the females from embarking in the ship before mentioned , for reasons that the reader will readily apprehend . His objections to the ship are met and answered by an old seaman ( the Rover in disguise ) , who happens to be present , and who very indignantly maintains that it is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak scandal of a wholesome and sound ship , as it is to talk amiss of mortal christian . ' The party eventually embarks in the Bristol trader , and Wilder receives a mysterious hint from the Rover to enter himself on board the same vessel , which he does , much to his satisfaction apparently , as well as the wonder of the passengers . // Then follows a series of nautical evolutions , in the endeavor of the Royal Caroline to pass to the windward of the slaver . This affords an abundance of stirring , startling , and highly poetical description . At length Wilder gets to sea , leaving the Rover at anchor , in the same beautiful but treacherous quiet in which she is first presented to us . Here we have another instance of that description , that nothing but reality can surpass . The night was rather misty than dark . A full and bright moon had arisen ; but it pursued its path through the heavens behind a body of dusky clouds , that were much too dense for any borrowed rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find its way through a covering of vapor less dense than the rest , and fell upon the water like the dim illumination of a distant taper . As the wind was fresh and easterly , the sea seemed to throw upward , from its agitated surface , more light than it received ; long lines of white glittering foam following each other , and lending , at moments , a distinctness to the surface of the waters , that the heavens themselves wanted . The ship was bowed low on its side ; and as it entered each rolling swell of the ocean , a wide crescent of foam was driven ahead , as if the element gambolled along its path . ' That ni0ht there is hot pursuit , and Wilder drives his ship under a cloud of sail . The Royal Caroline , seemed , like her crew , sensible of the necessity of increasing her speed . As she felt the pressure of the broad sheets of canvas that had just been distended , the ship bowed lower , and appeared to recline on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scuppers . On the other side , the dark plank and polished copper lay bare for many feet , though often washed by the waves , that came sweeping along her length , green and angrily , still capped , as usual , with crests of lucid foam . The shocks , as the vessel tilted against the billows , were becoming every moment more severe ; and from each encounter , a bright cloud of spray arose , which either fell glittering on the deck , or drove , in brilliant mist , across the rolling water , far to leeward . ' The approach of a tornado is depicted with surpassing power in the following passages . Wilder made a swift turn or two on the quarter-deck , never ceasing to bend his quick glances ' from his silent and profoundly expectant crew to the dim lines of spars that were waving above his head , like so many pencils tracing their curvilinear and wanton images over the murky volumes of the superincumbent clouds . ' In a monient twenty dark forms were seen leaping up the rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful sheets of canvass were effectually rendered harmless , by securing them in tight rolls to their respective spars . The men descended as swiftly as they had mounted to the yards , and then succeeded another short and breathing pause . At that moment a candle would have sent its flame perpendicularly towards the heavens . The ship , missing the steadying power of the wind , rolled heavily in the troughs of the seas , which , however , began to be more diminutive , at each instant ; as though the startled element was recalling , into the security of its own vast bosom , that portion of its partides which had , just before , been permitted to gambol so madly over its surface . The water washed sullenly along the side of the ship , or as she laboring rose from one of her frequent falls into the hollows of the waves , it shot back into the ocean from her decks in numberless little glittering cascades . Every hue of the heavens , every sound of the element , and each dusky and anxious countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moment . ' Our limits will not allow us to extract as freely as we wish we hazard the following , however , which we think is not surpassed by any passage in the volume . The topsail is cut away from the extremity of the yard . The canvass broke from its fastenings with a loud explosion and for an instant was seen sailing in the air , ahead of the ship , as though sustained on the wings of an eagle . ' The Caroline is wrecked and deserted by the crew , in a state little short of mutiny . Wilder and his female companions are saved by committing themselves to the launch . The scene here is fearful and thrilling to the last degree , and furnishes one of the best efforts of the author . The ship is about to go down . His companions saw the change , but not for the empire of the world , could either of them have uttered a syllable . Another low , threatening , rumbling sound was heard , and then the pent air beneath blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion like that of a gun . Now grasp the ropes I have given you , ' cried Wilder , breathless with his eagerness to speak . His words were smothered by the rushing and gurgling of waters . The vessel made a plunge like a dying whale , and raising its stern high into the air , glided into the depths of the sea , like the leviathan seeking his secret places . The motionless boat was lifted with the ship , until it stood in an attitude fearfully approaching to the perpendicular . As the wreck descended , the bows of the launch met the element , // burying themselves nearly to filling ; but buoyant and light , it rose again and struck powerfully on the stern by the settling mass ; the little ark shot ahead , as though it had been driven by the hand of man . Still , as the water rushed into the vortex , every thing within its influence yielded to the suction ; and at the next instant the launch was seen darting down the declivity , as if eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long formed a dependant , through the same gaping whirlpool , to the bottom . Then it rose , rocking to the surface ; and , for a moment , was tossed and whirled like a bubble circling in the eddies of a pool . After which , the ocean moaned , and slept again ; the moonbeams playing across its treacherous ho som , sweetly and calm , as the rays are seen to quiver on a lake , that is embedded in sheltering mountains . ' The next day , they discover the pinnace , in which the mutineers had deserted , a wreck upon the waves ; and there soon follows an appalling spectacle . This passage , though a fine one , is weak at its close ; and shows the mischief of surplusage in describing a palpable and terrible scene . A grim human form was seen , erect , and half exposed , advancing in the midst of the broken crest , which was still covering the dark declivity to *vindward with foam . For a moment it stood , with the brine dripping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the deep , to turn its frightful features on the spectators ; and then the lifeless body of a drowned man drove past the launch , which , at the next minute , rose to the summit of the wave , to sink into another vale , where no such terrifying object floated . ' The survivors are discovered , and taken on board the Rover . Then follows a sea scene of some mummery , and with something too that is legitimate , in which Fid and the black have occasion to exhibit themselves in a light that engages the attention of the pirate . He orders them before him . Then came Fid , followed by the negro , rolling along the deck and thumbing his hat with one hand , while the other sought an awkward retreat in a part of his vestments . " You have done well , my lad ; you and your messmate . " " No messmate , your honor , seeing that he is a nigger , " interrupted Fid. - " The chap messes with the other blacks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in company . " " Your friend , then , if you prefer that term . " " Ay , ay , sir ; we are friendly enough at odd times , though a breeze often springs up between us . Guinea has a d-d awkward fashion of luffing up in his talk ; and your honor knows it is n't always comfortable to a white man to be driven to leeward by a // black . I tell him it is inconvenient . He is a good enough fellow in the main , howsomever , sir ; and as he is just an African bred and born , I hope you 11 be good enough to overlook his little failings . " " Were I otherwise disposed , " returned the Rover , " his steadiness and activity to-day would plead in his favor . " " Yes , yes , sir , he is somewhat steady , which is more than I can always say in my own behalf . Then , as for seamanship , there are few men who are his betters ; I wish your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the heart he turned in the main stay , no later than the last calm ; it takes the strain as easy as a small sin sits on a rich man 's conscience. , * " I am satisfied with your description . You call him Guinea ? " " Call him by anything along the coast ; for he is no way particular , seeing he was never christened , and knows nothing at all of the bearings and distances of religion . " At this stage , the Rover sees fit to let Wilder a little into his history ; but it is too vague , to allow us to gather from it sufficient reason for his abandoning himself to the desperate course of life in which we find him . The conversation between the freebooter and his female passengers is sometimes well sustained ; but there is something unnatural in his tone , as long as we are not aware , that he is conscious who is before him ; and it seems quite out of place as well as character , for Gertrude to rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of the Book of Job . During this portion of the time , also , Master Fid discloses something of the history of Wilder , that seems to excite the peculiar attention of the governess . A sail is discovered . Among the opinions gathered upon this interesting topic , that of the black is hit off with admirable humor . " I ask you , if the stranger may not be a dozen tons larger or smaller than what you have named ? " continued the Rover . " H'em just as massa wish em , " returned Scipio . " I wish him a thousand , since he will then prove a richer prize. , * I s'pose he 'm quite a t'ousand , sir. ** " Or a snug ship of three hundred , if lined with gold , might do . " " He look berry like a t'ree hundred . " " To me , it seems a brig . " I t'ink him brig too , massa . " " Or , possibly , after all the stranger may prove a schooner , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often carry a royal , " continued the black . " And you think it questionable , whether it be a sail at all ? " // " H'em sartain nothing but a fly-away . " Fid soon interposes . " What the devil do you take it for , Guinea ? a church ? " " I t'ink him church , " responded the acquiescent black . " Lord help the dark-skinned fool ! Your honor knows that conscience is damnably overlooked in Africa , " ' &amp;c . The Rover 's critique upon his crew is well managed ; though somewhat out of season . Among others , the author has attempted a portrait of the Yankee , we guess , and one quite excellent in its way . The display of flags to the stranger sail , is in the best style of nautical coquetry . After showing other signals , the Rover 's orders are to " Let him see the taunting drapeau blanc . " Wilder obeyed in silence . The field of Portugal was hauled to the deck , and the white flag of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered in its elevated position , before a broad , glossy blazonry rose , like some enormous bird taking wing , from the deck of the stranger , and opened its folds in graceful waves at his gaft . The same instant a column of smoke issued from his bows , and had sailed backward through his rigging , ere the report of the gun of defiance found its way , against the fresh breezes of the trade , to the ears of the Dolphin 's crew. * There appear to be other indications of hostility on board the ship of the crown . " Hark ! t is a drum . The stranger is going to his guns . " The Rover listened a moment , and was able to catch the well known beat which calls the people of a vessel of war to quarters . ' - " We will imitate his example , Mr Wilder ; let the order be given. ** Battle , however , for the present is avoided . The Rover hoists the flag of England , and under it , goes on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander , discovers that Wilder is an officer attached to the vessel , and returns in safety and unsuspected to his own ship . There occurs here a good opportunity for a display of some moral sense , which is very properly made use of ; and though discovered , the Rover offers XVilder and his female charge free passage to the King 's ship , where the ancient captain is sufficiently edified , in learning that he had had the honor of receiving the Red pirate in his very cabin . Wilder , under the white flag , becomes the bearer of terms of capitulation , which are refused , and a sea-fight ensues . // What the Rover 's guns did not effect , is finished by a hurricane , and the Dart ' falls a prize to the freebooter . The death of Scipio Africanus unravels the plot , and affords a few passages of homely , hut natural and inimitable pathos . The chaplain proposes prayer for the dying negro . " I do n't know-I do n't know ! " answered Fid , gulping his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , as in the brightest and happiest of his days . " When there is so little time given to a poor fellow to speak his mind in , it may be well to let him have a chance to do most of the talking . Something may come uppermost which he would like to seiid to his friends in Africa ; in which case , we may as well be looking out for a proper messenger . Hah ! what is it , boy ? You see he is already trying to rouse something up out of his ideas . " " Misser Fid-h'em take a collar , " said the black , struggling for utterance . " Ay , ay , Guinea ; put your mind at ease on that point , and for that matter , on all others .

" The negro made a fruitless effort to rise , endeavoring to grasp the hand of the other , saying as he did so " Misser Fid beg a pardon of a black man ! Masser aloft forget h'em all , misser Richard ; he t'ink em no more . " " It will be what I call a d-d generous thing if he does , " returned Richard , whose sorrow , and whose conscience , had stirred up his uncouth feelings to an extraordinary degree .

" ' Wilder proves to be the child of the governess , who in her turn proves to be the widow of De Lacey , a son of the admiral of the same name ; and , as a proper conclusion of matters on deck , the prisoners are released , and the Rover retires . The next day he suddenly alters his course of life , disperses his // crew , sets tire to and blows up the Dolphin , ' while himselt , and another intimately connected with him , escape in some mysterious manner . Twenty years after this time , he lands as mysteriously in Newport , is discovered to he a brother of Mrs Dc Lacey , and dies under her roof , and with his kindred about him .

All this may arise from a very poetical state of feeling , that throws a kind of glare over every object ; arid it no doubt very naturally accompanies the peculiar excitement of the finale . But it is to be avoided , as there is a chance that the mass of readers are looking forward to a clear catastrophe , and are not always able , perhaps , to participate fully in the emotions of the writer . In the delineation of the Rover , again , it occurs to us that there is something objectionable . There is too much poetry about him . It is not , in all respects , the natural character of a man who has so long led a life of peril and depravity , and spent the better part of his days in the reckless swing of desperation .
