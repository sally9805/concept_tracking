txt ART . II. - Lectwres on the Philosophy of the Tluman Mind . By the late THOMAS BROWN , M. D. Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh . 4 vols. 8vo . Edinburgh , 1820 . First American Edition , Andover , 1820 , 3 vols. 8vo . Second American Edition , Philadelphia and Charleston , S. C. 1824 , 3 vols. 8vo . DR BRowN 's posthumous work , the title of which we have prefixed to the present article , consists of one hundred Lectures . We have already given to our readers the substance of fiftyone , in our review of a Sketch , * drawn up by the lecturer himself , for the use of those who attended his class . As this is the last time that we shall formally present him to the public , we shall subjoin to our concluding rapid analysis of his philosophical works , such notices as we have been able to obtain respecting his life and character , together with a few summary criticisms on his genius and writings . It will be remernbere4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two general divisions , viz , the External Affections of the mind , and its Internal Affections . The former comprehended our sensations , including our muscular feelings ; the latter involved our intellectual states of mind , together with our emotions . We exhausted the analysis of the first division , and proceeded as far as through the intellectual states in the second . The Emotions remain now to be considered , before completing the author 's system of the Physiology of the Mind . He declines venturing on a definition of Emotions , affirming that the attempt would be as truly impossible , as to define // sweetness , or bitterness , a sound , or a smell , in any other way , than by a statement of the circumstances in which they anse . Perhaps so ; yet , though one could not define a taste or a sound , it would be strange to philosophise upon either of them , without any reference whatever to the palate or the ear , which are their apj ) ropliated organs . Our author is liable to the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called the topical peculiarity of the Emotions . It must be familiar to the experience of every individual , that the seat of this class of feelings is the region of the praxordia . The author had already allowed the specific connexion between our intellectual states and the nerves and brain , which renders his omission on this point the more observable . He exposes himself to evident embarrasstnent and inconsistency throughout the work , by representing the mind as the immediate seat , both of the Intellectual States and Emotions . We believe that the alone true , intelligent , self active , immaterial , immortal principle lies , if we may so express ourselves , behind the reaions of the two classes of feelings abovementioned , and communicates in some inexplicable way with both of them . There is certainly something Witl ) in us , which compares one intellectual state with another , one emotion with another , and intellectual states with emotions . This is within the experience of all . But respecting the simple or compound nature of this interior principle , we hold all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The author 's general principle of arranging the Emotions is their relation to time . They are Immediate , or involving no notion of time whatever ; Retrospective , or relating to the past ; Prospective , or relating to the future . Admiration , remorse , hope , may serve as particular instances to illustrate this distinction . We admire what is before us ; we feel remorse for some past crime ; we hope some future good . Were they considered only as elementary feelings , without any regard to time , the emotions , he says , might be reduced to the following descriptions ; joy , grief , desire , astonishment , respect , contempt , and the two opposite species of vivid feelings , which distinguish to us the feelings , that are denotninated virtuous or vicious . Such a consideration of them , // 21 however , would be much more abstract , uninteresting , and inapplicable to human life and conduct , than the method Which he has adopted . The immediate emotions are subdivided into those , which do not involve any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do involve some mo*al affection . The following are our immediate emotions of the former kind . Cheerfulness , melancholy , wonder , mental weariness , the feeling of beauty , disgust , our feelings of sublimity and ludicrousness . To the latter subdivision may be referred the vivid feelings , that constitute to our heart what we distinguish by the names of vice and virtue , considered apart from the mere intellectual judgments we form respecting actions ; our emotions of love and hate ; of sympathy with the happy and with the miserable ; of pride and humility . The retrospective emotions are subdivided as they relate to others and to ourselves . Those , which relate to others , are anger and gratitude . Those , which relate to ourselves , are , simple regret and satisfaction , without the mixture of any moral feeling ; and finally , remorse and self approbation . The prospective emotions comprehend all our desires and all our fears . Of the former , the most important may be considered as enumerated in the following series . First , our desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it may yield ; secondly , our desire of pleasure , considered directly as mere pleasure thirdly , our desire of action ; fourthly , our desire of society ; fifthly , our desire of power , direct , as in ambition , or indirect , as in avarice ; seventhly , our desire of the affection or esteem of those around us ; eighthly , our desire of glory ; ninthly , our desire of the happiness of others ; and , tenthly , our desire of the unhappiness of those whom we hate . ' The following * ) aragraph on this subject , is a happy specimen of the author 's analytical skill , and of the gracefulness and facility , with which he makes the common nomenclature of our mental feelings fall into his own philosophical arrangements . I must observe , however , in the first place , that each of these desires may exist in different forms , according to the degree of probability of the attainment of its object . When there is little of any probability , it constitutes what is termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes what is called hope ; with // still greater probability , expectation ; and , with a probability that approaches certainty , confidence . This variation of the form of the desire , according to the degrees of probability , is , of course , iot confined to any l ) articilar desire , but may run through all the desires , which I have enumerated , and every other desire of which the mind is , or may be supposed to *e capable . ' Lecture 55. in the spirit of the foregoing paragraph , the reason why no peculiar place is set apart for the passions in this classification , is , that our passions are truly no separate class , but merely a name for our desires , when very vivid , or very perman ent . Dr Brown , also , goes into no separate classification of our fears , since it is evident that they are excited by precisely the same objects , which excite our desires . We desire to obtain any object , we fear that we shall not obtain it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope , that we may escape it . Thus , our fears and our desires are correlative feelings , and whatever is said of the one , may be referred , by a kind of contrasted application , to the other . We have thus given only a rough synopsis of the author 's arrangement of the emotions . He devotes to them twenty one of the hundred lectures . This portion of the book will probably be found the most popular and interesting of the whole . It is generally rich and delightful writing , with the exception of some commonplace prosing , and a little occasional declamation . The author separately considers each article in the foregoing ample catalogue , metaphysically , morally , and theologically . His speculations on this department of his science , would well bear dividing into a number of profound and elegant essays . They are adorned with a variety of apposite and beautiful illustrations , from rather a limited but very select range of reading . Perhaps the most felicitous and striking traits , in this busy picture of the emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each of them was introduced into our mental constitutions . The wisdom and goodness of the Creator are here very impressively vindicated . Even anger , hatred , and other passions , most generally liable to abuse , are shown to bear their necessary part in that harmonious arrangement , which provides for the happiness of the species . But this consideration leads the author to establish safe lines of distinction , and // 23 to deduce from an enlightened view of our whole nature a body of excellent moral rules . To attempt even a slight sketch of the acute and profound disquisitiotis , the exquisite analysis , the fine sensibility , the sterling good sense , the eloquent and earnest recommendations of morality , the examination and confutation of many opinions and theories of Alison , Hutcheson , Smith , Stewart , and other philosophers , which these twentyone lectures exhibit , would be a task , agreeable indeed to ourselves , and profitable to our readers , but far too disproportioned to other purposes , for which this Journal is designed . Among the very few topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissent from the ingenious author , is that of Avarice . It will be seen , in his enumeration of the Desires above represented , that he regards avarice as only a modification of our desire of power . We are persuaded , that this is an inaccurate reference of the real and original princ4le of the emotion in question . Avarice is often exercised without regard to the attainment of any kind of power whatever . It loves money and property purely as such , and not for the gratifications they can purchase . Dr Brown was aware of this phenomenon , and felt its inconsistency with the above classification of the desire . He labors at great length , and quite unsuccessfully , to account for this obvious anomaly in his system . He falls into a maze of his own creating , by first ranking avarice as an indirect desire of power , and then finding that it is not always a desire of power . He wonders , through a whole lect ( ire , why the miser should be so eager to deny himself all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only real value is , that it can purchase , and is the representative of those very renounced gratifications ! Would not our author 's perplexity and inconsistency have been very easily prevented , by only adding an eleventh class of desires to the ten already laid down ? Does not avarice flow from a distinct , original , and independent emotion , namely , a love of hoarding , or , as our author would have called it , the desire of acquisition ? The child hoards its shells and pebbles , the virtuoso his curiosities , the collector his hooks , the scholar his intellectual stores , and the miser his gold , almost entirely for the gratification of this simple and separate propensity , with comparatively a faint and for. * // tuitous influence of other motives . And to pursue a favorite train of the author 's speculation , before alluded to , it is well for us that our Creator has implanted in our minds this particular desire . Iii His prospective benevolence , indeed , it was intended to be a direct means of acquii'ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often ftilfils this intention blindly . An inattention to the distinction here pointed out misled the author , we doubt not , into his defective classification . Were it not for the strong operation of the instinctive propensity we are suggesting , man must often have perished through want , the consequence of carelessness arid improvidence . We were not left to calculate the benefits resulting from frugality , nor to wait until we should smart from privations , occasioned by lavishness and inexperience . A desire of mere acquisition , therefore , seems to be a compensation *ms beautiful as it is indispensable , in this fluctuating and precarious world . A too great indulgence of the feeling , of course , becomes , like an abuse of all our other desires , criminal and mischievous . It was probably in consequence of not adverting to this indubitable law of our mental constitutions , that Dr Brown , in endeavoring to account for the ur1reasonahle excesses of avarice , which are sometimes witnessed , was led to lay a very disproportionate stress on the regret , that arises from early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard this regret , as the original foundation and main ingredient of the passion . We are constrained to question the correctness of this theory . Who has not known instances of a decided bent for avarice , which could be traced up to the earliest period after infancy , when it was impossible that the little miser could have felt any inconvenience , or regret , arising from prodigality or extravagance ? Fasten down the cover of a box , perforate it for a small aperture , persuade your child to convey to it every coin that is given him , tell him to search for money on the parade ground early in the morning after each muster day , instruct him to bargain away his cake and his toys for cash , deliver to him , perpetually , short solemn lectures and cautions on the propriety of saving and hoarding his money , and such discipline , acting on the native desire for which we have been contending , will soon convert him into a sordid wretch , long before he shall have experienced // 25 one feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact he never devours . Regret for squandered means , we allow , is often one , among the many other circumstances , which Dr Brown has so happily enumerated , as enhancing and aggravating the force of the avaricious principle , and may sometimes awaken and develope it , when it has slept for a long time . But we can not belfeve it to be the mainspring of the passion itself , nor sufficient , especially , to remove the embarrassment , which the author has encountered in the exposition of his theory . Even should the separate desire , on which we insist , be denied , still we would account for most of the workings of avarice on fat ' different principles from this regret . Bitt we forbear to trust ourselves now with the discussion . Dr Brown has with great felicity assigned several reasons , for the paradox in common life , of a person parting . He might have accounted for this lattet ' case , in soirte instances , not so much from merely avaricious feelings , as from the shame of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an intolerable thoiigl*t , that the market man , with whom they are trading , will wink , in half penny triumph , at his brother market man , as soon as their hacks are tttrned . Many , also , contend long for a trifle , from a pure sense of justice . We come now to the consideration of our authot " s Ethical System . The Science of Ethics , he observes , has relation to our affections of mind , not simply as phenomena , but as virtuous or vicious , right or wrong . What then is the virtue , which it is the practical object of this science to recommend ? Why do we consider certain actions , says Dr Brown , and we could add , certain feelings , as morally right , and othem 's , as morally wrong ? The only test , according to him , is a siml ) le emotion of approbation , or of disapprobation . We are so constituted , that we can not help approving certain classes of ' human actions , and disapproving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relish for wholesome food , and a distaste for what is injurious , has , for analogous , but far higher purposes , created us subject to such immediate moral feelings . // These emotions , our author contends , are uniform in all men , hut occasionally modified by three circumstances . First , the influence of passion obliterates for a time , in many minds , the emotions that ought to arise on the contemplation of moral or immoral actions . Secondly , individuals , and even whole nations , have sometimes partial and imperfect views of the true tendencies of cei*tain actions , in which there is a mixture of good and evil , and this is the cause why morality appears to fluctuate in different times and places . Thirdly , association , in various ways , exerts considerable influence in modifying and perverting the emotions , which would otherwise be naturally raised by particular kinds of actions . The author insists , that these three limitations still leave unimpaired the great fundamental distinctions of morality itself , the moral approbation of the producer of unmixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who produces unmixed evil for the sake of evil . He refutes the sophistry and skepticism , which pretend that , in consequence of the foregoing limitations , the science of morality is unsettled , and virtue itself but a precarious and fluctuating name . He maintains , that where one instance can be found of disagreement among men , in approving certain actions and disapproving certain others , there are millions and millions of instances , all over the world , of a perfect uniformity of moral sentiment . The author next proceeds to examine other theories of Incrality , which have been broached by different writers . Hobbes , who makes virtue to depend on political enactment ; Mandeville , who reduces it to a corrupt love of praise ; Clarke and Wollaston , who identify it with the fitness and the truth of things ; Hu me , who measures it solely by the standard of general utility ; the ancient and modern disciples of Aristippus , who resolve it into the pursuit of selfish gratification ; Paley , who defines it to be the doing good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the sake of everlasting happiness ; ' and Dr Smith , who allows it no other standard , than our sympathy with the feelings of others , are successively subjected to elaborate confutations . In these strictures we see displayed an instinctive acuteness , in seizing the points at issue , and an unrivalled power of argument . The author , of course , throughout the whole speculation , says // many things to justify and illustrate his own system of morality , and mode of treating it . We have a few remarks to suggest . rhe great defect of Dr Brown 's ethical theory is , that he has confined his attention entirely to actions , which are only the occasional signs and representatives of virtue and vice in moral beings . We admire his discovery , as it may well be called , and on which another superior mind of our own country , * by a remarkable coincidence , has lighted , that certain feelings of vivid approval and disapproval are the true and original tests of right and wrong . As the physical qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and described , by their effects on our senses , and not by vain attempts to ascertain their abstract nature , so the moral qualities of thinking and responsible agents are to be designated by their effects on other minds . This , indeed , is an ingenious , a noble principle ; it is a bright eyed offspring of the Baconian philosophy ; it is the J ) ioneer to satisfactory conclusions on the subject before us ; it introduces at once a flood of light into this hitherto perplexed and obscure discussion . But having seized on the mighty instrument itself , Dr Brown seems to have failed in applying it with his usual comprehensive energy . In inquiring what objects , when contemplated by us , excite the approving , or disapproving emotion , he has strangely omitted the consideration of those mental feelings9 or rather states of mind , which , in the first place , give to actions their entire moral character , and , in the second place , constitute , by themselves , more than nine tenths of the vice and virtue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simple indifference to the welfare of others we disapprove as vice . A mere intention , a wish , is often virtuous or vicious . Refraining from action is frequently virtue or vice . Mere purity of mind we regard with the approving glow , which is paid to active virtue . Regret , shame , anger , joy , and other emotions , are regarded as right or wrong , according to the occasions on which they arise . It is not the blush that we admire and approve ; but the modesty , of which that meteor like tinge is the enchanting signal . It is not the mere phantasmagorial sight of a man , exposing // his life to save a drowning enemy , that excites within us the vivid feeling of approbation ; it is the sublime state of his soul at the moment , and which the action itself is only instrumental in making known . Now , in consequence of not adverting to these essential considerations , Dr Brown has leftthi s part of his ethical discussions in no little iniperfectiori and perplexity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our constitution , that certain actions excite within us the approving or the disapproving feeling , by which we distinguish them as virtuous or vicious . He speaks as if the moral nature of every action was immediately and intuitively known , as right or wrong , in the same manner as a color is immediately recognised as green or yellow . He takes no account of that long and varied thread of experience , observation , acquisition , reflection , deduction , culture , admonition , discipline , and example , by which moral feelings and ideas are developed in the mind of the child , and by which alone it comes at length to form its juigments of the character of moral actions . This , certainly , is a loose handling of the question , a very imperfect analysis of the matter under discussion . If , therefore , the fore*oi ng reflections are just , the true and amended theory of Di Brown , the really ultimate law of our moral institutions , for which he sought , would be this . Certain emotions , desires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are made known sometimes by actions , soruietimes by other sensible signs , and sometimes by verbal information , more or less direct , excite within us the vivid feeling of approbation , or disapprobation , corresponding to which , we are accustomed to denominate those states of mind , and the actions they produce , virtuous or vicious , right or wrong , moral or immoral . We are the more confirmed in this amendment of our author 's philosophical views , from its coinciding with the principles of morality inculcated in the Sermon on the Mount . It is from this point , we humbly think , that all ethical science must properly begin . Its adoption , we are persuaded , would have supplied a palpable defect in the work before us , and saved some readers many an hour of wistful dissatisfaction and perplexity . It is no more correct to confine the question to actions , than to the looks of the countenance . A tolerably // plausible system of morals might be built on the latter , as well as on the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be complete or scientific , which confined the inquiry to the shape of the gnomon , and the motions of the shadow alone , while the primary consideration of the sun s movements and rays remained untouched ? Our author , in the outset of tle discussion , seems fo have had a glimpse of the principle we have been urging , but certainly lost sight of it afterwards . He defines the Science of Ethics , as having relation to our affections of mind , as virtuous or vicious , right or wrong . Then why not proceed , and erect the science upon this bioad and true foundation ? Why abandon it almost imnediately , and say , One inquiry alone is necessary* what actions excite in us , when contemplated , a certain vivid feeling ? ' *c . Edin . Ed . Vol. 4 , p. 148 . And . Ed . Vol. 3 , p 267 . We trust we have sufficiently shown the very narrow and incomplete relation , which this particular inquiry bears to ethical science as a whole . In inquiring what constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be aiming at a theory of too much situiplicity . To feel , ' says he , the character of approvableness , in an action , which we have not yet performed , and are only meditating on it as future , is to feel the moral obligation , or moral inducement to perform it . ' The late Professor Frisbie seems to have been dissatisfied with this explanation , but in his criticism upon it , has not , we think , exactly approached the difficulty . Are there not many actions , ' he asks , which seem to us to have very little virtue or merit , yet by which the feeling of obligation is very strongly excit.ed ; nay , is not the obligation often inversely as the merit , as for example , in regard to the payment of honest debts ? * To these interrogatories we reply , that the obligation , which Professor Frisbie instances , is not properly or entirely a moral obligation . Without being apparently conscious of the facts , he has shifted the very point in question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something more than the sense of moral obligation ; there is the sense of legal obligation ; there is also the dread of offending society , creating enemies , and thus injuring one 's general interests . // Let a law be passed exonerating the debtor ; let public opinion too coincide with the law . There will then be merit in paying the debt , and a merit exactly in proportion to the moral obligation . In what respects then may it be said , that Dr Brown 's theory is deficient ? According to our opinoii , he has , undesignedly , however inconsistently with himself , suggested the precise and true theory in a subsequent part of his speculations . The following sentence occurs in p. 395 , Vol. 4 , Edin . Ed. towards the close of Lect. 91 . When I say , that it is my duty to perform a certain action , I mean nothing more than that if I do not perform it , I shall regard myself , and others will regard me , with moral disapprobation ** Here , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nature of moral obligation . It is not enough for us simply to approve an action , in order to feel the whole force of such obligation the very word obligation implies some conditional compulsson , constraint , apprehended penalty in case of our neglecting the duty . Now , what is the penalty implied in the idea of moral obligation ? Surely , as our author suggests above , the pain , which all moral beings feel in disapproving themselves , or being disapproved by others . It is this which we dread ; it is this which constrains us . The moment we allow a fear of any other nature than this to operate upon us , such as a dread of corporal punishment , or bodily pain of any other kind , or an injury to our general interests , the moral changes into the character of physical obligation . Dr Brown 's distribution of the Duties is the old and obvious one of duties to others , to ourselves , and to God . His treatment of this subject completes the work , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and similarly modified , with that bestowed on his treatment of the more general subject of the Emotions . Curious speculations are pursued , current errors are refuted , novel and valuable ideas are advanced , magnificent commonplaces are unfurled and waved about , and over the whole is diffused a vivid glow of * Just to show the author 's iuconsistency with himself above alluded to , turn over one leaf of his hook , and there will be seen the following sentence . It is , as I have said , on the one simple feeling of moral approvableness , that every duty , and therefore , every right is founded . ' But in the sentence in the text , has he not said that the sense of duty arises from a fear of disapprobation * // moral and religious feeling . A few lectures , perhaps , in this portion , require a little bracing up of the attention to read them through ; one needs a perpetual recollection , that one of our principal duties is to read Dr Brown 's inculcation of the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , 1 will go on . In all probability , these few lectures were written under the infiuen6e of the same feeling . Yet somewhat tedious as they are , they will repay a studious perusal . Nor are many of them fairly liable to the foregoing stricture . On the contrary , several will be found to exhibit the author 's peculiar vivacity , originality , and other excellencies . Instance the beautiful and ingenious lecture on friendship and gratitude , and one on the goodness of the Deity . In treating of our duties to God , the author takes occasion to demonstrate the existence and attributes of the Almighty Being . He rightly discards the argument a priori , which forever assumes the very point to be proved . He relies altogether on the short , simple , but irresistible argument drawn from the appearances of benevolent design , so profusely scattered over every part of the universe . XVe are dissatisfied with his attempted demonstration of the unity of God , and never yet have felt the force of the same point of reasoning when urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simplicity of design , everywhere exhibited in the works of the Creator . Two objections to this argument we can not conquer . The first is , that it would be not very difficult to make out a case of irreconcilable contrariety and multiplicity of design , apparent in the works of nature . For instance , in one point of view , what tender care seems to be taken of the happiness of all living creatures , while , in many respects , they seem to be left , with utter indifference , to their miserable fate . The second is , that even if a perfect unity of design , without the slightest apparent exception , could be pointed out as prevailing in the nuiverse , it would not absolutely , or satisfactorily prove a unity in the power which produced it . A million of deities might conspire in the most complete uniformity of operations . A stranger to this earth would find a certain uniformity of design , nay , thousands of different operations and results harmoniously conspiring to a single end , amidst all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how illogical would be his conclusion , that one being was the anthor // of the whole . He might , perhaps , properly infer , that one genus of beings had been at work in the construction of similar edifices , canals , cities , and other products of art . The mythology of the Greeks , which peopled every department of creation with presiding deities , was built on such an inference . And this , we are persuaded , is as far as human reason can legitimately advance , in settlink the point of the simplicity or complexity of the divine nature . It is a matter as tar removed from positive , ahstract demonstration , as the Deity himself is removed from man . It is true , the idea of the unity of God is now embraced in the world with more or less distinctness and purity ; there is nothing in nature to contradict or refute it , since even an actual contrariety of design might be consistent with it ; nay , it is almost a self evident truth ; philosophy can defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not assume the triumph of originally establishing and making it known . Every attempt to that effect which we witness , concurring with our inability to trace it so clearly to any other quarter , only drives us back with increased conviction to the leading representation of the Hebrew Scriptures , that the idea in question was originally and directly communicated from heaven , in some way or other , to men of Asiatic origin . When Dr Brown comes to consider our duties to ourselves , he takes up the question of the Immortality of the Soul . He advances in the affirmative some arguments that are absolutely gigantic , and others , that appear feeble and untenable . We will give an instance of each kind . Those , who hastily infer the destruction of the mind from the destruction of the body , will find it difficult to evade the force of the following reasoning , which has all the weight and acuteness characteristic of the author . When the body seems to us to perish , we know that it does not trsdy perish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to exist entire , as it existed before ; and that the only change which takes place , is a change of apposition or proximity . From the first moment at which the earth arose , there is not the slightest reason to think that a single atom has perished . All that was , is ; and if nothing has perished in the material universe ; - if even in that bodily dissolution , which alone gave occasion to the belief of our mortality as sentient beings , there is not the loss of the most inconsiderable particle of the dissolving frame ,  --  the argument // of analogy , far from leading us to suppose the destruction of that spiritual being , which animated the frame , would lead us to conclude that it , too , exists , as it before existed ; and that it has only changed its relation to the particles of our material organs , as these particles still subsistina have changed the relations , which they mutually bore . As the dust has only returned to the earth from which it came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the spirit may have returned to the God who gave it . ' Lecture 96 . Nothing was ever better said . But Dr Brown was well aware of an argument , xvhic*t the obstinate materialist still has in store , naruely , that all the mental operations , and consequently , what the immaterialist grataitously calls the mind itself , may be nothing more than phenomena , resulting from the union and organisation of material particles in a certain manner . Now to this our author offers the following feeble argument . If any one were to say , the Sun has no thought , Mercury , Venus , the Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and all their secondaries , have no thought ; but the Solar System has thought ,  --  we should then scarcely hesitate a moment , in rejecting such a doctrine ; because , we should feel instantly that there could be no charm in the two words , solar system , which ate of our own invention , to confer on the separate masses of the heavenly bodies , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been declared previously not to possess . What the sun and planets have not , the solar system , which is nothing more than that sun and planets , has not ; or , if so much power be ascribed to the mere iuvention of a term , as to suppose that we can confer by it new qualities on things , there is a realism in philosophy , far more monstrous than any which prevailed in the Logic of the Schools . if , then , the solar system can not have properties , which the sun and planets have not , and if this be equally true , at whatever distance , near or remote , they may exist in space , it is surely equally evident , that an organ , which is only a name for a number of separate corpuscles , as the solar system is only a number of larger masses of corpuscles ,  --  can not have any properties , which are not possessed by the corpuscles themselves , at the very moment at which the org 'm as a whole , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , additional to the affections of the separaW parts . An organ is nothing ; the corpuscles , to which we give that single name , are all ,  --  and if a sensation be an organic state , it is a state of riiany corpuscles , which have no more unity than the greater number of particles in the multitudes of brains , which form the sensations of all mankind . ' Lecture 98. // This reasoning will never do . To show its absurdity , let us follow it up for a moment in its own style . If any one were to say , the Sun has no ' mutual attraction* Mercury , Venus , the Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and all their secondaries , ' when separate and alone , have no mutual attraction , but the solar system has ' mutual *ttraction , we should then scarcely hesitate a moment in rejecting such a doctrine . ' Thus , by our author 's course of argument , we could disprove one of the most obvious facts of natural philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when alone , and an alkali , when alone , has not , the combination of acids and alkalies never can have ; and , therefore , such a phenomenon as effervescence between acids and alkalies , according to our author , can never take place . The truth is , Dr Brown is here guilty of begging the question . The very argument of the materialist is , that although the particles of matter , when separate , are not able to think , yet , when brought together in a certain way , which the Deity may appoint , the result of their influence on each other may be the phenomenon , which we express by the word thought . This our author denies , maintaining , that what one particle can not perform in a separate state , a multitude of particles can not perform in any sort of combination . It is plain , however , that this is no answer , but only a flat denial of the materialist 's argument , and , moreover , involves some most careless general positions , which are immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this topic , we would just ask the author , why so strenuous in maintaining the immateriality of the soul , when , in his noble argument , quoted above , he assumes the imperishableness of n*atter ? On the whole , we can not claim for him the merit of having placed the immortality of the soul on new and stronger vantage ground , than it occupied before . His reasonings on the subject appear to us to be full of assumptions . As might be expected , the discussion leads him too far from the track of pure philosophy into the entanglements of metaphysics . In defending the unity and indivisibility of the thinking principle , qualities which he regards as essential to its immortality , but which we do not , he is betrayed into arguments quite inconsistent with other statements in different parts of his work . For instance , he vigorously maintains that the mind can exist // only in a single state at once . But according to his whole philosophy elsewhere , and even according to the most common experience , that very mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emotion , simultaneously ; and it may be remembered , that in explaining the soul 's personal identity , he allowed , that along*with the memory or a sensation or an idea , we have an intuitive belief , that we are the same individuals , who had the sensation or idea before. * One would suppose , that in these cases there are two states , in which the mind exists at the same moment . But our author endeavors to surmount the inconsistency , by denominating them one complex state . Now , we confess ourselves quite as unable to conceive , how a unique single principle can exist , in what the author calls a complex state , as how it can exist in two different states at once . If the latter be incoml ) atihle with its nature , why is not the former also ? Truth is , the phrase , complex state , ' * or the still more impalpable and metaphysical phrase , which is sometimes a favorite one with the author , namely , a state of virtual comprehensiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty , and leaves the real nature of the mind in as much obscurity as ever . Amidst all his horror for rash hypothesis and gratuitous assumption , we are astonished at finding him everywhere asserting , as if it were an axiom of Euclid , that the mind is not composed of parts that coexist , but is simple and indivisible . ' Now this is unwarrantable . According to the true spirit of the new philosophy , we have nothing to do with this question . Much can he said plausibly in favor of the compound nature of the mind , without furnishing any fair triumph to skepticism , or exciting any necessary alarm among modest philosophers . Indeed , we have no hopes of gaining higher assurances of the soul 's immortality , from any new speculations on its internal structure . Be it simple , or be it compound , we do not despair . We doubt whether all the philosophy in the world can either improve , or set aside , the lucid and truly Baconian argument of the Apostle to the Gentiles , founded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the revivification of the human soul . The story left us by the Gallilean fishermen , which we are not ashamed to avow is far easier for us to believe than to doubt , needs no support from the // visions either of a Plato or a Priestley ; and while we look down into the vacant tomb , that once belonged to Joseph of Arimathea , we are little swayed , either one way or another , by the ingenuity and strength , or by the feebleness and inconclusiveness , exhibited in the reasonin-6s even of Dr Brown . Our aUstract terminates here . As an abstract , it is exceedingly imperfect , and conveys a very faint idea of the work . We have rather dwelt upon those topics , which seemed to require critical remark , than attempted to give a systematic sketch of all the author 's achievements . We shall no fulfil our promise to exact , from various quarters , a few contributions to the illustration of our author 's character and writings . The following notice is from a volume of the Edinburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character was one of extreme and I might almost say , of fastidious refinement . The habits of speculative philosophy and abstract thought , had not destroyed the vivacity of his imagination , or chilled the warmth of his heart . lie was by nature an enthusiast , and the prominent features of his mind in early youth were sensibility and ardor . At school he was distinguished by extreine gaiety and sweetness of disposition , and his contemporaries remembered how much he delighted and excelled in the recitation of dramatic poetry . Soon after he engaged in philosophical studies , he distinguished himself for acuteness of reasoning ; and his answer to Darwin 's Zoonomia demonstrated the discriminating powers of his mind . It is not for the writer of this letter to presume to analyse the subtlety , and profound originality , of his metaphysical inquiries . Among those who attended his lectures , some complained of a certain vagueness an ( l refinement that bordered on obscurity , but when he entered on the moral part of his course , he excited the highest degree of euthusiasm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was then he gave full scope to the lofty conceptions of his mind , and displayed an energy and devotion in the cause of moral truth that could not be surpassed , and can never be forgotten . Dr Brown 's manners might be considered somewhat artificial , and yet no man had more simplicity and singleness of heart , if that term belongs to one uninfluenced in his opinions , tastes , inclinations , and habits , by the caprices of fashion , or the calculations of a worldly mind . He never songWt the society of the fashionable , the rich , or the high born , on account of any of these adventitious circumstances . He carried the independent purity of his political principles into the morals of private life . His habits were abstemious , simple , and self-denied . His liberality to those , who needed // his pecuniary assistance , was as frank as it was unostentatious . But his benevolence was not of a kind to content itself with the cheap indulgence of almsgiving . Long after he had given up medical practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , who required his advice ; and what Burke said of Howard in a sense restricted to the particular objects of his attention , might be said of Dr Brown universally ; " He att&amp;nded to the neglected , and remembered the * There are many persons , wholly unknown to the circles of fashionable life , who received constant proofs of his cheering and kind attention . One instance of this is so characteristic of his turn of mind , that I can not omit mentioning it . Two Ayrshire peasants , who had made considerable progress in languages as well as in botanical and mathematical science , were recommended to his notice . After presenting them with gratis tickets for his lectures , he invited them to breakfast ; the conversation turned on botanical dra*ving . One of them proposed to show the Doctor some specimens of his performance in that art . " I was pleased , ** said he , on relating this circumstance , " to see the progress I had made in the confidence of these young men during the hour of breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they returned with the drawings , they rang at the front door . I had inspired them with the feeling of equality . " The political principles of this excellent man were those of genuine XVhiggism , untaintetl with the asperity of party prejudice . his reprobation of tyranny and oppression , wherever it was exercised , will be remembered by those who have heard him express his satisfaction at the overthrow of Napoleon Bonaparte , whose despotism he execrated . He took a deep interest in the political events of his own country . The five restrictive bills , passed during the winter session of 1819 , exc*ed his warmest indignation ; and in a meeting held by the Senatus Academicus , on the occasion of condoling with and congratulating his present Majesty , he expressed his opinion of those measures very strongly . The most ajinute circumstances , favorable to civil and religious liberty , interested him to the last ; and as an affecting instance of the sincerity of his feelings , on subjects connected with the freedom of his country , I may mention , that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middlesex poll , an event , deeply interesting on a moral as well as political principle , as being the grateful effort of a generous people to reward the son for the virtues of the father ; and when he was told two days before he died , that it had closed in favor of young Whitbread , though unable to speak , his countenance and manner expressed the liveliest satisfaction . He had returned in the autumn of 1819 to Edinburgh , in remarkably good health , and engaged with much ardor in the composition of his class book . He had even sketched out great literary // designs for his future execution , but that fatal disorder , which terminated in pulmonary consumption , seized him during the Christmas recess . He only lectured t*vice after the vacation . Doting the last lecture he delivered , he was greatly affected when he read some lines on the return of spring from Beattie 's Hermit. lie wished to persevere in his course* . But his affectionate friend and physician , Dr Gregory , forbade it , and strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His reply was , " No , I must die at home , you have no idea how miserably I am afflicted with the Maladie du pays . " His decline was rapid and alarming . As long as he had strength to hold a pen , he continued to give unremitting labor to the writing of his class book . In February 1820 , he received a short visit from his revered friend Mr Dugald Stewart , though at that time he scarcely admitted any one but his medical friend , and the members of his own family . On taking leave of Mr Stewart , he said gaily but emphatically , " I hope Moral Philosophy will live long in you . " ' In addition to the above gratifying sketch , an American correspondent has obligingly furnished us with the following interesting particulars , which the numerous admirers of Dr Brown in this country will receive much pleasure in perusing . In compliance with your request , I send you the following very general statements . With Dr Brown I was personally acquainted , and occasionally spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hospitality during my stay in that country . Immediately upon my arrival at the city of Edinburgh , after the opening of the session of the University , I called upon Dr Brown , and prqcured a ticket of admission to his class . Interpreting the intent of your request in the sense in which I believe you designed me to do , I have been led to adopt the following simple plan . The personal appearance of Dr Brown seems first to draw my attention . His was in a very especial degree that of an intense student . He was of ordinary stature ; of a pale and wan physiognomy ; careless and inattentive in his dress . The characteristic of his countenance was highly attractive , and none could meet him in the streets without noticing it in a particular manner . Profound thought was engraven on every feature . There appeared to be a great mind at work within , and absorbed in the most abstruse speculations . The outward aspect of Dr Brown evinced to the observing mind , that his trains of thought were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mode which he // adopted in delivering his lectures . In the class room he appeared in the most advantageous points of view . His manner was grave and dignified . He commanded profound silence , marked attention , and a high expression of regard . He read , or with more propriety I should say , he recited his lectures in an animated strain . He app*ared himself to feel the importance of those intellectual views , which he had created and was delivering , and was solicitous that the value of them should be perceived and appreciated by those who heard them . He read the poetical quotations , occasionally introduced , in a distinct and impressive manner . I was accustomed to hail with delight the returning toll , which summoned us to lecture , and regarded it as a philosophical treat . Dr Brown did not permit his students to take notes during the time of lecturing , owing to a fact with which you are doubtless familiar , viz , that a few years preceding , some of the lectures of Mr Stewart were presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author himself had issued them . Dr Brown was desirous that his students should , at the close of the lecture , apply to him for the solution of those doubts of a metaphysical kind that might arise . With such he would freely converse . He was intensely studious . Although surrounded by such a host of social attractions as Edinburgh presents , he allowed not his studious habits to be violated . I heard him state , that he set apart two evenings during every week , either for the reception of his company , or for his own personal relaxation . The rest of his time he considered as sacred to study . The manners of Dr Brown were interesting and rather refined . He was full of conversation ; very vivacious , and remarkable for the versatility of his information and diction . He could instantly enter upon any topic , however remote , and in his usual happy strain . In private life he was truly amiable . Two sisters lived with him , whom he supported . The most marked affection appeared to exist between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest wishes . His feelings as a man were generous and noble . He possessed more than an ordinary share of sensibility , and would indulge , in the hour of conversation , in the most sympathetic strain , on any scene of distress , which he had either witnessed , or of which he had heard . ' We have delayed for six months the publication of the present article , in the hope of receiving from Edinburgh an // essay on the life and genius of Dr Brown , by the Rev. Mr Welsh , announced as preparing for the press some time last year . But as yet , it has not been issued , and the distance of time is already too great , between our former and present articles on the lectures , to allow of any farther delay . A glimpse into Dr Brown 's lecture r*in , as most of our readers will remember , is furnished in the impudent , but entertaining Letters of Peter to his Kinsfolk . ' Having collected and presented the foregoing testimonials of the peculiarities of our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few desultory remarks on the former subject , and on the work before us , must be all that we now feel either inclined or justified to attempt . The prominent capacity , in which Dr Brown offers himself to our minds , is that of a fearless , minute , and ultimate analyst . This is the characteristic , that distinguishes him from every other author on record . XVe are not disposed to vindicate his absolute superiority in many other striking qualifications . His style is far from being faultless , his scholarship is neither exquisite in choice , nor extensive in its range , nor are his observations on life and manners peculiarly rich or original ; though in all these , as well as in many similar valuable requisites for a public instructer , he is not only not deficient , but is much more than respectable . But , in the art of looking into the elements and finer relations of things , in detecting the action and reaction between mind and matter , in reducing all human knowledge to its first principles , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . The true focus of Dr Brown 's mind , the mark at which its most intense power acted , was t*xed by nature for microscopic inspection . His more comprehensive surveys and larger classifications , though often imposing and magnificent , are sometimes dim , unwieldy , and incomplete . Witness his original arrangement of Politics and Political Economy , among the peculiar branches of the Philosophy of the Mind , an arrangement , however , which he did not subsequently follow . For another instance to the same purpose , we refer to his Inquiry into Cause and Effect , which wants distinctness in its general management and outline , though all the separate details of the argument are conducted with wonderful acuteness and power . Nor , while we follow him along the track of his curious speculations , or // peruse his more splendid and ambitious compositions , do we almost ever meet with those happy generalisations of expression , which so frequently astonish and delight us in the French school of the last century . Indeed , if a generalisation of this kind had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave it simply to his reader . He would have indulged his favorite habit of tracing out all the particulars that went to form it , thus appearing to arrive by gradual steps to a conclusion , on which Voltaire or Diderot would have alighted at once . But they , on the other hand , displayed little of his peculiar faculty and strength . Whoever will gaze through the medium of Dr Brown 's representations at the objects of his analysis , will perceive them clothed with unwonted brilliancy and distinctness , and new points of vision starting up , which were unsuspected before . All nature crumbles into infinitesimals before his glance . No man is a warmer adorer of the aggregate beauty and glory of the universe , but no man was ever so prone to regard it as a world of atoms . So too , while he is an impassioned admirer of roses and beautiful faces , he can not avoid reducing them , by a kind of stereographic projection , into plain surfaces of colored rays . He gazes with a poet 's delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but traces the involutions of every thread with still more of the eagerness of a metaphysician . He has erected new landmarks between the regions of illusion and those of reality . He has dissolved much of the influence , which names still exerted on our ideas of things . The study of his writings produces on the mind a similar effect with the study of chemistry . We look round upon creation with almost newly furnished optics ; every incident suggests matter of philosophical speculation ; the motions of an infant , and the actions of an adult , all thoughts , all passions , all delights , ' assume unaccustomed aspects , and exhibit interesting relations in the varied system of things . It is worthy of remark , that at the same moments , when Davy was accomplishing some of his greatest achievements in the analysis of matter , Brown was arriving at some of his most brilliant results in the analysis of mind . Both natural and intellectual science seem to have attained a point // of equal progress , when these two contemporaries arose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next most remarkable characteristic , that distinguishes our author , is the undisguised warmth of his moral sentiments . It is rather out of fashion , with existing literature , to seem very much in love with virtue . The phantom reproach of cant lowers in the distance , and frightens the moraliser into a well dissembled indifference . The public is a kind of good company , whose feelings must not be hurt by declamations against its favorite peccadilloes . The whining sentimentality of some authors , which was carried to a disgusting extreme about the end of the last century , and which received its death blow from Sheridan 's character of Joseph Surface , underwent the usual reaction of other human extravagaucies , and writers and talkers are now almost ashamed to testify any enthusiasm in favot ' of the parlor , every day virtues . Rousseau 's delightful declamations , too , were mingled with so much that was unprincipled and false , that they contributed not a little to the same effect . Dr Brown has been one of the first to break this chill spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge of mawkishness or of hypocrisy , and pours out his whole soul in ardent praise of whatever is good and lovely . He appears as the unshrinking advocate , especially , of all the domestic and gentler virtues . The seriousness of his enthusiasm is well calculated to put to flight the skeptical and profligate smile of the scoffer . His works , in this respect , might be recommended as an antidote to the poison of Byron . Unlike most moral philosophers , he treats not of the virtues and of our moral feelings , with the same cold and scientific interest , that he would inquire into the affinities of a salt or a mineral . His inmost sympathies keep pace with his subject , and impart light to it . Several indirect testimonials to the truth and inspiration of Christianity , are scattered throughout his Lectures . He is thus shielded from the charge , so ofien urged against the productions of his illustrious predecessor . But we wish that he were more than so shielded , and that Christianity had been more dii'ectly , explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lament the miserable mistake , into which so many moral philosophers have been betrayed , in declining any assistance from the New Testament . How might Dr Brown have // added light , sanctity , and authority to his own doctrines , while he in turn would have contributed no small support to the cause of Christianity . Can it be doubted , that Dr Chalmers is at this moment supplying the defect , on which we have been animadverting ? May his attempts be wise and successful . NC have next a few words to say respecting our author 's style . We remember hearing reported a happy jeu d'esprit on this subject , from the admired writer of Letters from the Mountains . When asked how she was pleased with Dr Brown 's poetvy , she replied , that it had too much metaphysics for her , and when immediately again questioned how she liked his metaphysics , she pronounced it too full of poetry . There is at least some foundation for this smart antithesis , though not enough to raise a serious objection against the writings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different times , but , in our opinion , scarcely a line of them was sufficiently metaphysical or respectable to deserve reading over , with the single excep* tion of the Paradise of Coquettes . This work , published anonymously , was immediately , by the unanimous consent of the critics , l ) rol*o*Inced to be second of its kind only to the Rape of the Lock . There is metaphysics in it , but we can not think it too metaphysical . That portion of it , particularly entitled to this epithet , is one of the most sublime , beautiful , ingenious , and original efforts of the English muse . It is a description of the Heaven of Coquettes , and we have always regretted , that so very lofty a flight of the imagination should have been introduced into a work of a design so gay and humorous . It is difficult to read it without feeling religiously , rather than facetiously disposed . It somewhat resembles an inspired glimpse into the possibilities of a future state of being , and , with due modifications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) lace in Baxter 's Saint 's Everlasting Rest , that gorgeous and delicious poem in prose , than of serving as a rhapsody in some heroi-comic effusion . With respect to the other point of the abovementioned antithesis , we allow it to be better founded . There is a little too much poetry in Dr Brown 's tnetapliysics , or , more exactly speaking , his general style as a writer is over poetical and ornamental . We are very far from recommending it as a // a model , and should be sorry to see it adopted as such , with the same facility , that our young men copied the less ambitious , but still somewhat too measured flow of Mr Stewart 's periods . We have sometimes thought that having written his Lectures , when comparat*tely young , and adopted at that time a florid and towering manner , Dr Brown was afterwards the less likely to correct it , in consequence of retaining , repeating , and laboring upon , the same course from year to year . He often indulges in solemn parade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and talks much of the difficulty of his tasks . We know of no better way to characterise his style , than to denominate it ultra-Ciceronian . Coming short of the perfections attained , on the one hand , by the Roman orator , it leans , on the other , rather towards his faults . It is too elaborate , tumid , and redundant . It is like Akenside 's verse turned into prose , except that it sends out not the slightest of a Grecian savor , and this last circumstance , coupled with the rarity , amounting almost to absence , of quotations from the Greek , convinces us , that the author must have been very superficially versed in the literature of that language . It may seem a hard and rash judgment to estimate a person 's scholarship , from the number of his learned quotations ; and so in general it is . But when one is a professed , and as we may say , an inveterate quoter , filling his productions with extracts from English and Latin authors , we may fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sentence now and then from Plato , if they had been familiar to his ear as household words , ' would have embellished his moral declamations , or given point to some of his philosophical statements and conclusions . Notwithstanding these negative peculiarities , it must not , however , be denied , that our Lecturer deserves to be ranked among the classical writers of the language . He is wanting only in a kind of Augustan perfection ; yet still he is classical , in the same way as that epithet belongs to Ammianus , to Statius , and to Seneca . The last author , by the way , is a god of his idolatry , and is quoted by him , we remember , alone of all others , five times in one Lecture . No man ever wielded the resources of the English tongue more skilfully than Dr Brown , or wrote it in more perfect purity . Yet it was the general European standard of its perfection , at which // he aimed , and not at its idiomatical properties and graces . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well executed movement by some scientific composer , but little * the indescribable and native charm , that pervades the beautiful melodies of his own country . He is full of brilliancies , while he has few felicities , and it is t1*s defect , which will lose for him the greatest number of readers . There are no easy , sweet , and playful turns in his ( liction , to relieve the strained and everlasting nisus of scientific disquisition . He hammers everything to the last degree . There is not a thought shown us just as it came into his mind . Though we admire the productions of his skill , yet we almost hear the workman panting and striving at his labor , and the whole atmosphere of his book as redolent of oil . A favorite figure of speech with the author , which he very frequently carries to a fault , is the climax . Scarcely a lecture that does not contain one . To set off some leading idea , or to give force and splendor to an illustration , circumstance is heaped upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of the stoutest reader gives way , and the dizzy train of his thoughts often goes with it . We must acknowledge that , in the writings of Dr Brown , there are too many obscure and difficult passages . After making due allowance for the imperfect state in which his manuscripts ma* have been left , * for the abstruse and shadowy nature of many of his topics , and even for an occa * We take the liberty of mentioning here a confused and erroneous arrangeroent of a few of the Lectures , at the end of the first , and beginning of the second volumes of the Edinburgh edition , and in the latter portion of the first volume of the Andover . To any one who will examine the matter with ordinary attention , there will , as we think , appear so many undeniable reasons for a substitution of the following arrangement , that we shall not take the trouble to enumerate them . It is certain that , as the Lectures now stand , nothing can be more perplexed and ill concatenated . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 . Lecture 24 , as now numbered , should unquestionably be Lecture 23. 2 . But the recap ituletion prefixed to Lecture 23 , as it now stands , including pp. 511 , 512 , Edinburgh edition , or p. 345 , Andover edition , should remain as it is . Then the body of the true Lecture 23 , will properly begin near the bottom of p. 537 Edinburgh , or on p. 362 Andover . That we now seem to perceive , &amp;c . This , if we are correct , should be continued to p. 563 , Edinburgh , or p. 376 Andover , where Lecture 23 will properly end . 3 . The recapitulation prefixed to Lecture 24 , stands where it ought , ending near the close of p. 537 Edinburgh , or on p. 362 Andover , thus ; - boundaries from the oilier . The body of the true Lecture 24 , will begin at p. 513 Edinburgh , or p. 346 Andover* thus ; - Though 1/it notion of extension , &amp;c. and // sional mysticism and unattainable aim in some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , by contrast , of the unabating transparency of Mr Stexvart 's elocution . On the whole , we must allow , that our author 's is often a bard style to read , and , as we should have thought , a much harder one to bear . He seems frequently nut to have adapted his sentences to the capacity of the ear . The attention is stormed and borne along , rather by the force and brilliancy of the expressions , by the earnest energy of the writer , and by the novelty , splendor , and importance , of his well selected topics , than by the clearness and distinctness of each successive position , and a certain smooth and resistless current of diction , of which Adam Smith , P*ilcy , and Godwin in his philosophical works , occur to us just now as three of the most remarkable instances . It would be unfair , of course , to refer for this point of cCml ) arisOn to historical or narrative writing . Though it is impossible to deny Dr Brown the possession of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages , which seem to indicate a want of familiarity with subjects , that are at the fingers ' ends of every general reader . In one place he condescends to impart , with much display , the information , that Ahelard , besides his well known connexion with Eloisa , was distinguished for his talents and attainments of every sort ; and somewhere*lse he tells us , as a perfect novelty , the whole story of the sympathetic needles from Strada 's Prolusions . Mr Stewart touches upon such things in quite a different manner . The remarks hitherto made , apply to the general characteristics of Dr Brown as a writer . We have a few more continue to the end of p. 530 Edinburgh , or p. 357 Andover , where the true Lecture 23 terminates . We know no way of accounting for the disorder here pointed out , except by supposing that Dr Brown wrote his recapitulations on separate sheets of pape.r from the bodies of his Lectures , and thus , that the bodies of Lecture 23 and Lecture 24 , have accidentally changed ptaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . The whote of Lecture 27 , recapitulation and all , should take the place and number of Lecture 25. 5 . Lecture 25 , recapitulation and all , should take the rank and place of Lecture 26. &amp; Lecture 26 , in like manner , should entirely assume the place and rank of Lecture 27 . A slight inspection will demonstrate the correctness of these last alterations . // specific criticisms to offer on the particular Lectures before us . Their posthumous publication is a warrant for gentle treatment , of which , however , they little stand in need . It is enough to secure Dr Brown the highest praise to say , that he has well discharged the vast responsibility of being the successor of Mr Stewart , or rather , of taking up the Philosophy of the Mind , where *eid and Stewart had left it . He enjoyed , indeed , peculiar advantages in corning after such men , and inheriting a certain general excitement and respect toward the science , to which they had been instrumental in raising the public mind . The era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar intellectual development . Poetry , and every branch of natural science , were daily acconiplishing wonders , and our author 's condition was precisely such , that he must either produce corresponding achievements in the Philosophy of Mind , or encounter the mortification of failure and obscurity . rfo these arduous advantages he was equal . Certain it is , that during his life he sustained the highest reputation as a Lecturer , and that on every individual , who witnessed his performances , without , as far as we are aware , a single exception . he made a favorable impression , unusually profound and permanent . A very valuable , if not the most valuable feature of this great work , consists in the contributions which it furnishes to the science of Natural Theology . Paley had already collected from every part of external , material nature , the most striking proofs of benevolent design in the J ) eity . Brown has effected precisely the same object , with respect to the various phenomena of our intellectual frames . A volume might , with great ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would completely fill lip the chasm in Paley 's outline , and deserve a place in every library on the same shelf with his celebrated treatise . Its plan might be consistently exten ( led and improved , by the addition of stich extracts as most directly contribute to the cause of religion , morality , and right thinking . One recommendation , at least , of the proposed work would be , that it would present a body of the most clear , original , popular , and least exceptionable passages , that occurThroughout the Lectures . Its tendency to higher utility can as little be doubted . // The general plan of the Lectures is , perhaps , too unwieldy and encyclopedial for a single work . We have no right to complain , indeed , of any author , for giving to the public ever so extended a series of delightful and improving compositions . The statutes of his professorship might , also , have enjoined upon this writer a very comprehensive range of subjects , more or less connected with the mind . His original scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ecouomy . Why it might not also have embraced Languages , Rhetoric , and Grammar , with equal propriety , we can not divine . We are of opinion that the proper Science of the Mind , if treated with the requisite compactness , would be limited to the investigation and description of our mental operations alone . Legitimately it can not branch out into Moral Philosophy , nor into Natural Theology . Each of these should form a system by itself . The philosopher of the mind ought , indeed , to trace the con nexsons , which his subject bears with these and all other sciences . But he has no particular business with erecting systems of Moral , Theological , Political , 01 . Historical Philosophy . For instance , lie may , with Dr Brown , attempt to investigate the true nature of Moral Obligation . This is a sentiment of the mind . But as a mental philosopher , his task stops there . He departs from his particular sphere , when he proceeds to enumerate and enforce the personal , social , political , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he thus encroaches on the real domain of the Moral Philosopher . Among the inconveniences , to which the form of posthumous Lectures subjects this work , are the innumerable recapitulations and repetitions , which everywhere occur . Probably all the leading ideas and arguments are stated , to a greater or less extent , three times over ; and many of them , even more . So that , were the Lectures reduced to a regular treatise , and these repetitions omitted , we should have a book exceeding in size little more than two thirds of the present . It should be remembered , however , that what is thus sometimes an annoyance in perusal , must have been attended with some advantages to those who originally had the privilege of hearing . And even rfow , the reader will find much assistance in comprehending and appreciating the // author 's arguments , by studying the recapitulations , in which former statements are frequently placed in better points of view , and considerations altogether new , are sometimes piesented . Nor on the whole do we regret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delivered , with all those little inddental appeals to the honor and good feelings of the students , those occasional comnpliments to the author 's colleagues in office , and those other allusions to circumstances of time and place , which take much from the abstract nature of the work , and invest it somewhat with the charm of local reality . Although , as we before intimated , our author 's style is the very opposite to the sententious , yet the vastness of his philosophy , and acuteness of his mind , have caused him to scatter several weighty maxims throughout these Lectures . We subjoin a few as morsels for reflection . Science is the classification of * The form of bodies is their relation to each other in space ,  - -  the power of bodies is their relation to each other in time . ' The power of God is not anything different from * The philosophy of the mind , and the philosophy of matter , agree , in this respect , that our knowledge is , in both , confined to the mere phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content ourselves with despising her ad * The difficulty of ascertaining precisely , whether it be truth , which we have attained , is in many cases much greater , than the difficulty of the actual attainment . ' Philosophy is not the mere passive possession of knowledge ; it is , in a much more important respect , the active exercise of ' acquiring it . ' Happiness , though necessarily involving present pleasure , is the direct or indirect , and often the very distant result of feelings of every kind , pleasurable , painful , and indifferent . ' When absolute discovery is not allowed , there is left a probability of conjecture , of which even philosophy may justly avail herself , without departing from her legitimate province. * To know the mind well , is to know its weaknesses as well as its powers .

It is an objection to the doctrine , when urged in his broad and unqualified manner , that it must tend to th , e discouragement of scientific inquiry . In pressing his particular views , he unguardedly represents it as a fruitless task to search for any other cause of a given effect , than the obvious and apparent one . But this would keep us back in the ignorance of infancy . The author could not have intended such a conclusion ; but he should have provided better against it . Another thing that has struck us , in our perusal of these arguments , is , that they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not know why a particular cause produces its immediate effect . One more remark connected with this topic . When Dr Brown asserts , tl ) at nothing can exist in nature , but all the substances that exist in nature , what would he say of motion ? Is this nothing , or is it something ? If it is something , can it he called a substance ? In short , the existence of motion , particularly spontaneous motion , though more intimately connected than any other phenomenon with this subject , and perhaps involving its essential difficulty , receives not in these speculations its due share of notice . The author loses himself in a criticism on Hume , at the end of the thirty-fourth Lecture . Hume does not speak of the annihilation of an idea , as Dr Brown represents him , but of the idea of annihilation . This mistake destroys the whole reasoning . We were disappointed in seeing no attempts to draw the characteristic lines of distinction , between man and the brute creation . The subject is nowhere hinted at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . He does not even encounter the obvious objection , that most of his arguments for the immortality of the soul would as well apply to faithful Tray , ' as to his master . // We are not satisfied with the liberties everywhere taken , in quoting the English poets . Scarcely a passage from them occurs , that is not altered , apparently with a direct intention , though , we are not always fortunate enough to perceive , with a happier adaptation to the subject in hand . From the author 's ambition to say something of every subject , more or less connected with his particular science , we were surprised that he has interwoven no remarks upon Delirium , Hypochondriasis , Liberty and Necessity , and a few others . An evident vein of Necessitarianism runs through all his speculations . That doctrine may be pretty directly deduced from his views of Cause and Effect , as well as from his favorite statements of the operations of the mind . Amid his loftiest declamations , upon the immortality and other attributes of the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a topic would have thrown a characteristic lustre on many a splendid paragraph . Perhaps it may be wrong to assert , that the author was under obligations to the late Dr Cogan , as that gentleman 's name , unaccountably at any rate , is alluded to nowhere in the Lectures . Yet it can not be denied , that a strong general coincidence exists between the two writers in their treatment of the Passions and Emotions , and several ethical questions , and particularly , the final causes of the actual arrangement of many mental phenomena . Dr Brown , more frequently than any other writer , goes back to infancy , childhood , and savage life , for the decision of philosophical points . He seems to have possessed little sense of the ludicrous . He never undertakes of himself to combat an error with satire . When he has need of this weapon , he constantly resorts to large quotations from Martintis Scriblerus , or Fontenelle . There is in this respect a striking contrast between himself and Dr Campbell , whose ridicule was as irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularise our favorite Lectures , and to transcribe abundance of other pencil marks , with which we have curnbered the margins of the author 's pages , but there is no end to this kind of critical chitchat , and we forbear.
