Foote . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. On the right of the audience the city of Yanina , stretching out in perspective along the borders of a large lake . On the left a chain of rocks . In the centre of the lake an island , with a fortress upon it . Women and children of Yanina , with a few Greek Soldiers , are seen , as the curtain rises , flying from the city gate . Zenocles appears upon the rocks . He descends rapidly . Zeno . Zenocles Whither do you fly ? What danger threatens you ? Sol . Soldier Ali ! the execrable Ali ! Zeno . Zenocles Ali ! Sol . Soldier Informed of the advance of Ismail , with the Sultan 's army , he hastened from yon citadel , to reduce Yanina to ashes , ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces and temples the rising flames give the awful signal of pillage and murder . Zeno . Zenocles And ye are Greeks , and suffer this ? Shame ! shame ! Sol . Soldier Surprised , unarmed , our bravest warriors are in the tyrant 's power . Perhaps , e'en now , surrounded by his satillites. they fall , heartlessly butchered . Wrath of Heaven ! vengeance ! All extend their arms to heaven , as in supplication . Zeno . Zenocles Heaven hears your prayers . Ay , vengeance ! vengeance ! Sol . Soldier Stranger , who art thou ? Zeno . Zenocles Zenocles ! son of the murdered Patriarch of Epirus ,  --  saved , while an infant , by a faithful servant , from the massacre of my whole race by the tyrant , Ali . My mother , with my sister at her breast , was plunged , by order of the merciless Pacha , into the waters of this very lake . I have sworn to avenge them . The hour approaches . Ismail mourns his father , the Vizier Ibrahim , a captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , to confide to him my plan for the destruction of our common foe . Sol . Soldier His destruction ! has he not that fearful citadel in the lake to shelter him , when he quits the smoking ruins of Yanina ? Zeno . Zenocles That citadel is commanded by Talathon , under Ali Pacha , who not long since refused to lend himself to the murder of the defenceless Suliots . By me the life of Talathon was once preserved , and could I but obtain access to him , I trust  --  Sol . Soldier Look ! look , where the fleet of Ali , laden with the plunder of Yanina , returns to the citadel . The Fleet of Ali appears in the middle of the lake , making all sail for the island . Zeno . Zenocles Let us march to meet Ismail  --  to welcome our avenger . Soldiers . Soldiers Death to the race of Ali ! Zeno . Zenocles Liberty and vengeance ! All . All Liberty and vengeance . Exeunt . SCENE II . The Gardens of the Fortress , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . Has . Hassan Well , but , Mouctar , good Mouctar , do n't look so black at me . I forgot ; it 's your nature , and you ca n't help it ;  --  but hear my defence ; hear my defence . Mouc . Mouctar No fooling ! you have disobeyed orders ; and shall be punished for it . Were you not expressly forbidden to hold any communication with the prisoner ? Hass . Hassan Well , I confess I am too tender-hearted ; but I 'm sure you must allow I am greatly improved . Before I entered into the service of the Pasha , I had the misfortune to be a good Mussulman ; I kept the laws of the Koran , and held this glorious liquor to be an abomination ; poor deluded wretch that I was ! Mark the effects of superior society . I defy any one to say I 've the least spark of religion left in me , or am ever known sober four-and-twenty hours together . Mouc . Mouctar Be warned , then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Ali shall certainly be informed of it , and your life may answer for your disobedience . Distant music . Hark ! he comes ! our mighty master returns triumphant from Yanina . Remember now ! Mouctar goes up the stage , and exit . Hass . Hassan Throwing away the flask . All the torments of Zatani light on the blood-thirsty Pacha , and his ebony prime minister ! Were it not for the love I bear to his grandson , Selim , and the beautiful Helena , I would soon show the fortress a clean pair of heels ; but the hope of being useful to them , induces me to make myself agreeable to Ali ; and by jesting with him , and drinking wine ( Allah pardon me ! ) with his men , I 'm in such favour , that I 'm permitted to run about like a favourite marmoset , and thereby render the loving young couple numberless little attentions . Ha ! here comes the grasping old skin-flint , with more grist for his money-mill . Ugh ! curse you ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Slaves , bearing coffers , filled with treasures , and other valuable effects , found in the plunder of Yanina , Guards , and , lastly , Ali Pacha , Selim , and Mouctar . Ali . Ali Pacha The flames of Yanina have lighted us bravely home . ' T is thus that Ali gives up cities to his foe . Vain Ismail has promised to bear my head to the Sultan . Let his Tartars seek it o'er the cannon of my citadel . If the treasures I have already hoarded there have stirred up the ambition of the Divan , it may find in these new spoils a fresh excitement . Let them come all . Hatred might have given the enemy dangerous auxiliaries in the inhabitants of Yanina ; but of them fitting care has been taken , and Ismail will only find widows and orphans , where he hopes for soldiers . To Selim . Son of Veli Thebelen , why those downcast looks ? Does Ali 's grandson wear a woman 's heart ? Se . Selim Can I do aught but shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great curse upon your race ? Where'er you step , that spot becomes a ruin ! Ali . Ali Pacha ' T was upon ruins that Alexander wrote his immortality . Se . Selim But thou , the rebel subject of the Sultan  --  Ali . Ali Pacha Weary of being his slave , am become his rival ; but , no more of this . If you prize my regard , insult me not by a weakness unworthy of the blood of Ali . Se . Selim What you call weakness , is my glory ; to that I owe the love of  --  Ali . Ali Pacha Silence ! Waves his hand to Mouctar , &c.; who fall back ; then , aside to Selim . The sons of Ali should find no glory but in the field ; yet , if thy heart must needs have stooped to love , could it not have chosen a worthier object than the sister of that sturn Suliot , Zenocles , the most daring , the most inveterate of my foes ? Se . Selim She knows not she is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all suspicion of her parentage ! knowing it , she would curse me for mine . Ali . Ali Pacha I curse myself for the coward pity , which made me listen to the prayer which saved her . Little did I think , when yielding to your mother 's supplication , I suffered Helena to escape the destruction of her family , to be reared by her , a nameless orphan in this island , little did I think the girl would live to rob the race of Ali of a hero . Se . Selim To love , is the hero 's privilege ; and his first duty to protect the helpless . Ali , Ali Pacha sternly . No more ! leave me ! away , I say ! Slaves , bear the treasures into the citadel . Mouctar , remain with me . Ali impatiently repeals his order to Selim to retire , He obeys ; Slaves , Guards , &c.; exeunt with treasure . Hassan lingers behind . Has . Hassan aside . What can he want with Mouctar ? some new mischief towards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacha After ascertaining he is alone with Mouctar . Mouctar , I believe none of my slaves rival thee in devotion to thy master . Mouc . Mouctar Knew I of one that did  --  Ali . Ali Pacha What would you do ? Mouc . Mouctar Stab him ! Ali . Ali Pacha ' T is well . Mark me ! Helena has won the love of Selim . She has destroyed the noble spirit which should burn in the bosom of my grandson . She must die ! Mouc . Mouctar Drawing his sword . My lord , I hasten  --  Ali . Ali Pacha Hold ! not so . You know her mother 's fate , in the centre of the lake ? Go ,  --  tell her it is my wish that she should leave the island ere Ismail attack it , and that I have secured her a temporary asylum in the convent of Sotira . Mouc . Mouctar I understand . I fly to execute your orders . Exit Mouctar . Ali . Ali Pacha alone . Ay ! let her perish ;  --  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hated Zenocles , sink in the silent waters , restoring Selim 's heart to war , which with the race of Ali , should have no rival . Go , join thy mother , girl . Now to place my newly acquired treasures in the secret vaults , safe , safe , safe ! Exit . Hass . Hassan Comes forward . " Safe , safe ! " I wish to the Prophet you were " safe , safe , " in a secret vault , with a nicely carved stone turban a-top of it .  --  Join her mother , indeed !  --  but she sha' n't , if I can help it ; but there is no time to be lost . Let me seek Selim instantly . Exit Hassan , hastily . Re-enter Mouctar , ( leading Helena . ) Hel . Helena But why , why this haste ? May I not behold Selim ere I go ? Where is he , Mouctar ? Oh ! give hope to my drooping heart ! You have but lately parted from him . Oh ! speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances with the foe ; we must cross the lake immediately , or the opportunity will be lost . Why this agitation ? Hel . Helena I can not bear that lake . My infant slumbers have been broken by dreams of its storied victims . Often and often have I stolen from my hed , to shroud my chamber window , which looks out upon its waters , lest I should behold the spectre boat , where the wife of the Patriarch of Epirus is said nightly to re-appear with the poor babe , to whom she sang the lullaby which proved their requiem . Mouc . Mouctar impatiently . There is no time for idle talk like this . Away ! away ! Mouctar seizes her fiercely . She recoils . Enter Selim . Se . Selim Helena ! Hel . Helena Selim ! rushes into his arms . Mouc . Mouctar aside . Confusion ! aloud . My lord , it was the Pacha 's order that I should guide that girl . Se . Selim Hence ! Dare the carrion bird darken o'er Paradise ? Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selim answers for Helena . Mouc . Mouctar I only urged the orders of the Pacha : but I leave you my lord . With Ali you will reckon , for preventing the discharge of my duty , perhaps , too , for not remembering your own . Exit Mouctar . Hel . Helena Dearest Selim ! Whence these flashings of your angry eye ? Whence the strange shuddering which shook you as you gazed on Mouctar ? Se . Selim I shudder 'd at the danger you escaped . Hel . Helena Danger ! What danger ? Se . Selim You were well nigh lost to Selim , and irrevocably . Alone with this remorseless monster traversing the lake , whose fatal stream already has received  --  Oh Helena ! let us fly this place of horror ! Let us escape this atmosphere of death . Ha ! what said I ? Shall Selim fly ? When foes beset his family , desert his post like a coward ? Hel . Helena Can you regret dangers , which yield no glory ? Forsake your own family , where you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , through the cities of Greece , for some trace of mine . Mine , of whom I know nothing but the misfortune , which has shut me out from every clue , even to their name . Se . Selim Oh ! if you prize Selim 's love , ne'er seek to know your family . Come with me , lovely innocence ! Let me hide thee from the malice of Ali , then return , to fight his battles . He hurries her towards the wing . Enter Hassan . Hass . Hassan Whither haste you , my lord ? Se . Selim To shield Helena from the fury of the Pacha . Hass . Hassan It needs not . Our prophet be praised ! She has nothing more to fear from Ali . By her death he hoped to extinguish your love , and give your undivided soul to war . But war no longer demands victories . An ambassador is here from Ismail  --  he brings us peace . Se . Selim Peace ! Hel . Helena Unlook 'd for happiness ! Se . Selim Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to celebrate the recent victory . Se . Selim His victory o'er Yanina ? The howling ghosts of a people massacre 'd in cold blood , should be his song of glory ; and shades , pointing to wounds , not given in battle , form his train of triumph . My soul sickens at the scene ' t is doomed to bear a part in . Return , dearest Helena , to the haram . Come , Hassan , with me to Ali . May our supplications , that he sign the treaty , prosper , and war vanish at the prayer of mercy . Exeunt . SCENE III . Rich Terrace , and Portico of the Castle of the Lake , with Haram and Gardens . Enter Zenocles , disguised as a Turk , and Talathon . Talat . Talathon Now , stranger , what would you with me ? Zeno . Zenocles Are we by ourselves ? Talat . Talathon Whence this mystery ? Who art thou ? Zeno Zenocles discovering himself . Zenocles . Talat . Talathon Zenocles ! Zeno . Zenocles Anguish has worn my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you still doubt ? Talat . Talathon The saviour of my life  --  Zeno . Zenocles Now comes to save your honour . Talat . Talathon How chances this ? A Suliot chief the ambassador of Ismail ! Zeno . Zenocles That character is a stratagem ; ' t was assumed , but to open these gates , and enable me to converse with Talathon . Talat . Talathon And what do you expect from Talathon ? Zeno . Zenocles Mark me ! You are not the only Greek who , spell-bound by the genius of Ali Thebelen , is become the accomplice of his crimes . But a new glory awaits you  --  the glory of effacing the stain which soils your name , by the destruction of your country 's tyrant . Talat . Talathon Shall the chief of Ali 's warriors betray him in adversity ! Zeno . Zenocles Have you not already betrayed your country in adversity , by joining Ali ? Is it only towards Greece , that her sons think perjury no crime ? Oh , men ! men ! Offspring of the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : which has filled history with its first great examples , which has taught countries unborn , when it was greatest , to be free and great . Oh ! men of Greece , can ye alone crouch tamely to the barbarian , and invite the yoke , while distant nations madden at the story of your wrongs , and burn to vindicate your cause . Son of heroes , start from your lethargy ! Crush the insulters of the land of glory , and give some future Homer themes for a mightier Iliad ! Talat . Talathon Zenocles , your voice rouses me ! I feel what I have lost and am ready to redeem it . Speak on  --  what is your purpose ? Zeno . Zenocles Ismail , trembling for the life of his father , now a captive in your charge , has made me the bearer of a treaty , which demands that Ibrahim be set free ; and upon this condition grants that Ali and his family may depart on the seas of Epirus . But should Ali accept the terms  --  Talat . Talathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh armies to harrass Greece anew , when his wasting strength shall have had time to recover ? And shall we stand by , and see him bear to a strange clime the spoils of our country , and the life , which has derived its fame only from her miseries ? No , I will await him , with a chosen band , upon the shore . Here , in the sight of Epirus , shall the spoiler 's blood bathe the soil he has made desolate ! Our long humbled land shall rise up once more a nation , and heaven-topp 'd Olympus tremble with delight , as its echoes once more awaken the shouts of liberty ! Tal . Talathon Zenocles , command me  --  But stay  --  Should Ali reject the treaty , and decide to tempt to the last the chance of battle in the citidel  --  Zeno . Zenocles Then , Talathon , to you , and to you only , can we look . The warriors of Ali , whom you command , have more than once signalized their devotion to you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ismail , may make them eager to earn their pardon of the foe , and their feeble attachment to Ali will soon be lost , in the hope of sharing the spoils of his overthrow . Tal . Talathon Yanina shall be avenged . Enter Helena at the back of the Stage . Hel . Helena ( Overhearing the last words . ) Ha ! ( Aside , and observing Talathon and Zenocles . ) Zeno . Zenocles Exult , my countrymen , exult ! The hour is come , when , like your own Ulyssis , ye shall cast off the weeds of slavery , and once illeg . ( Music heard faintly . ) Tal . Talathon Hear you those sounds ! Ali approaches . Death to the tyrant ! Zeno . Zenocles Death to all his race ! Hel . Helena ( Aside . ) To all his race ! Horrible ? Oh Selim ! Grant , Heaven grant , I may not be too late to save thy life , and those most dear to thee ! ( Exit hastily . Tal . Talathon We must separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go sound my fellow-chieftains . Farewell ! ( Going . Enter Ali and Mouctar . Ali . Ali Pacha ( To Tal . ) Stay Talathon , ( to Zeno . ) Envoy of Ismail , I accept the treaty , and to seal it now , only wait for Ibrahim , Mouctar you know your duty ? Mouctar bows and Exit . While as a pledge of my good faith , the chains of Ibrahim being broken , come share the rejoicings in celebration of my victorious return . Ali ascends his Throne and makes a sign for Talathon and Zenocles to take their places on seats placed for them . Slaves and dancers enter . War Dance . Chorus . Chorus ( Words by Lord Byron . ) Tambourgi , Tambourgi , thy ' larum afar Gives hope to the valiant and promise of war ; All the sons of the mountain arise at the note , Chimariot , Illyrian and dark Suliote , I remember the moment when Previsa fell , The shrieks of the conquer 'd , the conqueror 's yell  --  The roofs that we fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we slaughter 'd the lovely we spared .

Selictar , unsheath , then , our chief 's scymetar ! Tambourgi , thy ' larum gives promise of war ! Ye mountains , that see us descend to the shore , Shall view us as victors , or view us no more . All go up stage . After which Enter Mouctar . Mouc . Mouctar Long live the Pacha of Yanina , and confusion to his enemies ! Ibrahim is no more . Tal . Talathon What do I hear ? Zeno . Zenocles Is this the pledge of Ali Thebelen 's good faith ? Ali . Ali Pacha Thus is the pledge of Ali Thebelen to Ismail 's insulting pardon . Dare a nameless Pacha offer terms to me ? Hope to see Ali yield while he can fight !  --  Ghieftain , the wars of eighty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , while there remains to me a citadel , and ( Pointing to Talathon , ) such soldiers to defend it . I am nearer to Constantinople than to banishment . Ismail offer me a treaty ! Be Ali 's treaty with a slave written in his blood ! Mouctar , take him his father 's head ! That is my pledge of peace ! Zeno . Zenocles ( Aside . ) Hear you the heartless Despot ? Now is the time . Tal . Talathon ( Aside to Zenocles . ) He falls , and instantly . ( going . ) Enter Selim and Helena , suddenly . Se . Selim Detain Talathon ! Let him not escape ! Zeno . Zenocles Ha ! Mouctar prevents Talathon from quitting the stage Ali . Ali Pacha What say you ? Se . Selim That traitor and the Ambassador of Ismail plot our ruin . Helena overheard their oaths of murder . Ali . Ali Pacha Seize , and disarm the traitors ! Mouctar and Officers obey . Helena ! I will not dissemble . I deemed thee in heart my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act redeems thee  --  Live and be Selim 's bride . ( To Talathon . ) But thou , lifted by my bounty to the first rank among my warriors , what could thy folly hope from my destruction ? Tal . Talathon Absolution for having been thy accomplice . My purposes are known  --  strike . To be thy victim , is some honour , to be thy follower , a disgrace . Ali . Ali Pacha ( To Zeno . ) And thou , whose eye flash 'd fire at the tale of Ibrahim 's fall . Thou , who hast stolen into my palace like a spy , fit agent of the base schemes of Ismail ? Zeno . Zenocles Accuse not Ismail of a scheme , springing solely from my hate . I served my own revenge , but not Ismail 's . Ali . Ali Pacha Thy revenge ! What can'st thou have to revenge on Ali ? Zeno . Zenocles Greece is my country  --  can you ask now what I have to revenge ? Is there one of my nation who finds not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Were not thy memory lost among the myriads of thy victims , thou need'st not have asked the wrongs of the most injured . Remember Epirus , and thy deadliest foe . Remember Zenocles ! ( Discovers himself . ) Ali . Ali Pacha Zenocles Zeno . Zenocles Aye , barbarian ; the sole survivor of his murder 'd race , by thy hand murdered . I know my fate , and am prepared ; call forth your executioners . Let them restore me my parents , my brother , and my innocent sister . Ali . Ali Pacha Thy sister ? cease to lament her . Zeno . Zenocles How ! Ali . Ali Pacha She lives  --  but , tremble to learn where ! Zeno . Zenocles Powers of Heaven ! Ali . Ali Pacha Your sister is your denouncer ; she stands before you . Zeno . Zenocles Helena ! She rushes with a shriek into his arms . Se . Selim ( Aside . ) Oh wretched Selim ! now the die is cast ! Hel . Helena My brother . Zeno . Zenocles My long-lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that makes life precious , and die in her embrace , for whose sake only I could wish to live . Hel . Helena And must you die , and through your wretched sister ! Oh , mother , why did not the water , which received thee , close on the child ; Why have I found a brother , only to betray him , and part from him for ever ! Ali . Ali Pacha You need not part . Zeno . Zenocles How ; must she , too , share  --  Ali . Ali Pacha Your happiness  --  I give her back to thee . Zeno . Zenocles Dost thou not mock us ? Ali . Ali Pacha You wonder at my clemency . You wrong me , Zenocles . I will do more  --  I once oppressed the Greeks  --  ' t was then my policy . Now , a common danger unites us against a common foe . Zenocles , fly to your countrymen . Say , that beneath the walls of Constantinople , Ali will deserve their love . Zeno . Zenocles Thou the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace their holy cause by owning such a leader ? Thou art their foe . " Let Ali periah ! "  --  Such is the cry of all Greece , and to that will Zenocles die faithful . Ali . Ali Pacha What ? I forgive the Greeks ! I deceived thee ; I was born to be their scourge . In the mere thought of serving them , I betrayed my destiny , and gave the lie to sixty years of hatred . ' T is I , who , in the hearts of their cities have kindled discords , which shall consume them ; while alone , towering in this citadel , I live to see the traveller seek , on the wreck of ancient Greece , the ruins of the new . Zeno . Zenocles Oh ! ill-starr 'd nation ! Tal . Talathon Oh , my insulted country ! Ali . Ali Pacha Nay , do not mourn . Ye will both be spared the agony of seeing it .

Let Ali recommence in thee . Show thyself worthy of my two sons  --  sons , who are worthy of their father . ( Enter Hassan . Hass . Hassan Where , where is the Pacha ? Ali . Ali Pacha How now , slave ! What means this strange intrusion ? Hass . Hassan Pacha , thy two sons  --  Ali . Ali Pacha What of them ? Hass . Hassan Have fallen !

Ali conceals the letter . Enter Selim . Selim , revolt rears its haughty crest in the citadel ; as yet it has only dared to glance strange looks , and utter indistinct reproaches , but its looks will soon turn into thunderbolts , and its mutterings swell to shouts of vengeance !
