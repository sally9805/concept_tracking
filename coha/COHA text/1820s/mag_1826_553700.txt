txt ART . IX. - J'Iiiemoir of the Life of Josiah Quincy Junior , of . iVlassachusetts . By his Son , JOSIAH QUINCY . Boston . 1825 . Cummings , Billiard &amp; Company . Svo. pp. 498 . THE history of the American revolution , familiar as it is in its 1 ) prominent features , relates to a subject of so much importance , as may well inspire that general and growing interest , which is observable , to learn the minuter circumstances , that may be communicated by authentic memoirs , respecting the causes , principles , and incidents of the contest , and of the distinguished agents in the great transaction . During the war , all hearts were engaged in active and arduous efforts , to bring it to a successful issue . While such energies were in exercise , the interesting 1 ) rcliminary questions relative to colonial rights and duties , allegiance and supremacy , which had been so amply and ably discussed , were superseded . When peace was declared ; and independence secured , the whole country was miserably exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all became earnestly engaged , according to their opportunities , in repairing their wasted fortunes , or in securing the means of subsistence in the van0115 employments , to which they had been accustomed , or in the new pursuits which were opened by the revolution . To these exertions there ere , for a time , many discouraging obstacles . The change of political relations , resulting frouo the revolution , imp*ded , in a degree , the prosecution of some of the former branches of business . Time , experience* // and more abundant means , than were then possessed , were necessary for successful pursuits , in the new avenues which were presented . In the mean time , the public debt was pressing , no adequate national provision existed foP its discharge . and the honorable exertions of individual states to comply with their obligations , were beyond their means , created discontents , and , in one inst* nee , rebellioiK To th*se discouraging incidents , were added some untoward circumstances , in reference to the brave men , who fon ht the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited a dissatisfaction , that for a lime restrained the generoiis emotions , which would otherwise have natut ally prevailed . From these and other causes , which mi* ht be to *ntioned , we are not to look to the early yeats of our national progress , immediately after the war , for any very inteire interest in the history of the revolution . The important discusions which succeeded , relative to a new organisation of the national government , comt-n ' nded almost e. clusive attention to that object . The French revolution , which followed , revived congenial feelings and sentiments connected with the Ameiican contest ; but the bloody and revolting transactions , which accompanied that memorable struggle , repressed the early sympathies , which were manifested , and considerate men devoted all their influence , to guard *gainst the dangers of perverted sentiment , to establish the new national edifice on solid foundations , and to maintain a safe and steady course in the administration of public affluirs , during the fierce and alarming conflicts of contending nations . It was then that a recurrence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by becoming the insirLunent of party . In every stage , however , it may be af rmed , there has been no real want of attachment to those principtes. *len only differed as to the time , manner , and occasion of their expression , and as to their application . In the course of events , there is happily a return to the old good sense and old good humor ' of the country ; and we have arrived at a period , commencing with the treaty of Ghent , when a greater d e*r e of political catholicisni prevails , and among the various interesting topics to which a liberal curiosity is ext ended , the principles , causes , // events , and characters of the revolution , have their just share ol public attention . Speculations and details of this description are more valuable and deserving a complacent reception , as they are free from party views , and are not for the purpose of reviving extinguished animolties . They are regarded as a just tribute to depart*d worthies ; as preserving precious elements of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as laudable incitements to manly sentiment and m *nanimous deportment , in seasons of distress and danger . Under such iml ) ressions , they come with a lively warmth , but with a pure and chastened tone , from me n of refined taste a ' *icl elevated views . We follow them to scenes of strenuous action , not for the indulgence of angry passions , but from dutiful regards and grateful remembrances , in harmony with generous affections , and not unfrLndiy to that difibsive philanthropy , which it is desirahie to cultivate . hine maxima porr* Accepit Roma , et patrium servavit honorem . A memoir of the life of Josiah Quiacy junior could , at no period , he uninteresting to the Americ n people ; but from the considerations which have been suggested , and from the remarks of the worthy and respectable editor , we can not but think the time of publication to be well chosen . CBy the lapse of half a century , the actors in the scenes immediately preceding the war of the American Revolution , begin to be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to right feeling and just criticism . In the possession of freedom , happiness , and prosperity , seldom if ever before equalled in the history of nations , the hearts of the American people naturally turn towards the memories of those , who , under Providence , were the instruments of obtaining these blessings . Curiosity awakens concerning their characters and motives . The desire grows daily more universal to repay , with a h te and distant gratitude , their long neglected , and often forgotten , sacrifices and sufferings . ' p. v. The volume consists of a well written biographical sketch of Mr Quincy , of copious extracts from his journals , kept on a tour to the Southern Provinces , as they were then denominated , and on a visit to England , of copies of letters to and from his friends and correspondents , principally on political // topics , and a reprint of his Observations on the Boston Port Bill . The chief memorials of Josiah Quincy junior , bfionging to this class , were , by his last will , bequeathed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fiequently been solicited for publication , but , with the exception of the few extracts , which Gordon maCe nd inserted in the first volume of his History of the American Re *olution , no part has before been submitted to the press . They are now given to the general eye , not so much because they belong to that individual , as because his memory , from the circumstances of his life , death , character , and labors , is inseparably identified with the times in which he lived , and with the fortunes of his country. * p. vii . The family of Quincy commences , on American ground , with Edmund Quincy , who came from England with the Rev. John Cotton , and arrived at Boston , September , 1633 . Josiah Quincy junior was of the fourth generation from that venecable head , being the youngest of three brothers , sons of Josiah Quincy of Braintree , Massachusetts , who was the youngest san of Edmund Quincy , grandson of the Edmund first named . This family , in all its branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have , in a high degree , deservedly enjoyed the public confidence , in places of public trust and employment . The first Edmund Q uincy was one of the representatives of Boston , to the first General Court head in the colony . His only son , Edmund , who ( lied in 1697 , was a magistrate of the county of Suffolk , arid lieutenant colonel of the Suffolk regiment . John Quincy , his son , born 1689 , was Speaker of the House of Representatives , for many successive years , and afterwards a member of the Council . Edmund , his brother , was , in early life , a representative of Braintree , afterwards member of the Council , and Judge of the Superior Court of Judicature , from 1718 to his death , in 1738 . He died of the small pox , in London , being , at that time , agent from Massachusetts , relative to a controversy with New tlampshire , respecting the boundary line between the two provieces* In grateful return for his eminent public services , a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirs , by the General Court , and a monument was erected to his memory , at the place of his interment , in London , ( Btinhill-fields , ) at the expense of the province . // Josiah Quincy , his youngest son , accompanied his father to England . In 1766 he was employed to negotiate with Pennsylvania and New York , for assistance against the French aggressions on the frontiers . In the execution of this commission he became acquainted with Dr Franklin , with whom , and with other distinguished men of the age , he kept up a correspondence until his death , in 1784 , having for many years lived in retirement , on his paternal estate , in Braintree . This estate , now the seat of his grandson , editor of this work , is in Qeincy , a town set off from Braintree in 1792 . In that town , also , is the paternal estate of John Quincy , above mentioned . It includes Mount Wellauton , the residence , in early time ; of Thomas Morton , who was muted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate is now the property of his great grandson , John Quincy Adams , President of the United States . The subject of this memoir was horn in Boston , February 23d , I 744 , * He acquired the rudiments of a classical education , ' we are informed , at Braintree , under the tuition of Mr Joseph Marsh , who was for many years master of a highly respected private school in that town . ' We are induced to believe , that his classical studies were merely commenced with Mr Marsh , for , on reference to a list of scholars at Master Lovel 's school , in Boston , on which we may he allowed to rely , it appears , that young Quincy entered that celebrated school in 1764 , and left it in 1769 , when he was matriculated at Harvard College . Of his collegiate and professional studies and acquirements , and the developement of his character at that early period , we have the following information in the Memoir . 1.1759 , he entered Harvard University , where his industry , ml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His taste was refined by an intimate acquaintance with the ancient classics , and his soul elevated and touched by the spirit of freedom they breathe . His compositions during this period also prove , that he was extensively conversant with the best writers of the French and English schools . Above all , the genius of Shakspeare  - -  to have led captive his youthful imagination . In his writings , quotations , or forms of expression , modelled upon those of that author , perpetually recur . There still exists among his papers , a S of Josiah and Hannah Qulaq . HI . mOths nsa daughtsr.of lola Sturgis 14 of Yarmouth . // manuscript of the date of 1762 , he then being in the junior class of the college , of seventy closely and minutely written quarto pages of extracts from that writer . He was graduated in 1763 , with unblemished reputation . Three years afterwards , on taking the degree of Master of Arts , he pronounced the English oration , at that time a new thing in the exercises of the University , and considered its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** and it appears by the periodical publications of the day , that he acquired , both on account of the composition and delivery , great reputation . From the University , he passed in 1763 , into the office of Oxenbridge Thacher Esq . in Boston , one of the most eminent lawyers of the period , and entered upon the study of the law with that intense ardor and industry , which were his distinguishing characteristics . Mr Thacher died in July 1765 . SIr Quincy remained in the office during the residue of his student 's term , took a general oversight of its concerns , and on entering his professional career , succeeded to an extensive practice , which his talents , diligence , and fidelity , in a great measure , secured to himself . His industry while a student , and during the first years of his profession , is proved by several manuscript volumes , in his own hand , consisting of " Reports of cases and points of law , solemnly adjudged in the Supreme Court of the Province , ** part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eminent lawyers . The arguments of Auchmuty , Thacher , Gridle** , Otis , Adams , and other distinguished lawyers , with the cases cited , in various important questions , are here abstracted . ud preserved . ' pp. 7-9. it may be hoped , that the early specimens of Sir Quincy 's literary industry , whilst a student , will not be lost . Our printed reports are but of mod *rn date . The persevering labors of Mr Dane have preserved to us several manuscript cases of importance , which would otherwise have slept in oblivion . The volumes compiled by Mr Quincy , of Reports of cases and points of law adjudged in the Superior Court of the Province , ' must contain , it may be presumed , much valuable information , atid modern lawyers would be gratified by the perusal of the arguments , though merely in abstract , of such men as Auchmuty , Thacher , Gridley , Otis , and Adams . Mr Quincy was well fitted for his profession by his eminent talents and acquirements , and his distinguished eloquence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the business intrusted to his care , he soon acquired an extensive degree of practice . His ardent mind , // however , could not remain exclusively devoted to the duties of his profession , during the interesting political questions , which then agitated the country . The course of his studies , his family connexions , the band of eminent patriots with whom he had intimate intercourse , and especially the influences which the conversation and example of such a man as Oxeabridge Thacher , the Gamaliel at whose feet he was brought up , must have exercised , could not but engage him most devotedly in the various public topics of the day . Of this gentleman , the venerable John Adams , in one of his letters , gives an animated portrait . From 1758 to 1765 , I attended every superior and inferior court in Boston , and recollect not one in which he did not invite me home to spend evenings with him , when he made me converse with him as well as I could , on all subjects of religion , morals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theology , mythology , cosmogony , metaphysics ; Locke , Clark , Leibnitz , Bolingbroke , Berkley ; the preestablished harmony of the universe , the nature of matter and of spirit , and the eternal establishment of coincidences between them ; fate , foreknowledge absolute ; and we reasoned on such unfathomable subj *cts as high as Milton 's gentry in pandemonium , and we understood them as well as they did and no better . To such mighty mysteries he added the news of the day , and the tittle-tattle of the town . But his favorite subject was politics , and the impending threatenin* system of parliamentary taxation and universal government over the colonies . On this subject he was so anxious and agitated , that I have no doubt it occasioned his premature death . From the time when he argued the question of *vrits of assistance to his death , he considered thc king , ministry , parliament , and nation of Great Britain , as determined to new model the colonies from the foundation , to annul all their charters , to constitute them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parliamentary taxation , to apply that revenue to pay the salaries of governors , judges , and all other crown officers , and , after this , to raise a large a revenue as they pleased , to be applied to national purposes at the exchequer in England ; and , further , to establish bishops , and the whole system of the Church of England , tithes and all , throughout all British America . This system , he said , if it was suffered to prevail , would extinguish the flame of liberty all over the world ; that America would be employed as an engine to batter down all the miserable remains of liberty in Great Britain and Ireland , where only any semblance of it was left in the world. ** // We perceive , in this delineation , the character not merely of an in ( Iividual , but of the age , in its leading features . There was a free , bold , decisive , manly style of thought and action prevailing , inherited from a hardy , persecuted ancestry , and cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temper which could not brook oppression , or abuse of power in any of its forms . rrhe foundations , sustaining the spirit of liberty , were deep , strong , and indelible . The library of Harvard College , by the munificence of the younger Hollis , who did for law and polity what his uncle had done for theology , was stored with the best writers on those subjects , and her sons drank deeply from this well of English undefiled . ' Lord M*nsfieid said once , in debate , alluding to Otis 's Essay on the Rights of the Colonies , that he seldom looked into such things ; but in another case , about the same time , in a speech which is far more honorable to his mernory , * he expresses his enthusiastic admiration of President De Thou 's dedication of his history , which he never could read , he said , without rapture . If prejudice could have been dismissed , his heart might have been touched , as was the soul of Chatham , by sentiments and opinions , flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to the admired composition of President Dc Thou . At the time of the stamp act , and until after its repeal , Mr Quincy was a student in Mr Thacher 's office , and doubtless partook of the high excitement which prevailed at that period . His first political essays were two pieces , published in the Boston Gazette , in September or October , 1767 , under the signature of Hyperion . This first essay of the young Tyrt*eus of the day discovers the strong sensations , with which he viewed the measures , adopted by the parent country in reference to the colonies ; and the whole course of his conduct , during the few remaining years of his life , was in harmony with the energetic commencement of his political labors , as evinced in the essays of Ilyperion . At this period the alarming declaration , accompanying the repeal of the stamp act , had begun to be carried into execution by the act for laying duties in the colonies , on paper , ghjss , painters ' colors , tea , &amp;c. with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list in the provinces , to an indefinite extent . This measure , connected with the establishment of a board of commissioners of customs in Boston , was considered as evidencing a fixed determination in the administration to pursue , to an unknown and alarrniag extent , the project of raising a revenue from the colonies by indirect taxation , without their consent ; the high tone of authority intended to be maintained , in regard to the colonies , was further evidenced by restraining the governor , council , and assembly of New York , from passing any act until the mutiny act should be complied with . Soon afterward , ( November 2 , 1767 , ) was commenced the publication of the celebrated Farmer 's Letters , in Pennsylvania , a series of papers powerfully addressed to the understanding and feelings of the American people , in reference to The claim of a parliamentary taxation . Mr Quincy 's letter to the Reverend John Eagleston , written September 15 , 1768 , gives a view of his determined spirit , and of the state of things at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to secure the execution of the obnoxious measures , was expec te ( 1 . The transactions of the town of Boston , mentioned in that letter , ( p. 16 , ) were the results of a town meeting on the 12th of the same month , at which , besides recommending a convention of delegates to meet in Boston , it was resolved , That the freeholders , and other inhabitants of the town of Boston , would , at the peril of their lives and fortunes , take all legal and constitutional measures to defend all and singular the rights , liberties , privileges , and immunities , granted in their royal charter . That as there was an apprehension , in the minds of many , of an approaching war with France , those inhabitants , who were not provided with arms , should be requested duly to observe the laws of the province , which required that every householder should furnish himself with a complete stand . ' Respecting the last resolution , Doctor Gordon quotes a sarcastic remark published in the . A " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a French war , a disingenuous jesuitical preteuce . ' It was doubtless a mere disguise , which would seem to have been cqually unbecoming and impolitic , unless it were intended as a sort of argurnentu*n ad hominem , having reference to some false and de // lusive apologies , which had been offered for the maintenance of a considerable military force in the colonies . On the 3d of October , a few days after the arrival of the two regiments from Halifax , Mr Quincy again appears in the Boston Gazette , unintimidated , under the signature of flyperion . After what has been said and wrote on both sides of the Atlantic , upon colony affairs ; after the most perspicuous demonstration of the illegality and ill policy of the measures pursued against this continent ; it would be an affront to the understanding to attempt setting the matter in a clearer point of view . The meanest capacity must perceive , the remotest peasant in the wilds of America must feel , the consequences . British taxations , suspensions of legislatures , and standing armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadoiv the northern world . Heaven grant that a grand constellation of virtues may shine forth with redoubled lustre an sphere ! , d enlighten this gloomy hemiIf ever there was a time , this is the hour , for Americans to rouse themselves , and exert every ability . Their all is at a hazard , and the die of fate spins doubtful ! In vain do we talk of magnanimity and heroism , in vain do we trace a descent from the worthies of the earth , if we inherit not the spirit of our ancestors . Who is he , who boasteth of his patriotism ? Has lie vanquished luxury , and subdued the worldly l ) ride of his heart ? Is he not yet drinking the poisonous draught , and rolling the siveet morsel under his tongue ? He , who can not conquer the little vanity of his heart , and deny the delicacy of a debauched palate , let him lay his hand upon his mouth , and his mouth in the dust . Now is the time for this people to summon every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue , and call forth every christian grace . The wisdom of the serpent , and the innocence of the dove , and the intrepidity of the lion , with the blessing of God , will yet save us from the jaws of destruction . Where is the boasted liberty of Englishmen , if property may be disposed of , charters suspended , assemblies dissolved , and every valued right annihilated , at the uncontrollable will of an external power ? Does not every man , who feels one ethereal spark yet glowing in his bosom , find his indignation kindle , at the bare imagination of such wrongs ? What would be our sentiments , were this imagination realised ? Did the blood of the ancient Britons sivell in our veins , did the spirit of our forefathers inhabit our breasts , should ive , their dangers , their fiery trials , the thought would inspire unconquerable courage. * pp. 19-21 . In October , 1769 , he married the eldest daughter of Wilham Phillips , Esquire , an eminent merchant in Boston . In this connexion , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possessed of an intellect and spirit , capable of appreciating and supporting his own character and virtues . During his life she was the confidant of his noble views , and entering , with like ardor , into his political course , cheerfully submitted to the privations it induced , encouraging him with all her influence to risk the perils to which his open , undisguised zeal in the cause of his country , at that time , were thought to expose him and his family . She survived her husband three and twenty years ; his fame and memory being the chief solace of her life ; and the perfect fulfilment of parental duty to their surviving child , its only object . ' p. 29 . The professional eminence of Mr Quincy prompted an immediate application to him to assist in the defence of Captain Preston , and eight soldiers of the 29th British regiment , charged with the murder of five citizens of Boston , in the bloody tragedy of the 5th of March , 1770 . His sense of duty , as a lawyer , impelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , he had the support of his distinguished copatriot , John Adams , who was senior counsel in that memorable defence . Mt ' Quincy 's father , having heard reports of his engagement for the prisoners , wrote an anxious letter of inquiry on the subject . The son 's reply , ( p. 36 , ) is respectful and affectionate , but decided as to the course of conduct on the occasion , which he had determined to adopt . The published account of the trial contains Mr Quincy 's able and eloquent argument at length ; which is also given in this volume . It discovers great ingenuity , and beauty of sentimnent and expression , and we can not but notice the address with which he not only avoids embarrassment , from his well known political character , but finds occasion to introduce trains of thought connecting the grounds of defence with his political opinions and doctrines . Captain Preston , who was tried separately , and six of the soldiers , were acquitted . Two of the soldiers were convicted of manslaughter . In 1771 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political writer , were incessant , and all his performances in the great public // cause , in which he engaged , breathed that bold , ardent , and vehement spirit , which characterised his life , speech*s , and writings . ' These exertions , with his professional labors , exhausted his strength , and enfeebled a frame naturally not robust . In the latter part of 1772 , such decided symptoms of pulmonary disease were manifested , that he found it necessary for a time to abandon the field of debate , and to repair to a more southern climate . On the eighth of February , 1773 , he embarked for Charleston . On the same day , he commenced a Journal , from which the author of the Memoir has enriched his volume with many extracts . The generous reader will readily sympathise with the interesting valetudinarian throughout the whole of his tour , from his affectionate impressions as he sails down the harbor of Boston , in view of the shades of Braintree , the cherished abode of his childhood , and the residence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which occurred when the packet was within thirty leagues of the destined port , is feelingly depicted . The tremendous gale was atteided with rain , hail , snow , and sleet , and continued with few and inconsiderable intermissions , for five successive days . Mr Quincy arrived safely at Charleston , February 28th . His first impressions of that flourishing city were favorable , and every day of his residence , and of his intercourse with its kind and polished inhabitants , afforded additional sources of gratification . He remained in Charleston , until March 25th , when he proceeded homeward by land , visiting North Carolina , Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and New York , noticing objects worthy of attention , in reference to soil , cultivation , productions , commerce , manners and customs , political and civil institutions , and cultivating an acquaintance with many eminent men , particularly with those who had engaged with interest in the cause which he had so much at heart . At New York he took passage for Newport , passing down the Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of May . During this brief absence , his active mind , surmounting the disease with which he was afflicted , was busily engaged , an.d the remarks in his journal , on men and things , give abundant evidence of discrimination and just discernment , and of the generous and lofty spirit // with which he was animated . In South Carolina , he became acquainted with Lavinus Clarkson , David Deis , T. L. Smith , John Mathews , Miles Brewton , Charles C. Pinckney , E. Rutledge , Messrs Bee , Parsons , Simpson , and Scott , ( the seven last mentioned all gentlemen of the bar , ) Roger Smith , Thomas Lynch , J. Rutledge , Charles Piuckney senior , and J. Aliston . C. C. Pinckney and E. Rutledge , were , at that time , just returned from England , where they had pursued their legal studies , and had taken the degree of Barrister . Mr Quincy was much in the society of these gentlemen , and received from them many polite attentions . I was much entertained , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of brilliant natural powers , and improved by a British education at the Temple . ' Mr Rutledge possessed a manuscript collection of Reports , which Mr Quincy , from his devotedness to his profession , found time to copy , amidst his many social engagements , in that hospitable city . In North Carolina he visited William Hill , a most sensible , polite gentleman , and though a crown officer , a man replete with sentiments of general liberty , and warmly attached to the cause of American freedom , ' Colonel Dry , Dr Cobham , at whose house in Wilmington , he dined , with Messrs Harnett , Hooper , Burgwin , and Dr Tucker . Mr Harnett he describes as the Samuel Adams of North Carolina , except in point of fortune . ' At Newbern he visited Judge Howard ; breakfasted with Colonel Buncombe , of Tyrrell county , and at Edenton spent his time in dining and conversing with the most celebrated lawyers . ' On the 6th of April , our traveller entered Virginia . We can not but regret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters in Virginia , from whom he would doubtless have received a most cordial reception* In Maryland he was occupied with attending the courts of law ; he mentions no gentleman to whom he was introduced , but Daniel Dulany , the Attorney General . On the 23d of April he entered Pennsylvania , and appears to have been particularly pleased with all he saw in that flourishing province . In Philadelphia he received civilities from Dr Shippen , Thomas Smith , Mr Dickinson , author of the Farmer 's Letters , Mr Galloway , Speaker of the House , Joseph Reed , Jonathan B. // Smith , Chief Justice Allen and his sons , Jared Ingersoll , and Peter Wycoff . His visit to Mr Dickinson is thus briefly communicated . May 3d . The morning of this day spent in reading , and amusements of the itinerary kind . Dined with John Dickinson IEsq. the celebrated Pennsylvania * at his country seat , about two miles and a half from to*vn . A large company were very elegantly entertained . This worthy and able politician ( for such he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse the latter appellation ) here enjoys " otium cum dignitate " as much as any man . ' p. 133 . Mr Quincy would willingly have protracted his visit in Pennsylvania , but finding a friend from New England , who was returning home , and desirous of his company , he left Philadelphia on the 9th of May . The travellers passed rapidly through New Jersey . At New York he made but few observations . He mentions a visit to the theatre , an establi-shment then a novelty in this country . On the performance , and on the character and tendency of theatrical amusements , he has the following remarks . May 11th . Breakfasted with Major Bayard ; received a few complimentary visits , and an invitation to dine with Colonel William Bayard , at his seat in the country . Went to the theatre in the evening , saw the Gamester and the Padlock performed . The actors make but an indifferent figure in tragedy , a much better in comedy . 1-Tallam has merit in every character he acts . I was , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a citizen and friend to the morals and happiness of society , I should strive hard against the admission , and much more the establishment of a theatre , in any state of which I was a member . ' pp. 138 , 139 . The journal of this tour closes with these observations . What 1 have set down will be chiefly useful to myself . A bird of passage may easily collect , peradventure bear away , food for itself ; but can transport on its fleeting tour very little , if anything , of sufficient solidity for the nourishment of others . Were I to lament anything , it would be the prevalent and extended ignorance of one colony of the concerns of another ; were I to breathe a wish , it would be , that the numerous and surprisingly increasing inhabitants of this extensive and fertile continent , may be thoroughly attentive to , and suitably actuated by , the blessings of Providence the dangers which surround them , and the duties they owe to God , themselves , and posterity . ' pp. 140 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a disclosure was made of the letters of Bernard , Hutchinson , and other crown officers , which had been transmitted from England by Dr Franklin . Mr Quincy partook , in full measure , of the indignant excitement produced by that communication , and wrote a series of essays on the subject , under the signature of Marchmont Nedham . ' A paragraph from one of these essays is quoted in the Memoir , from which we may form a judgment of the style and temper of the whole . If to appear for my country is treason , and to arm for her defence is rebellion ,  --  like my fathers , I will glory in the name of rebel and traitor ,  --  as they did in that of puritan and enthusiast . ' An acquaintance which he had made with George Clymer , of Philadelphia , distinguished in the annals of his country for enlightened patriotism , sound judgment , and undeviating integrity , produced a letter from that gentleman ( p. 144 ) on the politics of the day , in July , 1773 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which Mr Quincy replied in his characteristic manner . In May , 1774 , Mr Quincy published his chief political work , ' Observations on the Act of Parliament commonly called the Boston Port Bill , with thoughts on Civil Society , and Standing Armies . It is a bold and spirited performance , exposing in strong and indignant language the threatened vengeance on the town of Boston ; and on the concluding topics , Civil Society and Standing Armies , discovering most industrious research into various sources of information , historical , legal , or political , having a bearing on the subject ; an extent of investigation not to have been expected in a sudden production , as he declares it to be , from one of infirm health , perplexed with various avocations . ' It was dedicated to the Freeholders and Yeomanry of the Country . In you , Gentlemen , ' said he , as the landed interest of the country , do I place my confidence , under God , at this day . ' He did not live to witness the conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated . When that serious crisis arrived , the freeholders and yeomanry of the country did not disappoint his expectations . When this work was advertised as being in the press , the author received an anonymous letter from the British Coffee House , in which he // was represented as being in imminent hazard of the loss of life and confiscation of estate . ' There is , ' said the writer , but one expedient left to save you-Employ , for God 's sake , those rare talents with which he bath blessed you , in convincing the people , that they have nothing to do , but to submit , and make their peace with government . You may by this means , probably , make your peace , and ward off the punishment that hangs over your head . ' To this address Mr Quincy thought it proper to pay more attention , than is usually given to anonymous communications . He immediately published a reply in the Massachusetts Gazette . The danger and the wrongs of my country , ' said he , are to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a sense of right and duty , that not only satisfies my conscience , hut inspires my zeal . While I have this sentiment , I shall persevere , till my understanding is convinced of its error ; a conviction that will not be wrought by the arm of power , or the hand of an assassin . Threats of impending danger , communicated by persons who conceal their name and character , ought never to deter from the path of duty ; but exciting contempt rather than fear , they will determine a man of spirit to proceed with new vigor and energy , in his public conduct . ' Soon after the execution of the Port Bill bad commenced , Mr Quincy received letters from Mr Clymer and Mr Dickinson , on the state of affairs , and communicating the feelings and opinions prevailing in Pennsylvania , and in other colonies , on the sufferings and proceedings of the Bostonians . The following is an extract of a letter from him to Mr Dickinson , dated Boston , *August 20 , 1774 . At the urgent solicitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , I have agreed to relinquish business , and embark for London , and shall sail in eighteen days certainly . I am flattered by those who perhaps place too great confidence in me , that I may do some good the ensuing winter , at the court of Great Britain . Hence I have taken this unexpected resolution . My design is to be kept as long secret as possible ,  --  1 hope till I get to Europe . Should it transpire that I was going home , our public enemies here would be as indefatigable and persevering to my injury , as they have been to the cause in which I am engaged , heart and hand ; perhaps more so , as personal pique would be added to public malevolence. // I would solicit , earnestly , intelligence from you , sir , while in London . I shall endeavor to procure the earliest information from all parts of the continent . As I propose dedicating myself wholly to the service of my country , I shall stand in need of the aid of every friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I esteem none more capable of affording me that aid , than those who inhabit the fertile banks of the Delaware . ' p. 173 . Mr Quincy 's intention of a voyage to England , was communicated only to his relations and a few political friends . He embarked privately at Salem , on the 28th of September , 1774 , carrying with him suitable letters of introduction to those characters , with whom he wished to become acquainted . The celebrated Congress of 1774 was then setting at Philadelphia . Samuel Adams and John Adams were members of that body . From John Adams he received an affectionate letter before his departure . Samuel Adams , in a letter to Rev. Dr Chauncy , observed , that Mr Quincy had informed him of his intended voyage . I am persuaded , ' he adds , he may do great service there . ' The particular objects in view do not appear to be specified . The plan was evidently urged by the political friends in whom he had most confidence . It was probably for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prudently be communicated by letter , to counteract representations which might be made by governor Hutchinson and others , who had then recently repaired to England , and perhaps with the hope of some salutary impression on members of the government , or other men of influence , from one who had so many points of character to recommend him . He landed at Falmouth on the 8th of November , and made the following entry in the journal , which he began at the commencement of the voyage . Having reached the famous island of Great Britain , I am prone to contemplate the glorious deeds that have made it immortal ,  --  but alas ! my affections and my duty call me to consider the state of my native country . ' p. 221 . On the same day he wrote to Mrs Quincy , concluding a letter which he had commenced some time previously at sea . To this lady almost all his letters written whilst in England , and which appear in the Memoir , are addressed . They are almost wholly on political topics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high concerns , to which her // husband was devoted . They were designed also , as is often exl ) ressed , for communication to a circle of political friends . His health , we find by the first letters , was improved by the voyage , and he immediately engaged in active attention to every object of interest around him . November 9th . Proceeded from Falmouth to Bodmyn , twentytwo miles . Passed through the town of Pendryn , and several small villages . The roads hilly and good , affording agreeable riding , and delightful land prospects . The cultivation of the land can scarcely be realised by a mere American ; it is to a wonderful perfection . The first reflection upon the immense labor that must be bestowed on these fields was , where the men lived , who did the work . Extensive fields , highly tilled , without a house . This was an object , which occurred almost every hour . The villages in which the laborers and peasantry chiefly reside , are built of small stones and clay , generally miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are servile in their obeisance , and despondent in their appearance . I could not help remarking , that if the little liberty diffused through . Britain , could give such a beautiful face to nature , what would be the appearance , if there was as much general liberty , as was consistent with that fundamental principle of social policy , " the greatest happiness of the greatest number . " November 11th . Though a very cold and stormy day , I viewed Plymouth Docks , and went on board and all over the Royal George , a first rate , pierced for two hundred and ten , and carrying two hundred guns . The ropewalks , buildings , armory , arsenal , naval and warlike stores , exceed the power of the human mind to conceive , that doth not actually behold . I will not attempt to describe what I could scarcely realise to be true , while I was actually viewing . My ideas of the riches and powers of this great nation are increased to a degree I should not have believed , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 , 74 , 80 , and 100 gun ships ; and ivent on board a loaded Indiaman just arrived ; but this , being after viewing the preceding magnificence , did not much move me . The various materials , and the several degrees of building , from the laying of the keel , to the finishing an hundred gun ship , which were very carefully viewed by me , in several instances , excited an astonishment I never before experienced . ' pp. 224-226 . The impressions of national strength , which the view of these and other specimens of power and magnificence pro vos*. xxms .. - uo. 50. 25 // duced , do not appear to have excited discouraging apprehensions of the fate of his country 's cause , in the event of a resort to arms , but the whole tenor of his correspondence , whilst in England , manifests a persuasion that such would be the issue of the controversy , and firm confidence in the result . On the 17th of November he arrived in London . We copy the following entries in his journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brornfield , C. Dilly , and J. Williams , from all of whom I received many civilities . Waited upon Dr Franklin , and drank tea with him . He appears in good health and spirits , and seems warm in our cause , and confident in our ultimate success . I find many friends to liberty and America , rejoiced on notice of my arrival . ' pp. 227 , 228 . On the same day he thus writes to Mrs Quincy About ten hours ago , I arrived in this great city , and am now at my lodgings , near the Hay Market . With you , and my friends , the first object and inquiry will be about my health and spirits . In one word ( for just now I am a man of too much business to use many ) they are both surprisingly fine ,  --  rather bordering upon extravagance , than under par .

The same may be said of Exeter and Salisbury cathedrals. - But why do I waste time upon any other subject , than my country ? I have spent about two hours today with Dr Franklin . He appears the stanch friend of America , and confident of the ultimate success of its friends . He has promised me his patronage , and I have reason to believe him sincere . He inquired particularly after " his old friend , " my father . ' pp. 228 , 229 . The residence of such a man as Mr Quincy in England , and his observations on men and things , in that interesting country , can not but be highly engaging to every liberal mind . No reader of that description will be satisfied , without a perusal of his entire journal and correspondence during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every American , from its reference to a most important period in our eventful history . XVe have only space for the admission of a few particulars noted in the journal . // November 18th . This morning , J. Williams , Esquire , inspector of the customs in the iVlassachusetts Bay , waited upon me , and we had more than an hour 's private conversation together . He informed me , that Governor Hutchinson had repeatedly assured the ministry that a union of the colonies was utterly impracticable ; that the people were greatly divided among themselves , in every colony ; and that there could be no doubt , that all America would submit , and that they must , and moreover would , soon . Dined with Doctor Fra**klin , in company with Doctor Bancroft and Mr Williams . Doctor Franklin confirmed the account given by Mr Williams relative to Governor Ilutchinson , so far as that several of the nobility , and ministry , had assured him of the same facts . November 19th . Early this morning J. Williams , Esquire , waited upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to see me this morning . I went about half past nine o'clock , and found Sir George Savil ( as Mr Williams informed me ) in the levee room . After a short time his lordship sent for Mr Williams and myself into his apartment . His reception was polite , and with a cheerfi*l affability his lordship soon inquired into the state , in which I had left American affairs . I gave him my sentiments upon them , together with what I took to be the causes of most of our political evils ; - gross misrepresentation and falsehood . His lordship replied , he did not doubt there had been much ; but added , that very honest men frequently gave a *vrong statement of matters through mistake , prejudice , prepossessions , and biases , of one kind or other . I conceded the possibility of this , but further added , that it would be happy , if none of those who had given accounts relative to America had varied from known truth , from worse motives . We entered largely into the propriety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject I received much pleasure . His lordship several times smiled , and once seemed touched . We spoke considerably upon the sentiments of Americans , of the right claimed by Parliament to tax ,  --  of the destruction of the tea ,  --  and the justice of payment for it . His lordship went largely and repeatedly into an exculpation of the ministry . He said they were obliged to do what they did ; that it was the most lenient measure that was proposed ; that if administration had not adopted it , they would have been called to an account ; that the nation were highly incensed , &amp;c . Upon this topic I made many remarks with much freedom and explicitness , and should have said more , had not his lordship 's propensity to converse been incompatible with my own loquacity . His lordship more than thrice spoke of the power of Great Britain . // of their determination to exert it to the utmost , in order to effect the submission of the colonies . He said repeatedly , " We must try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed over America . If we are defective in power , we must sit down con* tented , and make the best terms we can , and nobody then can blame us , after we have done our utmost ; but till we have tried what we can do , we can never be justified in receding . We ought , and we shall be very careful not to judge a thing impossible , because it may be difficult ; nay , we ought to try what we can effect , before we determine upon its impracticability . " This last sentiment , and very nearly in the same words , was often repeated ,  --  I thought I knew for what purpose . His lordship spoke also upon the destruction of the Gaspee , and in direct terms twice said , that the commissioners were appointed to try that matter , and had transmitted accounts that they could obtain no evidence . This declaration being in flat contradiction to what I had several times heard Chief Justive Oliver declare to be the case from the bench , when giving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . His Honor ever most solemnly declared , in public and private , that the commission was to inquire whether any such event had happened , in order to send word to England , that so a trial might , or might not be or dered , as the evidence might be ; and in the most express terms declared the commissioners had no power to try . In the course of near two * conversation , many things more passed between us . As many letters and messages were delivered to his lordship while I was present , I several times rose to depart , telling his lordship I was afraid I should trespass on his patience , or the concerns of others ; but being requested to stay , I remained about two hours and then rose to go , but his lordship kept standing , while he continued his conversation with his usual spirit . Upon my departure he asked me when I should leave England . I told him it was uncertain ,  --  but imagined not this twelvemonth . He hoped the air of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the most unhealthy months were past ; and then saying , " I am much obliged to you for calling on me , " we left each other to our meditations. ' pp. 231-236 . November 23d . Dined with Messrs Dilly , and a few friends of liberty , and spent the residue of the day in delivering letters . At night Mr Inspector Williams waited on me , with the compliments of Lord Dartmouth , and requested my waiting on him tomorrow at ten o'clock . Mr Williams gave me a curious account of a conversation with his lordship relative to my * Received the compliments of Governor Pownall to breakfast with him . // November 24th . Waited upon Lord Dartmouth , and had about an hour and a half conversation with him . I was convinced that the American and British controversy would be much sooner , and much more equitably settled , if it were not tbr the malevolent influence of a certain Northern personage now in Great Britain . Lord Dartmouth being called out for a few minutes to attend the physicians of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet that lay on his table said , " I would entertain you with a pamphlet ( Observations on the Port Bill , ' ) during my absence , but I fancy you have seen this . I think you know the author of it . " His lordship bowed with a smile , which I returned , an ( l he retired for a few minutes . * Was introduced by Doctor Franklin and Doctor Price , and spent part of the afternoon and evening with the Royal Society . Spent the residue of the evening with a club of friends of liberty at the London coffee-house . Was there introduced , by Doctor Franklin and Doctor Price to Mr Alderman Oliver , Mr Vaughan , eight or nine dissenting clergymen , and several other gentlemen . I find the most sanguine hopes of good from the spirit of the Americans , and the most ardent wishes for their success . ' pp. 240 , 241 . November 24th .

At the desire of Lord Shelburne ( transmitted by Doctor Price ) I waited on his lordship , and spent two hours in conversation on American affairs . His lordship appeared a very warm friend to the Americans , approved much of their conduct and spirit , and said if they continued united they must have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to carry on a civil war against America ; that they began to hesitate and would be obliged to give way . C His lordship confirmed my former intelligence of Governor Hutchinson 's assiduity , assurance , and influence , but in the end observed that the eyes of the nation and ministry must soon be opened . He particularly said that Lord Mansfield , last session , assured the House of Lords , that the plan they had laid would go down in America , sine dade ; and affirmed that he had the best intelligence what might be carried through there . Lord Shelburne intimated , that he had no doubt Lord Mansfield 's opinion was grounded on Governor Hutchinson 's information . I had before had a very similar account of Lord Mansfield 's declarations in the House , from Mr Counsellor Allyne and Mr Arthur Lee . ' pp. 264 , 265 .

" It is not , Mr Moderator , the spirit that vapors within these walls that must stand us in stead .

In the course of conversation Doctor Franklin said , that more than sixteen years ago , long before any dispute with America , the present Lord Camden , then Mr Pratt , said to him , " For all what you Americans say of your loyalty , and all that , I know you will one day throw off your dependence on this country ; and notwithstanding your boasted affection for it , you will set up for independence. ** Doctor Franklin said , that he assured him no such idea was entertained by the Americans , nor will any such ever enter their heads , unless you grossly abuse them .

This evening I had two hours ' conversation with Colonel Barr6 , and from him I learned that he was once the friend of Mr Hutchinson , in opposition to Governor Pownall , but that he had for a long time , and especially since his last arrival in England , wholly deserted him . Colonel Barr* , while we were viewing the pictures taken from ruins found at Herculaneum , said , " I hope you have not the books containing the draughts of those ruins with you . " I replied , there was one set , I believed , in the public library at our college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be of some service as a matter of curiosity for the speculative , but let them get abroad , and you are ruined . They will infuse a taste for buildings and sculpture , and when a people get a taste for the fine arts , they are ruined . * taste that ruins whole kingdoms ; t is taste that depopulates whole nations . I could not help weeping when I surveyed the ruins of Rome . All the remains of Roman grandeur are of works , which were finished when Rome and the spirit of Romans were no more , unless I except the ruins of the Emilian baths . Mr Quincy , let your countrymen beware of taste in their buildings , equipage , and dress , as a deadly poison . " Colonel Barr* also added in the course of conversation , " About fifteen years ago , I was through a considerable part of your country ; for in the expedition against Canada , my business called me to pass by land through Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , and Albany . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 1826 .

" I replied I did not in the least doubt it , for that if I was to judge by the late acts of parliament , I should suppose that a majority of the people of Great britain still thought so ; for I found that their representatives still treated them as such . He smiled , and the discourse dropped . Colonel Barr* was among those , who voted for the Boston Port Bill . ' pp. 289 , 290 . The part taken by Colonel Barr6 on the Port Bill , has appeared strangely inconsistent with his uniloim conduct , in every other instance , , on American affairs . He partook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the destruction of the tea in Boston . It was considered as a culpable violation of private property , and unworthy of tbe high principle , which had gained to the American cause mai*y distinguished advocates in England . Dr Franklin was so impressed with the unfavorable influence produced by this incident , that he wrote to influential men in Massachusetts , earnestly recommending payment for the property destroyed . This would probably have been done , if the severe measure of the Port Bill had not been so immediately adopted , or even afterwards , if the terms of that act had not precluded any hope or expectation of relaxation , though such payment should have been made . Again , writing to Mrs Quincy , January 11 , 1775 , he says ; In the nation you have many friends and hearty well wishers to your cause . The lords and commons are-what they are ; but ANOTHER CHARACTER 15 in principle your adversary , and will never be reconciled to your deliverance , till he s es , what , peradventure , he will not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers to their duty .

' pp. 303 , 304 . January 20th . Attended the debates in the House of Lords . Good fortune gave me one of the best places for hearing , and tak* ing a few minutes . // Lord Chatham rose like Marcellus ,  --  Viros . supereminet omnes . He seemed to feel himself superior to those around him . His language , voice , and gesture were more pathetic , than I ever saw or heard before , at the bar or senate . He seemed like an old Roman senator , rising with the dignity of age , yet speaking with the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the decent solemnity of a Paul , and rising with his subject , he smote his breast with the energy and grace of a Demosthenes . This great and astonishing character opened with some general observations , on the importance and magnitude of the present American quarrel , ( as he called it ) . He enlarged upon the dangerous and ruinous events , that were coming upon the nation , in consequence of the present dispute , and of the measures , already begun and now carrying on by his majesty 's ministers . He arraigned their conduct with great severity and freedom . pp. 318 , 319 . Lord Chatham 's speech is given at length in the journal , from Mr Quincy 's notes taken at the time . He afterwards remarks , that he had great satisfaction in reading his reports of the debates in the House of Lords , to one or two friends who heard them , that they thought them v9ry correct , and spoke of the blunders , omissions , and misrepresentations of the printed accounts .

In learning , perspicuity , and pure eloquence , probably no one ever surpassed Lord Camden . ' p. 329 . The Marquis of Rockingham also supported the motion . Lords Littleton , Suffolk , Gower , rfo*vnsend , Rochford , and Weymouth , spoke in opposition . I omit stating what their lordships said , lest I should be suspected by any , who may see this journal , of an unfair report of their speeches . But a very remarkable saying of Lord Gower I can not omit . His lordship said , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( with great sneer and contempt ) " let the Americans sit talking about their natural and divine rights ! their rights as men and citizens ! their rights from God and nature ! " // The Duke of Richmond , in the course of his speech , said , " Some nobles seem to think that regular troops can easily vanquish raw soldiers . But , my lords , discipline was intended only as a substitute for what the Americans have already ; attachment to their cause , virtue to inspire , a common cause , their all , to keep them to their duty . Americans will keep to their duty without discipline . They will keep to their standard without fear of discipline in case they desert it . My lords , Americans have the substance of what discipline is only the shadow .

As nothing interesting , which I am at liberty to communicate , has taken place since your departure from home , except such matters // as you could not fail of being informed of by the public papers , I have deferred writing to you , knowing that upon your first arrival in London , you would be greatly engaged in forming your connexions with the friends of this country , to whom you have been recommended . Our friends , who have been at the continental congress , are in high spirits on account of the union which prevails throughout the colonies . It is the united voice of America , to preserve their freedom , or lose their lives in defence of it . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound result of sober inquiry and deliberation . I am convinced , that the true spirit of liberty was never so universally diffused , through all ranks and orders of people , in any country on the face of the earth , as it now is through all North America . The provincial congress met at Concord at the time appointed . About two hundred and sixty members were present . You would have thought yourself in an assembly of Spartans , or ancient Romans , had you been a *vitness to the ardor which inspired those , who spoke upon the important business they were transacting . An injunction of secrecy prevents my giving any particulars of their transactions , except such as by their express order were published in the papers ; but in general you may be assured , that they approved themselves the true representatives of a wise and brave people , determined at all events to be free . I know I night be indulged in giving you an account of our transactions , were I sure this would get safe to you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important intelligence . Next Wednesday , the 23d instant , we shall meet again according to adjournment . All that I can safely communicate to you shall be speedily transmitted . I am of opinion that the ( lissolution of the British Parliament , which we were acquainted with last week , together with some favorable letters receive ( l from England , will induce us to bear the inconvenience of living without government , until we have some farther intelligence of what may be expected from England . It will require , however , a very masterly policy to keep the province , for any considerable time longer , in its present state . The town of Boston is by far the most moderate part of the province ; they are silent and inflexible . They hope for relief but they have found from experience , that they can bear to suffer more than their oppressors or themselves thought possible . They feel the injuries they receive ,  --  they are the frequent subject of conversation ; but they take an honest pride in being singled out by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . They know that their merits , not their crimes , have made them the objects of ministerial vengeance . We endeavor to live as peaceably as possible with the soldiery , but disputes and ( luarrels often arise between the troops and the inhabitants . // General Gage has made very few new manoeuvres since you left us . He has indeed rendered the entrenchments , at the entrance of the town , as formidable as he possibly could . I have frequently been sent to him on committees , and have several times had private conversations with him . I have thought him a man of honest , upright principles , and one desirous of accommodating the difference between Great Britain and her colonies in a just and honorable way . He did not appear to be desirous of continuing the quarrel , in order to make himself necessary , which is too often the case with persons employed in public affairs ; hut a copy of a Jetter via Philadelphia , said to be written from him to Lord North , gives a very different cast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was certainly ill judged , I suppose was the work of some of that malicious group of harpies , whose disappointments make them desirous to urge the governor to drive every thing to extremes ; but in this letter ( if it be genuine ) he seems to court the office of a destroyer of the liberties , and murderer of the people of this province . But you have doubtless read the paper , and thought with indignation on its contents . I wish to know of you how affairs stand in Great Britain , and what was the principal motive of the dissolution of Parliament . If the late acts of Parliament are not to be repealed , the wisest step for both countries is fairly to separate , and not spend their blood and treasure in destroying each other . It is barely possible that Britain may depopulate North America , but I trust in God , she never can conquer the inhabitants ; and if the cruel experiment is made , I am sure , whatever fortunes may attend America , that Britain will curse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravenous pack of dependants , bartered away the wealth and glory of her empire . 1 have not time to say more at present , than to assure you that from this time you may expect to hear from me , news or no news , by every vessel , and that my earnest wish is that your abilities and integrity may be of eminent service to your country . ' pp.204-209 . Dr Franklin did not continue long in England after the departure of Mr Quincy . He remained until all hope of the adoption of the mild and reconciliatory measures , which he so studiously promoted , was dissipated , and then returned to share in the impending dangers of his country . These two eminent men , like the elder and younger Pliny , held high converse together , as on the brink of a volcano . The fate attending the ancient worthies was reversed . The aged Franklin survived for many years , and witnessed the independence of his country . Mr Quincy did not live to reach // his beloved home . A hurried , incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea , on the 21st of April , prepare us for the sad scene which ensued . The last was written at his dictation , by a seaman , who paid devoted attentions to the interesting sufferer . It was a letter , full of the most interesting and affecting communications to his family and nearest friends . This letter still exists among his papers , in the rude hand writing of an illiterate sailor . ' To this seaman he repeatedly said , that he had but one desire and prayer , which was that he might live long enough to have an interview with Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren ; that granted , he should die content . ' From his last letter some interesting extracts are given in the Memoir . My going to America at this time was very considerably against my inclinations , especially as Doctor Fothergill was of opinion , that Bristol waters would be of great advantage to me . But he did not dissuade me from going to America , but advised it very strongly in preference to my staying in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , that determined my conduct , was the extreme urgency of about fifteen or twenty most stanch friends to America , and many of them the most learned and respectable characters in the kingdom , for my immediately proceeding to Boston . Their sentiments what ought to be the conduct of Boston , and of the continent , at this , and the approaching season , I had heard very often in the social circle ; and in what things they differed , I perfectly knew . It appeared of high importance , that the sentiments of such persons should be known in America . rfo commit their sentiments to writing , was neither practicable nor prudent at this time . To the bosom of a friend they could intrust what might be of great advantage to my country . To me that trust was committed , and 1 was , immediately upon my arrival , to assemble certain persons , to whom I was to communicate my trust , and had God spared my life , it seems it would have been of great service to my country. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America six days ago , I should have been able to converse with my friends . I am persuaded that this voyage and passage are the instruments to put an end to my being . His holy will be done ! ' pp. 346-348 . To recall to view the sad and affecting circumstances , attending the departure of that exalted spirit , is * melancholy office . We would follow , in silent musings , the filial steps of his biographer , then an orphan child , unconscious of his loss , // and who now , after the lapse of half a century , performs the pious duty of recording the life and death of his father , with vivid affection ; presenting his revered image , in the best expression , to the admiring view of his beloved country . Mr Quincy expired on the 26th of April , 1775 . A few hours afterwards , the ship bearing his remains arrived at Gloucester . There the funeral rites were performed , in gloomy unison with the storm of war , which he so often foreboded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Braintree , arid deposited in the burial ground at that place. * On the death of his widow , in 1798 , a monument was erected to their memory by their son , furnished with an appropriate epitaph , written by John Quincy Adams , concluding with the following lines . STRANGER , In contemplating this monument , the frail tribute Of filial gratitude , and affection , Glows thy bold breast with patriotic flame ? Let his example point the l ) atlls of fame ! Or seeks thy heart , averse from public strife , The milder graces of domestic life ? Her kindred virtues let thy soul revere , And o'er the best of mothers drop a tear . ' * Mr Quincy 's will bears date February 28,1774 . Francis Dana , Jonathan Jackson , John Adams , William Phillips junior , and John Lowell , were named executors . A specific legacy to his son is characteristic , and indicates the school to which he was devoted . I give to my son , when he shall arrive to the age of fifteen years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Bacon 's Works , Gordon 's Tacitus , and Cato 's Letters . May the spirit of liberty rest upon him . ' Two thousand pounds were bequeathed to Harvard University , in case his son should die in his minority , as a foundation for a Pro* fessorship of Moral Philosophy , Law , and Oratory .
