By Xavier Bichat , physician to the great Hospital of Humanity at Paris , and professor of anatomy and physiology. - Translated from the French , by George Hayward .111 . D.

WE are happy to see this work in an English dress , and especially so , that the labor of translating it has been performed by one of our own countrymen , and by one so well qualified , in every point of view , to do justice to it , as Dr Hayward . It is honorable to the profession of , medicine in America , indicative of a strong tendency to a scientific study of it , and auguring well for its interests , that the first translations of the works of Bichat , and , as to the present instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in this country . They have been within a few years considerably circulated , read , and studied , and have , so far as their influence has extended , had a most happy effect , in the proper course they have directly and indirectly given to the habit of thinking and studying among the younger part of the profession. * The labor of the translator is always so tedious and forbidding , that we can hardly be sufficiently grateful to Dr Hayward for the courage with which he has attempted , and the perseverance with which he has accomplished the task of rendering four well-fillcd octavo volumcs of French into so good English as he has given us . He evinces a complete knowledge of the language , and understanding of the subject of his author , and has executed the translation with great accuracy and fidelity , and in a good style . The meaning of the author is conveyed with more than usual clearness and precisFon . The only defect we can point out , if indeed in a scientific work it be a defect , arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the translator to follow the form of expression and sentiment of the original so minutely , as occasionally to throw something like awkwardness into the translation . But in scientific works , more perhaps than in any other , it is not always possible to * The Researches on Life and Death ' of Bichat , were translated by Dr Watkins of lialtimore , in 1809 , and the Treatise on the Membranes , ' by Dr J. C. Coffin of Boston , in 1813 , some years before translations of the same orks appeared in England // find expressions in one language , which shall be exactly equivalent to those in another ; there is often also a peculiarity of thought and sentiment so intimately associated with a peculiarity of phraseology , that the one can not be varied without weakening the force of the other , and it is better that something of a foreign idiom should be observable , than that the sentiments of the author should be expressed less exactly and clearly . It is to be considered that in a translation we have not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also to render his thoughts . The difference which exists between one man 's writing and another 's , does not depend more upon the language which he uses , than it does upon the mode of presenting his thoughts , the associations in which he brings them forward , and the relations and connexions which he exhibits between them . In all writing , these things are almost inseparably connected , and taken together constitute the style of composition , which consists not merely in language , but also in the relation and connexion of language with thought . Now the translator has to consider and allow for all this . For he may , in modifying the form of expression of his author , modify also his form of thought ; he may , in substituting an English idiom for a French , substitute also a different meaning ; and , in giving his own coloring to the languago , give in some measure his own coloring to the opinions . This remark we think particularly applicable to Bichat , the style of whose compositions , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong peculiarities , the entire removal of which , however it might improve the English style of the translation , would not compensate for the less perfect conveyance of his ideas . We believe that those , at least , who have been accustomed to read his works in the original , will allow that some of his thoughts can be in no way so clearly expressed , as by a bald and idiomatic translation of them ; in no other way can they be made to retain so much of that peculiar emphasis , that relish , if we may so speak , which they have in the original . The present translation , however , requires no apology on this score , since it is far more free from the fault to which we have alluded , than translations of medical works have usually been . It is every way worthy of confidence , as a faithful picture of the original . We have carefully examined the greater part of this volume in comparison with the French , and // have been able to detect scarcely any instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the author . It will form certainly a most valuable addition to our medical literature , and will , we trust , be extensively circulated . It has even higher claims upon the attention , than the former works of Bichat , which have been published in this country ; it will richly repay the physician for a careful and diligent study of it , and is not unworthy the perusal of even the general reader . The author was one of those extraordinary men , the history of whose life , character , and opinions ought not to be confined to the narrow circle of his own profession . They are truly the property of the whole literary world ; they are worthy of the attention of all who are interested in the advancement of science , or take pleasure in contemplating the success and achievements of the human intellect ; and yet with all his claim to notice , he affords one more striking example of the uncertainty and limited extent of medical reputation . No man , perhaps , ever entered the profession tinder more happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , probably , ever possessed greater advantages for prosecuting his studies , or improved them more completely to the extent of his ability . We believe that no man , in the same space of time , ever accomplished so much in the same kind of pursuits . Few , in any department of scientific labor , have exhibited a more rare combination of elevated intellectual qualities accompanied with such unfaltering industry and perseverance . And yet after all , how little has been known of him out of his own country , even among those to whose profession he was an honor . How little has been known of him any where , out of that profession ; although had the same originality of genius , the same strength of intellect , the same acute spirit of observation , the same persevering and zealous industry been devoted to almost any other department of study , we know of no name among the philosophers of the present day , which would have filled a larger sphere in the world of science , or stood higher upon the catalogue of fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accomplished medical character , are not intrinsically less rare and valuable , although perhaps less imposing and splendid , than those requisite for distinction of any other kind . Indeed , we suspect that a man of a superficial mind would find it harder it to acquire a reputation in the profession of medicine , // than in any other . That is , a well founded reputation ; for in no occupation is it so easy to acquire a sort of notoriety and currency which passes for medical fame . The iiiThTortune is , that the number of those , who are competent judges of the claims of an individual to a character for science in medicine , is very small , and is indeed almost confined to a few of the profession themselves . The habits and occupations of a great proportion of them , abstract their minds entirely from their proper studies , and incapacitate them from judging with intelligence and discrimination . Hence the works of the most solid and substantial merit have not always acquired the confidence of the profession at large , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fordyce are to many tedious and forbidding ; and there are many who , but for the name of Hunter , would be deterred at the onset from toiling through his works . Another circumstance detrimental to the extent and permanency of medical reputation , is the uncertainty of the science , the vacillating state of theory and opinion , the great number of systems which have been successively adopted by the profession , have become popular , perhaps almost universal , and have at length been discarded . An individual who has distinguished himself in one generation may be forgotten or become an object of ridicule in another , because he advocated theories which are exploded , or opinions which have become obsolete . Into by far the greater part of medical works , speculation and hypothesis are permitted so largely to enter and become incorporated so completely with the real matter of fact which they contain , that they become unintelligible when the theoretical opinions are no longer current , and of course the language in which they are conveyed has become in some measure obsolete . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable minds have been entirely lost to the profession . Physiologists and physicians , of different ages , have not differed so much in the views which they have taken of the ' laws of the system , and the practice in diseases , as they have in the language they have employed to express those views , and the hypotheses on which they have attempted to explain the nature of disease and the operation of remedies . Another consideration which renders medical reputation less desirable , is the small account which is made of it b* // the world at large . A man may be in the first rank , as a writer or a practitioner , and yet his very name be scarcely known out of the immediate sphere where he moves , except to his brethren of the faculty . The same real merit which in any other pursuit would insure him eminence and celebrity , will often in this leave him in comparative insig .. nificance . This is discouraging to an ambitious mind . Men will not labor without reward , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively , so easy to obtain , and where they do by no means regularly accompany each other , it is not strange that so many should prefer the easier reward , and seek only that sort of reputation which brings with it occupation and riches , instead of that which is only to be acquired by a deep and scientific study and which after all is limited in its extent and uncertain in its duration . Scarcely any objects of study possess intrinsically materials for so deeply fixing the interest and attention as those to which medicine relates , and yet it is truly remarkable how profoundly ignorant , by far the greater part of even intelligent and well informed men are of the structure and laws of their flame , and the principles on which diseases depend . It is to this ignorance , in part at least , may be attributed the cloud of prejudice through which almost every thing connected with the profession of medicine is viewed , and which is found so embarrassing to the fair and honorable practitioner in the conscientious discharge of his duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of deception ; a deception often rendered absolutely necessary by the impossibility of satisfying in any other way the minds of parties concerned ; or of explaining according to their comprehension and knowledge the circumstances which exist , or which render any particular course of conduct necessary . This evil might , and ought to be gradually removed by disseminating more liberal and rational views of the general principles of the profession , creating an interest in the character of its members , and thus preventing it from continuing the easy refuge of knaves and impostors , who too often share its honors and its emoluments , while they dishonor and disgrace it . There is , we think , no medical author , so well calculated as Bichat , by the character of his writings , to excite the interest // and fix the attention of extra professional readers . He contrives to throw a charm over the most dry and forbidding details , of which no other writer has been capable . And it is with the hope of exciting some attention to the subject of physiology particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we take advantage of the translation and publication of this work of his among us , to offer such a sketch as our limits will allow , of his life , character , and opinions . Marie Francis Xavier Bichat was born at Thoirette , in France , the 14th of Nov. 1771 . The earlier part of his life was not distinguished , we apprehend , by any remarkable precocity of intellect . He is mentioned merely as a young man of promise , of great ardor and industry in the pursuit of science , and exceedingly amiable and attractive in his private character . His father was a physician in the place where he was born , and with him , after leaving a seminary of learning at Lyons , on account of the disturbances occasioned by the revolution in that city , he pursued the study of anatomy . An early predilection , however , for mathematical inquiries soon carried him back to Lyons , where he indulged his taste for them , at the same time that he went on with his anatomical course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , as it proved for him in the end , the horrors of the revolution again drove him from the scene of his labors , and he found in Paris at once an asylum , and a field for exertion worthy of his ambition and his genius . He arrived there in the year 1793 , being then twenty-two years old , without any kind of recommendation or introduction , and left to depend wholly upon himself . He seemed at this period to have no aspirations for that eminence which he was destined so soon to attain ; on the contrary , his views were limited to the office of surgeon in the army , and with the intention of qualifying himself for this situation , he placed himself as a pupil under the celebrated Desault , then at the head of the profession of surgery in Prance . But in the crowd of young men , that thronged to hear the instructions of this distinguished man , Bichat possessed at first no particular claim to notice . He was , however , one of those fortunate men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to distinguish themselves . He lY* ' Series , No. 11. 18 // is said to have first drawn upon himself the attention of Dcsault in the following manner . It was the custom at his lec-. lures , for a few of the pupils , particularly selected for thtit purpose , to take notes as they were delivered , to write them out at length , and read them previously to the lecture of the following day in presence of the whole school ; this answering the purpose of a recapitulation , and serving to impress the precepts of the teacher more firmly upon the minds of his pupils . On one occasion , the individual , on whom this duty devolved , happened to be absent , and Bichat volunteered to supply his place . The subject was one of considerable nicety and difficulty , one in which Desault was much interested , had much distinguished himself , and on which he took considerable pains to make himself clearly understood . In the abstract which was read on the next day , Bichat acauitted himself to the admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , and clearness with which he detailed the opinions of his master . He was listened to , ' says one of his biographers , * with extraordinary silence , and left the theatre loaded with eulogium , and covered with the reiterated applauses of his fellow students . ' One can hardly conceive it possible that any individual , of whatever talents , could have made so distinguished a figure in the simple transcription of his notes , or have excited so much admiration by the mere detail , in ever so perfect and elegant a manner , of the ideas of another ; hut whether owing to the oc&amp;urrence of this circumstance or not , certain it is , that Bichat soon attracted the notice of Desault , was invited to his house , became a member of his family , was treated with all the kindness and affection of a father , and , from this period was associated with him in his labors and in his glory . ' During the remainder of the life of Desault , Bichat was engaged , under his direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his practice , his studies , his dissections and his lectures , and daily justified the expectations which his early performances had raised of his future progress . Death deprived him in the year 1795 of this kind friend and valuable patron , who died suddenly , as it was conjectured by poi .. son , during his attendance upon the Dauphin , leaving to Bichat the task of collecting and publishing his works ; a task which at once secured and perpetuated the fame of the master , M. P. R. Buissoxi , Anat . Descript. vol. 3. lutFod. // and was a lasting monument of the affection , the gratitude , and the intelligence of the pupil . In his twenty-fifth year , he now entered with the most brilliant advantages upon his own career . We have not the materials , nor have we indeed room to enter into any particular detail of the remaining events of his life . It was one series of arduous and successful labor ; of devotion to a great multiplicity of objects and pursuits , that might be each deemed sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with regard to each of which he brought to light many new facts and established many valuable principles . A number of essays , containing in substance the fundamental **iews which he afterwards confirmed and enlarged upon in his more celebrated works , were first read before the Medical Society of Emulation in Paris , ( a society , which we believe he was chiefly instrumental in forming , or at least , which owed much of its celebrity to his exertions ) and were published in their Transactions . It was to this association , that he originally communicated a dissertation on the membranes and an essay upon the symmetrical organs , papers which formed the basis of his admirable Treatise on the Membranes and his Researches on Life , and in fact contained the germ of the great work which is at present before us-his General Anatomy . He was constantly , by day and by night , devoted to the study of some part of the science of medicine . He was a public teacher of Physiology , and his lectures were attended by large throngs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the science which he was constantly unfolding . This science formed for a few years the principal object of his attention , and he sought only how to confirm and establish its principles , by throwing upon it all the light which it is capable of receiving from the observation of every part of the human frame , under every possible circumstance , whether of health or disease , of life or of death . At the age of twenty*seven years he first published , in a separate form , his Treatise on the Membranes , a work which established his fame on an immoveable basis , and fixed upon him the eyes of all his profession . The views , which form the basis of this work , were not originated by Bichat , they had been recognized and adopted in pathology by several previous writers ; but he enlarged , extended , and methodized them . He investigated , not only the relations of the mem // branes to their diseases , but went into a thorough examination of their structure , their history , their functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he had not the honor of the first conception of this mode of considering the membranes , he at least was the first who presented it in a clear and systematized form , who gave it a tangible shape , and caused it to exercise its proper influence upon medical stu dies . In the succeeding year appeared his Researches upon Life and Death , in two parts ; the first comprehending an extended view of the peculiar physiological doctrines he had been accustomed to teach in his lectures , principally relating to his distinction of the two lives , of which we shall say more hereafter ; the second containing a most minute and strictly philosophical investigation of the causes , phenomena and modus operandi of death , as it makes its first inroads upon the various principal organs . To this last part he had devoted much time and labor ; it was almost wholly the result of experiments performed by himself , and contributed many facts of great value to our previous stock . The number of these experiments seems to have been almost unlimited ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , and according to a biographer already quoted , no less than one hundred days were ( levoted to observations in which the carotid artery was exposed . Every part of the work bears marks of the same unwearied and persevering labor , and forms a monument of industry and talents , seldom equalled in a young man only twenty-eight years old . The views , which he had developed in his Treatise on the Membranes , led him to a similar consideration of the other textures , and he applied the same mode of investigation to them . The result of this inquiry , after having been taught and explained in his course of lectures , afforded the materials of which is composed the work at present before us , his General Anatomy . During the earlier years of his professional life , surgery and physiology alone had excited his attention ; but the field they offered for his ambition was less vast and extended than he dcsired . It had been already cultivated with success by too many distinguished men ; there seemed too little room left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , particularly in France had found fewer zealous // cultivators , it was in some measure an untrodden field ; the improved modes of investigation , which have been introduced in modern times , had not yet wrought that change iii this science , that it had in others . To this therefore Bichat determined to devote his genius and his life . Following up this determination , he entered upon the study particularly of pathological anatomy , and , as was usual with him , communicated the results of his labors in a course of lectures . The same zeal , the same ardor , the same unwearied activity was manifested in this new pursuit ; in a few months , ' says M. Buisson , he opened upwards of six hundred bodies at the Hotel Dieu , or elsewhere , and at the same time attended all the remarkable diseases in that great hospital . ' He had beert appointed one of its physicians , and found in it every facility for the prosecution of his scheme , and not satisfied with the portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of favor , to be permitted to attend to the patients of his colleagues , thus multiplying to a prodigious extent the number of his observations upon the living subjects of disease , and his examinations of the morbid changes after death . As another branch , and a most important , though neglect-* ed branch of the science of medicine , the materia medica claimed torfards the close of his life an important part of his attention , and fully sensible of the false and defective views which have always been taken of it , he became deeply interested in its improvement and desirous of introducing into its cultivation the same strict , philosophical method , which he had applied in the other departments of science . Of his labors in relation to these subjects , we are not aware that there are any distinct printed remains . In the volumes before us there are , it is true , many detached remarks , and occasionally more detailed discussions , upon pathology , materia medica , and the treatment of diseases , of very great ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , all the general and main principles , upon which he proceeded in the investigation of disease ; and it would not be difficult to trace out the principal characteristics of the plan , which he would have followed , had he lived to complete a work upon any of these subjects . Soon after the pnhlication of his General Anatomy , he began another work upon Descriptive Anatomy , of which , however , he only lived to complete two volumes ; the remainder of th' // undertaking has been accomplished by other hands. * Rich in facts , ' observes M. Husson , free from a useless parade of divisions and sub-divisions , this work presents an exact and precise description of the exterior aspect of the organs , enlarged views of the particular textures , which constitute them , and numerous researches with regard to the properties of each . ' Nothing daunted , nothing deterred him in the prosecution of his researches . He persevered during the heats of summer in performing the most tedious and offensive dissections and experiments . He watched with unceasing attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during life from disease , and after death from decomposition . He inhaled , from the mouths of his patients , the nauseous efiluvia of fevers , with a view to determine what differences in the nature of the disease might he denoted by the peculiar character of the breath . He traced in their bodies , when dead , the various disorganization and revolutions of . But this prodigal expense of self was soon to cut short his labors and his life . He lived only in his dissecting room or in his hospital , and several attacks of disease , the consequences of his imprudence and his unceasing and Unhealthful occupations , gave him serious warning to desist in time from the course he was pursuing . But warning was in vain ; he persisted , and fell , at length , a victim probably to the intense interest , with which he had continued to apply himself to his labors . On the 19th July , 1802 , whilst engaged in the dissection of a dead body , the exhalations which proceeded from it were such as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time exposed to their noxious influence alone , hut , on leaving the room , fell fainting to the ground . The symptoms of a violent fever ensued , and after remaining some time in a state of insensibility , he expired on the third of August , the fourteenth day of his disease , in the thirty-first year of his age.t A third volume had been nearly prepared for the press , and materials collected for a fourth and fifth . They have been since published , the third and fourth by Buisson , the fifth by Roux ; both of whom had been associated with him in their preparation . This is the account of the manner of his death as given by M. Husson , in a discourse delivered before the Medical Society of Emulation , and preaxed to the later editions of his Treatise on the Membranes . ' That of M. Buisson // No man , probably , at the same age , has ever arrived at an equal eminence in the medical profession ; an eminence not merely indicated by the offices he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , physician to the great Hospital of Humanity , and professor of anatomy , physiology , and rnedicine , *  --  but by the universal homage paid to his opinions in the city in which he taught , arid the veneration with which his character and memo* ry were regarded . More than five-hunded pupils attended his funeral , where an eulogium was pronounced over his remains by Lepreux , first physician to the Hotel Dieu . Bonaparte , at the representation of professor Corvisart , one of the first phy-. sicians in France , erected a monument in the Hotel Dieu , which was consecrated to the united memories of Desault and Bichat . His biographers unite in ascribing to his private character all the kind and benevolent qualities . He was , ' said Husson , in a mem9ir read before the Medical Society of Emulation a few weeks after his death , a good son , a sincere friend , an honest man ; his modesty made him less apprehensive on his own account , than on that of his booksellers , of the failure of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His character always equal , always frank , always generous , bore injustice and even injury , without impatience . He was never known meanly to seek for adulation , to covet office , or accu mulate titles ; he kept aloof from that shameful traffic of reputation , carried on in the journals , that sort of literary brokerage , in which the praise rendered seems to be but a usurious restitu* tion of that , which one of the parties concerned has previously received . A stranger to the low passions , he was sometimes their victim ; the unalterable sweetness of his disposition , and the candor of his mind would often prompt him to seek an excuse for the injuries of those who envied him . He exhibited in the ordinary commerce of life a goodness and gentleness , which invariably won all our hearts . He had also , among the most distinguished in our profession , zealous admirers and sincere friends . ' The most amiable moral qualities , ' says M* Buisson , relieved , in Bichat , the brilliancy of his merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with greater readiness in some particulars ; the fall he represents to have been merely accidental , and to have concurred , by its violence , with the other causes , in producing and increasing the severity of the disease which destroyed him , // to relinquish opinions , which are met by a solid objection . Incapable of anger and impatience , he was as accessible in moments of the most painful toil , as in those of leisure . his generosity was a sure resource , on which those of his students might rely , whose distance from their friends placed them in temporary indigence , or whose poverty deprived them of the means of instruction . Quick in discovering talents , he encouraged them in every possible manner , xvhenever he was aware of their existence . ' Europe will not believe , ' said Halli* , * that Bichat , before the age of thirty , seizing , with the hand of a master , ideas , which some men of genius had as yet only glanced at , laid the foundation of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous school of Leyden , the celebrated Sandifort , said to one of you , " in six years your Bichat will have surpassed our Boerhaave . " This was the impression of strangers . But we , we will say , that Bichat was also the best of men , that no slander ever polluted his lips , that no laurel withered at his touch , and that , modest without effort , he spoke only of what remained for him to do . No , it is mipossible that such a man should have had enemies , it is impossible he should have had detracters or those who were jealous of him . ' Bichat is principally known to us , and will be to posterity , by the peculiar views , which he adopted and has in some measure established , of some of the principal parts of the science of physiology , by his varied audvaluable researches into the structure of our organs , and the new points of view , in which he has placed the anatomy of the human body . The peculiar physiological views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly in all his works ; and it is a merit of his that he has always kept in sight the necessary connexion of this part of the science of medicine with every other , and , so far as he has developed his ideas upon the subjects of pathology , materia medica , and therapeutics , they seem all to have been founded upon and connected with the principles of physiology , which he had adopted . But in his Researches upon Life , and the Introduction to the work before us , these views are more systematically and copiously developed , and // we know of no way by which we can so well do justice to the character of the author , as by presenting to our readers a short abstract of these opinions , distinguished as they are for their ingenuity and beauty , and , for the most part , as we conceive , by their truth . Every thing around living bodies , according to Bichat , tends constantly to their destruction . And to this influence they would necessarily yield , were they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This principle is their life , and a living system is therefore necessarily always engaged in the performance of functions , whose object is to resist death . Life , however , does not consist in a single principle , as has been taught by some celebrated writers , by Stahl , Van Belmont , and Barthez , &amp;c . We are to study the phenomena of life , as we do those of other matter , and refer the operations performed in living systems to such ultimate principles as we can trace them to , in the same way that we do the operations taking place among inorganic substances . The chemist refers the phenomena of his science to the chemical , the natural philosopher to the physical properties of matter . So in physi. - ology we are to analyze the functions , as we study them , and thus discover the properties or powers of living systems , to which they are to be attributed . Living systems are thus found to be endowed with certain properties , powers , or principles , the chief of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs are rendered capable of performing the functions , upon which the continuance of life depends . Life , then , according to Bichat , is the state of being produced by the possession and exercise of what he calls the vital properties ; yet he does not always adhere with logical strictness to this definition , but rather uses the term sometimes to designate collectively the vital properties themselves , and this , perhaps , is its best and most convenient sense . His essential doctrine , however , is that there is no one single , individual , presiding principle of vitality , which animates the body , but that it is a collection of matter gifted for a time with certain powers of action , combined into organs which are thus enabled to act , and that the result is a series of functions , the connected performance of which constitutes it a living thing . This is his view of life , considered in the most general and simple way . But in carrying the examination farther , be New rres , Xe . 11. 19 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different relations , one common both to vegetables and animals , the other peculiar to animals . The vegetable exists entirely within itself , and for itself , depending upon other sub- . stances only for the materials of nutrition ; the animal , on the contrary , in addition to this internal life , has another , by which he conuects himself with objects about him , maintains relations with them , and is bound to them by the ties of mutual depend .. ence . This affords a principle , upon which to form a distinct classification of our functions . Those which we have iii common with the vegetable , which are necessary merely to our individual , bodily existence , are called the functions of organso life , because they are common to all organized matter . Those , on the other hand , which are peculiar to animals , which in them are superadded to the possession of the organic functions , are called the functions of animal life . Physiologically speaking , then , we have two lives , the con. - currence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ; both equally necessary to the relations we maintain as human beings , but not equally necessary to the simple existence of a living thing . By our organic life , food proper for our nutrition is first submitted to the operation of digestion , is then thrown into the circulation , undergoes in the lungs the changes which respiration is intended to effect , is then distributed to the organs to be applied to their nutrition ; from these , after a certain period , is taken away by absorption , thrown again into the circulation , and discharged at length from the system by means of the several exhalations and secretions . This is the life by which all the parts of the body are kept in a state of repair ; it is the life of waste and suppi ; necessarily subservient to the performance of those functions , which are the distinguishing characteristics of our nature , but not at all engaged in their performance itself . By our animal i*fe , on the contrary , we become related to the world about us ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things beside ourselves ; a knowledge also of their qualities and their capacities for producing pleasure or pain ; we feel , we reflect , we judge , we will , and react upon external things , by means of the organs of locomotion and voice , according to the result of these mental operations : we become capable of communicating and receiving pleasure and pain , happiness and misery . In fact , by the organic life we merely exist negatively ; // by the animal , that existence becomes a blessing or a curse , a source of enjoyment or of suffering. * It is not at all pretended that the idea of this division was entirely original with Bichat . Most physiologists have had some faint conception of it , and others have more distinctly recognized it under a somewhat different modification and with a different title . But he has made it peculiarly his own by the ingenious and novel manner , in which he has stated , explained , and illustrated it ; the detailed application , which he has made of it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and almost poetical air , which he has , by means of it , / thrown around many of these phenomena . In the first place , as he teaches us , the two lives differ , in some important respects , as to the organs by which their functions are performed . Those of the animal life present a syminet* y of external form , strongly contrasted with the irregularity , which is a prominent characteristic of those of organic life . In the animal life , every function is either performed by a pair of organs , perfectly similar in structure and size , situated one upon each side of the median dividing line of the body , or else by a single organ divided into two similar and perfectly symmetrical halves bythat line . Thusthe organs of sight and hearing , and of locomotion are double and similar ; the nerves of the brain go off in corresponding pairs ; the organs of smell and taste and the brain are situated with a perfect regard to this law . The organs of the organic life , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are irregularly * After the d*eath of Bichat , a work was published by M. F. R. Buisson , embracing the same parts of physiology as the Researches of Bichat , but with some modification of his views , which , however , had been submitted to his revisal , and met with his approbation . Buisson was a particular friend of Bichat , and one of the editors of the three posthumous volumes of the . finalomie Descriptive . Man , he defines to be an intelligence administered servie by organs ; and upon this view of his nature , founds a physiological classification , the same in effect as that of Bichat , The organs are of two dasses:1 . Those immediately subservient to the purposes of the intelligence , such as the eye , the ear , the or*ans of locomotion , of voice , &amp;c. and these , taken together , form the active life : 2 . Those not immediately connected with the intelligence , and not under its control , which are yet necessary to it , from nourishing and preserving the instruments , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heart , the lungs , &amp;c. these form the nutriteve lift . This division , it is obvious , does not differ essentially from that of Bi. chat ; and , although perhaps a more original and beautiful point of view , from which to look at man , as a subject of physiology , it is less perIectly applicable to life , considered as a whole , and possessed by a long series of animals *n d vegetables . // formed , and irregularly arranged ; the stomach is disposed without any regard to the median line , and one half of it bears no resemblance to the other ; the same is true of the liver , the spleen , and all the organic viscera . The heart , it is true , is a double organ , but its parts are of unequal size and strength , the rest of the circulating system presents a thousand irregularities , and the lungs are dissimilar in the two sides of the thorax in the division of their lobes , and the quantity of matter they contain . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the functions of the organs of the animal life . The exactness and perfection of vision depend upon the similarity of the impressions transmitted by the two eyes to the brain ; if these impressions are dissimilar , vision will be imperfect in proportion ; hence we shut one eye when the power of the other is increased by the interposition of a lens , and hence we squint when one eye is made weaker than the other . The same is true of all the senses , of the muscles of locomotion and voice , and of the brain itself ; if there is between the corresponding organs on the two sides , or the cor*esponding halves of the organs any inequality or dissimilarity , that is , if there is any defect of symmetry , the consequence is an imperfection in their function . Upon this principle Bichat explains the difference between different individuals in their natural capacity for distinguishing accurately the harmony of sounds . A good ear for music , as we express ourselves in common language , is only the result of the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain similar impressions ; a bad ear , on the contrary , is produced by any inequality in the organs , which transmit two unequal impressions . Thus when one , either of our ears or eyes , is deprived of its usual degree of sensibility , we can hear or see much better by making use of that alone , which is uninjured , than by having recourse to both . The same remark is extended tow the functions of smelling , tasting , and touching , and to the functions of the brain and muscles . But nothing like this is true of the organic life , to the regularity of whose operations , harmony and correspondence of action is not a necessary condition . The functions of the organic life are constantly going on ; they admit of no interruption , no repose ; whatever cause suspends , but for a moment , the respiration or the circulation , // destroys life . They form a necessary and connected series which must be always moving on in continued progression , from the beginning to the end of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is widely different . They have intervals of entire repose . The organs of this life are incapable of constant activity , they become fatigued by exercise and require rest . This rest , with regard to any particular organ , is the sleep of that organ ; and in proportion to the extent of the previous exercise , and the number of organs fatigued , the state of repose will be partial or general . Upon this principle , Bicliat founds his theory of sleep . General sleep is the combination of the sleep of particular organs . Sleep then is not any definite state , but is a more or less complete rest of the whole system in proportion to the number of organs which require repose . The most perfect sleep is that where all the functions of animal life , the sensations , the perception , the imagination , the memory , the judgment , locomotion , and voice are suspended , and the various forms of imperfect sleep exhibited in dreaming , somnabulism , &amp;c. are all produced by the wakefulness of some particular organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the animal being much under its control , the organic but slightly . In the animal life habit renders our feelings and sensations less intense , whilst it elevates and perfects the power of judging . The eye is no longer sensible of the presence of objects to which it has become familiarized , the ear akes no notice of sounds that are constantly repeated , the other senses become hardened against the operation of agents which have often excited them ; but at the same time the capacity for forming an accurate judgment with regard to their qualities has been growing more perfect . Thus a piece of music gives us at first a feeling of pleasure simply , and nothing more ; if it be often repeated , this pleasure vanishes , but we become capable of estimating the merits of its arrangement and harmony . In the organic life , it is not so ; respiration , circulation , secretion , &amp;c. are totally without the dominion of habit , and although some of the functions of this life , most intimately connected with those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in a general way a freedom from this influence is a distinguishing characteristic of the organic life . Every thing relating to the understanding is the attribute of animal life , whilst the passions on the contrary belong to the // organic life , have their seat in its organs , influence them , when they are excited into action themselves , and are on the contrary influenced by the state of the organs . The relation , which the passions have , so remarkably , with the animal life , is intermediate , and not direct ; all the primary phenomena produced by their excitement are exhibited in the internal organs ; the heart is violently excited in anger , more moderately in joy ; fear , sadness , grief produce an opposite effect . The lungs are equally affected , the respiration is quickened or impeded , a sense of oppression or suffocation is brought on , according to the nature and degree of the passion excited . in various emotions we experience peculiar sensations in the epigastrium , a sharp pain , a sense of fulness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , a spasmodic vomiting , a copious secretion from the liver or the mucous membrane of the intestines , producing a diarrhea . All the natural gestures by which we attempt to express the intellectual and moral affections , are so many proofs of the correctness of these views . if we wish to indicate any of the phenomena of the intellect , relating , for instance , to memory , to perception , or to judgment we carry the hand spontaneously to the head , but if we would express love , joy , sadness , hatred , &amp;c. we involuntarily place it upon the breast , or the stomach . We say a strong head , a well organized head , to express the perfection of understanding ; a good heart , or a feeling heart , to express moral perfection . Many of the phenomena of disease indicate the same relations between the organic viscera and our moral affections . in the diseases of some organs , the mind is cheerful and happy , taking always a favorable view of things , and this , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the contrary , when some other organs are affected , it is invariably gloomy and apprehensive , anticipating the most fearful results , and even in trivial complaints expecting the most fatal consequences . The two lives differ also in the mode and epoch of their origin . The organic is in activity from the very first period of conception , the animal enters into exercise only at birth , when external objects offer to the new individual means of connexion and relation . In the foetal state , the economy is solely occupied in the formation and nutrition of the organs ; this is the preparative stage of existence . The organs , which are to perform the functions of the animal life , are created and // perfected , but they are not exercised ; they are not accessible to the operation of the agents whose excitement is necessary to bring them into action , and of course they remain in a state of profound repose , until the stimulus , first of the air , and afterwards of food , light , and soi'inds , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great change takes place in the physiological state of man . His animal life is first brought into existence , and his organic life becomes more fully devel-. oped and more complicated , in order to accommodate itself to the increased demands which this change necessarily brings upon it . But from this moment , there is no farther alteration or improvement in the functions of the organic life . They are as perfect in the infant , as in the adult , they are not susceptible of education . But in those of the animal life every thing depends upon the education they receive ; at first feeble , imperfect , indistinct , they gradually become developed , and the direction given to this development and the character which they ultimately possess , depends in a great measure upon the influence exercised upon them by extrinsic circumstances . Differing thus in their origin and in their mode of develop .. ment , the two lives differ also in the mode of their termination in death , when this takes place naturally , that is , at the extremity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the organic has begun to fail . One after another its functions cease to be performed . The eye becomes obscured , it ceases to feel or to transmit the impression of light . The ear becomes insensible to the impulse of sound . The skin , shrivelled , hardened , deprived in part of its vessels , is capable of but an obscure and indistinct sensation ; the parts dependent upon it , the hair and beard , lose their vitality , grow white , and fall off . The intellectual functions follow in the train of the sensations , the perception is blunted , the memory fails , the judgment becomes infantile ; and at the same time the muscles under the influence of the brain , viz. those of locomotion and voice , partake of the same decrepitude . The old man moves with pain and difficulty , and speaks with a thick and trembling voice . Seated near the fire which warms him , he passes his days concentrated within himself ; estranged from every thing around him , deprived of desires , of passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no motive to break silence , happy in the feeling that he still // exists , when almost every other one has already quitted him. * In a certain sense then the animal life dies first , and leaves the organic still going on in the performance of its functions ; this separation is more or less complete and continues for a greater or less length of time in different cases . The old man may continue to breathe and digest , for some time after he has to all intents and purposes ceased to think and to feel , he continues to exist as a vegetable , when he no longer lives as an animal . Death , however , at length seizes upon the organic life . Gradually and step by step the vital forces desert the different organs ; digestion , secretion , &amp;c. languish , the circulation and respiration are successively impeded and finally stop . In considering the vital properties , as in all his inquiries concerning life , Bichat had constant regard to his grand division into the two lives ; and he recognizes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to itself , or at least , properties modified by the nature and relations of that life to whose functions they are subservient In the organic life , the organs have in the first place a sort of sensibility or perception , by which they become acquainted with the presence and qualities of the substances applied to them ; this is the organic sensibility ; they have then a property by which they react upon these substances , and excite in them motion ; this is the organic contractility . It has two modifications . 1 . Where the contraction is insensible , as in the exhalants , capillaries , secreting vessels . 2 . Where it is sensible , as in the heart , the stomach , the intestines , and these are called respectively , the insensible , and the sensible , organic contractility . In the organs of the*animal life , there is also a sensibility , by which they are not only made capable of receiving the impression of an object and its qualities , but of transmitting that impression to the common sensorium ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contracting , but is in the exercise of its power under the entire control and direction of the brain . These properties are called the animal sensibility and the animal contractility . But the principal and most important feature in the physio .. logical system of Bichat , is the complete , and entire , and exclusive explanation of all the phenomena of the living system upon the principles of vitality alone . Former physiologists* have not always kept this distinctly in view ; they have not // invariably recognized the principle , that the living system is in a certain sense insulated with regard to other matter ; that it is governed by a set of laws essentially its own , peculiar to itself . The human body has been regarded , too often , as a mass of matter , organized to be sure , but yet under the direction of physical laws , and the performance of its functions has been ascribed tothe powers of inorganic matter . Hence physiology has generally been somewhat tinctured by the favorite science of the age , with some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions were explained as much as 1 ) ossible by the laws of mechanics . The force of every muscle was calculated to a grain , the velocity and momentum of the blood were supposed to produce the motions of the living fibre , and the fibre to be so constituted as to vibrate like the chords of an instrument ; the stomach acted on the food like a pair of mill-stones , the chyle was absorbed from the intestines by the power of capillary attraction , and animal heat produced by the mutual attrition of the fluids and solids . So with the chemists , the human system was no less than a chemical laboratory . The stomach was a crucible , a retort , or an alembic ; the lungs a furnace , and respiration a true combustion , where the refuse and stubble of the system were consumed , and by the same means , with a commendable economy , the animal heat was maintained ; whilst secretion and exhalation we*e resolved into the operations of precipitation and distillation . These false views have always retarded the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ife were all in all . The phenomena of the system , whether in health or disease , were all ascribed to their influence and operation . And although there is doubtless much room for difference of opinion with regard to the particular views which he entertained of the nature of vitality , and although much may be said in defence of the opinion that it consists in one single independent principle , and not in a collection of distinct properties , yet this really makes very little difference . It is as easy to conceive the different pro .. perties to be so many distinct modes of operation of one principle , as it is to view them as existing separately , and only acting in concert . We have only to alter a few modes of expression , accordingly as we adopt one or the other of these hypotheses ; the things intended remain essentially the same , . e. the vital functions are all referred to th' operation of the // vital laws , in the same way that the phenomena of physics and chemistry are all referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of Bichat there are strong ohlections , and in a general way it may he observed , that he has very much over-rated and exaggerated the distinctions which exist between the two lives , that he has too often exhibited a caricature of the truth . Not that he had not himself perfect* ly clear ideas of their exact connexions and distinctions , but it happened , that carried away by an ardor , which had often a much poetry as philosophy in it , he gave to his doctrines the coloring of a warm and rich imagination , and like every enthusiastic young man who is eager in the diffusion of favorite opinions , frequently drew truth with too bold and ivell defined outlines , and represented that as entirely distinct in nature , which was only so in his artificial arrangenient , and in nature was blended and compounded with something else . His system affords a happy and striking expression of some of the fundamental distinctions of physiology , and though in some measure calculated to give to beginners in die science views a little too artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the phenomena of life , as exhibited in the whole vital creation , is better adapted than any other to form us to correct , methodical , and distinct views . To speak more particularly , much might he said to show thirt he attaches by far too great importance to many of the distinctions which he draws between the two lives in his Physiological Researches . This remark is true of those founded upon the external forms of the organs , the mode of their action and its duration , and those founded upon the natural end of the two lives . Not that there is not a general difference in these respects between the two lives , but that he has drawn the line with far too reat distinctness , and laid too much stress upon the division x which it establishes . More especially with respect to the influence of habit and the seat of the passions , we think very strong objections lie against the views which he has advanced ; and his doctrine of the vital properties , in precisely the form which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact relation which they severally have to the functions to whose performance they contribute , would probably meet with few defenders , although in its general essential features and with some coisiderable alterations of detail , it is that adopted by some of the most cmi i. *nt physiologists of our own country and of Europe . // The work at present before us is the fairest specimen of what Bichat was capable of effecting ; the best sample of what he promised to perform for the science of medicine . In it he exhibits more solid proofs of sagacity , more maturity of thinking , more soundness of judgment axd accurate reflection , though not more originality and ingenuity , not more extended research , not more persevering investigation , than in those which preceded it . It was written at an age , which , though for any other individual in the profession of medicine it would have been early , was , considering what he had already effected , comparatively advanced . There are indeed not many things in its plan or execution , by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-nine years ; nor indeed mans from which it could have been suspected that it was written at night , after the multiplied and exhausting la-. hors of the day , that it was sent to the press as it was written , without correction , or that the two last volumes were printed before the two first had been composed , so completely had the materials been digested and the plan laid out in the mind of its author . The plan of this work is , we believe , entirely due to the genius of B ichat , and is one of the happiest conceptions ever formed by any individual engaged in the science of medicine . It is true that the pathological facts and reasonings which gave the first hint , and afforded the main principle on which it is founded , were known for some years before the time of our author . The merit of first pointing them out has been claimed for different individuals . By the French for Pinel ; by the English for Dr Carmichael Smith and Mr Hunter . It lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so clear and distinct views , so far as they went , as the last , or contributed more to bring them distinctly before the eyes of the profession , and give them their due influence in pathology . It was probably , however , to Pinel that Bichat was indebted for the first suggestions with relation to this work . This author , in his Nosographie Philosophique , has referred to the correspondence between the character of the diseases of the different membranes and their structure ; and the analogy of the diseases of those of the same structure . This idea was seized by Bichat and carried out at large in his rJ7reatise on the Membranes , in which he made it peculiarly his own by the multitude of new fads and new views which he developed ; // describing with great accuracy the anatomy , the relations and connexions of the mcmbranes , their vital properties , in fact their whole physiological and pathological history , and establishing for them a new and scientific classification . This work contains the germ of his General Anatomy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same principle as that on which it is founded . The same mode of investigation is , in the General Anatomy , applied to all the different textures of the body , which , in the Treatise on the Membranes , is applied to them alone , in this way we are presented with a complete anatomical consideration of the whole system , under a different point of view from that which is generally taken in works upon anatomy , and a point of view exceedingly well adapted to give us clear and practical ideas , with relation to the connexion between the structure of parts and their diseases , whether functional or organic . into any analysis , or indeed any detailed account of this work it is no part of our plan to enter . But it will per , instructive and somewhat i estu* : general reader , to present a slight sketch of the general principles upon which it proceeds , and of the precise objects which it has in view . All animals , ' says Bichat , are an assemblage of different organs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own manner . to the preservation of the whole . It is several separate machines in a general one which constitutes the individual . Now these separate machines are themselves formed by many textures of a very different nature , and which really compose the elements of these organs . Chemistry has its simple bodies , which form , by the combinations of which they are susceptible , the compound bodies ; such are caloric , light , hydrogen , oxygen , carbon , azote , phosphorus , &amp;c . In the same way anatomy has its simple textures , which , by their combinations , four with four , six with six , eight with eight , &amp;c. make the organs . ' This extract affords us some idea of the nature and objects of General Anatomy . Anatomy , as it has been usually sudied , *r Descriptive Anatomy , is the anatomy of the organs . The body is taken to pieces and described in its s " veral parts . Each organ is considered as a whole , by itself or as connected with others by contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed only so far as it relates to itself , // and not to others having the same texture in common . Thus with relation to the muscles ; they are taken up individually . their form , origin , insertion , and the particular arrangement of the muscular fibre in each , are considered and described ; in relation to the abdominal viscera , their form , connexions , coats , are described ; and so with the other organs , and thus the whole body undergoes a minute examination . But all these same organs may be taken up in a different light , and this is the object of General Anatomy . Examine the stomach , we find it lined by a mucous membrane and covered by a serous ; examine the lungs , we find the same arrangement ; the bladder , still the same . But look elsewhere ; at the mouth , the eye , the ear ; we find them lined by a mucous membrane , but with no corresponding serous membrane without ; at the brain , the testis , we there find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining within . Every where we find cellular membrane , we find arteries , veins , nerves , &amp;c . Now these are what are called the different textures ; the serous , mucous , cellular , arterial , and venous textures . The same texture then is found in different parts , it contributes to the construction of different organs , intended for the accomplishment of entirely different objects ; still it possesses , wherever it is found , certain common properties , is governed by certain common laws , and takes a peculiar part in the formation of the organ . Thus the membrane which lines the stomach is subservient to digestion , that which lines the lungs , to respiration , two very different functions , and yet the analogies in structure , properties , &amp;c. , between these membranes , are so exact , that the conclusion is irresistible that they are of the same class , both mucous membranes . The same remarks may be made of the other textures . Now the object of General Anatomy , is to analyze the body , to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of a particular investigation , not as relating , except indirectly , to the organs into whose composition they enter , but as so many separate and distinct systems . This object Bichat undertook , and this he accomplished with that complete , extensive , minute , and thorough spirit of investigation , which always distinguished him with those bold , original , and ingenious views , which he always took of whatever came under his notice ; and with that strong disposition to apply every thing to some purpose of practical utility , for which he was distinguished , but which is so rarely // united with the other qualities which he possessed to so remarkable an extent . The different textures or systems he divides into two great classes . The first contains what may be called the prim-. hive or generative systems , and these are six in number ; viz. the cellular , arterial , venous , exhalant , absorbent and nervous . They contribute not merely to the formation of our organs , but may also to that of the other systems . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their peculiarity of structure to the formation of particular organs merely ; such are the osseous , medullary , cartilaginous , fibrous , fibro-cartilaginous , muscular of animal and organic life , mucous , serous , synovial , glandular , dermoid , epidermoid , and pilous systems . These are the organized elements of our whole bodies . From theircombination into organs of various forms , is made up the whole animal system , and by means of the structure and vital powers of these several textures , the organs are enabled to perform the functions assigned to them in the economy of the system . The object of the work is to present a complete and accitrate history of each of these textures separately ; to point out the distinguishing characteristics of each , and thus by assiduously studying whatever relates to the elements of our frame , arrive at the more perfect knowledge of the frame considered as a whole . The textures differ from one another characteristically in the forms which they assume . Some are always found in canals , some in flat membranes , &amp;c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alike . Some have a good deal of the cellular membrane , and many blood vessels and nerves , in others these are , more or less , wanting . They differ in hardness , thickness , color , density &amp;c . One has a fibrous arrangement , another a granulated ; one a lamellated , another a circular . They differ also in the results which they present , when submitted to the operation of chemical re-agents , and the results are to a certain degree characteristic of the texture examined . But a still more important source of distinction between the textures is founded upon thr* nature and degree of the vital properties with which they are endowed . The sensibility and contractility of animal life are predominant in th' nerves and animal muscles ; the organic sensibility and contractility ( of both kinds ) preside over the orgax*ic mu*cl*s , the // glands , the skin , &amp;c . Each of the simple textures combines , ? in different degrees , more or less , of these properties , and consequently lives with more or less energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of sensibility , which gives to it a peculiarity of character , a particular and distinguishing way of exercising the functions of life , and all these differences contribute to and form a part of the distinctions which exist between the various organs , and their functions . The textures are also farther distinguished by the time , mode , and extent of their development . Some are proportionally more developed in younger life , as the capillary , cellular , and nervous systems , others in adult and middle ages , as the muscular and the piloid. others in the more advanced stages of existence as the venous and the osseous . In the General Anatomy , Bichat has considered the textures under all these points of view . It contains , in fact , a complete system of anatomy and physiology , under a different arrangement from that in which we usually study them , and an arrangement particularly well calculated to facilitate their practical application in the investigation of disease . We think it one of the greatest excellencies of the work , that there is throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem fundamental in pathology , viz , that a st.ate of disease is not . *pec'jficaliy different from a state of health , that it depends for its existence and support upon the same powers , and is governed essentially by the same laws , only modified and turned aside from their natural course and operation by the influence of agents unnaturally applied ; and of course , that it is only by the investigation and application of the laws of health , that we can ever understand disease . It would be superfluous to attempt to point out the great advantages to he derived from this mode of studying anatomy and physiology . Every professional man must feel its importance , as soon as he understands the plan , and , perhaps , no illustrations could make any other than a professional man duly appreciate it . It is a mode peculiarly adapted to the purposes of the physician . General anatomy is truly the anatomy for the physician ; it is in fact eminently medical anatomy . And , we believe , though we may be singular in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be got from the work before us , is of no less importance to the physician , than any which he acquires from // anatomy , studied in the ordinary way , valuable as that undoubtedly is . The application of the principles contained in this work to the investigation of the nature , seat , and phenoinena of disease is direct , immediate , and obvious . They open indeed a completely distinct field in the science of pathology , which had been before but partially and occasionally cultivated . Upon the whole , Bichat may be considered as the most extraordinary man of whom the profession of medicine has yet been able to boast . Not that he was by any means the greatest man , or that he has made the most raluable contributions to the stock of our knowledge . But there is more in his history , and character , and works to excite admiration and astonishment . Let it not be supposed however that his writings are to be spoken of in terms of unqualified commendation . They will bear , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much caution , and it is particularly necessary that the younger class of professional readeis , or readers of general science , should be on their guard , lest they be carried away by the fascination of his manner and the ingenuity which he always displays , to imbibe opinions which have no solid foundation . They are the works of a young man , and must be read with that kind of reserve with which the writings of young men upon scientific subjects should always be approached . They certainly bear some marks of immaturity . His fondness for systematizing and drawing nice distinctions often leads him to refine too much , and renders his subject obscure from the very attempt to be minutely correct . He is often copious to a fault , and dilutes the truth he would inculcate , by such a flood of illustration and argument , that the thing to be proved is lost in the multiplicity of proofs , and the force of that which is sound , is overwhelmed or overlooked from its connexion with that which is unsound . This seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily and without correction , so that he retains a thousand trivial and often puerile remarks , which a revisal would have induced him to exclude . There is frequently an appearance of solidity and force in these remarks , which at first is imposing , but vanishes before a strict examination ; this deception is owing to the peculiar manner in which he announces his opinions , and to the air of ingenuity which his reasonings always display , even when they have it // not in reality . There is , in fact , throughout his works , a vast deal of inconclusive reasoning ; reasoning which at first seems plausible and unobjectionable , but which turns out to have some radical defect , that destroys at once its force and importance . Of this we can readily refer to a remarkable instance , at page 37 of the volume before us , where he endeavors to shew that the blood is not incorruptible in disease , from the fact that in opening a dead body he found , instead of the black abdominal blood , a real grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein , the trunk of the vena porta , and all the hepatic branches , so that by cutting the liver in slices , he could distinguish by the flow of this sanies , all the ramifications of the vena porta from those of the vena cava , which contained ordinary blood . ' Hence he argues that the blood had circulated in this state before death as if this sanies could have been circulating , and yet the branches of the vena cava , and indeed all the vessels of the body not contain it . No deduction can be more futile , so far as it depends upon this reasoning , and yet there are many examples where opinions are defended by arguments of as little weight as these . Yet his faults are by no means a balance for his excellencies , nor are they indeed so great or so imporant as those of most other physiologists . There is little of that direct , that intrinsic inconsistency which may be charged upon a great part of preceding writers upon similar subjects . He is seldom absurd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes among French physiologists , there is no one with whom a comparison is so readily suggested as with John Hunter , who has long held a similar rank , among the English . In native powers they probably differed more in kind , than quantity . Bichat was more quick and apt at comprehension and perception , he had more docility in acquiring and greater facility in communicating knowledge . He had , if we may so express ourselves , greater agility of mind , than Hunter , who was distinguished more for strength , depth , and energy , and less for ingenuity in defending , or clearness in stating his opinions . The former had uncommon advantages of education , advantages , it is true , which he had obtained by his own exertions and merit ; the latter comparatively very few . From the peculiar structure of his mind , or some other circumstances , Bichat early in life formed a system of thinking and studying , to which he always adhered* // This system was clearly and definitely laid out , not only in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in reference to it . Mr Hunter , on the other hand , had no idea of system writing ; the plan of one , probably , scarcely entered into his mind , and yet without being aware of it , his thoughts were perfectly systematized , and his works contain , altogether , an admiruble and most perfect system of physiological principles . Bichat thought , in order that he might form a system , his views were intentionally sent in this direction ; but Hunter seems to have had no such object , he formed a system because he thought , and from the very constitution of his intellectual powers , never thought without thinking systematically . Every thing contributed to give Bichat an immediate and brilliant reputation . He was elegant , persuasive , and fascinating , as a writer , popular and admired as a lecturer , surrounded by the pupils , and inheriting , in some measure , the reputation and influence of his master , Desault . Hunter on the other hand was poor , he had to toil his tedious way under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and obscure in his style of writing and lecturing , it was long before he could make others comprehend the important truths of which he was the discoverer , and nothing but their importance and their value could ever have made the works in which they are promulgated , standard and classical in the profession . Such indeed were the obstacles which were thus thrown in the way of his progress , that it was not till nearly the age of forty that he had become very much known , and indeed at his death which occurred at more than sixty years of age , he had not acquired a very much higher standing in his own country , than Bichat had acquired in France , at the age of thirty-one. * This difference certainly did depend , in a very considerable degree , upon the extrinsic circumstances to which we have alluded . Bichat was more brilliant , Hunter more profound . The quick , beautiful , and ingenious ideas of Bichat often affect us with all the fascination , all the piquancy of wit ; whilst those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produce in us something like the sensations of grandeur or sublimity. i3ichat had , perhaps , the most thorough knowledge , and entertained the most clear and connected views of the structure and functions of the human body , considered by themselves , and in one sense was the // *best human physiologist ; but Hunter had , with the eye of a master , looked all creation through . Not merely his own species , but the long series of living things extending from man , down to the lowest zoophyte , had all claimed a share of his attention ; and he had studied life from the top to the bottom of this immense scale of being , as one grand whole . What Bichat might have accomplished , how nearly he might have arrived to an equal standing with the great man , to whom we have compared him , it is impossible to conjec* ture . It is the highest praise that we could give him , to be named in such a connexion . That he could have effected as great a change in medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have been expected . That he would have done much , that he would have given a great impulse , and in some important respects a new direction to the inquiries of physicians , there can be little doubt , and indeed this consequence is in some measure to be anticipated from the influence of the works he has left behind him ,
