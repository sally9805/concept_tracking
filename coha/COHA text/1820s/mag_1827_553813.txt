Compiled and published under Orders of the Department of War . Svo. pp. 529. 1826 . Washington . Way &amp; Gideon . WE have placed the title of this work at the head of the present article , not only because it is a valuable compilation , judiciously executed , but because it contains many important documents , exhibiting the general policy of our government in its intercourse with the Indians . The true character of this policy has not been well understood , even in this country , and abroad it has too often furnished the motive or the pretext for grave accusation and virulent invective . This subject we now propose to examine , and in connexion with it briefly to review the conduct of the two rival nations , whose general measuyes in peace and war had produced the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the Indians , previously to the existence of the American government . The operation of the British policy has been so much more extensive and durable than that of the French , that in the observations which we shall submit to our readers , this riative importance will be kept in view . The peace of 1763 terminated the long contest between the French and British , for superiority upon the North American continent . During its continuance , which exceeded a century , the Iroquois were in the English interest , and the other // tribes in the French . We speak in general terms , and without adverting to the inconsiderable exceptions , occasioned by the local residence of some small tribes , and by other partial causes . The great contending parties availed themselves of the passions and wants of the Indians to harass their enemies , and employed them without scruple , wherever their services were useful ; and each was more successful in arraigning the conduct of its rival , than in defending its own , for this atrocious practice , equally repugnant to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no disposition to look back upon the revolting scenes of these times gone by . The Indians were employed with a full knowledge of their habits and propensities ; and many a traditionary story , as well as the more permanent memorials of history , has brought down to us , even through successive generations , afflicting details of these enormities . The cupidity of the savages was stimulated by pecuniary rewards , and human scalps , as proofs of death , were bought and sold in christiati markets. * As the fortunes of the French waned , and the superiority of the British became more and more manifest , the zeal and exertions of the Indians in the interest of the latter gradually relaxed , and they became spectators rather than actors , in the great drama , which was rapidly approaching its termination . The Iroquois appear to have become sensible , that in exalting one power and annihilating the other , their policy had been directed by very limited views , and that it would convert an ally into a master . Even as early as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address to that sovereign , portrayed , with * In the year 1754 , the war assumed a very serious aspect , and the French government , in order to stimulate the savages to cruel and merciless depredations , provided a large premium for the scalp of every Anglo-American , which the Indians should produce . This open cruelty was not retaliated hy the English government upon the French inhabitants of Canada , but a bounty was offered of ? 100 on the scalp of the Indians .

In the war between France and England , and their colonies , their Indian allies were entitled to a premium for every scalp of an enemy . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and feeling , the calamitous issue , which awaited them . We doubt not , ' said they , but our great Queen has been acquainted with our long and tedious war , in conjunction with her children , against her enemies the French , and that we have been as a strong wall for their security , even to the loss of our best men. ** Since then , so often has this strong wall been interposed between the British and their enemies , that it is now utterly demolished , and its fragments scattered to the four winds of heaven . In 1750 , the governor of New York was directed to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations , and to endeavor , by means of valuable presents , and promises of more , to xvean them from the French interest , frito which they had been artfully allured by that intriguing people , and attach them to their former friends and allies , the British . * It is evident from many circumstances , that the Indians justly appreciated the motives of the christian belligerents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both we and the French sought to amuse them with fine tales of our several upright intentions . That both parties told them , that they made war for the protection of the Indian rights , but that our actions fully discovered , that the war was only a contest , who should become masters of the country , which was the property , neither of one , nor the other . ' ( Vol . I. p. 244 . ) And the Indians told Sir William Johnson , that they believed soon they should not be able to hunt a bear into a hole in a tree , but some Englishman would claim a right to the property of it , as being his tree . ' ( lb. p. 188 . ) A change in the counsels of the Iroquois was the natural result of this state of feeling , and decided indications of this change are found in the vacillating conduct of their chiefs upon the Ohio , towards Washington , when engaged in his adventurous military embassy to the French posts in that quart*er . This state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1774 , it led to open hostilities . But at an earlier period , the unsettled state of their Indian relations must have satisfied the British government , that in succeeding to the power of the French , they had not succeeded to their influence and interest with the Indians . Pontiac 's war , and the contemporaneous attack upon most of the posts on the northwestern fronfer , and the capture of many of them ; * Wynne , Vol . I. p. 178. * lb . Vol . II . p. 24. // the expeditions of Broadstreet and Bouquet in that quarter , and of Grant in the south , together with many other military expeditions of subordinate interest , mark the excited feelings , which prevailed among the Indians , from Michilimackinac to Florida . There is a peculiar elasticity in the French character , and we stop not to inquire whether it be feeling or philosophy , by which a Frenchman accommodates himself to any situation , in which he may be placed . Upon the Seine and upon the St Lawrence , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two centuries , in the depths of the American forests , he has associated with their rude tenants , and , as he could not elevate them to his own standard , he has descended to theirs. * A mutual and permanent attachment has been the result of this intercourse , and to this day , the period of French domination is the era of all that is ' happy in Indian rennmscence . When we look hack upon the long interval of Indian intercourse , which elapsed between the first settlement on the shores of the Atlantic , and the final consolidation of the British power , nothing but a dreary waste meets the eye . Not a verdant spot cheers the sight , nor a single Oasis in this worse than Libyan desert . Remote and feeble colonies had become important and flourishing provinces , and the aboriginal inhabitants had disappeared , or receded , before the mighty tide of population , which already , from the summit of the Allegany , was spreading with exterminating force over the forests and prairies of the west . We hold no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian 's rifle is more attractive than that of the woodman 's axe , nor are we believers in that systi*m of legal metaphysics , which would give to a few naked and wandering savages , a perpetual fitle to an immense continent . But it will not at this day be disputed , that when , in the progress of improvement , the hunting grounds of the Indians give place to cultivated fields , it is our duty to render them a full equivalent . The British government is responsible for the whole course of measures4 in relation to the Indians in this country , until the war of the Revolution . Their orders were executed by their * In 1685 , the Marquis de Denonville wrote to the French government ; It has long been believed that it is necessary to mingle with the Indians in order to Frenchify them ( Franciser ) . But this is a mistake . Those with whom we mingle do not become French , but our people become Indians . ' // own officers , and during a part of this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another for the southern department , were appointed by the crown . Not a vestige remains of any permanent advantage derived by the Indians from the cessions or sacrifices they made . Their actual relations with the British government may be emphatically stated in few words . They were useful , and were used , in war to fight , and in peace to trade . Queen Anne , indeed , presented sacramental vessels to the Mohawks , and other furniture for a chapel , and this is about the extent , as far as we have been able to discover , of the direct interfer. ence of the British government in any plan to improve the moral condition of the Indians . Pious and benevolent men were engaged then , as they are now , in this interesting task , and the names of Eliot and Brainerd have come down to us with apostolic sanctity . The Society for Propagating the Gospel attempted something ; but they discovered , as they said , that the Indians obstinately rejected their care , ' and abandoned the effort , without suspecting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not in the docility of the scholar . Generally , however , great indifference prevailed , and it is said in the Biographia Britannica , that Lord Granville reproved the converting of the indians , because a knowledge of Christianity will introduce them to a knowledge of the arts , and such a consummation will make them dangerous to our plantations. * Of a similar character is the policy , stated by Hutchinson to have been pursued , that of keeping up so much contention among the Indians , as to prevent a combination , and to make an appeal to us as umpires necessary from time to time. * in the few Indian treaties which have escaped from the official bureaus , a piece or two of strouding , ' some duffils , ' kettles , ' flints , ' &amp;c. constitute the whole value paid for important cessions . These presents were too inconsiderable for general distribution , and they disappeared almost as speedily as the council which produced them . A permanent arrangement , by which an annual consideration should always be given , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted nor proposed . This plan of permanent annuities , which constitutes an era in the relations existing between the white and the red man upon the continent , was introduced * Hist. of Massachusetts Bay , Vol . I. p. 252 . AOL. xxlv. - No. 55. 47 // under the American govexurnent , and was first extensively embodied in Wayne 's treaty of 1795 ; a treaty to which no parallel can be found in history . The Indians had waged * bloody and causeless war against our settlements for many years . They had been finally overthrown in a signal battle , and their confidence in themselves and their cause utterly destroyed . They were invited to a general coungil at Greenville , where the same tern*s were granted , which had bee.n offered to them long before . Many important advantages were secured to them , and perpetual annuities were guarantied to each tribe . If any restraints were imposed by the Bri4sh authorities , before our revoli*itign , upon the Indian traders , either in relation *o 4ieir general conduct , or the price of their goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisedly when we say , that none such now exist . Nor is there any prohibition against the introduction of spirituous liquors into any part of their Indian *ountry* We may close this branch of the subject in few words . There was no attempt to provide a permanent residence for the Indians . There were no schools , and no efforts to introduce agriculture , or the niie* chanic arts . There were no annuities , no regulations to direct the conduct of the traders , and no law to prevent the sale of ardent spirits . A century and a half had passed away since the first settlement of the country . The rulers who governed it , heedless of the condition and sufferings of its aboriginal inhabitants , abandoned them to that current of events , which is yet hurrying them onward to their doom . The records of history can not furnish a more cold blooded , heartless document , than the official report of Sir Jeffery Amherst , the British commander in chief , dated Albany , 13 August , 1763 , and communicating the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , that Colonel Grant had burnt fifteen towns , and all the plantations of the country ; destroyed fourteen hundred acres of corn ; and driven about five thousand men , women , and children into the woods and mountains , where , having nothing to subsist upon , they must either starve or sue for peace . ' But that great revolution had now approached , which has already produced , and is yet destined to produce , important changes in the social and political systems of the world . The American government , at the commencement of its operations , // used every effort to prevent the Indians from taking part in the contest , and the desperate struggle in which the early patriots were engaged , still left them time to devise plans forthe moral and physical melioration of their trnhappy neighbor* . On the 30th of June , 1775 , Congress resolved , That the committee for Indian affairs do prepare proper talks to the several tribes of Indians , for engaging the continuance of their friendship to us , and neutrality in our p*e*ent unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following month it was again resolved , in the same spirit of conciliation and humanity , That it should be recommended to the commissioners of the northern department to employ Mr Kirkland among the Indians of the Six Nations , in order to secure their friendship , and to continue them in a state of neutrality ; with respect to the present controversy between Great Britain and these colonies. * But in January and February of the next year , tw6 resolutions Were passed , which provided more full security for the protection and improvement of the Indians , than all the measures of the preceding government . Resolved-That all traders shall dispose of their goods , at such stated prices , as shall be fixed and ascertained by the commissioners , or a majority of such as can conveniently assemble for that purpose , in each respective department , and shall allow the Indians a reasonable price for their furs and skins , and take no unjust advantage of their distress and intemperance ; and to this end , they shall respectively , upon receiving their licenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Colonies , in such penalty as the acting commissioner or commissioners shall think proper , conditioned for the performance of the terms and regulations above prescribed . ' Resolved-That a friendly commerce between the people of the United Colonies and the Indians , and the propagation of the gospel , and the cultivationof the civil arts among the latter , may produce many and inestimable advantages to both , and that the commissioners for Indian affairs be desired to consider of proper places in their respective departments , for the residence of ministersand schoolmasters , and report the same ' to Congress . ' When the infancy of the government , and the object and spirit of these resolutions are maturely considered , they will be found honorable to the body which adopted them . With what little effect attempts were thus made to counteract the efforts of the British authorities , and to restrain the habitual disposi // tion of the Indians for war and plunder , was soon demonstrated by events , and impartial history has recorded . The employment of the savages by the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy their enemies , are among the most atrocious acts , which Christendom has been called to witness . We shall not here tax our own recollection , nor the feelings of our readers , by any recital of the enormities we have seen , or of which we have heard or read . The imagination can furnish no aid towards a just conception of these scenes . There is nothing , more appalling than the reality . The Indians are impelled to war by passions , which acknowledge no control , and death and desolation are the objects of their military expeditions . From infancy , they are taught to inflict cruelties upon their enemies , and to bear with stern fortitude , whatever may befall them . They are equally prepared to endure and to torture , and in either situation without the slightest symptom of human frailty or feeling . They have not only no principles of religion or morality to repress their passions , but they are urged forward in their career of blood by all around them ; by the examples of their fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most renowned warrior , whose tomahawk flies swiftest and sinks deepest . There is a horrible institution among some of the tribes , which furnishes a powerful illustration of this never tiring love of vengeance . It is called , the Man-eating Society , and it is the duty of its associates to devour such prisoners , as are preserved and delivered to them for that purpose . The members of this society belong to a particular family , and the dreadful inheritance descends to all the children , male and female . Its duties can not be dispensed with , and the sanctions of religion are added to the obligations of immemorial usage . The feast is considered a solemn ceremony , at which the whole tribe is collected , as actors or spectators . The miserable victim is fastened to a stake , and burned at a slow fire , with all the refinements of cruelty , which savage ingenuity can invent . There is a tradittonary ritual , which regulates , with revolting precision , the whole course of procedure at these ceremonies . The institution has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen and related to us the incidents , which occurred on these occasions , when white men were sacrificed and consumed . The chief of the family , and principal member of the society // 1e27.iI War Dance . among the Miamies , whose name was White Skin , we have seen , and with feelings of loathing excited by a narrative of his atrocities , amid the scenes where they occurred . There are but two serious occupations. , connected with the ordinary business of life , to which an Indian willingly devotes himself . These are war and hunting . Labor is performed exclusively by the women , and this distribution of duties is a marked characteristic of all barbarous nations . The passion for war is fostered and encouraged by institutions , which are admirably adapted to make the warrior brave and enterprising . Nothing in the systems of the ancient republics was better devised to stimulate the ardor of their citizens . And when assembled Greece proclaimed the victor at the Olympic games , and crowned him with the olive wreath , she furnished no more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions of our aborigines . It is the same love of distinction , which impels the warrior to tear from the head of the writhing and reeking victim , the bloody trophy of savage victory , and at the next war , dance in his distant village , to strike the post , and to recount the atrocities , which , by the aid of the Sag*a*nosh , * he has been enabled to commit upon the Tshe-mo-ke-maun.t An Indian war dance is an important incident in the passing events of a village . The whole population is assembled , and a feast provided for all . The warriors are painted and prepared as for battle . A post is firmly planted in the ground , and the singers , the drummers , and the other instrumental musicians , are seated within the circle , formed by the dancers and the spectators . The music and the dance begin . The warriors exert themselves with great energy . Every muscle is in action , and there is the most perfect concord between the music and their movements . They brandish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents seem unavoidable . Presently a warrior leaves the circle , and with his tomahawk or casset*te strikes the post . The music and dancing cease , and profound silence ensues* He then recounts , with a loud voice , his military achievements . He describes the battles he has fought , the prisoners he has captured , the scalps he has taken . He points to his wounds , and produces * Englishman , ) * Bigknife , American* * in the Algonquin dialect . // his trophies . He accompanies his narrative with the actual representation of his exploits , and the mimic engagement , the advance and the retreat , are exhibite&amp; to his nation as they really occurred . There is no exaggeration , and no misrepresentation . It would be infamous for a warrior to boast of deeds he never performed . If the attempt were made , some one would approach , and throiv dirt in his face , saying , I do this to cover your shame , for the first time you see an enemy you will tremble . ' But such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally contain many individuals , the character and conduct of every warrior are well know-n . Shouts of applause accompany the narration , proportioned in duration and intensity to the interest it excites . His station in the circle is- then resumed by the actor , and the dance proceeds till it is interrupted in a similar manner . In the poem of Ontwa , a scene like this is so weH* described , that we can not resist the temptation to transfer it to our pages . Of all who have attempted to embody in song the living manners ' of the Indians , the anonymous author of that poem has been most successfuL His ; characters , and traditions , and descriptions , have the spirit and bearing of life , and the whole work is not less true to nature than to poetry . A hundred warriors now advance , All dressed and painted for the dance , And sounding club and hollow skin A slow and measured time begin ; With rigid limb and sliding . foot And murmurs low , the time to suit , Forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Now slowly rise the swelling notes , When every crest more lively floats , Now toss 'd on high with gesture proud , Then lowly mid the circle bow 'd ; While clanging arms grow louder still , And every voice becomes more shrill , - Till fierce and strong the clamor grows* And the wild war whoop bids it close . Then starts Shuuktonga forth , whose band Came far from Huron 's storm beat strand , And thus recounts his battle feats , While his dark club the measure beats . ' // But this scenic representation must not be confounded with the ordinary Indian war songs , which are sung by the warriors , when leaving their villages upon a hostile excursion , and whenever , during the march , the excitement of music is necessary to stimulate the party to encounter the fatigues or dangers of the expedition . The chief warrior commences the song , and after its termination , he is greeted with the well known exclamation , yeh , yeh , from all the warriors . A scalp is the most honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Herodotus describes this custom as existing among the Scythians , and Polybius , among the Carthaginians . It is commonly taken from the crown of the head , but Long , an English traveller in the Indian country , during our revolutionary war , tells us , that " some of the Indians in time of war , when scalps are well paid for , divide one into five or six parts , and carry them to the nearest posts , in hopes of receiving a reward proportioned to the number . ' p. 23 . Some strong moral or religious barrier would be necessary to restrain the Indians from the perpetration of cruelties , to which they are impelled by the powerful motives , which we have described . But no such barrier exists ; and the experience of two centuries has demonstrated , that in all their battles with the whites , when resistance ceases the slaughter begins . Man in his strength , woman in her weakness , and infancy in its innocence , are alike devoted to destruction , and frequently with circumstances of atrocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages or nations . No terms of reprehension can be too strong for the employment of such a force . The nation , which authorizes it , should be arraigned at the tribunal of Christendom . It is a force which will not be controlled . Human power can not stay the tide of slaughter . And *allies , ' * as the Indians may be , it is an alliance , to which posterity will look back with grief and indignation , and which will tarnish the brightest jewel in the crown of the Defender of the Faith . it needs no casuistry to prove , that the government , which employs a force , of whose * The British to the American Commissioners , Ghent , September 4 , 1814 .

' // direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that force . Mr Madison has justly said , that for these enormities they are equally responsible , whether with the power to prevent them , they want the will , or with the knowledge of a want of power , they still avail themselves of such instruments. ** That the savages could not be restrained , was well known to the British authorities , and has been repeatedly avowed by their officers , and even with menaces of the consequences . Such was the avowal in Burgoyne 's proclamation , and such was the menace in General Brock 's demand of surrender to General Hull , wherein he says , You must be aware , that the numerous body of Indians , who have attached themselves to my troops , will be beyond my control the moment the contest commences . ' This example was also followed by Proctor in his summons to General Harrison , at Fort Meigs ; and at the catastrophe of the River Raisin , General Winchester states in his official report , that he was informed by the British commanding officer , that unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the conduct of the savages . ' And that these were not empty threats , we have many heart rending proofs , and none more decisive than the British official account of the battle at the River Raisin , published at Quebec , February 8 , 1813 . It is there coolly stated , that at daybreak on the 22d January , Colonel Proctor , by a spirited and vigorous attack , completely defeated General Winchester 's division , with the loss of between 400 and 500 slain ; for all , who attempted to save themselves by flight , were cut off by the Indians ! ' The incidents connected with the employment of the savages , during the progress of our revolutionary war , are embodied in the history of our country . The gasconading proclamation of Burgoyne , which gave the assurance of official sanction to the measure , and in which he says , I have but to give stretch to the Indian forces under my direction ( and they amount to thousands ) , to overtake the hardened enemies of Great Britain and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the melancholy catastrophe , which , in the murder of Miss M'Crae , gave more horrible celebrity to their employment ; the devastation of the country upon the Mohawk ; the massacre of Wyoming ; the numerous war parties , // which were detached from time to time , to lay waste the frontiers of Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Kentucky ; these are but some of the more prominent events in that long and bitter contest . But it was at Detroit , that this influence was most successfully exerted . That place was then the central point of Indian negotiation and intrigues , and the savages were there collected from every part of the surrounding country , and fed and clothed at the expense of the British government . Many of the principal Canadians received commissions from the provincial authorities , constituting them officers of the savages , in order that their influence might be exerted in raising war parties , whenever circumstances rendered it expedient to attack and lay waste our exposed frontier . We annex a copy of one of these commissions , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up to public abhorrence this nefarious practice . As it is copied verbatim , we disclaim all responsibility for the accuracy of the language in which it is written. * When it was determined to detach a war party upon duty , these officers were directed to raise the necessary number of warriors ; and in doing so , they depended on the effect of their personal influence , and on presents , and promises , and war dances , and all the moral and physical excitemeras , to which the Indians most readily yielded . * Par Henry Hamilton , Ecuyer , Lieutenant Gouverneur and Surintendant du Detroit &amp; Dependences , &amp;c. &amp;c &amp;c .

' // When the party returned , they were formally introduced to the commanding officer . The scalps were thrown down before him in the council house , and the principal warrior addressed him in terms like these , Father , we have done as you directed us ; we have struck your enemies . ' They were then paid and dismissed , and the scalps were deposited in the cellar of the council house . We have been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this charnel house was cleansed , it was a spectacle , upon which the inhabitants gazed with horror . The Indians , however , were not always ready to undertake these distant and dangerous expeditions . In 1779 , Governor Hamilton prepared a feast , and invited all the warriors to a dance . He was desirous of engaging them in an attack upon some of our settlements . The principal chief was a Kickapoo , who , declining to join in the dance , was reproached by Hamilton in the metaphorical language so common among the Indians . Your body is very heavy . You do not dance . You will not go against my rebellious children . ' The chief replied , True , it is heavy . But so is yours . Take one end of this tomahawk , and I will take the other , and we will go together . But no ; you will not go yourself . Is it not a shame , that you send us out like dogs , to fight the Americans , while you remain at your own fire ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them. * If yours are so , do as I do . But neither my hands , nor those of my tribe , were made to be washed in the blood of the white man . ' This spirited remonstrance was received with great applause by the Indians , and the expedition was abandoned . We are indebted for the following relation to a respectable gentleman of Detroit , James May , Esq . and as it elucidates important traits in the Indian character , and discloses facts not generally known , we shall give it in his own words . During the American revolutionary war , when the Indian war parties approached Detroit , they always gave the war and death whoops , so that the inhabitants , who were acquainted with their cust6ms , knew the number of scalps they had brought , and of prisoners they had taken , some time before they made their appearance . Soon after I arrived in Detroit , the great war party , which had captured Ruddle 's station in Kentucky , returned // from that expedition . Hearing the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon met the party . The squaws and young Indians had ranged themselves on the side of the road , with sticks and clubs , and were whipping the prisoners with great severity . Among these were two young girls , thirteen or fourteen years old , who escaped from the party , and ran for protection to me and to a naval officer , who was with me . With much trouble and some danger , and after knocking down two of the Indians , we succeeded in rescuing the girls , and fled with them to the Council House . Here they were safe , because this was the goal , where the right of the Indians to beat them ceased . Next morning , I received a message by an orderly sergeant , to wait upon Colonel De Peyster , the commanding officer . I found the naval officer , who was with me the preceding day , already there . The Colonel stated , that a serious complaint had been preferred against us by M'Kee , the Indian Agent , for interfering with the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians had a right to their own mode of warfare , and that no one should interrupt them ; and after continuing this reproof for some time , he told me , if I ever took such a liberty again , he would send me to Montreal or Quebec . The naval officer was still more severely reprimanded and threatened to have his uniform stripped from his back , and to be dismissed from his Majesty 's service , if such an incident again occurred ! And although I stated to Colonel De Peyster , that we saved the lives of the girls at the peril of our own , he abated nothing of his threats or harshness . ' And in the biography of David Zeisberger , published in the Christian Herald of February 3d , 1821 , an incident is related , which is not less shocking to the moral sense of mankind , than the reputed attempt of the Austrian tyrant to render the Swiss patriot the executioner of his son . About this time ( 1778 ) a large sealed letter had been handed *o him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit . It contained a positive injunction , with formidable threats annexed to it , to wit , " The teachers of the christian Indians shall , without delay , go on an expedition with us against the rebels , on the other side of the Ohio , kill them , and deliver up their scalps . " In the same memoir , and in Heckewelder 's history of the Moravian Missions , will be found an account of the final destruction of this flourishing mission , and the forcible removal // of the Christian Indians and their teachers . In commenting upon these transactions , the London Christian Observer of August 31st , 1826 , deems it incredible ' that our country*. men , ' among whom British officers are mentioned , should have countenanced a scheme for the assassination of a band of peaceful Christian Missionaries , and the destruction of their unoffending converts . ' And it adds , that the narrators of these events were Germans , ' and that it may not unreasonably be presumed , that the narrators were under some misunderstanding respecting the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs ' were , the pious conductors of that excellent work can now determine . The recognition of our independence terminated these flagitious scenes , and they were succeeded by a few years of comparative tranquillity . But the relations between the two coun** tries were not permanently established , and discussions soon commenced , which assumed a character of severity . They were fortunately closed by Jay 's treaty , at the moment when a. war appeared inevitable . But during the progress of these discussions* the usual indications of Indian hostilities , such as have preceded and accompanied all our differences with the British government , gave unerring warning of the storm , which was approaching . It burst upon our frontiers , and during the administration of General Washington , this unprovoked war embarrassed and perplexed the infant government . We have neither time nor space to review its incidents . We can only group together * few of the principal facts , which demonstrate , that the savages did not want other counsels , and influence , and aid , in the commencement and prosecution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolution , the British Indian headquarters . The elder M'Kee was at the head of the Indian department , and he was aided by Elliott and Girty , men well qualified to serve in such a cause , where hands that stayed not , and hearts that relented not , and zeal that tired not , could furnish examples* which even savages might admire in despair . From 1783 to 1790 , not less than three thousand persons were murdered or dragged into captivity , from the frontiers of Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Kentucky . The scalps and the prisoners travelled the old war path. * The British Indian de // partment was numerous and active . A personal inspection was made by Lieutenant Governor Hunter , and a fort was cornmenced upon the Miami . The hopes of the Indians were elated by the celebrated war talk of Lord Dorchester . Profuse issues of clothing , provisions , and ammunition , were made to them . Several intercepted letters of British officers were published , which leave no doubt of the influence exerted upon the Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had obtained a victory over the combined force of the hostile Indians and a considerable number of the volunteers and militia of Detroit . ' And this , too , in a time of profound peace between the American and British governments ! When the Indians fled from the victorious army of Wayne , they applied for admittance into the British fort at the foot of the Rapids of the Miami . Assurances , that they would find shelter there , should the fate of the day prove adverse , had ; been long before given . The commanding officer , however , took counsel of his prudence , rather than his promises , and closed his gates to the flying savages . This conduct has never been forgotten by the Indians , and Tecumth* in his celebrated speech to Proctor , reproached the British with this gross deception . At the battle of the Rapids last war , ' said the indignant chief , the Americans certainly defeated us ; and when we retreated to our father 's fort at that place , the gates were shut against us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief , when the Wyandots of Brownstown were importuned to cross the Detroit river , and join the British standard , this untimely occlusion of the fort yet lingered in the memory of the Indians . In 1812 commenced our second war with England . It was preceded in 1811 by hostilities upon the Wabash , where Tecumnth* and his brother the Prophet had collected a considerable band of disaffected Indians , seceders from the established authorities of their tribes . This spirit , however , never extended far , and it was repressed by the vigorous and decisive cam* paign of General Harrison . Tranquillity was restored upon the borders , until Christian hands again offered the tomahawk to the ludians , and christian presents and promises induced them to accept it . In 1812 , as in 1775 , did the American government exert every effort to save the Indians from embarking in a hopeless contest , in which they had neither rights to assert , nor wrongs to avenge ; but which was prosecuted for objects* that they understood as little as they regarded . // The talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of the war , contains sentiments so honorable to himself and his country , and so appropriately and beautifully expressed , that we shall submit to our readers a part of this interesting document . It may be considered as the manifesto of the American government , establishing the principles of its intercourse with its aboriginal neighbors in the critical circumstances , which imposed new duties upon both . And the contrast between this course , and that pursued by the British government , must awaken reflections here and elsexvhere , which although tardy may yet be useful . The red people who live on the same great Island with the white people of the eighteen fires . are made by the great Spirit out of the same earth , from parts of it differing in color only . My regard for all my red children has made me desirous , that the bloody tomahawk should be buried between the Osages , the Cherokees , and the Choctaws . I wish also that the hands of the Shawnese and the Osage should be joined in my presence , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Louis . This was a good peace for both . It is a chain that ought to hold them fast in friendship . Neither blood nor rust should ever be upon it . I am concerned at the war which has long been kept up by the Sacs and Foxes against the Osages ; and that latterly a bloody war is carried on* between the Osages and Joways . I now tell my red children here present , that this is bad for both parties . They must I ) ut under my feet their evil intentions against each other ; and henceforward live in peace and good will ; each hunting on their lands , and working their own soil . ' A father ought to give good advice to his children and it is the duty of his children to hearken to it . The people composing the eighteen fires , are a great people . You have travelled through their country . You see they cover the land , as the stars fill the sky , and are as thick as the trees in your forests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the great water beyond which he lives . He robbed their ships and carried away the people belonging to them . Some of them he murdere*l . He has an old grudge against the eighteen fires , because when he tried to make them dig and plant for his people beyond the great water , not for themselves , they sent out warriors , who beat his warriors ; they drove off the bad chiefs he had sent among them , and set up good chiefs of their own . The eighteen fires did this when they had not the strength they now have . Their blows will now be much heavier , and will soon make him // do them justice . It happened when the thirteen fires , now increased to eighteen , forced the British king to treat them as an independent nation , one little fire did not join them . This he has held ever since . It is there that his agents and traders plot quarrels and wars between the eighteen fires and their brethren , and between one red tribe and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their nests . There they are fed with false tales against the eighteen fires , and sent out with bloody belts in their bills , to drop among the red people , who would otherwise remain at peace . It is for the good of all the red people , as well as the people of the eighteen fires , that a stop should be put to this mischief . Their warriors can do it . They are gone and going to Canada for this purpose . They want no help from their red brethren . They are strong enough without it . The British , who are weak , are doing all they can by their bad birds , to decoy the red people into the war on their side . I warn all the red people to avoid the ruin this must bring upon them . And I say to you , my children , your father does not ask you to join his warriors . Sit still on your seats ; and be witnesses that they are able to beat their enemies , and protect their red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a further advice for my red children . You see how the country of the eighteen fires is filled with people . They increase like the corn they put into the ground . They all have good h6uses to shelter them from all weathers ; good clothes suitable to all seasons ; and as for food of all sorts , you see they have enough , and to spare . No man , woman , or child , of the eighteen fires ever perished of hunger . Compare all this with the condition of the red people . They are scattered here and there in handfuls . Their lodges are cold , leaky , and smoky . They have hard fare , and often not enough of it . Why this mighty difference ? The reason , my red children% is plain . The white people breed cattle and sheep . They plough the earth , and make it give them every thing they want . They spin and weave . Their heads and their hands make all the elements and productions of nature useful to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant peace and friendship . No tomahawk has ever been raised by one against another . Not a drop of blood has ever touched the chain that holds them together as one family . All their belts are white belts . It is in your power to be like them . The ground that feeds one lodge by hunting , would feed a great band by the plough and the hoe . rhe Great Spirit has given you , like your white brethren , good heads to contrive , strong arms , and active bodies . Use them like your white brethren ; not all at once , which is difficult , but by ? ttle and little , which is easy . Especially , live in peace with one // another , like your white brethren of the eighteen fires ; and like them your little sparks will grow into great fires . You will be well fed ; well clothed ; dwell in good houses , and enjoy the happiness for which you , like them , were created . The Great Spirit is the friend of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one another . The more they are so , the more he will be their friend . These are the words of your father to his red children . The Great Spirit , who is the father of us all , approves them . Let them pass through the ear , into the heart . Carry them home to your people . And as long as you remember this visit to your father of the eighteen fires , remember these are his last and best words to you . ' In the same spirit a council was held on the western frontier , by three distinguished gentlemen , Governors Meigs , Worthing .. ton , and Morrow , the objects and result of which were communicated by them to the public , in the following terms . The council with the Indian tribes on the western frontier having been concluded , the Commissioners deem it their duty to give to their fellow citizens a concise view of the proceedings and result . The Commissioners , according to their instructions , have endeavored to ascertain their views and dispositions . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility on their part , that the President stood in no need of their assistance in the war with Great Britain , and that for their own sakes , he desired them to remain quiet and pursue their usual occupations . The chiefs , in behalf of the tribes that attended , have made professions of friendship and attachment to the United States , and have , in the most positive manner , declared their intention to adhere to and observe the existing treaties , to remain neutral in the present war , and to reject the overtures of the British ( which they state to have been repeated and pressing ) to engage in it . ' Most unfortunately for this devoted race , these overtures sometimes assumed a shape , which few Indians can resist . In Buchanan 's Sketches , to which we have already referred , the speech of Cornplanter to the Governor of Pennsylvania is quoted in these terms . Great Britain requested us to join with them in the conflict against the Americans , and promised the Indians land and liquor . ' ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , a fearful responsibility is assumed , no less at the tribunal of public opinion , than of justice and morality . These means were but too successful . Many of the northern Indians joined the British standard , and as the vicissi // tudes of war left our frontier exposed or defenceless , they did the accustomed work of death and desolation . But no event , since the discovery of the continent , has produced greater changes in the character , feelings , and situation of the Indians , than this war . During the latter part of 1812 , and the whole of 1813 , the north and the west were almost depopulated . Their ordinary occupations were abandoned , and men , women , and children assembled around the British headquarters upon the Detroit river , the warriors for blood , pay , and plunder , and their families for food and clothing . It is said that twelve thousand rations were daily issued to this subsidized host. * And where are they now ? Gone , the victims of war , and want , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *vatch-fires * and the other incidents of savage life may furnish materials for romantic delineation , their recollection now excites a deeper sympathy for the fate of those , who gave life and animation to the scene . Their numbers pressed heavily upon the resources of the British commanding officer . Supplies were obtained with difficulty , and doled out with parsimony . Their usual habits and employ. * ments were abandoned . These were succeeded by the listlessness of a sedentary crimp , without the recurrence of those duties , which give some variety to that most irksome situation . A warrior has no system of tactics to learn and no labor to perform ; and when associated with civilized troops , he must abandon the chase , because the animals lie pursues retire from the vicinity of large bodies of men . No resource , therefore , was left for physical exertion or mental excitement , except the war parties , which were occasionally detached upon scalping expeditions . Such was the disposition of General Harrison 's force , that these were few and far between , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of morbid inactivity . They were collected in unusual numbers , and many of them were as unaccustomed to the climate , as to the mode of life , and the absence of employment . Under these circumstances , disease was necessarily generated , and it was exacerbated by all the symptoms of a disastrous campaign . The hopeless prospect before them was rendered still more gloomy by the presence of their families , remote from home , and depending for food * Quartery Review , No. 61 , p. 78. t Id . p. 78. or , . xxiv NO 55. 49 // and clothing upon their allies , ' whose capture or retreat appeared but too probable . These causes produced their full effect . A grievous mortality prevailed among them , and when the American army made its descent upon the Canadian shore in 1813 , there was no foe to oppose it . Proctor had fled with the warriors who adhered to his cause . But much of his savage force had previously disappeared , either in the recesses of the forest , where shelter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of the miseries they endured . We had no pleasure in hearing them , and we should now have none in relating them . Whatever , in the extremity of human suffering , man has done or endured , these wretched outcasts were doomed to do and bear . Father , ' said the Indians to General iVicArthur , at the first interview , which they sought with an American officer , after the retreat of Proctor , Father , we are now unarmed . We are at your mercy . Do with us as you think proper . Our squaws and children are perishing . We ourselves are also perishing . If you take us by the hand , we are willing to take up the tomahawk against any power , white or red , which you may direct . ' But this physical wretchedness was not the only evil entailed upon them by their participation in the war . Their spirits were broken . The series of disasters which occurred , destroyed all confidence in themselves ; and when the peace of Ghent restored the American and British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the promises of ' land and liquor , ' which had been made to them , had ended in the loss of one half of their people , and the return of the other to their dependence upon the American government , they yielded with sullen indifference to the fate which they could not avoid . This feeling was well expressed by W*besh* , the principal Sioux chief , to the British commanding officer at Drummond 's Island , in 1815 . W*tbesha is venerable for his age , and has always maintained a decided influence over his people . He was treated with marked attention , and valuable presents were spread before him . My Father , ' said he to Colonel McDowell , then commanding the post , what is this I see before me ? A few knives and blankets . Is this all you promised us at the beginning of the war ? Where are those promises you made us at Michilimackinac , and sent to our villages , on the Mississippi ? You told us you would never let fall the hatchet until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Father would never make peace , without consulting his red children . Has that come to pass ? We never knew of this peace . We are now told , it was made by our Great Father beyond the water , without the knowledge of his war chiefs ; that it is your duty to obey his orders . What is this to us ? Will these paltry presents pay for the men we have lost , both in battle and on the road ? Will they soothe the feelings of our friends ? Will they make good your promises to us ? For myself , I am an old man . I have lived long , and always found the means of supporting myself , and I can do so still. ** In this general retrospect , it has been no part of our objeci to excite feelings which time has happily allayed . For ourselves , we were willing , that the story of these enormities should be forgotten . The losses and sufferings were our country 's , and we had little reason to expect , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party which inflicted the injury , would render a public examination of these facts necessary . But so it is ; imposing charges have gone forth to the world against us , and our relations with our aboriginal neighbors have furnished the occasion for accusations , which have been preferred in no measured terms . The subject has been frequently discussed in the British journals , and always in a tQne of reproof and severity ; but it was reserved for the sixtyfirst number of the London Quarterly Review , formally to arraign and censure the United States , in an article , not less reprehensible for its temper and sentiments , than false in its statements and conclusions . Its whole scope can be fully understood only by an examination ; but its tone and spirit may be estimated from a few quotations . If the mode of warfare of the Indians was ferocious , that of the enemy with whom we had to contend the Americans was equally so . ' p. 102 . However it may be attempted to preserve appearances by fraudulent and compulsory purchases of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has always been the boast of American policy , that " the Indians shall be made to vanish before civilization , as the snow melts before the sunbeam . " ' The words printed in italics , are marked in the original as a quotation , and the idea is thus conveyed , that this ferocious sentiment is an acknowledged maxim of the American // government . Let the place be pointed out , where this sentence is to be found , in a connexion to justify the inference obviously deducible from it , and we shall then have reason not to believe it a fabrication . How far , ' continues this journal , the practice has been assimilated to the design , may be gathered from the butchery by the Kentuckians , of Indian families in cold blood , after their surprise at Tippacanoe on the Wabash ; from massacres committed by General Harrison 's troops in their attacks on the Indian settlements in the autumn of 1812 ; from the murder , after the affair at the Moravian Town , of squaws and children , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from the more recent and authorized horrors of General Jackson 's Seminole war . ' p. 108 . We affirm without fear of contradiction or of error , that there is not to be found , on the face of the globe , a race of men , so utterly abandoned to vice and crime-so devoid of all fear of God and regard towards man , as the outsettlers of Kentucky , Ohio , and the other back states . ' p. 94 . It would surely have been a despicable submission to the mawkish sensibility of our patriots , to have rejected the cooperation of the Indians in repelling an invading enemy , who at least equalled them in bloodthirsty qualities . ' p. 102 . This article has gone forth to Christendom , and as yet un* contradicted . The whole discussion is in this temper , and specific charges are urged against us , with all due formality , evincing equal disregard of courtesy and truth . And shall our countrymen sit still , with folded arms , while the civilized worki are believing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , by such bold assumptions , and by the imposing particulars of time , place , and circumstance , with which the statements are surrounded ? And this , too , because all must be bland and courteous in literary discussions ? We confess that we have no part in such frigid philosophy . Vainly shalt we look back with pride , or forward with hope , or around us with congratulation , if we do not cherish a sacred regard for national character , and an unshaken determination to maintain and defend it against the detractions of malevolence , and the attacks of unprincipled illiberality . It is certainly among the wayward inconsistencies of human nature , and excites our surprise , while we deplore its occurrence , that a literary journal , which has produced powerful effects upon public opinion , and whose general execution is honorable to the age and nation , which it has so often instruct* // ed and delighted , should systematically display , upon some important topics , a deep malignity of feeling and of purpose , equally incompatible with the discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every reader of generous sentiments , from the St Lawrence to the Ganges . Whenever its peculiar dogmas , religious or political , are impugned , all sense of right , equity , and truth , seems to be forgotten or abandoned , or else all knowledge to be turned as by a miracle into total ignorance . This predetermined hostility has been heretofore too visible on all subjects , connected with the social and political institutions of the United States ; with their past history and future prospects ; their government , laws , religion , civil condition , and progress in the arts . These topics are the withering blast of the Simoom to its genius , taste , and learning . We are told that a better spirit is now gaining ground in its pages , and we are glad that some recent proofs would seem to encourage this expectation . Let it be understood that we are not here speaking of what this Journal is or will be , but of what it has been . It is only of sins already committed , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of many of the occurrences , which form the groundwork of the charges , in the article to which we have referred , and we are persuaded that a correct relation of them will redeem our country from the imputations with which it has been assailed . Our indian relations have frequently furnished , either directly or indirectly , the pretence for these misrepresentations ; and we think it due to the ' world , which may have been deceived , to state the real merits of the case , and to refute , as we trust we shall be able to do , these slanders , which in our opinion have been suffered to remain too long unanswered , through the same medium , the press , in which they have been conveyed. ** Influenced by these considerations , we have been led in the preceding part of this article to a retrospective view of the conduct of the British and American governments towards the Indians . If we are not greatly deceived , the facts , we have placed before our readers , will be deemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other . This general historical examination was necessary to a distinct view // of the subject , and to a more particular investigation of the accusations boldly preferred by the Quarterly . These we shall proceed to meet and confute . The tenure , by which the primitive inhabitants of this continent held their land , is a question of metaphysical speculation , rather than one of practical right . All will agree , that they were entitled to as much as would supply them with subsistence , in the mode to which they were accustomed . And there will probably be an assent , little less general , to the proposition , that whatever was not thus wanted and employed might be appropriated by others to their own use . The new race of men , who landed upon these shores , found that their predecessors had affixed few distinctive marks of property in the forests where they roamed . There were none of those permanent improvements , which elsewhere by universal assent become the evidence and the security of individual appropriation . From Hudson 's Bay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements , and have gradually by force or purchase reduced the aboriginal inhabitants to a state of vassallage , or driven them into the interior . European sovereigns have divided this immense country , by their charters or their treaties , into many colonies and provinces , and have assumed a general jurisdiction over them , without the slightest regard to the primitive occupants . And the hoisting of the first flag , and the burying of the first bottle , are important incidents , which have occasioned many a perplexing discussion to grave diplomatists . Almost all the country , now composing the Atlantic portion of the United States , was thus acquired by England . Our colonial records contain the history of many of these negotiations and purchases , but time has swept away almost every vestige of the consideration paid to the Indians . Since the establishment of their independence , the United States have adopted the system of acquiring the aboriginal title by peaceable purchase , but they have adopted it with an important change , consolatory to all , who look with sympathy upon this falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians a never failing resource against want , and its beneficial effects are apparent in the improved condition of the Wyandots , the Shawnese , and the Miamies . But one instance in the history of the United States can be found , where they have acquired any title to the unappropriated country hy force : // and that was at the termination of the wanton and unprovoked hostilities of the Creeks , originating probably in foreign influence , but prosecuted in a spirit of atrocious cruelty , not often displayed , even in Indian warfare . Peace , without exemplary chastisement , would have been but an invitation to new aggressions . The condition of our primitive people , is a moral phenomenon , perhaps without a parallel in the whole history of man . During two centuries , they have been in contact with a civilized people . They have seen our improvements , and felt our superiority . They have relinquished their bows , and arrows , and skins , and flint knives , and stone tomahawks , and have adopted our arms and ammunition , our cloths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in their own moral qualities , if they have not receded , they certainly have not advanced . A principle of progressive improvement seems almost inherent in human nature . Communities of men , as well as individuals , are stimulated by a desire to meliorate their condition . There is nothing stationary around us . We are all striving in the career of life to acquire riches , or honor , or power , or some other object , whose possession is to realize the day dreams of our imaginations ; and the aggregate of these efforts constitutes the advance of society . But there is little of all this in the constitution of our savages . Like the bear , and deer , and buffalo of his own forests , an Indian lives as his father lived , and dies as his father died . He never attempts to imitate the arts of his civilized neighbors . His life passes away in a succession of listless indolence , and of vigorous exertion to provide for his animal wants , or to gratify his baleful passions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to compare his situation with that of others , and to resolve on improving it . In a season of abundance , he never provides for a season of scarcity . Want never teaches him to he provideilt , nor misery to be industrious . This fatuity is not the result of ignorance . Efforts , however ill directed , have not been xvanting to teach and reclaim him . But he is perhaps destined to disappear with the forests , which have afforded him food and clothing , and whose existence seems essential to his own . Under such circumstances , what ignorance , or folly , or morbid jealousy of our national progress does it not argue , to expect that oar civilized border would become stationary , and some of // the fairest portions of the globe be abandoned to hopeless sterility . That a few naked wandering barbarians should stay the march of cultivation and improvement , and hold in a state of perpetual unproductiveness , immense regions formed by Providence to support millions of human beings ? And has England furnished us with any example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canting weakness ? We will not inquire in India , for there no barbarians , strictly speaking , are found . But the Anstralasian continent is now a British province , acquired and settled within the memory of the present generation . And where are its aboriginal inhabitants ? Let the following extract from the Sydney Gazette of December 16th , 1824 , answer this . question . The overseer , finding that they had nearly expended their arms , he and his men dismounted , tied their horses together and faced about , commencing a fire of musketry on the natives , then eharged them with the bayonet , until they were completely routed and dispersed . The natives left sixteen men dead on the field , and their weapons were completely destroyed . After the fight , the party returned in safety to Mudgee . ' That nothing short of that whole continent , exceeding Europe in extent , will satisfy the forbearance of the British government , we have full evidence in the measures , which are in progress. * And what permanent advantages , either physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * King 's Cove , Port Cockburn , Melville Island , Australasia , November 12 , 1824 . On our arrival at Sydney from F*ngland , we hired a merchant vessel ( the Countess of Harcourt ) , which we loaded with various provisions , and embarked in her a detachment of 25 men of the 3d regiment of Buffs , commanded by Captain Barlow . We also loaded a colonial brig with various agricultural and mechanical instruments , necessary to form a settlement . After a pleasant passage of six weeks , we arrived at the destined spot , at the northern extremity of New Holland ( now called Australasia ) , named Port Essington , in longitude 131* east of Greenwich , where we landed all our mariners ( 46 in number ) , and immediately hoisted the British flag on a high tree , amidst a salute of 21 guns from the Tamar , a volley of small arms from the troops , and the repeated huzzas of all hands . Perhaps never was a martial sound heard here before . The natives were so struck with terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! you had no reason for fear . None hut Americans cause barbarians to vanish as the snow melts before the sunbeams . ' The account then proceeds to describe in detail the defensive works . which were erected , and the force stationed there . // neighbors ? We hear of no treaties of cession , no purchases compulsory , ' or voluntary , no mutual discussions , no annuities for future relief . The land is wanted , and it is taken . But the conversion of our gloomy forests into cultivated fields , which is described as the peculiar reproach of the American government , was commenced and zealously prosecuted , as we have already seen , before that government existed , and with such effect , that the royal authorities , some years before their overthrow , had begun to cover with their grants the great valley of the Mississippi . At the cession of Canada to England , the French settlements were principally confined to the country upon the St Lawrence , about Montreal and below it . A few small military posts , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding them , constituted the whole of the results of French power , and the whole evidence of French enterprise . The integrity of the Indian territory , north of the great lakes , was almost inviolate . Since then , the population of the country has been more than quadrupled , and its settlements have advanced to the upper lakes , and now rest upon Lake Superior . Here , as elsewhere , the tide of civilization has borne before it the tenants of the forest , and from Montreal to Lake Huron , a few small reservations are all , that are left to them of the vast possessions they inherited . We have not the elements of an accurate calculation in our power , but we are satisfied , that the number of Indians living in the unsettled country , within the limits of the United States , is far greater , in proportion to its extent , than can be found in any part of Canada . Nor is the progress of the English settlements limited to this frontier of the British dominions . They have reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions of the Hudson 's Bay Company . The mercantile sovereigns , to whom that country was granted by the British crown , are establishing their posts , half commercial , half military , wherever a band is to be subjected or a muskrat to be caught. * And with what effect upon the means and morals of the natives , let the facts * They , ' speaking of the Northwest Company ( now consolidated with the Hudson 's Bay Company ) , planted their forts and trading posts over a wide range of territory , and established a more despotic rule , than could be found to exist , even in any Asiatic government . ' A ' *tices of the Claims of the Hudson 's Bay company , p. *9. // decide , which we shall quote by and by , from Captain Frankliii and Dr Richardson , who have lately traversed those distant regions . But the most extensive speculation , we have ever known in the acquisition of Indian title , for we can not call it purchase , unless the word be technically used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the settlement of which was commenced in 1812 . This country was granted to him by the Hudson 's Bay Company , and in the project for settlement it is stated , that a tract of land of some millions of acres , in point of soil and climate inferior to none of equal extent in British America , is to be disposed of . ' This tract contained 117,000 square miles , * or 74,880,000 acres , considerably more than one third of the whole quantity ceded to the United States . It is equal in extent to all the states north and east of the Delaware , and was acquired by a little parchment and wax , without even the ceremony of a purchase , and without the expenditure of a single word in promises , or a single shilling in presents or payment to the Indians.t By what degree of fair dealing ' this was effected , we must leave to our brethren on the other side of the ocean to determine . There is a branch of our Indian relations , which it may be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstood , and sometimes misrepresented . The subject is thus sneeringly introduced in the article , which we have before quoted . By what degree of f*iir dealing the purchases of Indian lands have been regulated , since the peace , may be learnt from an abstra3t in Mr Buchanan 's work , ( p. 152 . ) By the items in this formal account current it appears , that to the year P*20 , above 190 millions of acres had been purchased from the Indians , for which they had received in annuities something more than two millions and a half of dollars ! while the profits of the republican government , in vending their acquisitions by retail , or C* the balance of gain , " as Mr Buchanan calls it , on the part of the United States in dealing with the Indians , amounted to above two hundred and thirteen millions of dollars . ' p. 109 . In all of this , there is enough of truth , to elude the charge of deliberate falsehood , and yet so much of error , as to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Montreal Herald , a pam* phiet published in 1817 , p. 50. * Communications of Mercator , &amp;c. p. 53. // Assuming Mr Buchanan 's statement and estimate to be nominally correct , still every one , in the slightest degree acquainted with the operation of our land system , must be aware , that such calculations of the value of the property could he made , only by the most sanguine political economist , or a most blind political adversary . A considerable proportion of the land in every part of the western country , where these cessions have been obtained , is unfit for cultivation and improvement . Ages will pass away , before it can be all amalgamated with the common mass of property . And during that period , it will re* main an unproductive fund , unless the proposition submitted by Colonel Benton to the Senate of the United States should he adopted . His proposition is founded on this very fact , that the duration of the present system of land sales will be indefinite , if the price be not reduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at short and fixed intervals , and that eventually a gratuitous distribution should be made of all that is unsold . He illustrates the subject , by the operation of the present system in Ohio , where , after an experiment of thirty years , more than half the land is the property of the government . The expense of surveying the public land amounts to no inconsiderable sum , and the annual appropriation for this object is about $70,000 . The fees and salaries of the officers , and the various contingent claims , inseparable from such an extended system , present another important deduction from this estimate of profits . In all the new states , inchoate rights have been acquired by actual settlers , which have in many instances been confirmed by the General Government , and extensive districts have been thus gratuitously alienated . There has been also assigned for the support of common schools , and wisely and providently assigned , one thirtysixth part of all the national domains , besides two or more townships in each State and Territory , formed from it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning . And in one section of the country , another thirtysixth part has been appropriated to the maintenance of a religious establishment ; not in a form prescribed by law , but as each local vicinage should determine . Such was the operation of the several causes , affecting the sale of the public land , that up to the 30th of June , 1819 , within six months of the period alluded to in the Quarterly , as we are officially informed by the reports of the treasury de // partment to Congress , the whole amount received on account of these sales , from the organization of the government , was but $18,287,828 dollars . An experienced and intelligent scn ator , Mr King , who has since retired from the councils of his country , after a long life devoted to its service , instituted a minute inquiry into this subject , with a view to ascertain its actual effect upon the fiscal operations of the government . The reports , which were received from the executive officers , in consequence of his suggestions , disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was his opinion , on a careful examination of the subject , that as a mere pecuniary question , the acquisition and sale of lands by the United States had proved an unprofitable adventure . It requires but a moderate portion of that profound science of profit and loss , which is not confined to republican govcrnments , ' to show , that the value of any article must be estimated by its use , or its power of immediate conversion into money , and if the article itself is useless and unproductive , and can not be sold for an almost indefinite period of time , it has in reality , no present actual value . Almost any reasonable sum paid for it , would , by the ordinary operation of interest , exceed in a few years the worth of the property . After deducting the waste and sterile land , the gratuitous concessions , the specific appropriations , and the expenses of survey and sale , from the present actual value of the land , where shall we find that balance of gain , ' which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its worse than ignorance , have swelled to so formidable an amount ? The soundest statesmen in the United States do not look to the public lands as a source of revenue . In the annual estimates submitted by the treasury department to Congress , this branch of national income is computed at a mimillion of dollars. * We have no reason to expect , that it will exceed that amount . Subtracting from this estimate the expenses of survey and sale , and the other contin ent claims upon this fund , a sum not sufficient to meet the authorized expenditures for the service of the Indian Department will remain in the treasury . In 1824 , the appropriation for this object was $424,978 ; in 1825 , it was $730,000 ; and * We exclude the estimate for 1827 , because circumstances connected with the change of the credit system , and other considerations stated in the annual treasury report , have increased it beyond the experience of past or the prospect of future years . // in 1826 , it was $1,009,741 . Every year brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such , during the past year , were the sufferings of the Florida Indians , and the incidents connected with the Creek negotiation . These objects require specific appropriations . But so interesting and extensive are the relations , existing between the United States and the Indians , that we have no reason to anticipate any very considerable diminution of this expenditure . It commenced with the commencement of the government , and has gradually and steadily increased ; and it will continue , as long as Providence shall continue the Indians in their present state of want and imbecility . In the annual message of the President of the United States , transmitted to Congress December 5th , 1826 , it is stated , that the appropriations to indemnify these unfortunate remnants of another race , unable alike to share in the enjoyments and to exist in the presence of civilization , ' have increased to an unexpected amount . They are applied to the payment of annuities , promised in our various treaties with the Indians ; to aid the efforts , which are making to improve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothing ; to the purchase of hors*s and other domestic animals , to improve and promote their agricultural operations ; to the support of blacksmiths and other artizans , employed to labor for them ; and to the payment of the various officers , necessary to protect them , and to serve as the means of communication , between them and the government and citizens of the United States . If , then , the produce of this public stock is barely equal to the expense entailed upon the country by its acquisition , we shall in vain seek for the profits of the American government . ' But our search in another direction will be more successful , and justly offensive as it may be to delicate nerves , it is nevertheless true , that a regal government is trafficking in this proscribed article . We are not able to exhibit the items of a formal account current , ' for these matters have been managed in the Canadas , with prudential secrecy . Much of the public land there has been granted upon a system of favoritism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ones . But time and experience produce wonderful changes in the affairs of this world , and it is not now considered disreputable for the regal government to exchange solid acres for sordid pelf . We ; hall quote , in iroof of this assertion , a document , whose authen // ticity will not be questioned . It is the public notification of the Executive Council of the Province of Upper Canada , signed by order of his Excellency , the Lieutenant Governor , in council . It thus commences . For the information of persons arriving in Upper Canada as settlers , the following summary of the rules , which his Majesty 's government has thought fit to lay down for the future regulation of grants of land in the Province , in conformity to the system , which has been recently adopted with respect to other Colonies of his Majesty , has been prepared in conformity to instructionsfrom Lord Bathurst . ' It then proceeds to establish nineteen regulations on this subject , three of which we shall quote . 1 . A valuation will be forthwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices will be struck for each district . * . All the lands in the Colony , not hitherto granted and appropriated for public purposes , will be offered for sale at the average prices thus fixed . 3 . The purchase money is to be paid by four quarterly , or five annual instalments , as the party applying may desire , but in the latter case , legal interest shall *e charged , and shall be payable annually from the time of making the agreement . A discount of ten per cent . will be allowed for ready money payments . ' The quarterly and annual instalments , the legal interest , and the discount of ten per cent . are highly creditable to the fiscal knowledge of Lord Bathurst , and it is due to candor to say , that not a member of the republican cabinet could have devised a better system for vending these acquisitions by retail , ' and so highly is it esteemed , that it is extended to other colonies of his Majesty . ' But the newspapers have informed us , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals for the conveyance to them of one seventh part of the public lands in Upper Canada . The details of this bargain we have never seen . But commissioners were sent from England to appraise the lands , and it is understood , that the arrangement has been completed . The consideration paid was said to be one million of pounds sterling , about one fourth part of the sum received by the United States for the sale of all its public lands , from the organization of the government to July , 1819 . And this for one seventh part only of one of the most remote colonies of the British crown . // But even Lord Selkirk , with all his pride of ancestry , did not overlook the important consideration of money , while pro .. jecting his colonizing schemes . In the project to which we have before alluded , he says , the land will be sold extremely cheap . ' All this is as it should be . No government , not wholly abandoned to a system of favoritism or prodigality , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of income , so unexceptionable as this . Such mawkish sensibility ' will find little sympathy in the present age . But what shall be thought of the practical wisdom of a journal , which Ilouts such a principle ? This , too , when it has been recognised by its own government , and is in active and profitable opera .. tion ! Whether it be owing to ignorance , or to any less pardonable quality , let its readers determine . But it is not alone in vending these acquisitions , ' that the influence of the republican example has been felt . It has be*. gun to operate with equal force , in obtaining them . The in* quiries , which we have instituted , have satisfied us , that no system of permanent annuities has heretqfore been adopted in the Canadas , as a consideration for cessions obtained from the Indians . But in June , 1825 , an arrangement was made at Amherstburg by the British authorities with a band of the Chippewas , residing upon the River St Clair , for the extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that river to Matchedash Bay in Lake Huron . Two small reservations were made , and an annuity of $3000 was secured to the grantors . But there was a principle engrafted in this treaty , which may teach even the republican government a salutary lesson of thrift , and which has never probably occurred to their commissioners , as it is not to be found in any of their compacts with the Indians . With a profitable regard to the rapid declension and eventual extinction of these hapless people , a stipulation was introduced into this instrument , providing , that when one half of the band shall become extinct , one half of the annuity shall cease . And the human and the pecuniary reduction are thus to proceed , paripassu , until death shall have done its office . We have not ourselves seen this treaty , but a friend to whom Wawwawnosh , the chief of the band , exhibited the counteroriginal , has given us an abstract of its stipulations . In the United States , these conventions are annually published in the *tatnte hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // world . But in the British possessions , publicity is never given to them . If in any branch of this examination we may appear to treat the subject with undue levity , we can assure our readers , that the tone is assumed with the hope to repress more indignant feelings . We look with deep sympathy on the condition of this feeble remnant , who , like the autumnal foliage of their own forests , are scattered by every blast , but to whom no spring will bring renovation ; and we regard with deep solicitude , every effort for their preservation and melioration . Not even a partiality for the character of our country would tempt us to conceal their wrongs , or to magnify their errors . But the callous malevolence of the article , which has rendered this discussion necessary , can not always be met with perfect equanimity , and we may be allowed to sneer at assertions and insinuations , whose falsehood is too palpable for serious refutation . There is one consideration , connected with the cession of land by the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , to be overlooked . The advance of the white settlements is the signal for the recession of the game . There is always an extensive interval of border country , between our cultivated frontier , and the permanent possessions of the Indians . Their unremitted efforts to procure food and clothing , cause a rapid diminution of wild animals in this district ; and as these animals flee from destruction , they are followed by those , who look to them for sustenance . The district , thus abandoned , becomes useless to the natives , and this is the land , which is generally acquired by our treaties . In many instances , and we speak from personal observation , the amount paid for these cessions has been more valuable to the Indians , than all the animals existing there , whose flesh and furs are sought by them . We come now to other topics . It is not necessary to prove in this place for the fiftieth time , ' says the Reviewer , that our cause was common with that of the Indian nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Irnericans had been the real aggressors . ' With what truth these assertions are advanced , will be best determined by a brief examination of the various acts of the American government towards the Indians , and by a comparison of these with the course , which has been pursued by the British government . Our attention has already been called to the unremitting ex // ertions of the republican government to restrain the Indians from hostilities ; to induce them , whenever a contest between their white neighbors appeared unavoidable , to remain in their own country , and suffer the storm to pass away , without exposing themselves to its violence . In the same spirit , hostile tribes have been brought together , and the tomahawk buried beneath the ashes of the council fire . The whole history of the intercourse , between the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent , and the European invaders and their descendants , does not furnish a more consolatory spectacle , than the council held at Prairie du Chien upon the Mississippi in August , 1825 . During many generations , a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its origin is lost in the depths of time , and no other motive for its prosecution has existed , since these tribes have been known to us , than the thirst of revenge , and the necessity of having some enemy , from whom trophies of victory might be won . More recently the Sacs , and Foxes , and loways joined the Chippewas , and a crisis seemed fast approaching in the northwest , . which threatened to anticipate the operation of all the other causes , to which the sufferings and declension of the Indians are attributable . Nothing could have averted this result , but the powerful interference of the United States , and it was interposed promptly and efficaciously . That the Indians might not vanish as the snow melts before the sunbeam , ' commissioners were appointed to meet the various tribes , interested in this procedure , and to conclude a peace among them . This was brought about at the expense of the United States , and the preamble of the treaty so fully explains its objects , that we shall quote it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republican government . The United States of America , have seen with much regret , that wars have for many years been carried on between the Sioux and Chippewas , and more recently , between the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes , and the Sioux , and also between the Loways and the Sioux ; which , if not terminated , may extend to the other tribes , and involve the Indians upon the Missouri , the Mississippi , and the Lakes , in general hostilities . In order therefore to promote peace among these tribes , and to establish boundaries among them and the other tribes , who live in their vicinity , and thereby to remove all causes of future difficulty , the United States have invited the Chippewa , Sac , and Fox , Menomonie , loway , VOL . XXIV. - NO . Fih. // Sioux , Winebago , and a portion of the Ottawa , Chippewa , an ( l Potawatomie tribes of Indians living upon the Illinois , to assernide together ; and in a spirit of mutual conciliation , to accomplish these objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;c . The instrument then proceeds to establish a peace among these tribes , and it affords us great satisfaction to add , that this peace has been thus far preserved inviolate , and there is every reason to believe it will be permanent . The same principle was pursued in 1826 , and at a greater expense , by convening a council upon Lake Superior , for the purpose of explaining and enforcing in that remote region , the objects of the treaty of Prairie du Chien . And at St Louis in September last , the Delawares and their allies , and the Osages , were convened , and an arrangement happily effected for the termination of the hostilities existing between these contending tribes . The amount annually expended by the government of the United States , upon the various matters connected with their Indian relations , has been already stated , as have also the objects to which this expenditure is applied . It has been shown , that the sum now received from the sales of the public lands* is barely sufficient to meet this demand upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States supported an establishment , devoted to the purpose of supplying the Indians with those articles of civilized manufactures , which long habit has rendered essential to their comfort or subsistence . This plan was first adopted in 1796 , and was continued jzy successive legislative enactments , until 1822 , when the law regulating it was suffered to expire by its own limitation . A superintendent and agents were appointed , and a capital finally equalling $500,000 was vested in this concern . The salaries of all the officers were paid from the treasury , and the merchandise was required to be sold to the Indians , upon such terms , as would merely preserve the integrity of this capital . Even this utterly failed , owing to causes arising out of the war . It was eventually thought expedient to leave this trade to private competition and to regulate the conduct of the traders , so as to prevent those impositions , which , at an earlier period , were apprehended from the limited capital and few persons engaged in this distant and hazardous traffic . The laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian tribes , have made every provision* which could be devised , for protecting the rights of the Indians // and restraining our citizens from injuring them . Among these provisions the following are the most prominent . Places are designated , where the traders must reside , in order that their conduct may be more open to observation , than it would be , if they were suffered to roam at pleasure through the country . No person can enter the Indian country to trade , without first obtaining a license from the proper agent , and giving bond with sufficient sureties for his good conduct . These licenses must be annually , or at most biennially renewed , and any maleconduct prevents their renewal . An invoice must be submitted to the agent , previously to the granting of the license , that proper articles only may be introduced into the Indian country . An abstract of these licenses is required to be annually submitted to Congress , and thus are they subject to the supervisioa of the national legislature . These are the principal provisions , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate the conduct of its citizens in their intercourse with the Indians . That they are wholly effectual , or that they are never violated , no one needs to be told , who knows what feeble barriers statutory regulations frequently interpose between ignorance and cupidity . But their object and tendency can not be misunderstood , and it is difficult to conceive what other general system can be adopted , better suited than this to attain the desired end . Our laws also contain other regulations , not less honorable to the government than useful to the Indians . All persons are prohibited , under heavy penalties , from hunting or trapping , or settling upon the Indian lands , or from driving horses or cattle to feed thereon . The purchasing or receiving from any Indian a gun or other article commonly used in bunting , any instrument of husbandry , or cooking utensil of the kind usually obtained by the Indians in their intercourse with the white people , or any article of clothing , except skins or furs , ' are rendered indictable offences . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them by any citizen , who shall pass the boundary line . In all disputes between the Indians and the whites , respecting property , the presumption is declared to be in favor of the Indian , where possession has ever been with him . There is also a permanent act , which appropriates a sum of money annually , for the civilization of the Indian tribes adjoining // the frontier settlements . ' The first section of this act , is a memorable proof of the feelings of the government of the United States , towards the Indians , and is , in itself , too interesting to be passed by unnoticed . For the purpose of providing against the further decline and final extinction of the Indian tribes , adjoining the frontier settlements of the United States , and for introducing among them the habits and arts of civilized life , the President of the United States shall be , and he is hereby authorized , in every case , where he shall judge improvement in the habits and condition of such Indians practicable , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to employ capable persons of good moral character , to instruct them in the mode of agriculture suited to their situation ; and for teaching their children , reading , writing , and arithmetic , and for performing such other duties , as may be enjoined , according to such instructions and rules , as the President may give and prescribe , for the regulation of their conduct in the discharge of their duties . ' And yet it is the boast of American policy , that the Indians shall be made to vanish before civilization as the snow melts before the sunbeam ! ' The inordinate indulgence of the Indians in spirituous liquors is one of the most deplorable consequences , which has resulted from their intercourse with civilized man . Human nature , in its vast variety of aspects , presents no phenomenon like this . Among other nations , civilized and barbarous , excessive ebriety is an individual characteristic , sometimes indulged and sometimes avoided . But the Indians in immediate contact with our settlements , old and young , male and female , the chief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal intoxication , whenever this mad water can be procured . This propensity was remarked at a very early period , for Le Pare Ducreu , in his Historia C'anadensis , says , liii austerd ilid non suavitate , sed acrimonid barbarice cepti , sine modo legeque , pellium permutatione co*imptum hauriunt. ( p. 62 . ) There is no reason to believe , that prior to the discovery of America , the Indians north of Mexico used any artificial liquor whatever . We can find no trace of any preparation similar to the ava of the Polynesian islands , or to the intoxicating liquor of the Mexicans . This remarkable abstinence , of which few examples can be found , has been succeeded by a mblancholy reaction , equally unprecedented . Elsewhere habitual drunkards have paroxysms of intoxication followed by sobriety ; but as long *s // the stimulus can be obtained , an Indian abandons himself to its indulgence , with the recklessness of desperation . At the treaty of Chicago , in 1821 , the commissioners order. - ed , that no spirits should be issued to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the bungs were driven into the barrels . A deputation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this precautionary measure , and at its head was Topnibe , the principal chief of the Potawatomie tribe , a man upxvards of eighty years of age . Every argument was used to convince them that the measure was indispensable ; that they were exposed to daily murders , and that while in a state of intoxication , they were unable to attend to the business , for which they were convened . All this was useless , and the discussion was only terminated by the peremptory refusal of the commissioners to accede to their request . Father , ' said the hoary headed chief , when lie was urged to remain sober , and make a good bargain for his people , Father , we care not for the money , nor the land , nor the goods . We want the whiskey . Give us the whiskey . ' But fortunately , these revolting scenes are confined to the vicinity of the settlements , where spirituous liquors can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all articles is so expensive , that whiskey can not be profitably sold in any considerable quantity . The ascent of rapid streams , and the crossing of numerous portages , where boats and their lading must be conveyed by human labor , render the Indian trade hazardous and expensive . And if the laws could be eluded , still the trader would be admonished by his own interest , not to attempt the sale of this deleterious article . If introduced at all , its introduction must be to the exclusion of commodities , essential to the subsistence of the Indian , and consequently to the object of th' trader . We have seen many Indians , remote from the white settlements , who had never tasted of spirituous liquors , and we can testify , from personal knowledge , that the evil itself is almost unknown there . Every practicable method has been adopted by the government of the United States , effectually to prevent this traffic . The introduction of spirituous liquors into any part of the Indian country is rendered penal , and subjects the offender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his goods . And the officers upon the frontier are enjoined to search all packages entering the country , and to seize and // confiscate all outfits , among which this proscribed article shall be found . These regulations are rigidly enforced , and as there are certain great avenues of communication , by which alone , mcrchandise can be imported into the Indian country , it is not difficult to control the arrangements of the traders . These routes are the Mississippi and Missouri , the Fox and Onisconsin rivers , the Illinois river , the St Peter 's river , and the straits of Ste Marie . By closing these great natural highways , all entrance into the country beyond is effectually interdicted , and upon or near all of them , military posts are established , where a rigid system of surveillance is maintained . The police of the Indian trade is here in active operation , and every security is provided against fraud and oppression , which can be applied in such a complicated and extensive concern . The cultivated frontier of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Detroit to Nachitoches , a distance upon this line of fifteen hundred miles . Settlements occur at intervals , of greater or less extent along this whole border . There is nothing to prevent a daily intercourse between the inhabitants and the Indians ; and where the passion for spirituous liquors is so strong , and the determination to indulge it at all hazards , so fixed , it is easy to conceive , that opportunities would not be wanting , even were our institutions less free than they are . A solitary settler , whose nearest neighbor is some miles distant , has little to fear from the operation of a law , whose violation there is none to witness . And this is the difficulty , which has heretofore rendered abortive every exertion wholly to suppress this traffic , in the vicinity of our settlements . The peculiar organization of our government has vested in the United States complete jurisdiction over the Indian country , and as we have already seen , their duty has been fearlessly performed , by the enactment of laws to prevent the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But as soon as the Indian title to any part of this country is exitinguished , the jurisdiction of the general government , for all the purposes of internal police , ceases , and that of the proper state or territory commences . All the states and territories upon the western frontier have also passed laws to correct this evil , and why these laws have been less effectual than those passed by Congress , the facts we have stated will fully explain .. // During the administration of Mr Jefferson , that distinguished philanthropist regarded with deep solicitude the condition and prospects of the Indians , and promoted with untiring zeal every measure for their improvement . He addressed a circular letter to the governors of the several states and territories , upon the indian frontier , respecting this traffic in spirituous liquors ; and as this letter discloses the views of the government upon this important subject , we shall insert it below , as another evidence of this exterminating ' policy , as it was exercised twenty years ago ; and similar proofs we might adduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . To the judgment of the world we may safely commit the conduct of the American government , in regard to the particulars here touched upon . That full success has not attended their measures , is obviously attributable to the peculiar circumstances which we have examined , circumstances that embarrassed the French government in their efforts to protect the Indians from this deleterious indulgence . The earlier historians of Canada have recorded the edicts and instructions of the French king for preventing la traite d ' eau-de-vie , ' et 1 ' yvrognerie i laquelle ces pei*ples out un penchant . ' With what little success , is evident from the whole course of the narrative , and from the reiterated and peremptory interference of ** Washington , Dec. 31 , 1808 . Sia ,  --  The general government of the United States have considered it their duty and interest to extend their care and patronage over the Indian tribes within their limits ; and perceiving the injurious effects produced by the inordinate use of spirituous liquors , have passed laws authorizing measures against vending or distributing such liquors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for some time was attended with the best effects . I am informed , however , that latterly , the Indians have got into the practice of purchasing such liquors themselves , in the neighboring settlements of whites , and of carrying them into their towns ; and in this way , our regulations , so salutary to them , are defeated . I must therefore request you to submit this matter to the consideration of your legislature . I persuade myseig that in addition to the moral inducements which will readily occur , they will find it not indifferent to their own interest , to give us their aid in removing from their neighbors this great obstacle to their acquiring industrious habits , and attaching themselves to the regular and useful pursuits of life . For this purpose , it is much desired , that they should pass effectual laws to restrain their citizens from vending and distributing spirituous liquors to the Indians . I am , &amp;c . Tii . JErFFrnSoIN. ' // the government . The true cause of the failure is stated by Charlevoix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the just reflection , that ordinary authority acts feebly against certain passions , et que 1 ' int ? r*t de la religion est Un motf peu capable de toucher des ceurs domin6s par la cupidit*i ! ' On a retrospect of all that has been attempted and effected , it can excite but little surprise , that the American government has but partially succeeded , when the first possessors of Canada , with military authority , an inconsiderable population , and but one avenue of communication with the interior , were unable to suppress this desolating traffic . But in the actual state of our Indian relations , the missionary establishments for the education of indian youth , founded and supported by voluntary contributions and aided by an annual appropriation from the national treasury , almost offer an atonement for the past , and certainly strong encouragement for the future . With a full knowledge of all that has heretofore been done , these institutions are proceeding upon more rational principles . And whatever may be the result of this great and interesting , and we may probably add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives and views of those who are conducting it . Of these establishments there are fortyone in operation , upon the frontiers of the United States . We do not know the number of pupils they contain , but their expenditures were $191,606 in 1824 , and $202,070 in 1825 . The returns for 1826 , we have not seen . They will doubtless exhibit a proportionate increase . When it is recollected , that the value of their own agricultural products , and the labor of their teachers , artisans , and others , which is wholly gratuitous , constitute no part of this amount , some conception may be formed of the value of these eleemosynary foundations . The children , male and female , are here fed , and clothed , and taught , and they are prepared , by a regular discipline for those duties , which subsequent events may probably call them to perform . We shall hazard no predictions concerning the result . Whatever that may be , no holier effort can be found in all the records of human charity . We shall advert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meliorating the condition of the Indians , and preserving them from further decline and eventual extinction . This is the scheme for removing them to the country west of // the Mississippi , and there establishing them in a permanent residence . It is well known , that this proposition was submitted by the President to Congress two years since , accompanied by a project of the various arrangements required to give it full effect . It has been slightly discussed in the legislative halls , and more fully in the public papers before the nation ; and the general opinion on its practicability and consequences is yet unsettled . All agree , that the expense is unworthy the consideration of the government , and that the only important inquiry is , what effect it would produce upon the Indians themselves . The magnitude of the subject is imposing , and its possible consequences appalling . Doubts and difficulties surround the question , and we do not here introduce it , that we may prejudge or even discuss it . We have brought it before our readers merely as an evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their earnest desire to discharge with fidelity a great moral debt , which is neither concealed nor denied . But when has England stretched forth a hand , to stay this wasting pestilence , which is sweeping before it all that time has spared us of the race of red men ? The whole continent , north of the United States , is under her control . From the gulf of St Lawrence to Nootka Sound , she exercises undisputed sovereignty . In those extensive regions , many tribes of Indians yet remain , if not with primeval manners , yet with strong claims upon the sympathy of the government and people , who assert and exercise jurisdiction over them . There is here no want of physical wretchedness , or of moral depravity . The climate is rigorous , and the country sterile , and a scanty and precarious subsistence is furnished by the rivers and lakes and forests of these hyperborean regions . The living fountain of depravity has sprung up here , and the white man has presented that poisonous draught , which brings forgetfulness of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a demon , with every baleful passion excited , and every moral barrier prostrated , exhibiting a loathsome spectacle , of which no conception can be formed by those , who have seen only the excesses of civilized life . Our inquiries , concerning the measures which have been adopted by the British government on this important subject have been direct , and the answers have been brief . To Upper Canada , however , these inquiries have been principally con // fined , because there our opportunities have been most favorable , and because in Lower Canada the original population has almost disappeared . What has been done , no one has told us . What has been left wadone , embraces the whole circle of duties , which the relative situation of the parties imposes upon the christian power . There is no law to prevent the sale of spirituous liquors to the Indians ; none to prevent persons from hunting and trapping upon the Indian lands . There is no law to prevent the introduction of - spirituous liquors in any quantity into the Indian country ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give bonds ; or to regulate their conduct ; but they trade , when , and where , and how they please . No annuities are paid to the Indians ; or rather none is known to be paid to them , except in the case we have already mentioned . And in Mr Halkett 's historical notes , respecting the North American Indians , published in 1825 , we are told , that in Canada , *there is but one regular protestant Indian mission ! ' We have not heard , that any plan has been digested or proposed for removing the Indians from any part of the lands they now occupy , where they are peculiarly exposed to temptations and danger , to more remote positions , beyond the reach of the advancing tide of elvilized vices and population . Mr Buchanan has indeed suggested , that the country on the eastern coast of lake Huron should be appropriated as a land of refuge , where these timeworn pilgrims may find rest and safety . But unfortunately for the success of this well intended project , this tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgation of Mr Buchanan 's scheme , and the compass and chain are already preparing it for division and sale and settlement . The reviewer in the Quarterly has also expressed his approbation of this plan of protection and seclusion , but his benevolence is not less catholic , than it is disinterested . He proposes , that the Indians , living within the United States , should be received , and protected , and improved in the British dominions . But he shall speak for himself . With us , humanity and policy dictate but one course . As the stream of American population continues to drive the tribes before it , some part of their remaining numbers may be forced northward , within the nominal 1 boundary of our possessions . There the fugitives should find shelter and protection , and opportunities of social improvement . There the remains of the primitive people of that vast continent might yet be collected . ' p. 1 1O* // This is as just as it is generous , for we are assured , that to the Indians , is the preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , mainly to be attributed . ' ( p. 100 . ) That after these essential services , and after being compelled to abandon the Michigan country , of which it was intended to give them lasting possession , ' ( p. 78 ) a district should be assigned for their permanent occupation , would not be unreasonable to expect . And , in the philanthropy evinced by the proposition , we must find an excuse for the total ignorance displayed of the course of Indian migration , which will never be directed towards the arctic regions . But unfortunately , the concluding sentence , by disclosing the true object of it , converts this benevolent scheme into a mere interested defensive preparation . There the remains of the primitive people of this vast continent might yet l ) e collected ; and their settlement on the western flank of our cultivated country might form no contemptible barrier and point of support against future aggressions , by which it is idle to suppose , that the Canadas are not yet to be menaced . ' Hapless people ! Still destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fought and lost ! You are to become a living bastion on the flank of the Canadian defences ! And this after all is the object of the proposition . The Indians are to be concentrated on our boundary , and thence they are to descend upon the cultivated country , as the Goths descended upon Rome , involving in one indiscriminate destruction the monuments and arts of civilized life , and those who reared and cultivated them . The total absence of all restrictions upon the Indian trade in the British dominions has naturally led to the most revolting scenes . We shall extract from Captain Franklin 's narrative a few passages , exhibiting facts , to which nothing similar can be found , from the mouth of the St Croix to the mouth of the Colombia . In describing York Factory , the principal establishment of the Hudson 's Bay Company , Captain Franklin observes , speaking of the Crees , The inmates had a squalid look , and were suffering under the combined afflictions of the hooping cough and measles ; but even these miseries did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , which they unhappily can procure from the traders with too much facility ; and they nightly serenaded us with drunken songs . ' p. 23 // The tribe of Indians , who reside in the vicinity and frequent these establishments is that of the Crees or Knisteneaux . They were formerly a powerful and numerous nation , which ranged over a very extensive country , and were most successful against their neighbors , particularly the northern Indians , and the tribes on the Saskatchawin and Beaver rivers ; but they have long ceased to be held in any fear , and are now perhaps the most harmless and inoffensive of the whole Indian race . This change is to be entirely attributed to their intercourse with Europeans Englishmen ? , and the vast reduction in their numbers , occasioned , I fear , by the injudicious introduction among them of ardent spirits . They are so passionately fond of this poison , that they will make any sacrifices to obtain it . ' p. 50 . It might be thought the Crees have benefited by their long intercourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case as it ought to be , is not entirely their own fault . They are capable of being and I believe willing to be taught , but no pains have hitherto been taken to inform their minds , and their white acquaintances seem in general to find it easier to descend to the Indian customs and modes of thinking , particularly with respect to women , than to raise the Indians to theirs . Indeed , such a lamentable want of morality has been displayed by the white traders , in their contests for the interest of their respective companies , that it would require a long series of good conduct , to efface from the minds of the native population , the ideas they have formed of the white character . ' p. 59 . It often happens , ' says Doctor Richardson , that the meat , which has been paid for , if the poisonous drafts it procures them , can be considered as payment , ' &amp;c . But the full developement of the principles and practice of this trade will be found in the seventieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer all , who are anxious to ascertain what are the effects of this intercourse , where there is no authority to check or restrain it . We can not introduce into this journal the facts , which are disclosed . But the canon of commercial ethics , by which these shocking scenes are permitted and justified , we shall here quote for the benefit of some future Vattel , who may prepare a code of fur regulations for the republican government . ' The masters and wintering partners of the companies , deemed this criminal indulgence to the vices of their serva*its , necessary to stimulate them to exertion for the interests of their respective companies . ' And this atrocious principle is thus avowed , not by one of the outsettlers of Kentucky , Ohio , md the other back states , ' but by two great companies , one of // 41 * British Fur Company in Canada . them constituted by the British crown , sovereigns over an immense country , peopled by many tribes of Indians , and the other exercising actual sovereignty , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively inhabited . Well may the reviewer in the Quarterly commiserate the fate of the Indians , when abandoned to traders like these ! But the contests of these rival companies assumed , at one period , a much more portentous aspect , than the ordinary competition of commercial jealousy . Armaments were prepared , allies engaged , forts captured , and battles fought , by these peltry lords , in open contempt of their government , and to their own everlasting disgrace . Scenes were exhibited to the Indians in that quarter , which never were , and we may proudly say , never can be witnessed in the United States. * These flagitious scenes continued for years *o excite their passions and corrupt their morals , as well by the depraved examples around them , as by the indulgence of their propensity for ardent spirits , which the importance of their services rendered necessary . * We shall quote from Lord Selkirk 's justificatory pamphlet , published at Montreal in 1817 , and entitled Notices of the Claims of the Hudson 's Bay Company and the Conduct of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At page 94 will be found the instructions of the Governor of the Red River Settlement , dated Fort Douglass , 12th April , 18i6 , to one of his officers detached upon a particular service . This officer is told , It is my wish , that you carefully avoid every act of hostility , until fully justified by the conduct of our enemies . The half breeds having been ordered to assemble at the Fort Qui Appelle , any acts of hostility committed by them , must be considered as committed by immediate or authorized agents of the Northwest Company , and repelled or retaliated accordingly . ' In a note to page 101 , it is stated , that in the month of July , 1816 , in a council held before the Indian department at Drummond 's Island near Lake Superior , in the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Maule , President , Lieutenant Colonel M'Kay , Superintendent of Indian affairs , John Askin , and others , a declaration was made by Katawaketay , an Indian of Fond du Lac , importing , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead his nation to make war upon and destroy the English Colony , at Red river . That he had been offered all the goods in three of their stores as a reward , if he would undertake this service . That he had refused their offer , and declined taking arms against the colony , until he knew whether it would be satisfactory to the Indian department , and his great father on the other side of the great lake . That he was some months afterwards offered a bribe , if he would cause the bearers of despatches to the Colony to be intercepted by any of his people , and robbed of their papers or murdered . ' // These Indians , ' we are told in the pamphlet just referred to are often kept in the forts of the Northwest Company in a state of intoxication , until they are deprived of all they possess . ' ( p. 53 . ) Nor was this civil war terminated , as it should have been , by the efficient interposition of the British government . A proclamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is known to have been adopted . Some of the parties were apprehended by the exertions of their rivals , and committed to prison at Montreal , but they finally escaped with impunity . Lord Selkirk was understood to be at the head of the Hudson 's Bay Company , which was influential in London , and Mr M'Gillivray , a member of the Council of Lower Canada , was at the head of the Northwest Company , which was equally influential at Quebec . But a union of the rival companies has tej*minated all these difficulties . The bustle and noise of war have disappeared , and have been succeeded by the calm , still operations of trade . It is a silence , which will not soon be interrupted . It is already becoming the silence of desolation . In those impassable regions , the oppressor and the oppressed are almost severed from the human family , and there are few now to disclose the deeds of the one , or the sufferings of the other . A vague estimate of them may however be formed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a full confirmation of these statements , but it appears from his account , that both of the companies , now consolidated into one , are guilty of these nefarious practices . After informing us of the methods by which the Indians are induced to dispose of their furs , and particularly the enticement of spirituous liquors , he adds , Neither has any attention been paid to the original cost of European articles , in fixing the tariff , by which they are sold to the Indians . A coarse butcher knife is one skin , a woollen blanket , or a fathom of coarse cloth , eight , and a fowling piece , fifteen . p. 74 . He has already told us , that a skin in the language of the * Froni the manner in which the trade of the Northwest Company is carried on , the natives are subjected to continual and grievous oppressions and cruelties , and their race is menaced with speedy extinction .

' p. 61. // trade , is a beaver skin , and is the standard of value ; and we are thus enabled . to compute the prices of the articles mentioned , and to form some general conception of the enormous profits of this traffic . The expense of transportation is inconsiderable , when compared with the excessive prices , at which the goods are sold ; for the pamphlet before quoted informs us , It is well ascertained , that the conveyance of goods through Hudson 's Bay , to the Red River Settlement , is not more expensive , than the conveyance of goods from England to York , in Upper Canada* ( page 67 ) ; and again it is said , that these goods are sold at an advance of one thousand per cent . upon the Montreal prices ' ( page 40 ) . We are told by M'Kenzie , ( Travels , vol . I. page 24 , ) that thirteen thousand three hundred and sixtyfour skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , ' giving about one pound and a half as the average weight of each skin . This at five dollars a pound , which is the usual price , would fix the value of a skin at seven dollars and a half . A butcher knife , which probably costs in England 3*d. sterling , would thus sell for seven dollars and a half ; a blanket or two yards of coarse cloth , which cost two dollars , would sell for sixty ; and a fowling piece , which M'Kenzie ( Vol . I. p. 19 ) says costs no more than twentyone shillings in Great Britain , ' would sell for one hundred and twelve dollars and a half . We may safely affirm , without fear of contradiction or error , ' that human avarice has never devised a more stupendous system of fraud and rapine , and that a more iniquitous traffic , or one evincing a more utter destitution of all fear of God and regard towards man , ' has never adminisistered to the insatiate thirst for riches .

He is then turned out , with a miserable family about him , and the frigid zone before him . These are the effects of an unrestrained trade . We have sketched them briefly , but truly . And that the moral degr*dation of the Indians is not confined to these countries , we have // the evidence of the anonymous author of the Remarks on the Indians of North America , ' who is understood to be Mr Bannister , Attorney General of New South Wales , and who says , The Indians in Nova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( p. 37 . ) We trust the outsettlers and traders of the back States , will not again be taunted by a British journal with their vicious lives , ' and the poison of ardent spirits , ' until the general character of the Indian trade in the British dominions shall have approximated to the standard , which is established by the laws of the United States , and to which their citizens have approached , if they have not conformed . The Reviewer dismisses with affected indifference , as we have seen , the question of the employment of the savages by the British government in the late war . Against them , as against us , the Americans had been the real aggressors . ' This pretence of fighting the battles of the Indians is a stale artifice , and one which they themselves well understand , as is sufficiently evinced by their declaration already quoted from Pownall . Mr Bannister is more candid . He says , Nor must it be forgotten , that Indian hostilities have rarely been carried on in the absence of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to tax the patience of our readers by investigating the causes of our second war with Great Britain . He , who has yet to learn , that it originated in a series of maritime aggressions , unexampled in duration and extent , must seek it in the history of the times . The hope of possessing Canada had no more influence upon the declaration of war , than the possession of Paris in 1814 , by the allies , had upon the origin of the war , which was consummated by that event . In all belligerent operations , injuries are mutually inflicted , until the parties are willing to relinquish the contest , with or without an adjustment of the difficulties , which caused it . The war with the tribes , here alluded to , was the hostile movement upon the Wabash in 1811 , which commenced in the fanatical or political schemes of Tecumth6 and his brother , the Shawnese prophet , and was terminated by the battle of Tippacanoe. *l*e Reviewer , with characteristic ignorance , denominates this a furious war with the Indian tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a single tribe was engaged . During several preceding years , a fanatical spirit had gone forth among the Indians , of which the Prophet was rather the dupe than the cause . Circumstances , partly the result of his personal // character , but still more of his situation and associations , gave to his rhapsodies an influence and to his name a celebrity , which the prophets of other tribes have never acquired . But the same phrenzy prevailed through the whole extent of the Indian country , and was felt amid the ice and snow of the polar regions . It was not alone upon the frontiers of the United States , that a prophet appeared to rouse his countrymen , by religious denunciations , to cast away the manufactures of the white man , and to bid the forest resume its empire over his cultivated fields . The disaffected party under the influence of the Prophet , which threatened our frontiers in 1811 , before the movements of General Harrison 's army , and which was dispersed by his successful operations , was composed of deserters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each tribe disavowed any participation in their projects . And they were in fact a lawless , predatory band , obeying no common authority , and seeking no rational object . The Reviewer is either not aware of the fact , or conceals it from his readers , that some of the most important tribes never joined the British interest , hut faithfully preserved their friendly relations with the United States . It is usual to consider the Indians as one people , with the same feelings , views , and policy . But they are broken into independent communities , frequently enemies and always rivals , claiming and occupying separate districts of country , and receiving for their cessions separate considerations . The intercourse of the United States with the Delawares , had been varied and extensive , and they had gradually retired as our settlements advanced , ceding in succession the lands possessed by them ; and at the declaration of war , they were established upon White river , an important tributary of the Wabash . They withstood every temptation , and not a Delaware raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Shawnese were also faithful . Their history is involved in much obscurity . Their language is Algonquin , and closely allied to the I ( ickapoo and other dialects , spoken by tribes , who. have certainly lived for ages north of the Ohio . But they are known to have recently emigrated from the south , where tbey were surrounded by a family of tribes , Creeks , Cherokees , Choctaws , &amp;c. with whose language their own had no known affinity . Their traditions assign to them a foreign origin , and // a wild story has come down to them of a solemn procession to the brink of the ocean , and of a miraculous passage through the great deep . That they are closely connected with the Kickapoos , the actual identity of language furnishes irrefraga .. ble proof , and the incidents of the separation yet live in the oral history of each tribe . We are strongly inclined to believe , that not long before the arrival of the French upon the great lakes , the Kickapoos and Shawnese composed the tribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lake , to which they have given their name . It is said , that this tribe was exterminated by the victorious Iroquois . But it is more probable , that a series of disasters divided them into two parties , one of which , under the name of Kickapoos , sought refuge from their enemies in the immense prairies between the Illinois and Mississippi , and the other under the name of Shawnese fled into the Cherokee country , and thence farther south . Father Sagard in 1632 , called the Eries , the nation du chat , or of the racoon , on account of the magnitude of those animals in their country ; and that is the soubriquet , which to this day is applied by the Canadians to the Shawnese . But however this may be , the tribe itself , like the Delawares , had been migratory , and had removed its council fire from place to place , as the white man advanced to extinguish it . They , too , had made important cessions , and occupied the country at the sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States were scrupulously preserved ; but Tecumth6 and the Prophet , instigated by personal ambition , abandoned their brethren , and with a little party of seceders , estimated in the Quarterly at half a score , ' * passed over to the British camp . The Miamies had long been stationary in the country between Lake Michigan and the Ohio , and had yielded to the United States , for valuable returns , valuable tracts of country . At the commencement of the war , and for some months afterwards , they adhered to their engagements , and forty of their warriors accompanied William Wells , who was sent to conduct the garrison of Chicago to Fort Wayne . When our operations in the northwest were palsied by imbecility , and one disaster seemed to make way for another , this tribe yielded to the combined effects of threats and promises , and accepted the tomahawk , which was tendered to them by the British Qfficers // The Senecas , who also occupied a portion of the country , south of Lake Erie , were a shoot from the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable firmness . The history of the Wyandots , we shall presently examine . We have here but to remark , that their claims extended over important sections of the country , and that they were parties to various treaties , by which the American government had ac* quired extensive jurisdiction . The great body of the tribe resided upon the Sandusky river , and there its legitimate government was established . Neither people nor government abandoned their friends , nor forgot their duties . These were the tribes upon our frontier , with xVhom our re* lations had been most complicated , and they were the tribes , who evinced the strongest disposition to remain neutral , or to join us in the contest . The Chippewas , Ottawas , and Potawatomies are more closely connected , than any other tribes . They have one council fire , and almost an identity of interest . The Chippexvas extend from Lake Erie far to the north and west , and their different bands have no common point of union , but manage their concerns like independent tribes . Those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and previously to the war of 1812 , not an acre of the country belonging to these tribes , had ever been occupied by the United States . The settlements were confined to the districts , acquired by their predecessors , French and British , and although a cession of territory had been made in 1807 , yet not a white man had settled upon it , and the entire usufruct was in the Indians . The northern Chippewas , the Menomonies , the Winebagoes , and the Sioux , who are enumerated in the Quarterly as active allies , and who probably constituted three fourths of the British savage force , had never been brought into contact with the American government , nor ever ceded to it the smallest portion of their lands . Nor to this day has a rood of their country been bought , or claimed , or settled , or occupied . The little insulated communities at Green Bay and Praire du Chien are now , as they were at the capitulation of Montreal . What then becomes of the pretext , that the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' When , in fact , those , who had ceded most , were most anxious to remain it peace . And when those . who had ceded nothing , and who // will for ages cede nothing , clutched the tomahawk with as little scruple as it was presented . Was it a provident regard for the future , that dictated to the aboriginal politicians the necessity of providing for events , which , if they ever come , must come when some mighty physical revolution shall render the southern coast of Lake Superior and the table land of the Mississippi pleasant residences for civilized man ? Such prospective wisdom is rarely found among the Indians . It would disclose , not a mere trait of character , but a new feature of human nature , if these improvident beings , with whom the past is forgotten and the future contemned , and whose whole existence is absorbed in the present , should encounter the United States in war , lest their country might be sold after the lapse of centuries . But it is felt , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross and the Indian Kukcwium , * and it is now discovered , that the christian troops were fighting the battles of the Indians . And whose battles were they fighting in the revolutionary war ? What land had the infant government acquired , or what aggression had it committed ? When the British ministry quailed before the eloquent invective of Chatham , it was said by Lord Suffolk in the House of Lords , that if they did not employ the Indians , the Americans would . How false this was , we have already shown . But the ministry adhered to their resolution , with a tenacity of purpose , which in a better cause would have merited the appellation of just inflexibility . As the alliance was consummated openly , better to avow it boldly . Better to avow at once , what no canting will ever conceal , that the savage cooperation ' was useful to the British troops ; and it was therefore sought with an anxiety , no ways diminished by the ruthless consequences of its employment . We shall now proceed to examine another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The surrender of Hull , ' says the Quarterly , had been shortly precedt*d by the accession of the tribe of Wyandots or Huron * This is the Indian standard , and the word , which is Algonquin , means something to standby . It is a long spear , with feathers attach . ed to the staff from one end to the other , and issuing at right angles from it . The color of the feathers is variegated ; and this ensign is borne hy the chief warriors . Whenever it is displayed , the hostile parties well understand that there is neither peace nor truce , and that a battle alone can decide between them // Indians , to our alliance . Inhabiting the banks of the Detroit river or strait , these people form a singular exception to the degeneracy , which usually attends the intercourse of the Indians with the whites . The Wyandots have all the energy of the savage warrior , with the intelligence and docility of civilized troops . They are christians , ' &amp;c. p. 103 . As the occurrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of operations , by which the Indian alliance was secured , we shall give the history of the transaction , as we know it happened . Charlevoix long since described the Wyandots as the nation of all Canada , the most remarkable for its defects and virtues . ' XVhen Jacques Cartier ascended the St Lawrence , he found them established near Hochelega , now Montreal ; and when Champlain entered the same river , their war with the Iroquois had already commenced , and that enterprising officer accompanied one of their parties in a hostile expedition against their enemies . The events of that *vnr were most disastrous , and they were driven from their country to the northern shore of Lake Huron . But distance afforded no security , and the Iroquois pursued them with relentless fury . Famine , disease , and war made frightful havoc among them , and the accounts of their sufferings , given by the old missionaries , who witnessed and shared them , almost task the belief of the reader . They were literally hunted from their resting place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed their preservation to the protection of the Sioux , in whose country , west of Lake Superior , they found safety and tranquillity . In a few years , however , the power of the Iroquois was crippled by their wars with the French , and the Wyandots descended Lake Superior , and occupied the land about old Michilimackinac . When the French fort at Detroit was first established in 1701 , this tribe was invited to settle in its vicinity , and their services were important in resisting the hostile operations , which the Foxes long conducted against the infant colony . Their final migration was to the plains of Sandusky , and here they resided , when the ill fated expedition of Crawford was consummated by his horrible sacrifice at the stake . This tribe is at the head of the great Indian family . How this preeminence was acquired , there is none now to tell . They were the guardians of the great council fire , and they alone bad the privilege of sending their me*sen*gers , with the well // known credentials , wampum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , the Wyandot , when any important subject required general deliberation . In the calamities , occasioned by the victorious career of the Iroquois , the site of this fire had been often changed , but always with the prescribed ceremonial , and with proper notice to all , who had a right to convene around it . In 1812 , the fire was at Brownstown , at the mouth of the Detroit river ; but it was extinguished in blood . And the whole institution has now disappeared , and will soon be remembered only in the traditionary stories , which it is the province of age to repeat , and of youth to learn . The Wyandots are divided into seven bands or tribes . There are three Turtle tribes ; namely , the Little Turtle , the Water Turtle , and the Large Land Turtle tribes ; the Porcupine tribe , the Deer tribe , the Bear tribe , and the Snake tribe . Their offices are in form elective , but in reality hereditary , and the succession is through the female line . A chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest male relative in that descent . There was formerly a great chief , called Sarstaritzee , and by the English the Half King . But the office , not being suitable to the declining fortunes of the Wyandots , has been abolished . A peace chief is at the head of each tribe , and the chief of the Porcupine tribe is now the acknowledged head of the nation . The seven chiefs are called the counsellors , and they constitute the actual government of the Wyandots . In 1812 , Tarh6 or the Crane , an aged and venerable man , was the principal chief of the Porcupine tribe of the Wyandot nation . He lived at Upper Sandusky , about one hundred miles from the mouth of the Detroit river , and there he was surrounded by his counsellors , and by almost all his people . A small party , amounting to about sixty persons , including men , women , and children , lived upon the River Aux Canards near Malden , in Canada , and another party of about two hundred and fifty persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly opposite the British post at its mouth . Such was the distribution of the Wyandot nation at the declaration of war in 1812 . When the Crane became satisfied , that a war between the United States and Great Britain was inevitable , he directed the proper measures to be taken for convening a general council at Brownstown ; and alarmed at the situation of his own people , // he attended in person with his confidential counsellor , Betweenthe-logs , and with the principal Shawnese chief , Black-hoof . At this council the Wyandots were asked by the Potawatomies , Chippewas , and Ottawas , whether they intended to take hold of the British hatchet , which was offered to them . Walk-inthe-water , who was at the head of the Wyandots on the American side of the river Detroit , and was the chief speaker of the nation , answered ; No , we will not take up the hatchet against our father the Long-knife . Our two fathers are about to fight , but we red men have no concern in their quarrel , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral . ' This advice was generally approved ; but the result of the council having been communicated to the British authorities , immediate measures were taken to counteract a decision so adverse to their hopes . A council was convened at Malden , which was attended by the chiefs of the various tribes in the vicinity . Elliott , the Indian agent , and the British commanding officer were present . The former demanded of the Wyandots , whether they had advised the other tribes to remain neutral . To this , Walk-in-the-water answered ; We have , and we believe it is best for us , and for our brethren . We have no wish to be involved in a war with our father , the Long-knife , for we know by experience , that we have nothing to gain by it , and we beg our father , the British , not to force us to war . We remember , in the former war between our fathers , the British and the Long-knife , we were both defeated , and we the red men lost our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made peace with the Long-knife , without our knowledge , and you gave our country to him . You still said to us , my children , you must fight for your country , for the Longknife will take it from you . We did as you advised us , and we were defeated with the loss of our best chiefs and warriors , and of our land . And we still remember your conduct towards us , when we were defeated at the foot of the rapids of the Miami . We sought safety for our wounded in your fort . But what was your conduct ? You closed your gates against us , and we had to retreat the best way we could . And then we made peace with the Americans , and have enjoyed peace with them ever since . And now you wish us , your red children , again to take up the hatchet against our father , the Long-knife . We say again , xve do not wish to have any thing to do with the war . Fight your own 1 ) attles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' // Service of Indians in civili*zed Warfare . April , Elliott here interrupted the speaker , and said ; That is American talk , and I shall hear no more of it . If you do not stop , I will direct my soldiers to take you and the chiefs , and keep you prisoners , and will consider you as our enemies . ' Walk-in-the-water then took his seat , to consult the other chiefs , and Round-head , who had openly espoused the British interest , and who was the chief of the small party of Wyandots living in Canada , immediately rose , and said ; Father , listen to your children . You say , that the talk just delivered by my friend Walk-in-the-water , is American talk , and that you can not hear any more of it ; and if persisted in , you will take the chiefs prisoners , and treat them as enemies . Now hear me . I am a chief , and am acknowledged to be such . I speak the sentiments of the chiefs of the tribes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and take hold of your war hatchet , and will assist you to fight against the Americans ! ' He was followed by Tecumth6 and the Prophet , and by tv:o Wyandot chiefs , Worrow and Split-log , the former residing in Canada , and the latter in the United States . Walk-in-the-water , and his associates , still declined the invitation . Elliott then arose and said ; Mv children , I am now well pleased at what you have done ; that you have accepted the hatchet of your British father , and are willing to assist him in fighting against the Americans . As for these men , my friend Walkin-the-water , and the others , 1 shall bring them and their people to this side of the river , where I can have them under my own eye , for they are in my way at Browustown . ' Walk-in-the-water made no reply , but left the council house , and recrossed the river , to communicate the result to the Crane . Apprehensive for his personal safety , the old chief and his attendants instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandusky . A detachment of the British troops , under the command of Captain Muir , with a party of the militia under Captain Caldxvell , amounting to about three hundrcd men , accompanied by Round-head and Teeumth6 , with two hundred Indians , crossed the river the same night . They surrounded - and took prisoners , the Brownstown Wyandots , and compelled them to embark in their boats . They xVere then carried to Malden . A few days before this occurrence , this party had sent a deputation to the American general at Detroit , at the head of which was Walk-in-the-water , representing their exposed condition , and requesting that a block // house might be erected at Brownstown for their defence . Why this obviously useful measure was not adopted , we can not tell . The proposition evinces the earnest desire of the party to be protected in their neutrality . And this is the sagacity ' displayed by the tribes , who hastened ' to join the British troops . But we shall develope the whole progress of this Wyandot alliance , ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the secret management of Indian cooperation . ' About a year after this forced accession , ' the Crane pro .. posed to General Harrison , who was then encamped with his army at Seneca , that a formal embassy should be sent by the Wyandots , to their brethren in the British camp , and to all the Indians , who adhered to the British cause , advising them to consult their true interest , and retire to their own country . The proposition was approved by General Harrison , and the Crane was requested to take such measures , as appeared most proper to give it effect . Between-the-logs was appointed the ambassador , and a small escort of eight warriors , commanded by Skootash , the principal war chief of the nation , was selected to accompany him . Two speeches were sent by the Crane , one to be delivered privately to his own people , and the other publicly to the British Indians . The Wyandot embassy arrived at Brownstown in safety , and the following morning a general council assembled to hear the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliott and McKee , the British agents , were present . We have been told , that Between-the-logs arose in the midst of this host of enemies , and delivered with unshaken firmness the following speech from the Crane , which had been entrusted to him . Brothers , the red men , who are engaged in fighting for the British king , listen ! These words are from me , Tarh6 , and they are also the words of the Wyandots , Delawares , Shawnese , and Senecas . Our American father has raised his war pole , and collected a large army of his warriors . They will soon march to attack the British . He does not wish to destroy his red children , their wives , , and families . He wishes you to separate yourselves from the British , and bury the hatchet you have raised . He will be merciful to you . You can then return to your own // lands , and hunt the game , as you formerly did . I request you to consider your situation , and act wisely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Brothers , whoever feels disposed to accept this advice will come forward and take hold of this belt of wampum , which I have in my hand and offer to you . I hope you will not refuse to accept it in presence of your British father , for you are independent of him . Brothers , we have done , and we hope you will decide wisely ' Not a hand moved to uccept the offered pledge of peace . The spell was too potent to be brdken by charms like these ; but Round-head arose , and addressed the embassy . Brothers , the Wyandots from the Americans , we have heard your talk , and will not listen to it . We will not forsake the standard of our British father , nor lay down the hatchet we have raised . I speak the sentiments of all now present , and I charge you , that you faithfully deliver our talk to the American commander , and tell him it is Our wish he would send more men against us , for all that has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not satisfied with the number of men he sends to contend against us . We want to fight in good earnest . ' Elliott then spoke . My children ; as you now see that my children here are determined not to forsake the cause of their British father , I wish you to carry a message back with you . Tell my wife , your American father , that I want her to cook the provisions for me , and my red children , more faithfully than she has done . She has not done her duty . And if she receives this as an insult , and feels disposed to fight , tell her to bring more men , than she ever brought before , as our former skirmishes I do not call fighting . If she wishes to fight with me and my children , she must not burrow in the earth like a ground hog , where she is inaccessible . She must come out and fight fairly . ' To this , Between-the-logs replied . Brothers , I am directed by my American father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , he will march here with a large army , and if he should find any of the red people opposing him in his passage through this country , he will trample them under his feet . You can not stand before him . And now for myself , I earnestly entreat you to consider the good talk I have brought , and listen to it . Why would you // devote yourselves , your women , and your children , to destruction ? Let me tell you , if you should defeat the American army this time , you have not done . Another will come on , and if you defeat that , still another will appear , that you can not withstand ; one that will come like the waves of the great water , and overwhelm you , and sweep you from the face of the earth . If you doubt the account I give of the force of the Americans , you can send some of your people , in whom you have confidence , to examine their army and navy . They shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your British father tells you lies , and deceives you . He boasts of the few victories he gains , but he never tells you of his defeats , of his armies being slaughtered , and his vessels taken on the big water . He keeps all these things to himself . And now , father , let me address a few words to you . Your request shall be granted . I will bear your message to my American father . It is true , none of your children appear willing to forsake your standard , and it will be the worse for them . You compare the Americans to ground hogs , and complain of their mode of fighting . I must confess , that a ground hog is a very difficult animal to contend with . He has such sharp teeth , such an inflexible temper , and such an unconquerable spirit , that he is truly a dangerous enemy , especially when he is in his own hole . But , father , let me tell you , you can have your wish . Before many days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder lake , paddling his canoe towards your hole ; and then , father , you will have an opportunity of attacking your formidable enemy in any way , you may think best . ' This speech terminated the proceedings of the council . All the Indians , except the Wyandots , dispersed , and they secretly assembled to hear the message sent to them by their own chief . Governments frequently preserve their forms , long after essential changes occur in their institutions , and the Turkish edicts are yet dated from the Imperial stirrup , although the successors of Amurath have long since exchanged the camp for the seraglio . The Crane 's message was a peremptory mandate , evincing in its manner , that the time has been , when sterner authority was exercised by the Wyandot chiefs , than they would now assume , or the warriors obey . // The Wyandots were directed to quit Skorah* immediately . They were said to be liars and deceivers , and that they had always deceived the Indians . And facts , in evidence of this , were quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was said to he erected as a refuge for the In-. dians , hut when they were overpowered by Wayne , the gates were shut against them.t The comparative strength of General Harrison 's army and of the British forces was concealed from them , and they were in a very dangerous condition . This message was faithfully delivered to the Wyandots , and produced its full effect upon them . They requested Betweenthe-logs to inform the Crane , that they were in fact prisoners , but that they had taken firm hold of his belt of wampum , and would not fire another gun . They promised , that on the advance of the American army , they would quit the British troops , as soon as it was safe to take that decisive measure . And such in fact was the result . When Proctor left the country , his Wyandot allies abandoned him , a few miles from the mouth of the River Tranche and retired into the forest . Thence they sent a message to General Harrison , imploring his mercy . But this formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of the great Indian confederacy , produced an excitement , visible and menacing . To counteract it , the usual means were employed , and the embassy was directed to leave the country instantly . So apprehensive were their friends , that even the sacred character attached to them , would not protect them from the machinations of Elliott , that a party of the warriors accompanied them , some miles on their return . No sinister accident however occurred . * But we return to the Reviewer . A watchful care and a fortunate degree of influence over our Indian allies , prevented the infliction of such enormities in the * The British , in the Huron dialect . * The Crane was wounded in this action , and the loss fell heavily upon the Wyandots. * Every Indian speech is accompanied by its appropriate belt , which is deposited with the chief speaker .

He could not have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian war whoop ; who had seen these atrocious cruelties , which yet flit , like pale spectres , across the memory . This affectation of mercy , and of merciful exertions , we shall proceed to expose , and to reveal some of the horrible enormities which are here passed over . We have already seen the official account in the Quebec Gazette , of the four or five hundred men , who were slaughtered by the Indians at the battle of the River Raisin in 1813 , because they attempted to effect their escape . This account is signed by Edmund Baynes , Adjutant General , and there is inserted in it the following complimentary notice . The Indian chief , Round-head , with his band of warriors , rendered essential service by his bravery and good conduct . ' But the most authentic evidence yet exists , of the barbarities , which were perpetrated upon the prisoners taken in this brilliant the speech repeated in a language , bearing little resemblance to that now spoken by them . The facts connected with this deportation of the Wyandots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mrs Walker , a respectable half Wyandot woman , and her two sons , Isaac and William . The former is the public interpreter at Upper Sandusky , and the latter is the teacher of the Missionary school at that place . Both are intelligent and well educated , and both are men of integrity . They and their mother were with the Wyandots of Brownstown , and were taken across the Detroit River . And they were present at the great council , where Between-the-logs delivered his speech . We are also indebted to Mr Stickney , then the United States agent for the Wyandots , for his account of the transaction . And we may add , that the general facts respecting the capture of these people were known to us at the time ; and that we were present , when the ambassador received his instructions ; and we heard the Crane , when he made his report to General Harrison of the result . // action . ' We shall introduce a part of it here1 and leave to our readers to judge for themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' which are thus loudly proclaimed to the world . The facts which we are about to quote , were taken at the time from eye witnesses under oath , whose names are attached to their testimony . * Joseph Robert says , that on the next day after the battle on the River Raisin , a short time after sunrise , he saw the Indians kill the American prisoners with their tomahawks ; that the Indians set the houses on fire , and that in going out , the prisoners were massacred and killed as aforesaid ; that is , three were shot , the others were killed in the houses and burned in the houses . ' Antoine Boulard says , that on the next day after the last battle at the River aux Raisins , he saw the Indians kill the Secretary of the American General , who was on the horse of the Indian who had taken him prisoner , with a rifle shot ; that the prisoner fell on one side , and an Indian came forward with a sabre , finished him , scalped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained two days on the high way , before the door of the deponent . ' Louis Bernard states the same fact , respecting the massacre of the Secretary of the American General , and also , " that on the next day after the battle , I was near the house of Gabriel Godfrey , Junior , and the house of Jean Baptiste Jereaume , where a great number of prisoners were collected , and that I heard the screaming of the prisoners , whom the Indians were tomahawking ; that the savages set the houses on fire , " ' &amp;c . Ensign Baker was left by General Winchester to take care of the prisoners , and in his report of these outrages , after stating the names of many whom he knew to have been killed by the Indians subsequently to the battle , adds , Many fresh scalps have been brought in since the battle , and dead bodies seen through the country , which proves that others have been killed whose names I have not been able to find out , independent of those reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks to the return made to Colonel Proctor , whose names do not appear , were not known by those who saw them killed . ' For the greatest number of our unfortunate fellow citizens being sent from Detroit , we are indebted to the exertions of our * The documents in full may be found in Niles 's Register , Vol . IV . pp. 92 , 93 . They were transmitted to our Government by Judge Woodward in March , 1813. // fellow citizens there , who with unexampled generosity , ' &amp;c. lavished their wealth for their ransom . ' Hubert Lacroix deposes , that on the day succeeding the massacre at the River Raisin , he was proceeding from the battle ground of the preceding day to Sandy Creek in company with another person , and on arriving near the creek , their attention was attracted by violent screams , apparently of some one in extreme terror or agony , issuing from a house near them . After hesitating a moment , they cautiously approached the house and looked in , when they saw standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and foot and tied to a stake . Bundles of straw were attached to him , as high as his breast , and around him , singing a death song , were dancing a number of Indians , with lighted torches in their hands , with which at short intervals , they kindled the straw around the prisoner . The next morning the deponent saw the dead body of the prisoner , mangled and half burned , lying in the door yard before the house , where it had been thrown by the Indians , as soon as death had put a period to their tortures . ' To this we might add the mass of testimony presented to a committee of the House of Representatives appointed to examine the subject , and all tending to confirm the same shocking facts ; as well as innumerable proofs from other quarters . But we forbear . These details are as afflicting to us as they can be to our readers , and we shall therefore only refer to the massacres , which followed the surrender of Colonel Dudley 's detachment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1813 . The particulars will be found in the public journals of the times. * A large body of the prisoners was placed within the walls of old Fort Miami , and many of them were assassinated by the Indians , who passed the British centinels , and attacked these unarmed men . We never knew the number of those , who were thus massacred . An honest half Shawnese , Joseph Parks , has more than once described the scene to us , and stated , that he saw one Potawatomie kill three prisoners . But we here terminate this recital of horrors , and pass by the conflagrations and murders , which studded our exposed frontier with burning dwellings and mangled corpses , from Lake Erie to the gulf of Mexico . It was customary , ' says the Quarterly again , C for the British to secure the lives of the prisoners , by paying head money for // every American delivered up in safety by the Indians ; and Ehis measure was generally successful . ' pp. 105 , 106 . We shall probe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , 1812 , and the cooperation of the British and Indians was confined almost exclusively to the northwestern frontier . The services of the Indians upon the Niagara and St Lawrence were scarcely felt , and certainly produced no effect upon the operations of the war . Incursions were made upon our territory , in that quarter , in a few instances only , and there were no aggressions there to mark the alliance . ' The surrender of Detroit opened our whole frontier to the enemy , and it required the most vigorous exertions for many months to retrieve the effects of this unlooked for disaster . During this period , Winchester 's troops were defeated at the River Raisin , Fort Meigs was twice besieged , and an attempt was made to carry Lower Sandusky , by a coup de main . This last attack was made on the 2d of August , 1813 , and it terminated the offensive operations of the British in this quarter . General Harrison had been embodying and disciplining his troops , and collecting all the necessary mat6riel , preparatory to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so useful to his country . Proctor retreated from Sandusky , without capturing a single prisoner , and of course without the opportunity of ransoming ' any . The Moravian Towns on the river Tranche were the next place , where he saw the American troops , and here his force was annihilated , and his Indian allies scattered like leaves before the blast . This authority to pay head money was first given in a general order issued by Sir George Provost , dated at Kingston , July 20th , 1813 . With a view to soften and restrain the Indian warriors in their conduct towards such Americans , as may be made by them prisoners of war , his Excellency is pleased to approve of the following arrangements , submitted by that board , and directs that the same be acted on , namely , ' among other things , for head money upon prisoners of war , brought in by Indians , allowance should bt* made to them for each prisoner brought in alive of FIVE DOLLAR5 ! ' After the war had existed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon our captured troops , and the storm , which at last overwhelmed the British army in the northwest , was gathering and approaching , this order appears . // The proffered reward never saved a single human being ; and for the most conclusive of all reasons , because not a human being was taken by the Indians after its promulgation . The massacres we have related , all occurred before this humane attempt to soften and restrain the Indian warriors . ' And this effect is to be produced by a gratuity of five dollars ! Not enough as we have seen , to buy a butcher knife ! The hand of the warrior , in the excitement of battle , is to be stayed by this paltry sum ! The miserable victim of savage caprice is to be protected during the paroxysms of fury and intoxication , to which he is exposed in the camps and villages of the Indians , by the cupidity of his master , who is to receive five dollars ! We ask seriously , how much more was given for the dead scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can . For ourselves , we know , that every successful war party , on its return , was taken to the public store , and profusely supplied with clothing and other necessary articles . We shall now introduce unquestionable evidence to show , that so far from any real attempt to soften and restrain the Indians , the citizens of the subjugated Territory of Michigan , were actually prohibited by the British authorities from rescuing their suffering countrymen , by purchasing them of the Indians. * The British General , Proctor , is now beyond the reach of human judgment . What motive induced him to issue an order , so shocking both in its immediate and remote consequences , we can not tell , nor can any of the respectable gentlemen , who have signed the statement below . Persons most charitably disposed will attribute the measure to some unknown * We , whose signatures are to this paper , were in this country during the whole occupation of it by the British troops in 1812 and 1813 .

But whatever doubt there may be respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as well known as any other occurrence , which marked the dark year of British domination in Michigan , and now constitutes part of her history . But there is another document , which we have seen , and which was never intended for an American eye , that affords a practical commentary upon this plan of softening and restraining the Indian warriors . ' It was an original letter from General Brock to Proctor , apparently in the handwriting of the former , and dated the day preceding his death . It was found among the papers of Proctor , which were captured after the action at the Nloravian Towns , and was first discovered by Lieutenant Norton , Aid de camp to the general officer , who then commanded upon that frontier , and was generally read by the officers . The purport of this letter was as follows . You say you had thoughts of using the force under your command to restrain the Indians from committing depredations on the inhabitants . The person or persons who have advised you to a course of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would advise you to beware of them . This species of force is necessary to us , and they must be indulged . ' The pretended butcheries , ' massacres , ' and murders , ' after the actions at Tippecanoe , the Massasinewa , and the Moravian Towns , are vile fabrications . We use strong terms , but the following letter from the able general , who personally commanded in two of those actions , and by whose orders the expedition was undertaken , which led to the other , will prove that the terms are no stronger than the circumstances fairly justify . SIR ,  --  In answer to your inquiries respecting the statement in the sixtyfirst Number of the London Quarterly Review of the murders committed by the American troops upon the Indians , after the battles of Tippecanoe and at the Moravian Towns , and at the attack upon the Indian settlements in the autumn of 1312 , alluding , I presume , to Colonel Campbell 's expedition to the Massasinewa , I have to state that the entire account is a base calumny , unsupported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not an indian woman , nor child , living or dead , was seen at or subsequent to the battle at the Moravian Towns . They had all // been secreted in the forest , before the approach of the American troops , nor was one of them discovered by us . Nor was a wounded Indian warrior left upon the field . Agreeably to the uniform custom of the Indians , all who were not killed , were xemoved by them , and the situation of the army , and the nature of the country forbade all pursuit . Colonel Campbell , in his attack upon an Indian town , the day preceding the action at the Massasinewa , killed seven Indian : warrlors and captured thirtyseven men , women , and children . The next morning he was himself attacked , and after a vigorous contest , the Indians were repulsed with considerable loss . During this action his prisoners were protected , and not one of them was injured . They were all brought in safety to the settlements , except some who were dismissed with messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Ball , the second in command , upon his horse , and his life was thus preserved . At Tippecanoe our troops were attacked by the Indians , who occupied a formidable position in a fortified town , near the site of our encampment . The attack was made before day on the morning of November 7th , 1811 , and after the Indians were repulsed , they retired to their town , and thence they sought secrecy and security in the forest . The American troops did not enter the town till the eighth , when it was found wholly abandoned except by one old decrepid squaw , who was supplied with provisions and left unharmed . Not an Indian family was seen during the whole expedition . Two wounded Indian warriors were taken , both of whom were carefully attended . One of them died on the following day , and the other , a distinguished Potawatomie chief , was left on the ground , at his own earnest request , with every thing necessary to his comfort . He was found by his friends a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived some weeks after , but died from an attempt to amputate his wounded leg with a tomahawk . I had offered to have this operation performed by the army surgeons , but he could not be prevailed on to have it done . These two warriors and the squaw were the only living Indians seen subsequent to the battle . I am , &amp;c . W. H. HARRISON . Our testimony is feeble and useless after this decisive refutation , but we can not refrain from saying , that the statement of General Harrison respecting the battle at the Moravian Towns is in coincidence with our distinct recollection . As to what is said of the more recent and authorized horrors of General Jackson 's Seminole war , ' which Mr Buchanan declares , he has deemed it prudent to omit in his work , ' we // suppose it refers to the execution of Arbuthnot and Ambrister , and of the Indian Prophet , who instigated his countrymen to war . The following observations are annexed in the form of a note to the words just quoted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part with the assurance which almost immediately follows on the same page , that " the kindness and civility , which he has experienced from all ranks in the United States , he shall ever be ready to acknowledge . " * And this , too , is prudence . ' We confess , that we comprehend the meaning of Mr Buchanan , as little as we do the point of the note . His Majesty 's consul will never meet the fate , nor obtain the crown of martyrdom , if his other virtues be not more strongly tempted , than was his prudence here . Certainly he could not mean to insinuate that there was any danger , either to his person or to his social intercourse in the examination of a transaction , whose details had been published in every newspaper , and discussed in every political circle in the Union ; which had formed the subject of inquiry in the Senate and House of Representatives , and upon which a committee in each of those bodies had reported unfavorably ; and which had furnished matter for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish authorities . To this correspondence we may safely refer all , who have yet any interest in investigating the occurrences of the Seminole campaign , and the conduct of the commanding General . With many it has been a triumphant vindication , and with others a satisfactory justification ; and all have felt the force of the argument , and ackowledged the perspicacity of the writer on the part of the United States . General Jackson is no favorite with the English journalists , nor is it natural he should be , till the affair of New Orleans can be forgotten . His fame must rest upon the affections of his countrymen , and upon his own splendid achievements . They are proud and durable monuments . We shall now examine some of the other facts , stated in this article . They are , perhaps , not very important , but as they were thought worth fabricating , they are worth refuting . For these truths , ' says the Quarterly , we will pledge ourselves . ' ( p. 100 . ) Hoxv indiscreetly this pledge has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall presently see . Every man who has served in that country , can attest the fact , that the Kentuckians invariably carry the tomahawk and scalping // knife into action , and are dexterous in using them . It is well authenticated , that the first scalp taken in the late wars was torn from the head of a lifeless Indian by the teeth of a captain in the American service . This wretch , whose name was IVicCulloch , was killed in a skirmish on the 5th of August , 1812 , and in his pocket was found a letter to his wife , boasting , that on the 15th of the preceding month , a few days after the opening of the war , when an Indian had been killed on the river Canard , and was found scalped , he had performed the exploit . ' p. 102 . The character of the Kentuckians is beyond the reach of tirades like this . We know them well . They are generous , hospitable , high spirited , and patriotic ; fearing nothing and regarding nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle is over . Their eXertions and those of their sister state , Ohio , in support of the late war , will be recorded among the proudest events of American history . Their citizens voluntarily joined the standard of their country at New Orleans and on the northern shore of lake Erie . Every hunter or woodsman carries a knife , whenever his occupations lead him into the forest . It is as necessary to him as his rifle and blanket . Without it , he could not skin and dress his game , nor strike his fire , nor cut a stick , nor prepare for encampment , nor divide his victuals , nor perform the thousand offices , where such an instrument is required . But this writer probably supposed , that every night , a comfortable table , with its knives and forks , and other apparatus , is spread for the citizen soldier , who mounts his horse at the summons of his country , and is soon lost to all but himself and his companions , in the everlasting solitude of pathless forests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saddle , his bed a blanket , a pointed stick his only culinary utensil , and his knife the only manual instrument . And how long is it , since similar implements were carried by the Highlanders , and since the clanking of knives and forks , lifted from the table , above the salt , and drawn from the sheath below it , ' was heard at Highland dinners ? And these hardy mountaineers , and we speak it seriously , were as likely to scalp their living companions , as the Kentuckians to inflict outrages upon a dead or dying savage . It may be , that such gross violations of decency and humanity were committed . Individual passions can not always be restrained , but the man and the deed would be reprobated , as generally and as vehemently in Kentucky as in London . // The story of the first scalp torn from the head of an Indian by Captain Me Culloch , we shall tell in few words . The first scalp taken during the late war between the United States and Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian in the British service , and carried to Malden , we presume for the customary reward . For this fact , we can appeal to the gallant General Miller , to Colonel Snelling , and other living officers , to whom the occurrences , which we shall relate , are well known . Soon after General Hull crossed the Detroit river , a detachment was ordered to advance towards MaIden , and observe the position of the enemy . A British party was stationed to protect the bridge over the River aux Canards , and when the American detachment arrived near that river , one company was directed to advance along the road , concealing as long as possible their approach , and to fire upon the British party , as soon as they discovered the main body of the detachment in the rear . To attain a position in the rear , the river was crossed a few miles above the bridge , and when the advancing detachment was descried , the British party was attacked , and instantly fled . The sentinel upon the bridge was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence , where there was almost no fighting , and certainly no resistance , Sir George Provost favored the world with a specimen of military fanfaronade , to which no equal can be found except in Hudibras . His order is dated August 6th , 1812 , and in it , he talks of the heroism and self devotion displayed by two privates , who being left as sentinels , when the party , to which they belonged , retired , continued to maintain their situation against the whole of the enemy 's force , until they both fell , when one of them , again raising himself , opposed with his bayonet those advancing upon him , till he was overwhelmed by numbers , ' &amp;c . The soldier , who was killed , was buried near the spot , and as soon as the detachment retired , he was disinterred by the Indians , and his scalp taken off and carried to Maiden . McCutloch had in early life been taken prisoner by the indians . Their manners and habits were familiar to him , and he had married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guides of General Hull 's army , and when that army reached Detroit , he voluntarily crossed over to Canada , anxious , no doubt , to participate in scenes , which recalled the // incidents of his early youth . He remained with the army but a few days , and was killed on his return . We believe he shot an Indian in a skirmish , while in Canada , and , without however knowing the fact , we may well admit , that he scalped him . He had often fought with the Indians , and his memory was stored with many a tale of their barbarities , and his passions excited to revenge them . The dental tearing of the scalp , is doubtless a gratuitous ornament of the writer of this article , to place the story in bolder relief . Was this too in the letter , or was the narrator present to witness an operation , which might bid defiance to a tiger 's teeth ? As to the captaincy , it is another fabrication . McCulloch was as much a captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American service . He was , as we have seen , a guide  --  a pilot , through an ocean of forest . And is this laceration of a dead body , inhuman as it is , to be an offset against a system of pecuniary rewards , which led to murders , that the prescribed voucher might be obtained for their payment ? Many of these facts are known to ourselves . And for others , we refer to living witnesses , or to publications or documents , which have long been before the public . Before quite closing our long article , we must beg the patience of our readers to listen one moment to a curious story told by the Quarterly . After Hull 's advance into Canada , the little river Canard for some time separated our troops from the enemy ; its banks were overgrown with long rushes and rank grass , and the Indians frequently crossing it in their canoes , found cover to watch every motion of the enemy 's outposts . One morning a small picquet of twelve or fourteen Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were observed in their advance by a single Indian , who lay concealed among the rushes . He marked out one of the party , fired , and killed him . While the smoke of his rifle was dissipating , he had already crept round to the rear of the picquet , who had just time to pour a volley into the spot , which lie had quitted , when a second shot from behind them , brought another of their companions to the earth . The fire of the party was ineffectually repeated , and immediately followed by a third bullet , as deadly as the two first , from an opposite quarter . Then belicving themselves surrounded , and pani* struck at the unerring discharge of their enemy , the party precipitately retreated , and left the field to the Indian . ' p. 103 . If one man can be found from Johnny Groat 's house to the Land 's End , who believes this idle rhodomontade , our estimate // of British intelligenae has been higher than it should be . There is not a tree nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this brilliant exploit was achieved . Memory has placed before us the whole panorama , freshly and vividly . The little sluggish stream winds its devious course through an extensive prairie , as level as the noble strait which bounds it , and but little elevated above it ; affording no shelter for an ambush , nor safety against an attack . Yet here , a party of fourteen men , woodsmen too , is surrounded in broad day , by a single Indian , who fires and succeeds in obtaining their rear , enveloped in the smoke of his own rifle , while they are firing where he was ! And three times he thus fires , travelling the circumference of the circle , while his bewildered enemy is employed in facing about , and attacking , not the shadow , but the smoke ! We have seen something of Indian fighting , and know , that in the forests , and behind trees and logs , they are formidable , and even terrible assailants . And when the sleep of the soldier is broken by the war whoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this wonderful improvement in aboriginal tactics , this ambulatory ambuscade , we had yet to learn . Certainly the Monk of Canterbury could not have invented gunpowder . This stratagem would seem to afford an explanation of the mode , in which the Trojan adventurer , unharmed and unobserved , advanced to the very palace of the Carthaginian queen . The neque cernitur ulli must refer to the very hero of the River Canards . Infert se septus nebu1* , mirabile. dictu , Per medios , miscetque viris ; neque cernitur ulli . But lest the Reviewer should lay the flattering unction to his soul , ' that the trifling skjrmishes upon the River Canards , prevented the passage of the American troops , we can tell him , that after the first attack , when the British detachment was driven into Malden , and possession obtained of the bridge , the American parties were expressly prohibited by their commander from crossing that river . For the truth of this fact , we appeal to General Miller , to General McArthur , and to General Findlay . That stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze , but over which they could not pass . We do not here investigate the motives of the American general . That is the province of history . Our task is finished . Much of it has afforded us no pleasure . But the glove was thrown down , and recreant indeed // should we of this country prove , were there none willing to take it up . rhe chars-es were made in no measured terms , and the manner and the matter were equally exceptionable . In their examination , we have been necessarily led to investigate facts , some of which were never thus publicly disclosed , and others had passed away , and were forgotten . Although , when grouped together , they present scenes at which humanity shudders , yet they are the lessons of history ; and profitable lessons too , if they prevent the recurrence of similar enormities , or if they produce any permanent improvement in the condition of the Indians . The experience of the past is only valuable , as it influences the present and the future . History can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude from its records all transactions to which the parties can not look back with complacency . To the mariner , the buoy that marks the sunken rock and warns him to avoid it , is not less dear , than the beacon which discovers his destined port and invites him to enter . The massacre of St Bartholomew 's , the Sicilian Vespers , the Noyades of the Loire , the martyrdoms of Smithfield , and the infinite multitude of events , which ex* hibit the ascendancy of pernicious passions , are yet useful memorials for after ages* History , and even modern history , is already sufficiently fabulous , without a suppressio yen , which will leave to posterity little more than a knowledge , that battles were fought , and kingdoms won . Many of the facts , which we have stated , will be new to the British nation . Indifference to the sufferings of others is no trait of their character , and it is not probable , that either they or their government were ever fully aware of the horrors , which attended the employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant , their feelings were excited by war , and the facts were systematically concealed or misrepresented , by those , who conducted their operations in this hemisphere . Were it even in our power , it would afford us no pleasure to lower the rank of England in the general scale of national character . It was the land of our forefathers . We are connected with England by many a grateful recollection , by many a sympathetic feeling , by the ties of consanguinity , by the bonds of a common language and a common religion , and by kindred habits , feelings , and pursuits . In all that is valuable in life , in literature , in science , and in the arts , she has contributed her full proportion to the general stock . // But while we axvard this justice , we may be permitted to express our regret , that discussions , such as we have now spread before our readers , are ever rendered necessary by the violent attacks of the British press upon the mind and manners of this country . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conjecture . Even while we are writing these remarks , we perceive that one of the most respectable of the English journals has recently travelled out of its course to observe , that we are not fond of relying upon s5lrnerican reports . ' * And what is gained by this affectation of contempt ? The malice is ineffectual , the dart falls imbecili ictu , and the world is at no loss to attribute such coarse invective to the remembrance of events that have happened , or still more to gloomy visions of those , which may happen . Whatever we are , or are to be , we are far beyond the reach of mere literary denunciations , which , however they may gratify malevolence abroad , or provoke irritation at home , can never impede our progress in the career of national improvement . How much more honorable would it be , and we cheerfully add , how much more becoming the British character , to cherish kindly feelings ; to look back upon the little band of pilgrims , who sought liberty of action and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of those institutions , which , in their native land and in their newly sought home , have secured so much national prosperity and private happiness ; and to look forward to the United States , as the great depository of English literature and science and arts , and the living evidence of English intelligence and principles , when her own insular monuments shall be swept away , as all things else have been swept away , by the rolling tide of time . Sincerely do we hope that her day of glory will not be shrouded in a night of gloom ; but what has happened to other nations may happen to her ; and the traveller may yet inquire for the site of London , as we now inquire for those of Nineveh and Babylon. //
