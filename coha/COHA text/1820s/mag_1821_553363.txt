txt ART . XXI. - State Prisons and the Penitentiary System vinaicated , with observations on managing and conducting these institutions , drawn principally from experience . . dlso some particular remarks and documents relating to the Massachusetts State Prison , by an officer of this establishment at Charlestown . S. Etheridge , Charlestown , 1821. pp. 63 . THERE is no object of legislation , in this country , that excites more various opinions , than that of the penal code , and the system of punishment to be adopted under it . At the // same time , there are few departments of civil government that are more firmly established in a certain course of proceeding . The amelioration of the criminal law has been introduced into all the States , and though there are differences in the details , the general principles are perfectly assimilated . Nothwithstanding , how ever , this general practice , dissatisfaction every where exists , and the complaints against the penitentiary system seem to demand a change in our plan of punishment . Believing , however , that imprisonment and compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death for very atrocious offences , expedient or practicable in this country , for the prevention and punishmont of crimes ; we shall briefly advert to some of the causes , that make many persons doubt the utility of this system , and endeavor to show that the fault is not in the system itself , but in the imperfect manner in which it has been executed . In the first place , too much was expected from the penitentiary scheme . Some benevolent men , disgusted with the cruelty and barbarity of the old modes of punishment , and very justly considering them as not only increasing the quantity of crime but the ferocity of the criminal , were led to hope too much from a milder and more enlightened course . When they found convicts , condemned to hard labor , becoming submissive and orderly while they were treated with humanity , they anticipated a thorough reform , whereas in most cases it was only a yielding to necessity , or a hypocritical demeanor to obtain a pardon ; while in too many instances the first use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cases of this kind , were held by those who think it a proof of wisdom to believe the worst of mankind , to be not only more numerous than they really were , but to afford incontrovertible proofs of the folly of attempting to reclaim any offenders . The one party would array justice in the garb of a methodist and expect with the aid of labor , solitude , tracts , and lectures to eradicate the most deep-rooted and brutal perversity ; the other would not call down Astrea from heaven , but conjure Tisiphone from hell , and surround her tribunals with the gibbet , the block , and the stake , the lash , the brand , and the wheel . There can be no hesitation which side to take ; yet the former carry their expectations to a visionary extent . Another source of error has arisen from confounding establishments in other countries , that were entirely different* // with those in this country , because they bore the same name . This often leads writers on both sides the water into great mistakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in the United States , by some persons , that under the insolvent law in England , which is applicable to a wholly different class of persons from the bankrupt laws , that the insolvents had been discharged from debts to the amount of several millions sterling , and the whole amount of dividends was not one farthing in the pound . Some persons in Europe have been led into mistakes from our names of penitentiaries , which are entirely distinct from establishments of the same name in Europe. * They are nearly as different as our State prisons , and the State prisons of Europe . Penitentiaries in Europe are a kind of improved bridewells . They are used for juvenile delinquents , or for convicts for a first offence ; in whose case there may have been some peculiar distress , or se** duction , to have indut*ed the offence , and where the depravity does not appear to be hopeless . No person here need he in formed , how unlike such prisons are to those of the same name in this country ; but we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mistake has been , in supposing we possessed what we did not . In point of fact , the true penitentiary system never has existed here but for very short periods . When the State prison of Philadelphia and some others were first established , and placed under the care of zealous and humane men , who were anxious that the success of a milder code might forever prevent a recurrence to the sanguinary principles of the ancient law ; and while these prisons were sufficient to contain their tenants , with some regard to classification and some power of separation ; and before the absurd contradiction in terms existed , of sending an offender for the second time to a penitentiary , the system was for a short time in such force as it exists in Europe . So far , indeed , as the system * A particular instance of this fell within the knowledge of the writer of this article . Mr Roscoe , of Liverpool , published about two years since a work entitled Thoughts on Penal Jurisprudence , ' in which , deceived by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official report made to the legislature of Massachusetts , as very erroneous . This induced the writer to address him a letter , which produced a correspondence and full explanation of the subject . Should that enlightened philanthropist chance to meet these pages , he will perceive a repetition of some fewsentences of that correspondence , and that the present article is calculated to fulfil one of his wishes . // calculates on the reform of criminals with a view to their discharge , the original intention of the law was different here ; because there were some heavy crimes punished with perpetual imprisonment instead of death , so that the idea of pardon in this world was never entertained . Whatever may be the experience of other countries , we have no right in the United States to declaim against the penitentiary system , since it never has been fairly essayed in this country . If our State prisons have not produced all the good effects that have been expected , it is not owing to the nature of these institutions , but to the improvidence of the several legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prison of Philadelphia was not originally constructed for this purpose ; yet it was successfully administered , until the increase of criminals and the refusal of the legislature to build another prison , so accumulated the convicts , that all possibility of classification and separation was destroyed . It was worse in New York  --  the prison , originally intended for three hundred , afterwards contained more than double that number , and when we visited it a few years since , a large part of the convicts could not be employed for want of room , and some of the best of them were pardoned out ' every month , for no other reason than to make way for new convicts , that the course of justice might not be impeded by the want of room to execute its decrees . This is now remedied in New York , by the establishment of an extensive bridewell , and the erection of a new prison in the western district of the state . Pennsylvania is building a large prison , expressly adapted to the purposes both of labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law which sends youthful offenders , or those convicted of lesser crimes to labor in county prisons , partly by the separation of Maine , and partly , as we apprehend , by some diminution of crime ; * the prison is becoming more adequate to its purpose , and with some moderate additions , would fully answer all the designs of punishment by hard labor . The same difficulty of want of sufficient room * The crimes punished by imprisonment at hard labor have decreased : in November 1818 , as stated in the pamphlet under consideration , there were in the prison at Charlestown three hundred and eighty-three ; from a recent inquiry , there are now ( September 1821 ) two hundred and seventy-nine . The crimes on the contrary punished with death , such as murder , mail robbery , &amp;c. have very considerably increased : an increa , se , however which we are lhclined to believe temporary and accidentaL // for separation existed in the Maryland penitentiary ; as it does probably in that of Richmond , though of this latter we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is absurd to attribute the defects of these prisons to the system itself , and deny its utility altogether . What could be expected from establishments where separation and cassification were impracticable ; where the convicts were so crowded , that they could not be made to work apart , and some of them could not be employed at all , and where they were confined at night ten , fifteen , twenty , and even more in one room ? Too sanguine expectations of general reform have been entertained by some persons , and the failure of these has led others to distrust the system entirely . But if , with all the disadvantages they at present labor under , some instances of reform have taken place , it is certainly justifiable to expect that more frequent instances of it would occur , if our prisons were sufficiently capacious , and properly distributed to effect their objects . In this country , where a man can rarely be driven by absolute distress to the commission of crime , there is less room perhaps to hope for reform under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seem to be some beings destined by the strongest natural propensity to pursue crime from inclination and preference ; as there are others , who are constantly impelled to benefit their fellow-men , by the greatest exertions of genius , or the widest feelings of beneficence . Though confinement to hard labor must be our only mode of punishment , yet it may and ought to be divided into different establishments ; one of which should be exclusively for juvenile offenders , and all convicts for the first time and for the lighter kind of offences ; this might be called the penitentiary . The other establishment should contain only criminals condemned for heavy crimes , or such as shewed themselves to be hardened in guilt , by the commission of a second crime ; this might be called the State prison , from whose tenants reformation would seldom be expected , and to whom pardon should be most rarely extended . Such is the only plan of punishment which we believe can be permanently adopted in this country ; and to prove this position negatively , we shall briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , transportation has been frequently recoinmended , // and the spots that have been named for this purpose are the Columbia river and an island in Lake Superior . We shall pass over some difficulties about the jurisdiction-wheth-. er the government of the union is to become the goaler , and receive the criminals from all the States , be at the expense of transports , and maintain a large force to guard them-or whether each State is to acquire a piece of territory and take charge of its depot ; both these alternatives are too obviously absurd to require consideration . But suppose this difficulty overcome , suppose such a precious depot established to keep the criminals securely ; it will require an expense that will hardly be endured in this country , where we watch public expenditure so closely ; and even after all this expense , these exiled convicts will be continually escaping , and finding their way back to their old haunts . They contrive to get back every year from Botany Bay to England , though it is under penalty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in either of the places proposed in this country . They must be furnished with the means of subsistence and protection against the savages , or you will do an act of inhumanity , that is not and never will be authorized by law . The policy of transportation is every way questionable ; in the case of atrocious criminals , it is wholly unjustifiable . Perhaps in Europe the surplus of a crowded population , who are driven to the commission of some petty crime to avoid starvation , might be taken from penitentiaries and transported with some hope of their being purified , and willing to labor in a new country ; but , after all , it is a miserable kind of materials for new settlements . It is inexcusable in any nation to resort to it , until the accumulation of distress , and petty offences in consequence , have increased to an inconvenient and alarming degree . Transportation is , of all modes of punishment , the most costly , and of little importance in deterring the unprincipled from crime , as They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much to punish our convicts in this way , as it does now in the State prisons . We hope that this country will never resort to it . The bleak and wintry regions of Lake Superior will doubtless preserve some island in desolation for the use of posterity , if they shall choose to make use of it ; but we trust , that we shall find in a very few years , on the banks of the Columbia , a settlement of virtuous , enterprising men , who will gradually diffuse over the vast uninhabited coasts of the Pacific , // our language , with our principles of education , religion , and liberty . There has been another proposal , that they should be made to labor in chains , in digging mud or on the highways ; that their appearance would excite horror , and thus operate more powerfully as an example . To this plan there are various objections ; the first is the expense ; they could do but little labor encumbered with chains , and they would require a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conferring with their accomplices , and making their escape , which would be much more easy . Yet the expense is the 3lightest objection . Not only men of elevated , generous feelings , but even merely prudent men , would be cautious at shewing the slightest disrespect to honest labor , however humbly engaged ; and would not there be some danger of this , if criminals were to be placed near honest men , engaged in the - same toils ? What influence would it have in this quarter of the union , where the citizens tax themselves and take a pride in laboring voluntarily to keep their roads in repair , if these condemned catiffs were to be employed in the same occupation ? No man , who has ever seen the squalid , horrible , desperate galley-slaves of Europe , working in chains on the highways , under the care of armed guards , would ever wish to introduce such a spectacle here ; and every man , without having beheld such sights , would be convinced after a little reflection , that they are wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage to the humane and moral principles of our community , that would not be endured . But the remedy for the evils of the present system most frequently suggested , and most strongly confided in by some persons , is , to restore the good old system of flogging , branding , pillorying , gibbeting , &amp;c. &amp;c . Now without admitting for a moment the possibility of such a return to ancient barbarism , such a retrograde step from civilization , let us examine a little into the operation of such punishments , and see whether in point of utility as to diminishing the amount of crime , they will bear a comparison with the modern system of labor and seclusion , imperfect as these latter may be . By the old code , a convict for a small crime was punished with imprisonment and whipping . As to imprisonment , which , under that system kept the prisoners rotting in idleness , we presume that it will be admitted by every one , that whilst the prisoner is incarceNew $eri*s , No. 8 .. // rated , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the old method of simple imprisonment , which formed a part of the sentence of every criminal , we shall therefore consider as abandoned even by the most strenuous advocates of the old laws , and we shall only speak of the personal inflictions . To commence with whipping , not to dwell on its inconsistency , under a free government , * what is the effect on the criminal who has committed some offence for which he is sentenced to hard labor for two years ? In former times he would have been imprisoned a shorter period and receive fifty lashes . After being openly exhibited as a spectacle of the lowest infamy , with a smarting back and famished belly , he is turned loose , to do what ?  --  to find employment ? - who will give it to him ? - no , smarting with infamy and shunned by every one , he must commence his depredations , with increased brutality of feeling . If he should be confined at hard labor for two years , he will at least have been kept from mischief during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the folly of his course , and coming out with less notoriety of infamy , he stands a better chance to procure some employment , if he has a dispo-. sition to be honest . But in this case of corporal inflictions , we have only taken the first stage , which presents the least difficulty . The convict who has received fifty stripes for a first offence , commits a second ; there must be some gradation inthe sentence ; fifty lashes were not sufficient , he must take a hundred . But his chance for employment is no better , he must live , he is brought forward a third time-there must be some proportion in the punishment , he is sentenced to five hundred lashes  --  but this becomes torture , and it is in vain to propose it ; no legislature in this country would listen to it for a moment . Now by the present system , the same criminal for his second offence might have been sent ( at least in Mas .. sachusetts ) to the state prison for ten years ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be sent there for life , be made to labor for his subsistence , the public would be safe from his depredations , without having his back or their feelings , lacerated by the infliction of torture . One striking advantage to the public by the labor plan of punishment , and which seems hardly appreciated , is , that the culprit being shut up for a length of time , at least during that // time , the public are protected from his depredations . Sup-. posing even , that he could be made to earn nothing during his confinement , it would be a saving to the community . If a neighbourhood were infested with a wolf that kept them in continual alarm , and whose indiscriminate ravages might do them the greatest mischief , would not the inhabitants prefer feeding him with even merino sheep , if he could be shut up , rather than run the risk and feel the anxiety , of his midnight prowling ? To return to the other inflictions that accompany the whipping system , the pillory , the branding irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough ; but we think it useless to discuss these portions of exploded harbarity , which a virtuous and humane people will never again suffer to be exhibited among them , and shall offer only one remark on the cruelty and stupidity of the practice of branding , a genuine relic of the dark and ferocious ages . We ask what can be more cruel and stupid than this punishment* if the criminal is ever to be set at liberty , and what more superfluous , if he is not ? A wretch is discharged with an indelible mark , to warn every human being against him , to inspire horror at his first aspect , and to condemn him inevitably to become a desperate outlaw . The only excusable pretext for it would be , when applied to atrocious criminals condemned for life , so that they might be known every where if they made their escape ; but this purpose may be effected in other ways without resorting to this brutal expedient . There are some persons who think that the ameliorated code does not inspire sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were more executions . Nothing can be more mistaken than this opinion , and no one position in relation to this subject more capable of being proved by facts , than that crimes have been most abundant in those countries where sanguinary inflictions have been most frequent ; that violent crimes have decreased in proportion , as capital punishments have been diminished ; and that se far , as the fear of punishment can operate to prevent the commission of offences , it is the certainty and not the severity , that produces the effect . It is also absurd to talk of multiplying executions , in the present state of public feeling ; it is useless to recommend hanging criminals for theft or forgery , when the repugnance to capital punishment is so deep and universal , that even in // a clear case of murder , there is always some solicitude lest a jury should not have firmness enough to bring in a verdict of guilty . The feeling against the punishment of death is very strong , and the class of persons who hold that human tribu-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in any case , whether they be wrong or right in their opinion , is certainly increasing . Reflecting minds will not fail to perceive , that this sentiment against all violent and brutal chastisements , and all executions , has a much wider scope than the mere consideration , about a few guilty wretches who have perpetrated atrocious crimes . Those who are opposed to taking away life in any case , assert that perpetual incarceration , with all the privations that may be made to accompany it , is the most severe of all punishments , and far more dreadful than any that can be directed against life and limb : - that violent punitions were the inven tion of barbarous ages , and were calculated to perpetuate the spirit they harmonized with : - that a thorough feeling of religious humility , and a proper reverence for Almighty Providence , forbids the destruction of what he alone could create : that the exhibition of every act of violence engenders harsh and ferocious feelings , and when this is exhibited under the formality and sanction of the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of private passion : - that the infliction of stripes , torture and death , even on the most odious criminals , has a direct tendency to degrade human nature : **that the abolition of capital punishments is of far other importance , than the life of a miserable convict which may be almost wholly worthless ; that in getting rid of all these acts of legal vengeance which cut off criminals in a violent manner , you raise the value of human life ; and the ultimate tendency of the system is , to discourage war and all the forms of * " A cruel criminal code is the parent of pusillanimity . A nation broken to cruel punishments becomes dastardly and contemptible . For , in nations , as well as individuals , cruelty is always attended by cowardice . It is the parent of slavery . In every government we find the genius of freedom depressed in proportion to the sanguinary spirit of the laws . It is hostile to the prosperity of nations as well as to the dignity and virtue of men . The laws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in blood . What did they produce ? An aggravation of those very calamities which they were intended to remove . A scene of the greatest and most complicated distress was accordingly exhibited by the miserable Athenians , till they found relief in the wisdom and moderation of Solon . " Wilson 's charge at a Circuit Court in Maryland in 179k // violence , by which human life is considered as insignificant , and to be wasted with impunity . These persons contend , that the whole spirit and the ultimate end of christianity is to banish all deeds of violence ; and that the laws are contradictory to it , and infected with ancient barbarism , until their example , which has the most commanding influence , shall consider the life of the meanest and most guilty human being , as sacred , and its destruction under any circumstances , as unjustifiable . Whatever extravagance there may be in these opinions , there can be no doubt , that their adherents are increasing in this country ; and that a disposition to do away all public displays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishments , is gaining ground in all countries where any principles of liberty , or any exercise of public opinion have an influence on the administration of civil government . The existence of this disposition is shewn in a variety of ways , and where the laws are not modified to meet it , a spirit will be engendered to counteract them . It is one of the highest qualifications in a legislator to be able to perceive and to guide the feeling of his age ; and if his views fall behind it , he will be no more than a mere attorney or scrivener , compiling new regulations on the basis of superannuated precedents , and all his labored enactments will be practically evaded . If the public think any punishment too severe , juries will refuse to convict the criminal ; and many offenders will escape from being prosecuted at all , or from being convicted if they are , when the penalties are more severe than the feelings of society require or will endure . The progress of light in our times , however , is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turn their backs upon it to avoid being dazzled . The struggle for amelioration , is one , that demands the utmost fortitude and determined spirit of perseverance . The late sir Samuel Romilly contended through his whole parliamentary career , with very partial success , to soften the penal code of England , and diminish capital punishments knowledge , his eloquence , and his experience , could effect few immediate changes . Yet his exertions were not thrown away , his reasonings remain and form a text-book for those who follow in his steps ; they will still have to combat that bigoted adhesion to a barbarous code , which is so discordant with the present state of society , // that the practice under it has been involved in great irregularity and confusion ; and there are not wanting persons who would remedy the evil by bringing back into use some of the most flagrant enormities of the ancient laws . One of the most melancholy instances of this barbarous spirit , indeed one of the most astonishing in the present state of knowledge upon this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contained in the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth numbers of an English journal , called the Pamphleteer , and written by J. T. Barber Beaumont , Esq . F. A. S. one of his majesty 's justices of the peace for Middlesex and Westminster . ' In this treatise , among the punishments he recommends , are emasculation and cutting off the hands of certain criminals before execution : ' but branding he seems to regard with particular favor , and enters into details upon it , which exhibit a mind , that in the present state of the world , we think a real phenomenon . After designating the crimes for which branding should be used , he proceeds to say : branding is a very efficacious instrument of punishment , though lately cast intO disuse , it being certainly no comfort . It might be made serviceable for the future recognition of the criminal on the following plan . Let the places of session be numbered , and at each place let a registry of convictions , producing the punishment of branding , be kept . These two numbers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one over the other , in the manner of a fraction ; he would thus carry about with him at all times , a record of his identity and former life . To shew at once the nature of his former crimes , should the figures become obliterated , the marks might be arranged thus : crimes of theft to be marked on the right side of the back ; of fraud on the left side of the back ; of lasciviousness on the right breast ; of malice on the left breast . A convict doomed to perpetual imprisonment , to be marked on the forehead and both cheeks . If the marks are obliterated , or become indistinct , the executioner is to rebrand the parts , and he is at liberty to examine the convict 's body from time to time , to ascertain how the fact is . " After the complacent display of honors appended to tho author 's name , the reader is more struck at meeting with such schemes , as these just cited . The initials of F. A. S. recalled // 1821 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have somewhere received , that the being a fellow of the Antiquarian Society , is rather a recommendation with the English government , to bestow the commission of a magistrate . However that may be , we should have been strongly inclined to suspect the author , with the advantage of his Antiquarian fellowship , to have committed a little plagiarism on some unknown monk of St. Dominic , from whose black-letter invoice of torture he had taken the preceding details ; were not the ideas in his essay of the same kind , too numerous to allow the supposition , that a man in his honorable situation , would have borrowed so largely , without an acknowledgment . All these odious propositions to restore some of the most barbarous punishments of former times , though they may not emanate from a mind callous to all the feelings of humanity , yet they certainly shew great ignorance of human nature , and great inattention to the known results of experience . What can be more absurd than to suppose , that a man desperate and profligate enough to commit a highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder , either of which he knows will subject him inevitably to death , would be deterred from the act , because his hand was to be struck off a few minutes before he was strangled ? The consequence would be only a momentary suffering to the culprit , but a brutalizing effect on the spectators . This pretence of inspiring terror among offenders is directly falsified by the history of all penal codes . The same pretext was given for retaining the shocking , the execrable details in the former punishment for high treason . And though these most disgraceful barbarities have been but recently repealed , and that after a long struggle in parliament , yet there probably could not be found in that body , though there might in the society of Antiquaries , a single person to vote for their restoration . The feeling in this country , since its independence , has been almost universal in favor of mild punishments ; and even in their colonial condition , they had many strtiggles against the sanguinary spirit in the criminal code of the parent state . Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wisdom and benevolence , in which no crime was pun* ished with death but premeditated murder ; all his laws , however , were repealed by the government in England , but were still persevered in for several years by the colony . There // were many other attempts to ameliorate the criminal laws by different colonies . A striking case of this occurred in Massachusetts in 1762 . Governor Bernard , by a message to the house of representatives of June 9th , in that year , says , that he had before him a bill respecting the punishment for counterfeiting money and treasurer 's notes , passed at the winter session preceding , to which he had refused his consent , because it was not made capital ; he returned it with a recommendation that they should make it capital , as was the case in every other part of the British dominions , and he should prefer not having the bill pass , unless the offence could be made capital , because the atrocity of the crime would otherwise be diminished . After some debate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer they agree with him in the atro .. city of the crime , and proceed to say : at the same time the house are very averse to a capital punishment in any case , where the interest of the government does not absolutely require it . And as they doubt not some other punishment than death will be sufficient effectually to deter from the commission of this crime , they can not give their consent it should be punished with death . ' The system of punishing criminals by hard labor was suggested in several of the States during the revolutionary war , and was introduced still earlier in Massachusetts . in 1765 a committee was appointed to make the punishment of criminals more subservient to the public interest , by altering the punishment of certain felonies , and providing a method for a public work-house , to which criminals of every part of th' province may be committed who may be sentenced to hard labor . ' The convicts in this state were employed in making nails at Castle William until that fortress was relinquished to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . It was however in Pennsylvania that the penitentiary system was first methodically and successfully established . The prison of Philadelphia had fallen into such* a frightful degree of abuse , that it became a terror to the inhabitants , and it was asserted that the gaolers used to send out the prisoners to commit depredations , who brought their plunder to the prison as a place of security . Some courageous and humane citizens determined on effecting a thorough reform , not only in the management of this particular prison , but in the whole system of punishment , and the success of their efforts caused a general adoption of their plan . // The criminal code of Massachusetts , in its infliction of capital punishment , holds a middle course between those codes which retain the sanguinary spirit of former times , and those which punish no crime but murder with death . By the laws of this state five crimes only are punished capitally-treason , murder , rape , burglary with arms or if any assault is committed , and arson where a dwelling house is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be reduced to four , for treason is a. crime that never has and probably never will happen . The other four are the most atrocious and violent offences that can be committed , and occur very rarely . If they were more frequent , it would be useless to punish them with death ; for excepting the advantage of getting rid of the culprit , and thereby saving the expense of keeping him in confinement , the efficacy of this punishment is destroyed by its frequency . At pre*. sent , when executions happen , which is after an interval of years , a great crowd is drawn from all parts , by that love of strong emotion which actuates mankind to witness scenes of deep , tragic interest ; great solemnity prevails , and a powerful feeling of awe is produced that has a lasting effect . Yet once make the spectacle as frequent , as it is in some countries , and the same indifference would be manifested , and the utility of the punishment almost destroyed . To that class of economists , and unfortunately they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this branch of legislation exclusively in reference to expense , and to calculate every thing only in dollars and cents , it may be suggested , that the hanging of one culprit costs the community in the loss of labor of the thousands who flock to behold it , a thousand times as much as it would to keep him in prison a century . It has been already observed , that it is of the highest importance to legislators that they should possess a wide and observing mind to discern the spirit of the age in which they are called to legislate ; because , after all their efforts , it is this , that will render their regulations efficient or nugatory . But besides this general and philosophical view , there are subjects of narrower consideration , where the course of things has produced changes , which it is necessary to understand in order to legislate wisely . The crime of forgery is an instance ; this , in all its branches , is inflexibly punished with death in England , and in consequence parties frequently refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to alter New &amp;riem , No. 8. // the punishment has repeatedly failed , though probably it will be successful in the course of one or two sessions of parliament . When a bank note was a comparatively scarce and valuable possession , and when of course the inducements and facilities of forging it were infinitely less ; when its promise was sacred , and before its proprietors by a connivance with the government had derived an immense profit , by refusing to redeem their promises in specie , the policy of hanging the forger might be more expedient , while the necessity would sek dom happen . And in this country , though punishing forgery with death has long been abolished , yet there were not wanting persons who would punish the villany of the counterfeiter with death . Yet such persons do not reflect how different the feeling is for a hank note , in our times , not only from their numbers , but from the difference of character which they once possessed when they were infallible types of property . Suppose death were now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commitment of the prisoner and his trial , the bank he tried to cheat should itself disappear under a shameful system of fraud , and rob the whole community , as some scores of these institutions have done in different parts of the country-what would a jury do in this case ? It is an extreme one , we admit ; but the time has gone by when the law would stake the life of a man against a bank note . It is under the head of forgery , that the greatest number of instances occur , of offences committed under circumstances which do not imply deep and inveterate profligacy ; and which might be pardoned with more safety than any other , if it were uot necessary to keep alive a wholesome terror against a crime of such dangerous and ruinous tendency* But our laws , which punish it with imprisonment for various periods , according to its enormity , give a chance for the interposition of meruy , where there have been grounds to extenuate the guilt of the criminal , and when his own conduct affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will cite a few examples from the Massachusetts State prison , to shew the effects of a humane system . A very ingenious mechanic was convicted of having prepared some plates to counterfeit bank notes . He had previously borne a reputation for honesty as well as ingenuity . in committing the ofl*nce , though he knew he was doing wrong , yet it was proved that he had been // deceived in part by those who employed him , and that ho had been enticed under several false pretences to prepare the plates . After being in the prison a year or more , and having shewn himself to be penitent from the first moment , he was pardoned . The man has ever since conducted himself hon. " estly and been usefully and extensively employed .

He had always been considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confliiement-his whole deportment was submissive and penitent ; at the end of eighteen months he was pardoned ; he returned to his family , and ha* since conducted himself well .

Some counterfeiters came to him and offered to buy his farm at a high price , if he would take his pay in false doubloons ; they finally persuaded him to do this under the idea that he might go down to Castine , then occupied by an enemy 's force , and purchase goods with these doubloons , and not only obtain a great profit from these goods , but also do a service in cheating the enemy . It was doubtless not a very stern honesty that could be seduced by such arguments as these ; but there was something specious to lead him on to sell his property for a great price . However , he ldst his farm , and was committed to the State prison for a long term , or for life . After behaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardoned , and has since beenindustrious and honest . Now , in England , each of these men would have been executed . We might adduce many other instances , but these will suffice to shew , that humanity is not always disadvantageous . There are too many cases where a pardon has been given to those who were unworthy of it , hut certainly they are not so many as to discour-. age a discreet use of it . Out of fourteen hundred and seventy-one convicts who have been sent to the Massachusetts State prison during a period of sixteen years , two hundred and for-. ty-two. have been pardoned , and twenty of these have been afterwards committed again . We often hear objections to the penitentiary system , which acquire some degree of force from being frequently repented , though they will not bear examination . A very prevalent idea is that the State prisons are a very great expense to the commu- // 4 Penitentiary System . Oct. nity . Now there is probably no country in the world where the expenses attending the department of criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States in this union . hi New Hampshire , the State prison last year paid its expenses and left a sP*all balance in its favor . In Massachusetts , the State prison costs but six thousand dollars a year to the treas. ury , and though in New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia , it demands a larger sum in proportion ; yet in no instance is it exorbitant , or sufficient to weigh against the system of hard labor punishment . Some persons say that the prisoners are too well fed , that they do not work hard enough ; - give them nothing but bread and water , and make them do the hardest labor . Now to make men perform excessive labor with no other food but a limited portion of bread and water , is easier to suggest than to realize . The fact is , that in all the prisons we have examined , there is no considerable error in this respect ; the convicts have a sufficiency of coarse but wholesome food , prepared in the simplest manner ; and if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically impossible that they can do hard labor . Other persons recommend a system of exclusive solitary confinement , without ever having considered its effects . In the first place , if this should be adopted , the view of the economists must be abandoned , for the criminals can perform no labor . But there are more serious objections to its adoption . It is the most dreadful of all punishments ; if rigidly enforced , it would make all subjected to it maniacs , if it did not destroy them ; this is not a matter of conjecture , but of experience . As a mode of correcting the convicts and enforcing the discipline of the prison , it is in harmony with the system , a most effective means of co*rcion , and always reduces the most obstinate to submission . A week or ten days is generally sufficient for the purpose . We were assured by the inspectors of the Philadelphia and Baltimore penitentiaries , that in each of those prisons but one instance had occurred of its failing to subdue the criminal . In each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulse had been reduced to a cambric thread , ' the criminal was still obstinate , and they were obliged to release him to prevent his perishing under it . In the Massachusetts prison there are no means for making solitary confinement perfect . There is still another class of persons who aSsert , that the // State prisons are not a sufficient punishment , that criminals do not dread being sent there , and that many commit crimes expressly to enjoy the comforts of being confined in. them . It might be a sufficient answer to say , that those who commit a second , third , fourth , or fifth crime , do not do it from any affection towards the State prison , any more than those cub prits , who under a different system are whipped repeatedly , pilloried , and branded , perpetrate their crimes from any particular relish for those inflictions . Nor will the miserable , stupid bravado of some convicted felons , that they were very glad to get to the penitentiary ,  --  that they had committed theft on purpose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are to legislate on these subjects ; though it has sometimes been brought forward in the public prints , and in argument , as an unequivocal proof , that being condemned to the State prison inspired no dread . In answer to this , it would only be necessary to mention the desperate attempts , in the face of almost certain destruction , that have been made from time to time in different prisons to effect an escape ; and that in all these institutions , the most constant vigilance is necessary , to prevent these wretches from making the most daring efforts to abandon the supposed luxuries of their situation . To effect theit escape by open violence , is so nearly impossible , that the attempts in this way are comparatively rare ; but it is well known to all the guardians of these establishments , that the most skilful of the convicts are always secretly occupied in devising some plan of escape , and are often engaged for months together , at every moment they can catch , in preparing furtively the most ingenious methods to effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these arguments afford , that will occur to every man on a moment 's reflection . Is it not contrary to all our knowledge of human character , is it not a libel on mankind to suppose , that they can ever willingly submit to imprisonment , to coercive labor , to infamy , for the sake of mere food ? If the absurdity of the supposition is not apparent to every man , let him visit one of these prisons , and casting a glance at the faces of the convicts , observe the emotion of rage , of shame , or compunction that the looks of a stranger will excite amongst these miserable criminals . Many of the erroneous impressions as to the effects of this system ot punishment have arisen from too sanguine ideas of // reforming the convicts . A portion of them may doubtless be made to feel the folly of their ways , ' a larger number too , than has yet been brought to this result , whenever the governments will provide the quantity of room that these establishments require to produce all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present we do not know of any prison of which this can be said . But , generally , they must be considered as places rather for the confinement of criminals , than for their reform ; as places where they will be kept during their detention out of the way of doing mischief , as doing severe penance for the crimes they have committed , and contributing by their labor to defray the expense of our criminal jurisdiction . A recent regulation in the laws of Massachusetts , which it would probably be good policy for the other States to adopt , will go very far to do away one of the evils attributed to State prisons ; that those who were not reformed were made worse by them . We shall not in future hear of any convict being sentenced a fourth time . Out of the whole number , one thousand four hundred and seventy one , that have been sent to the State prison in Charlestown , one hundred and thirty three were for a second time , seventeen a third time , and eight a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing that when any criminal sent to the prison was found to have been ibere before , that the a4torney general should proceed against him by information , and he should be sentenced for a further term not exceeding seven years , because of his second conviction ; and if a criminal should come there for the third time , he should be proceeded against in a similar manner , and should be sentenced to confinement for life . Seven convicts are now there for life under this new law . In this way , all those who are incurable will be taken from preying on the public , and having previously learned some trade in the prison , can be advantageously employed . It is not uncommon to find men who are more ready to call for severity in the chastisement of culprits , than to consider the obligation which rulers are under to do every thing in their power in the way of prevention , t and how much individuals are called on by all the principles of policy and humanity to lend their * See the pamphlet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several facts of this kind . t We refer the reader for many sound and eloquent remarks on this topic to the 25th No. of this journal , art . 16 , which was written by the l*te estima. ble Mr Gallison .

Nothing is more common than the use of what was originally poetic language in speaking on this subject . People talk of swallowing distilled poison and maddening draughts ; but these expressions have ceased to be figurative . Though we are fully aware of the mischief , though we have seen it demonstrated to be almost the sole cause of all the suffering , the poverty , and the crime to be found in this country , we still proceed without any attempt to lessen or to arrest it . We convert the exuberance of our harvests , which the bounty of Providence has bestowed , into a seductive poison , where the ingredient is a devil . ' There is not only no restraint on the production of the article ; but every facility is afforded for its distribution . Men who are too lazy to work , are allowed nearly without a check to entice others to lose their senses , their property , and their honesty in these infernal draughts . Formerly a dram could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , in the country , is turned into a dram shop ; while in the cities they spring up in every street and at every corner . No farmer can go to purchase necessaries for his family without being exposed to the temptation ; no laborer can get to his home without passing a score of these tippling houses , but for which he would have gone home sober to his family . If he passes them at first , they are sure to decoy him at last . Fatigued , thirsty , and seeing them surrounded with his companions , he may go by a few times , but he begins to enter by degrees , the practice soon becomes a habit , and he - finally consumes his earnings and his strength within their pestilent attraction .

Surely they ought to look with some pity on the wretch who has been drawn into the commission of crime through intoxication , the cheapness and facilities for which they have declined to lessen . The chief requisite in the establishment of these prisons is sufficient room for their purposes : and as this is an expense that occurs but once , it is the most miserable policy to incur it inadequately ; particularly as it does not require edifices of excessive dimensions . The expenditure is for room and strength , not elegance and decoration . The rooms in the Massachusetts State prison are all of them cells of different sizes . Their sides , roof , and floor , are blocks of unhewn granite , with an iron door and iron grate . They are , in fact , small , artificial caverns ; their only furniture is a straw matrass on a wooden crib , with a bible and some religious tracts , the gifts of charitable societies . They are constantly aired , being occupied only at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Nothing is wanting to that prison , except a greater number of these cells . It is a mistake of some theorists to plan a prison , so that every man shall he in absolute solitude and seclusion . It is only desirable that the greater part of the convicts , particularly the more atrocious and hardened ones , should be thus separated . But in many cases a discreet superintendant will find it advantageous to put two or three together , where he perceives a repentant disposition , and that they will sympathize , and confirm each other in such a course . It can not be too often repeated , that classification and separation are the first objects to be obtained ; and that the greater part of the disappointment , and the principal , we might almost The excise in England en ardent spirits was not laid solely for fiscal purposes .

' The fact exists here , but without the advertisement . It is honorable to our population , that drunkenness is not more common when liquors are so cheap . what would be the state of the population in England , with the present habits of their working classes , if whisky could be had at fifteen pence a gallon , and if an ordinary laborer Lould , with one day 's wages , obtain the means of intoxication for a fortnight ? // say the only cause , of any bad results from these prisons , have arisen from their limits being too narrow for the number of criminals they hold in confinement . The experiment of the Penitentiary System can not be said to be tried , until the prisons shall be large enough to separate and class the convicts , which is not the case in any prison in the United States . At present it is impossible to prevent prisoners of very different degrees of guilt , from seeing each other and occasionally talking together , and the mischief from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have the charge of these institutions , is entirely obvious and is very extensive . These establishments , to which criminals of all kinds are sent promiscuously , could only be paralleled by a hospital that should receive all patients indiscriminately ; where a sufferer with the rheumatism would catch the small pox , and another with a fracture be infected with the plague ; and the most virulent and contagious disorders would soon obtain a mastery over the rest . The advantage , indeed , to the public , would be in favor of the hospital , since the evil would destroy itself by exterminating its victims . The pamphlet , whose title is prefixed to these observations , is written by the warden of the Massachusetts State prison , and contains much valuable information . The author is well calculated , by his intrepidity , humanity , and discretion , for the situation he holds ; and there is no office that requires a greater share of these qualities . He visits , unarmed , the most atrocious felons , whose malignantpassions sometimes drive them to desperation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has doomed to ignominy and many of them to perpetual imprisonment ; but for whom there is a hope of pardon and escape from despair . Much depends on his sagacity in discovering those who are capable of reform , in fixing the feeling of repentance where it has taken root , and in detecting the cunning and hypocrisy of those who are feigning penitence , only to be at liberty to wreak themselves on society for their punishment . The observations of such an officer are worthy of attention , and we recommend his work to those who are interested in the subject . It is of great importance that the question should be maturely considered in this country ; when we consider , that the ancient criminal code , of sanguinary punishments , torture and corporal inflictions , can never be introduced .
