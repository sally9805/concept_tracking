Money is the Witch of the World . Sometimes she plays farces and at others , she acts real tragedies . DRAMATIS PERSON Mr. Banker . Sir . Cunning . Mr. President . Mr. Shaver . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Secretary . Bank Directors . Agents , Brokers , &c.; Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  Mr. Banker 's office . Enter Banker . Banker . Mr. Banker I am rich in fame , in honour , and in money , because my stocks have made me so . Banks I control ; insurance stocks , and turnpike roads  --  our city funds , and salt works of the state  --  I have raised or lowered at my pleasure . ' T is not in stocks alone my fame is known . The warlike ships of many nations have been built by me ; and Greece may soon become familiar with my name . A bolder stroke methinks I can conceive :  --  The nation 's bank , the nation 's mint , and then the nation 's treasury . But hark ! ( A noise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make me their reports . Enter Mr. Agent . What news bring you ? Agent . Agent Of great success in all the operations you have entrusted to my care . You will please examine my report , and learn the zeal with which I have laboured in your cause . Banker . Mr. Banker Hand it to my secretary , and in the while take these new commands and see that you obey them . Agent . Agent You may depend upon it . Exit agent . Banker Mr. Banker ( solus ) . In Europe the people are but slaves , and agents dare not disobey their masters . In this land of freedom , then , will agents be my slaves , or will they violate the confidence reposed and make me a slave of theirs ? Or is mankind , the world throughout , the same  --  born with different intellects , and created to fulfil the varied scenes of their existence ? Mind is power  --  wealth is power , and strength of bone and muscle is the same ; and with the three united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , in seeking those with whom I will conspire , great caution is required :  --  The newspapers of the day must be controlled  --  and politicians flattered  --  and military men , who have worn the epaulets of fame and glory , invited to my standard . I 'll call my secretary , ( ringing the bell , ) and consult with him ; for he has often played the rogue in lesser things with great success . Enter Secretary . Secretary . Mr. Secretary The agent 's gone ; I have looked at his report ; it is most flattering . The stock he has procured on better terms than what we first supposed he could ; and now the bank is ours . Banker . Mr. Banker You know the confidence I have long reposed in you  --  I have a plot to be executed that requires the aid of those who can contrive  --  men of influence , wit , and cunning  --  choice spirits of the highest grade  --  in money , champions of chivalry . Secretary . Mr. Secretary Pray let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bank  --  the nation 's mint  --  and then the nation 's treasury . Secretary . Mr. Secretary A bold design , fitted for your capacity . Banker . Mr. Banker With whom shall we confide ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary First of all , Sir Cunning meets my views  --  and then  --  Banker . Mr. Banker And will Sir Cunning play a second part where once he was the first ? for he was the first with Dallas and the Treasury . Secretary . Mr. Secretary He must play second , for now the first he can not play in any monied game . Banker . Mr. Banker Go then and sound him . Be cautious , for he is tricked in artful wiles ; and if he should fathom our designs before we could control him , his interest would be doubtful . Secretary . Mr. Secretary I have told you he could play only second in any money game , and where is the man with whom he could unite , unless it is yourself , sir ? Banker . Mr. Banker Small spirits , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dread sufficient to command him ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary I think it will . Banker . Mr. Banker But if it should not , how would you then proceed ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary You know , for twenty years I have rode upon the tempest , or sailed above the storm . At Albany I 've been successful in gaining the Legislature of the state , and on Lehigh 's banks the coal I managed well . Banker . Mr. Banker Go , then . I leave it all with you ; but remember , in your going , the crafty deal you have to play . Secretary . Mr. Secretary I will ; and if he plays Turk , I will be a Turk to him ; or if he acts the Jew 's or Christian 's part , I will do the same . Exit . SCENE II .  --  Broker 's Office in Wall-Street . ( Mr. Broker looking over his money drawers . ) Enter Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator There is some shivering in the wind , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear up  --  a light flaw will capsize them now . Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker No more marble scrapes , I hope . Mr. Speculator Mr. Speculator Some of the incorporated shaving shops will be on a par with Malepare . Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker The devil ! Will Mr. Maxwell , the district attorney , have them indited also ? Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator I guess not  --  big bugs have the direction of them . Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker The attorney can not be under the influence of big bugs , can he ? But pray let me know : I have some little interest at stake in them . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator Why , there is the Life and Fire , and the big Pawn Broker 's shop , and  --  Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker None of our city bankers , I hope . Enter Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant Gentlemen , I want some money to day . Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker How much ? Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant I have a very large amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular state of the banks , I can get no accommodations  --  I am short 5,000 . Mr. Broker . Mr. Broker Money is very scarce  --  it bears a high premium ; but I suppose your securities are good . Enter Mr. Shipper . Mr. Shipper . Mr. Shipper The Liverpool packet is in . The devil is at play in England : Manchester and Birmingham are prostrated ; the workmen have been turned out of employment , and starvation has driven them to desperation . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant Have you got your letters from the post office ? Mr. Shipper . Mr. Shipper The letter bag is up and distributed , and I have the latest dates . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator Give the news if you please . Mr. Shipper . Mr. Shipper ( Opening a letter . ) My advices add , by way of postscript , ( reading , ) " from what I have above written , you have been prepared for what you thought the worst ; but fresh disasters rush upon us . By this morning 's stage , news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the military to quell them . Even Liverpool is alarmed lest the starving poor should visit our city to plunder us for bread . We shall have to imitate your immortal General Jackson in his defence of New Orleans , by using bales of cotton to defend our city . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant I must run to the post office to get my letters . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  Mr. Banker 's Office . ( Mr. Banker solus . ) Enter Mr. Secretary . Secretary . Mr. Secretary I have been and seen Sir Cunning , and  --  Banker . Mr. Banker His words  --  his words , my dear secretary . Secretary . Mr. Secretary His words ? He said he would come and see you . Banker . Mr. Banker When , sir ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary Directly . Banker . Mr. Banker Did you guard against deception ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary I did . Banker . Mr. Banker How did you approach him ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary With smiles I addressed him , and he gave a smile : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With solemn air I placed my eyes upon him . He read my thoughts , and gave me this response :  --  I am ready for any bold or deep design . I pierced his inmost soul , and found it willing . I then told him all . President . Mr. President But his pledge . Secretary . Mr. Secretary He gave me one more sacred than the bonds of Masonry . Enter Servant . Servant . Servant A gentleman inquires for my master . I believe it is Sir Cunning . Banker . Mr. Banker Show him in . Enter Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning How do you do , gentlemen ? How are you to-day ? Banker . Mr. Banker I am glad to see you . Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning Well , Mr. Secretary , any thing new to-day ? How are stocks ? Money plenty ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary So , so , you know banker : I think we can operate to advantage . Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning Fine time to make money  --  what say you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me all about it . I can command half a million of dollars any day . Banker . Mr. Banker It requires a powerful combination . Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning Yes , yes , I know it ; but we can manage matters , ca n't we , Mr. Secretary ? Secretary . Mr. Secretary I think so . Banker . Mr. Banker How ? Give me your mind . Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning Buy up the newspapers to publish what we want , and to puff us . Get the control of two or three of our city banks , and a score or so of the little banks throughout the country . Send Mr. Secretary to Albany to get a few more chartered institutions , and make some weak minded men the directors , subject to our will and pleasure , and dash forward in politics , and promise our support to the treasurer for President of the United States , and get our friends into the custom-house offices ; then create a new kind of paper , called Life and Fire Bonds , and Lombard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think proper , and make them bear interest at six per cent , from date , Page 13 payable in six , nine , and twelve months , in imitation of government war loans . Get agents to sell them among the brokers and speculators , and send a ship-load off to the south to buy cotton at Charleston , Savannah , and New-Orleans : they wo n't know but they are New-York bank bills . That will give funds to buy the United States bank stock , so as to get the control of the direction . Then commence a quarrel with the treasury department , and make our newspapers attack the managers of the nation 's mint , and get the present incumbents turned out , and our friends put in . Then throw every obstacle in the way of the government being able to pay their interest regularly on the national debt . Profess a great deal of friendship , and , by our officiousness , get them into a devil of a scrape ; then , in pretending to help them out , step into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Sir Cunning . Banker . Mr. Banker Can we control the officers we make ? Sir Cunning . Sir Cunning Yes , yes . They wo n't know one another : they ca n't combine . You see we must not let the right hand know what the left is doing . Banker . Mr. Banker You are right , Sir Cunning . SCENE II .  --  Mr. Speculator 's Office in William Street . Mr. Speculator Mr. Speculator , solus , walking his office . Names are indicative of character . Life and fire are united only in hell . rna , the name of a mountain and of a steam-boat , both have burst from excess of heat . What must insurance be ? The sun , the fountain of life and light , has sometimes spots upon its face . Mechanics ' tools lose their edge , and Tradesman 's bills are often doubted : stocks are used as whipping posts , and shavers often cut their skins . Enter Mr. Shaver . Mr. Shaver . Mr. Shaver You seem to be in a soliloquy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . You are a lucky fellow  --  I hope you are clear of the life and fire paper ? Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator Light fire paper , you had better said . I done better when I dealt in crockery ware . Mr. Shaver . Mr. Shaver Have the water-works touched you ? Water and fire , two opposing elements ! How happened you to be handling both at a time ? I think you must have been studying chemistry : perhaps you were about analysing some marble concerns . Marble , fire , and water , furnish the great constituent parts of soda drink . By the way , has the Hudson Company furnished you with ice to cool it ? Enter Mr. Old Times . Mr. Old Times . Mr. Old Times Acquaintances , how do you do ? Mr. Shaver and Mr. Speculator . Mr. Shaver , Mr. Speculator My old friend , how do you do ? we are glad to see you . Old Times . Mr. Old Times O brave , brave . Mr. Shaver . Mr. Shaver So you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , and no visiter can he more welcome . You have transacted much business in your day , but things went very different then from what they do now . Old Times . Mr. Old Times Why , we talked very different , if I may judge from what I heard as I emered the door . You appeared to be conversing about ice and sober water  --  odd subjects for merchants to be discussing . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator Why , we have relinquished our former mercantile pursuits , and are now engaged in the stocks . Mr. Old Times . Mr. Old Times What stocks ? Stocks ! I hope you have not been where the boys throw rotten eggs at you . Mr. Speculator . Mr. Speculator No , no , you do n't understand . Mr. Old Times . Mr. Old Times The whipping post , then . Mr. Shaver Mr. Shaver You are a great quiz , ( slapping Old Times on the shoulder ; ) it was soda water , not sober water , of which we were speaking . Mr. Speculator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , and Mr. Shaver too . He do n't know that I shall never be able to pay that note of mine which he shaved the other day . ( Aside . ) Old Times . Mr. Old Times I have seen a number of my acquaintances  --  Mr. Merchant , Mr. Shipper , Mr. Bank Director , and a number of others : they all looked rather flat , and I supposed that sober water was some new article lately introduced . But how get you on in town ? How is Mr. Senator and Mr. Grocer ? He used to be a very clever little man when he followed tailoring in the country . He must have risen very fast , I think : you sent him to the assembly a year or two ago . Mr. Shaver . Mr. Shaver Broke , broke , completely over the dam , and your friend the doctor , too  --  somehow of another they did not tail their P 's and Q 's right . Old Times . Mr. Old Times I should like to know particulars . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening  --  you shall know the whole . SCENE III .  --  Scene changes to the counting room of the auctioneer.  --  Mr. Auctioneer looking over his account of sales . Enter Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant How have my goods sold ? Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer I do nt know , I am just examining ; but you must not be surprised if you have sacrificed something . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant Loss upon loss is too bad  --  the goods invoiced lower than they were ever before . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer The banks have broke , and there is no money . I had a full house at the sale , but the retailers would buy but little for cash , and I date not give them credit . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant What is the amount . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer It will not be very much from the amount I advanced . ( Handing the account of sales . ) Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant Can it be possible $7,000. for what cost $10,000 ?  --  $3,000 gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer Oh ! trade must revive , the storm will blow over . You must not repine . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant Ah ! the news from England . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer Indeed , no one could have anticipated the decline that has taken place in the cotton trade . The planters at the South must be large sufferers , and the merchants must not have too much feeling , ( if they participate a little in the general depression of business ) when the agriculturists of the country are suffering so much . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant I could sustain a loss  --  but my family , my expenses , my character , my children , my every thing that is dearer than life  --  and what am I without my property ? my wealth is my reputation , it is your reputation , it is the power of the world . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer It is true , but pause a moment , examine your account of sales . I have done the bost in my power . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Auctioneer . ) The goods I bought of you the other day do not hold out agreeaably to the bills . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer Ah , how I pray ? Mr. Retailer . Mr. Retailer The cambrics which are charged as twelve yards , do not exceed ten , and the shirtings fall short as much . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer Is it possible ? I will send one of my young men to examine them . He shall call this morning . I hope you will be ready to pay the bill . Mr. Retailer . Mr. Retailer If it is corrected , I shall . Exit Mr. Retailer . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer So you see I am bothered . Sell and deliver goods , and then have to re-examine them again . Your losses are nothing to my vexation , and then , again , I guarantee sometimes ; and always when I sell for cash , and deliver without the pay , it is at my risk , you know ; and now I can not tell whether that account of sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be other deductions to be made . Why are you not more particular in having your goods correspond with your invoices ? Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant You know they were made for auction . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer And you know  --  Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant And then we both know that deceptions are practised in trade . Mr. Auctioneer . Mr. Auctioneer So it is : without responsibility there is no character . You have your goods put up by the manufacturer expressly for auction . You are not known , the manufacturer is not known , the goods are sold by the invoice ; let the baptismal name be what it will , I call them by it  --  dry goods , groceries , or the like . I had as lief sell Yankee rum for Jamaica spirits as not  --  you only tell me so . My business is to echo others men 's words . Mr. Merchant . Mr. Merchant It is ten , and I have large payments to make too for cotton purchasers , and I must borrow  --  will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Auctioneer It is doubtful . My hour of sales has arrived . Look in again sir , if you please , I will try to accommodate you . Exeunt omnes . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  Director 's Room in the Bank . President , Directors and Cashier , with notes for discount . President . Mr. President Let 's proceed to business . Cashier . Cashier The drafts upon us for specie have been very large , although there has been no particular run upon us , and the demand for money has greatly increased . 1st Director . 1st Director How much is asked for ? Cashier . Cashier One hundred thousand dollars more than we have funds . ( Handing the notes to the President. ) 2d Director . 2d Director What kind of paper ? President . Mr. President Our old customers are large applicants , and the directors themselves have thrown in a great deal . 3d Director . 3d Director I want money . 7th Director . 7th Director And I too . All the Directors . All the Directors And I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , and I. 1st Director . 1st Director If we had not meddled with insurance bonds , our funds would have been at command . 4th Director . 4th Director I always opposed them . President . Mr. President Our friends out of doors helped us in procuring our charter  --  we felt under some obligation to them . 4th Director . 4th Director Bargains at Albany are like politicians ' promises  --  good for nothing . 1st Director . 1st Director A little show of honesty is the salt of villany  --  it is sprinkled to keep the people easy . I think we had better use a little more of it , or else we shall be in bad pickle . 3d Director . 3d Director I think we had better use post notes payable at three or six months  --  in this way we may get relief . Some bold stroke must be made  --  New-Orleans , Savannah , and Charleston , be our markets . 1st Director . 1st Director I do n't like these bold strokes . 3d Director . 3d Director Nothing like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sir Cunning , and see how he has dashed up , and then misfortune pulled him down ; but now he is up again , managing banks , insurance companies , &c.; 1st Director . 1st Director Yes , he may very justly sing the little boy 's song of teter totter : but I do n't wish to see our institution a teter totter  --  our city is full of them . Mr. President . Mr. President We must compel those stockholders who have hypothecated stock , to redeem it or sell out . 4th Director . 4th Director That will not do  --  it is on the votes of such stockholders that we manage the direction . Cashier . Cashier But the leather man in the swamp , gentlemen ! Directors . Directors What of him ? what of him ? Cashier . Cashier His partner . Directors . Directors His partner ! He owns stock in our bank . Cashier . Cashier What the devil does he care for it ? President . Mr. President But the Leather Man . Cashier . Cashier He is a queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thinking man  --  he is a self-taught man  --  he is a liberal man  --  he is what I know to be an honest man  --  a bold man , and , like a tanner 's dog , when he once seizes , never lets go Directors . Directors Egad , he is the last man then that we want to deal with . President . Mr. President Mr. Iron , with all his rust , will better suit the views of those who wish to cheat and shave , than any honest man . Messenger opens the door . Messenger . Messenger Mr. President , an officer is without who wishes to see you . Mr. President . Mr. President Invite him to a seat near my desk within the bank , and tell him I will soon be there . Messenger . Messenger ' T is the sheriff , sir ; he has some public duty to perform . President . Mr. President It is ! show me him . Exeunt Mr. President and Messenger . Directors engage in a confused conversation among themselves . Re-enter Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leather Man has got that little black-eyed , keen-eyed judge , to issue his injunction , and we are Dennis 'd now . Exeunt with consternation , noise , and confusion . SCENE II .  --  The Bank with heaps of specie on the counter , and clerks in attendance opens . Enter , an immense crowd of hurders , cartmen , counter jumpers , countrymen , together with a medley of all sorts  --  such as priests , lawyers , devils , all rushing to the counters , with bank bills in their hands .  --  All together , All together ( with confusion . ) I want the specie  --  pay me  --  this way  --  here  --  my turn first  --  do nt croud  --  dam the banks  --  keep out of the way , &c.; Enter Magistrate , mounting the counter . Magistrate . Magistrate My fellow citizens , I exhort you all to keep the peace , and hereafter I advise you to keep no paper money . Gold and silver will not deceive you but foundered banks , like foundered horses , will . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the chancellor , I am ordered to close this institution . Fellow citizens , withdraw . Disperse ye bank directors , brokers , shavers , skinners  --  disperse , or else to jail I 'll lead you . Exeunt omnes
