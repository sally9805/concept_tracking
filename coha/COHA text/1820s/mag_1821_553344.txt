txt ART . IV. -i . Sketches , Historical and Topographical , of the Floridas ; more particularly of East Florida . By James Grant Forbes . 8vo. pp. 226 , New York . 2 . Memoir on the geography , and natural and civil history of Florida , attended by a map of that country , 4*c . By Witham Darby . Svo. pp. 92 , Philadelphia . THE first discovery of Florida has been usually ascribed , not with much justice , to Sebastian Cabot . This discovery is supposed to have been made in 1496 or 1497 , in Cabot 's first expedition for the discovery of a north-west passage to China . In that voyage , Sebastian Cabot , or more probably John Cabot with his son Sebastian , for the latter was at that time but twenty years old , ran down the American coast from latitude 670 , where his seamen were alarmed at finding no // night , a far south as latitude 38* , or at farthest 36* , near one of which points he was compelled by want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He therefore did not approach within many miles of any part of the coast , that has ever been properly included within the limits of Florida . In the year 1512 , John de Ponce , the first discoverer of Porto Rico , who had acquired great wealth as governor of that island , fitted out , at his own expense , two vessels in quest of the fabled fountain of health . The virtues of this fountain , believed by the natives and by many Europeans to exist in some part of the West Indies , or the southern part of North America , were such , that whoever bathed in it , of whatever age he might be , was immediately restored to the vigour and beauty of youth . De Ponce first discovered the coast of Florida on Easter Sunday , which festival is called in the church calendars Pascha Floridum , and from that circumstance he gave the country the name which it has borne ever since . He coasted southerly from latitude 300 along the Atlantic shore ,  --  landed at a place which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession , and established a stone cross as a monument ; - discovered cape Florida , which he named Cape Corrientes , from the rapidity of the current through the Gulf of Florida ,  --  and discovered also the islands and rocks called The Martyrs , which he so named from their fancied resemblance to men tied to stakes to be burned . A name of evil omen , some writer remarks , which the great number of shipwrecks upon them has since rendered ap* propriate . IDe Ponce then entered the bay , sometimes called from him , to this day , Juan de Ponce , where he landed and took possession in the name of his sovereign . After making this discovery , De Ponce went to Spain , and by much solicitation obtained the appointment of governor of Florida , in which country he intended to settle a colony . He returned to Porto Rico , where he fitted out a fleet at great expense , and enlisted a body of men to establish his new colony . He reached the coast of Florida , and had hardly landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was attacked with such vigor by a great body of savages , armed with poisoned arrows , that a great number of his men were killed , and the rest were compelled to retreat to their ships . He was himself wounded by a poisoned arrow , but made his // 64 July , escape and was carried to the island of Cuba , where he died . Many of his followers died , in great distress , of the wounds inflicted by the poisoned weapons . This last expedition is not noticed in some of the early histories of De Ponce 's discovery , and there is perhaps reason to doubt at least that part of the story , which relates to the use of poisoned weapons by the natives ; but we find the narrative in Le Moigne 's history , as published by De Bry , and also in 4w other early histories . In 1520 Luke V ? asquez of Ayllon equipped two ships from the harbour of Plata , in the island of Hispaniola , for the purpose of procuring savages from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He landed at the bay of St. Helena , in South Carolina , then , and long afterwards , considered by the Spaniards as within the limits of Florida . The natives , after they had recovered from their alarm at sight of the Spanish ships , and of men who were covered with clothes , received their visiters kindly and hospitably . Vasquez , in return for their hospitality , invited a large number of the natives to an entertainment on board his ships , and seized the opportunity to set sail with them on board , and to proceed towards Hispaniola . Many of them pined to death from vexation , and an obstinate refusal of all food . A large part of the remainder perished at sea , in one of the vessels which foundered in a storm , and a small number who survived the voyage were forced into a cruel and hopeless slavery . Vasquez for this exploit received the reward offered to such as discovered new lands . In 1525 he went again to St. Helena with three ships , but one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afterwards cut off by the natives ; in consequence of which he returned disappointed to Hispaniola . Some accounts say that he was left behind , and died in Florida . Pamphilo Narvaez obtained a patent from Charles V , and in March 1528 he sailed from the island of Cuba for Florida in five vessels , with a military force of four hundred foot and forty horse . He proceeded round the western extremity of Cuba , and after encountering several storms , in which he was in great danger of being wrecked , he arrived on the coast of Florida . He landed at a place on , or near the bay of Tampa , and discovered an Indian village , from which all the inhabitants fled on his approach . In a deserted hut he found some trifling ernaments of gold , which encouraged his hopes . On advanc // ing into the interior he found small quantities of indian corn . He was told by the natives that there was a country , called Apalache , far distant to the north , which was rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set out with three hundred men on foot and forty horse , ordering the ships to follow him along the shore . After marching fifteen days through a desolate country , they came to a river-perhaps the Suwany , on which Gen. Jackson destroyed Bolegstown in 1818 . They crossed the river , partly by swimming , and partly on rafts , and on the other side they discovered a party of Indians , who supplied them with corn . On exploring the sea-coast it was found to be full of shoals , and without ports . They again proceeded on their march for fifteen days , without finding an inhabitant . On the 17th of June they fell in with a party of Indians , who were enemies to the Apalachians , and were then on their march to make a hostile inroad into their country . The Indian king took the Spaniards to his towns , and entertained them with corn and venison . They soon proceeded on theh* march , and on the 28th of June came in sight of the town of Apalache , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found abundance of corn , deer-skins , mantles , and garments , woven of the inner bark of trees , women 's head-dresses , and stones for grinding corn . The town consisted of forty houses , which were low and covered with straw . It was surrounded by thick woods and deep morasses . The Indians were of a large stature , nimble and well formed , and generally naked . The whole country which the Spaniards had passed over was flat and sandy , interspersed with troublesome bogs , and abounding in walnut , oak , laurel , fir , cedar ; pine , and low palm trees . They remained twenty-five days at Apalache , and made several ex* cursions into the country , which they found thinly inhabited and wretchedly poor . A cacique , whom they took prisoner , told them that his town and district were the best in that whole region , and that beyond it the inhabitants were less numerous , and the land was poorer . Narvaez therefore concluded not to attempt to push his conquests farther , but to return towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desert country , they came to the town of Ante , where they obtained a small supply of corn , pompions , and kidney-beans . This place appears to have been situated on the river of St Marks , probably near the present town of St Marks . From Ante p* // party was sent to explore the sea-coast . They returned on the third day with information that shallow bays and creeks extended far inland , that the sea was remote , and that the face of the land was rude and dismal . The men had now become sickly , and had lost nearly all their horses . They had travelled two hundred and eighty leagues since they landed , and in the whole distance had seen neither mountain nor hill . They were subject to the continual attacks of the natives , in which ten of their number had been killed . Having contrived to build five wretched boats , with such materials as they could procure , making ropes of their horses ' manes and tails , and sails by sewing together shirts , they embarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After wandering here some days , where they suffered the severest hardships , they were separated by a storm , in which the boats were all wrecked , and three of them with their whole crews were lost . Eighty persons from the other two boats got on shore , upon an island , naked and without arms . The natives took compassion on them , and furnished them with provisions , as long as they had any to offer . They remained upon this island from October to April , subsisting in part upon roots . Many of them died of hunger , and the survivors fed on their flesh . Before spring their number was reduced to fifteen , and four only , one of whom was named Cabeca de Vaca , after long wanderings and a variety of adventures for the space of seven years among the savages , at length reached the Spanish settlements of Mexico , and thence returned to Spain . Pamphilo de Narvaez , the commander , was never heard of after the wreck of the boats , though there was a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these disasters , Florida was for several years neglected . At length Ferdinand de Soto , a soldier who had acquired vast wealth in Peru , was appointed , by the emperor Charles V , governor of Cuba , with the title of General of FJorida , and I* ' 1arquess of the lands which he might conquer . About this time Cabeca de Vaca returned to Spain , and gave such an account of his adventures , and of the wealth of the regions through which he had passed , as excited an unconquerable curiosity , at the court of Spain , to explore the country . Soto fitted out a splendid expedition , and was accompanied by a great number of gentlemen , who disposed of large estates in Spain , to raise the means for equipping themselves to follow // him . Several Portuguese gentlemen also enlisted in the cause , one of whom after his return wrote an interesting history of the expedition . They left Spain in April 1538 ; and sailed from Havana with nine yessels , having on board six hundred men , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 18th of May of the following year . After a short voyage they arrived in the bay of Espiritu Santo and there landed . We do not propose here to give even a sketch of the peregrinations and exploits of this extraordinary man . They are fully detailed in several works , to the best of which we have above alluded , lie spent the summer after he landed , and the following winter , in the peninsula of Florida , not far distant from the bay of Apalache ; and in the beginning of the following spring , he sent back his vessels to Cuba for supplies . Leaving a part of his men at the port , he then marched towards the north and east , in search of a place called Yupata , where he was informed there was gold . He crossed the river Alatamaha , and probably the Ogechee , and proceeded northward towards the sources of the Savannah , and thence westward across the Allegany ridge . After resting for thirty days , in May and June , at a place called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his horses fed in the meadows , he proceeded south to the town of Mavilla , or Mobile , sending his sick by water ; and here he spent the summer . In October he suffered severely by the burning of Mobile . He fought here a great battle with the Indians , in which he killed two thousand men . While here , he heard that his vessels had returned with supplies to Ochus , the seat of the town of Pensacola , but he concealed the fact from his men , lest they should be impatient to quit the country , and because he did not wish any inforinaflon of his want of success to reach his countrymen . In November he marched in a north-westerly direction eighty leagues to Chicaca , a Chickesaw village on the upper part of the Yazoo river , where he spent the winter . In the following summer he marched again west , and crossed the Mississippi , which he called Rio Grande . In the succeeding spring , after spending the winter at Antiamque , he was taken ill of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the 21st of May 1542 , he died . This event happened at Guacoya , said to be on the bank of the Red River , in latitude 31g . His lieutenant , Moscoso. continued to ramble on the western side // of the Mississippi till the following summer , when he built seven vessels and descended the river , and after a variety of hardships arrived in Cuba , in September 1543 , with three hundred and eleven men in a state of great wretchedness . In 1544 Julian Samanus , Peter Ahumada , and others , solicited permission to take possession of the country and to govern it , but the emperor withheld his consent . It was thought better to attempt to convert the natives to the christian religion . Accordingly in 1549 , Ludovicus Cancellus , a friar of the order of St Dominic , with four others of the same order , was sent out at the expense of the emperor , to preach the gospel in Florida . He landed unarmed , with his companions and a few sailors . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded them , not to hear - them preach , but to attack them with clubs , as if they had been enemies . Lewis , who had before learned their language , did all that oratory and mild words could do , to sooth their minds , but they were deaf to his persuasions , and fell upon him and killed him , with two of his associates . The others made their escape . It was related by some of the followers of Soto , who had remained in the country and afterwards escaped , that the Indians ate the , flesh of the three friars , and took off their skins entire and hung them upon the shrines of their idols , as a trophy of their victory . After the disastrous and tragical termination of so many attempts to reduce this country under the Spanish dominion , the zeal of the Spaniards began to abate . But the French soon after attempted to establish a colony here . In 1562 , John Ribault sailed from France with two men of war , with a large body of troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Florida in latitude 300 , near the site of the city of St Augustine , and called the place French Cape . He found the coast low and flat , and covered with lofty trees . He coasted along the shore until he came to the mouth of a beautiful river , which he called May , from the season in which the discovery was made . He entered the mouth of the river and landed . His party was received in a friendly manner by the natives , who gave them maize and red and white berries . They went into the woods , but observed nothing remarkable , except trees with red and white berries , on which were multitudes of silkworms . They proceeded to explore the coast northerly , as far as the Jordan , one of the principal rivers of // Carolina , probably the Santee . The intermediate rivers were named by Ribault from the rivers in France , which they were supposed to resemble . These names , however , are not retain -- ed at present , though they are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary 's was called the Seine . They finally resolved on planting their little colony at a place which they called Charlesfort , in St Helena Sound , near the mouth of the Edisto . Twenty-six persons only consented to remain , and the rest returned to France ; and Albert , the lieutenant , was left in command of the colony . They were treated in a friendly manner by the natives , from whom they obtained not only partial supplies of provisions , but pearls , chrystal and silver . But they made no provision for their future subsistence ; they neglected to plant , and dissensions broke out among them . They quarrelled with , and assassinated their commander , and elected another . Finding no relief from their friends in France as tbey expected , they were reduced almost to despair . They finally resolved on building a vessel to carry them back to France . Although destitute of almost every material usual in ship building , they succeeded in constructing a ship , in which they determined to embark . Their cordage was made from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing and bed linen . They embarked with a very small supply of provisions , and were soon overtaken by a calm , which lasted twenty days . Their provisions became entirely exhausted , and they were reduced to the horrid necessity of putting to death one of their number , and feeding on his flesh . A soldier , on whom the lot fell of being first sacrificed to prolong the lives of the rest , submitted voluntarily to the measure , and made not the least resistance . Each one stood by to catch his portion of the blood of the victim , and not a drop was wasted . They soon after fell in with an English ship , which relieved them from their distress , and carried them into England . It is said that they were presented to Queen Elizabeth , and treated by her with great kindness . In April 1564 , Rene de Laudonniere , who had in the former expedition accompanied Ribault , sailed from Havre de Grace , with three ships fitted out by the king to relieve the colony left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , he determined to establish himself at the river May . He there selected a spot for a town , on the south side of the river , two leagues from the sea , and erected a fort , // which he called Carolina . Some persons have supposed that the seat of this establishment was much farther towards the north , and have traced to it the origin of the name of the two Carolinas . Some have even assigned it a situation as far north as Albemarle Sound , and identified the river May with the Roanoke . This is manifestly erroneous ; and although there is a good deal of confusion and inaccuracy in all the early , as well as later accounts of this part of the country , there appears to be abundant reason for supposing that the river May of Ribault , was no other than the St John 's . One of the most important early historical documents of this part of the coun- try is the narrative of Le Moyne , * preserved by De Bry , which is accompanied by forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This map , though very imperfect , is in some particulars more correct than those published nearly a liundred years later . Laudcrnniere maintained a friendly intercourse with several native chiefs , and made preparation for an expedition to the Apalachy mountains , where he hoped to find an abundant supply of the precious metals . But a serious disaffection and mutiny arose in his own colony , and he was seized and put in chains . A part of the conspirators afterwards took the vessels which remained in Florida , and went on a piratical cruise in the gulf of Mexico , in consequence of which Laudonniere regained his liberty , and the command of the remaining portion of the emigrants . But their merchandise for trade with the Indians being exhausted , and supplies of provisions in consequence failing , they resolved on abandoning their post . Their distress was increased by a remarkable scarcity of game , and an entire failure of the fish in the river . They built two vessels , in which they determined to attempt a voyage to France , but after they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt Hawkins , an Englishman , with four vessels , came into the mouth of the river in pursuit of water . The French commander purchased of him one of his ships and a stock of provisions . Soon after this occurrence Ribault , also with seven ships from France , having on board a powerful reinforcement of troops and settlers , appearQd at the mouth of the river . Ifiatoria Luctuo&amp;a Expeditionis Gallorum in Floridam , published by De Bry , 1591 , subjoined also to the Latin translation of Benzone , published f.y Vignon , 157&amp; // Accounts had been sent to France of the conduct of Lan-. donniere , which led the government to suspect his fidelity . It was on this account that they sent out under Ribault so strong an armament . A great number of gentlemen and ohcers , who had been left by the recent peace out of employ , joined the expedition . Ribault on his arrival was much surprised at the proofs of Laudonniere 's fidelity , and he offered to leave him in command of the fort ; but the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure was delayed by the exertions for the repair of the fort , and in the mean time six Spanish vessels under the command of Don Pedro Menendez , arrived and anchored at the mouth of the river . Philip II . had made to Menendez a grant of Florida , with extensive privileges and prerogatives , on condition that he would make an accurate chart of the coast , a condition which he never performed ; and he now arrived with eight hundred men to take possession of his province , and to drive out the heretics , who had lately planted themselves in the country . He had left Cadiz with a much larger force , which with the reinforcements received at the Canary Islands , amounted to twenty six hundred men . His fleet , however , had been scattered by a storm , and he arrived on the coast of Florida with but six ships . He passed by the river of Dauphins , which he named St Augustine , from the festival of the day when he discovered it . Four of the ships of Ribault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river May , and were near being taken by him , but they escaped , and he returned to St Augustine . The four French ships returned to their anchorage , and , after consultation , Ribault determined to embark his troops and to proceed immediately to attack his enemy . In a few days they sailed from the river , leaving Laudonniere , and all the women and children , with the sick and disabled , and not more than twenty able bodied men in the fort . Ribault soon came in sight of the Spanish ships , at anchor before St Augustine , where Menendez had begun to build a fort . This was the first establishment of the city of St Augustine . Ribault was on the point of making an attack , when suddenly a violent wind arose , and he was obliged to abandon his prey , at the moment when he thought it in his power . He stood out to sea , as far as possible , but the storm became so violent , that after being forced a great distance towards the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed to pieces . The inert // succeeded in escaping to the shore with the loss of but a single individual . They were however naked , and without arms or provisions . Ribault immediately resolved on attempting to reach fort Caroline by land , distant about fifty miles . In performing this journey , over a country not inhabited even by savages , and full of swamps and creeks , they endured the greatest hardships . Having , as they thought , nearly overcome all difficulties , and arrived in the vicinity of the fort , they stopped , and sent forward a number of men to reconnoitre the fort , and see whether the feeble party left there still retained possession of it . On approaching their citadel , they were astonished to find the Spanish flag flying upon it . This news being reported to the famished army , they were filled with horror and dismay . They knew the cruel disposition of the Spaniards , who regarded them as heretics and outlaws , and they were already perishing from fatigue and famine . The feeble garrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his bed by sickness , had remained for several days after the departure of their fleet in a state of the greatest anxiety . They were aware of the danger to which the ships had been exposed from the storm , and knew also that they were themselves in their ruined fort liable every moment to be attacked by the Spaniards , who might approach them by land . Several days passed without any news of the fate of their companions . On a certain morning , at sunrise , after the feeble guard , who had kept watch through the night , worn out with fatigue , had retired to rest , the whole garrison being quiet in their beds , three hundred Spaniards rushed from three different quarters into the fort , and began an indiscriminate slaughter of every one they met . A few individuals , among whom was the commander of the fort , made their escape , and after various disasters arrived in France . The rest , men , women , and children , were cruelly put to death . Such was the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort , after his toilsome journey , and he resolved on sending a flag of truce to the Spanish commander . His messengers were met by a number of Spaniards , who came out to them in a boat . They inquired after the French who had been left in the fort . The Spaniards answered that Menendez , a man of great kindness and humanity , had put them into a ship furrushed with every thing necessary , and sent them back to // France , and that he was willing to treat Ribault and his followers in the same generous manner . An officer was afterwards sent to the Spanish commander , with the offer of a surrender , on condition that their lives should be spared , and they should be sent to France . Menendez swore in the most solemn manner to observe these conditions , but as soon as the prisoners were brought across the river , they had their hands bound behind them , and they were all put to death . One soldier only escaped . The Spanish commander declared that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole number of the French colony who thus perished exceeded nine hundred persons . The French and Spanish nations in the mean time were at peace , and no measures were taken by the king of France to avenge this atrocious outrage . But De Gourgues , a French nobleman , determined at his own risk to punish this act of cruelty and the insult offered to his nation . He fitted out at his own expense , three ships with eighty sailors , and a hundred and fifty soldiers , and sailed in August , 1567 , for Florida . He arrived after a long voyage , at the mouth of the river May , and was saluted by the Spaniards , who mistook him for some one of their own nation . To confirm them in their error he returned the salute , and passed on to the St Mary 's , where he landed . He there assembled a body of the natives , who were strongly attached to the French , and hostile to the Span* iard , and enjoining on them the strictest secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards had rebuilt fort Carolina , changing the name of it to St Matthe0 , and constructed two other forts nearer the sea . The three were garrisoned by four hundred men . The French and Indians entered the forts by surprise , killed a great number of men in the assault , and took all the rest and hung them on the nearest trees , saying , they did not hang them as Spaniards , but as traitors , murderers , and robbers . De Gourgues , having accomplished his object , destroyed the fortifications on the river May , and returned to France . The French made no further attempt to establish them*elves in Florida . Purchas , after briefly recapitulating the early history of this ill-fated territory , says , Thus bath Florida been first courted by the English , wooed by the Spanish , almost wonne by the French , and yet remains a rich and beautiful virgin , waiting until her neighbour Virginia , bestow on // her an English bridegroome , who as making the first love , may lay the justest challenge unto her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Philip IL to Menendez extended from Newfoundland on the north to the river of Palms , on the west side of the gulf of Mexico , in latitude 25* , or according to other accounts 220 , probably the Rio del Tigre or the Santander , or perhaps the Tampico . In this broad extent it was sometimes taken by the Spanish writers , according to De Laet , as late as 1633 . But according to the same writer , what was then properly called Florida , was bounded on the west by New Spain , and on the north by Virginia , afterwards Carolina . In the drnerique of Sanson , of Abberville , the celebrated French geographer , it is described as follows . Florida is situated between New France and New Spain , and extends from the river of Palms , which bounds the province of Panuco in New Spain , to the river Jordan , which separates it from Virginia , which I call New France . ' The map of Sanson conforms with this description . The Spaniards had then two settlements on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St John 's , and none on the gulf of Mexico . The country north of the St John 's remaining unoccupied , king Charles II . of England , in 1663 , made a grant to the Earl of Clarendon and others of all the tract of country extending from Virginia on the north , to the river San Mattheo on the south , and extending west in a direct line to the South Seas . Afterwards , March 24 , 1667 , a new charter was granted , by which the boundaries were made to extend from 290 to 36* , north latitude , and from these points westward by parallel lines to the Pacific ocean . Either boundary would embrace within it the whole of what has been since named West Florida ; the whole of that colony lying north of the latitude of the mouth of San Mattheo , or St John 's river . The English did not by virtue of this grant make any permanent settlements on the Gulf of Mexico , but they formed establishments there for trade with the Indians . Settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , and extended to other points on the coast . The conflicting claims of the Spaniards in Florida , and the English in Carolina , produced a state of hostility which lasted many years , and the controversy was maintained , not only between the colonists , but between the mother countries . // By the seventh article of the treaty concluded between Great Bfitain and Spain , as early as the year 1670 , it was stipulated that the king of Great Britain and his subjects should remain in possession of what they then possessed in the West Indies and America . This was an acknowledgment of an important principle , which was also recognized in several subsequent treaties , but the difficulty was to apply it . It was finally agreed by the treaty of Seville , in 1729 , that commissioners should be appointed by the courts of England and Spain , to settle their mutual pretensions in relation to trade , and boundaries in America . Commissioners were appointed , and met at Madrid , but they did not bring their conferences to a successful termination. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded , by which it was agreed that immediately after the signing of the convention , two ministers plenipotentiaries , should be named by the parties respectively , to meet at Madrid within the space of six weeks from the date of the exchange of ratifications , and to regulate the pretensions of the two crowns in relation to trade and navigation , and to the limits of Florida and Carolina . In the mean time , orders were to be immediately given by both parties , that no new posts should be taken on the frontier , and that the fortifications should not be increased . Mr Jefferson in a report made by him when Secretary of State , intended to be communicated by way of instruction to the commissioners of the United States in Spain , dated March 18 , 1792 , alluding to the convention at the Pardo , says , The convention is to be found in the collections of treaties ; but the proceedings of the plenipoteutiaries are unknown here . Qu . If it was on that occasion that the southern boundary of Carolina was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , further north to the St Mary 's , or was it the proclamation of 1763 which first removed this boundary ? If the commissioners can procure in Spain , a copy of whatever was agreed on in consequence of the convention of the Pardo , it is a desirable state paper here . ' The convention of Pardo gave great dissatisfaction in England , and it was the subject of much discussion in parliament . The excitement was so great that the ministry were obliged a few months after to issue letters of marque against Spain , and although the commissioners were appointed under the Hist . Abr4 , e6 des Trait*s , ii . 2S2. // convention , and met at Madrid , it is evident from the manifesto of the king of Spain , issued in August following , and from the reasons given by him for not paying the sum of money stipulated in the convention , that nothing was done in relation to the settlement of limits. * This is also apparent from the remarkable treaty of perpetual alliance , between the courts of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memorable Family Compact formed nearly twenty years later . The tenth article of this treaty is as fol-* lows : as the safety of Florida can not be complete , while the new colony of Georgia is suffered to subsist , the establishnient of which the English have not been able to the present moment to justify by any good title , their said majesties xviii take measures to compel the English to destroy this new colony as well as every other fort which they shall build , in the territory of his most Catholic Majesty in America , and to restore the countries or places belonging to Spain , which the English already occupy or shall occupy during the war . ' This war lasted until the peace of Aix la Chapelle , and that peace , instead of quieting the claims of England , placed every thing in relation to territories in America on the footing , on which they were or ought to be , ' before the war . This stipulation renewed the controversy , and it was not terminated until the peace of 1763 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain . The king of Great Britain was thus enabled to settle the northern boundary of Florida at will , and it was done by letters patent , issued under the great seal . Having traced thus far the history of the northern boundary , we must go back to an earlier period to examine the principles on which depend the true limits on the west , between Florida and Louisiana . Spain , as before stated , extended her claim to the river of Palms , but for a long period she took no actual possession of the western part of this extensive territory . The French first discovered the river Mississippi by approaching it from Canada through some of its tributary streams , and as early as 1682 had traversed nearly its whole course . In 1684 , an expedition was fitted out from France , to explore the mouth of the Mississippi , and to make a settle * See these documents in the Parliamentary Debates , 1739. f First published by Flassan . Dip . Francaise , 2d Edit . V. 172. // ment upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and founded their colony on the bay of St Bernards , at the mouth of the Colorado , and called it St Louis . This establishment was soon after broken up , and nearly all the settlers perished . In 1699 Mr D'Ibervilie was sent to explore and settle the mouth of the Mississippi . He stopped at Pensacola , where three hundred Spaniards had three years before formed a settlement . He entered the Mississippi , and named the country Louisiana . He formed a settlement at Dauphine isn A , xxhich subsisted and was maintained for the purpose ci giving a nominal possession to the territory , for a number of years . In 1712 , the king of France granted to the sicur Anthony Crozat all the lands possessed by him , bounded by New Mexico and Carolina , including the isle Dauphine , and the river Mississippi from the edge of the sea as far as the IlluiGis , together with the Missouri and Wabash , and all the countries and territories , and the rivers which fall directly or indirectly into that part of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grant , and the colony was transferred to the company of the Indies . About this time New Orleans was settled . The establishment at Dauphine island was transferred to Biloxi . In 1722 , the head quarters were trans-. ferred from Biloxi to New Orleans , and the settlement at th' former place was abandoned ; a few years afterwards , the colony was again relinquished to the crown of France . About the same time that Iberville sailed from Rochfort for the Mississippi , three ships sailed from England , by order of king William , for the same destination , to take possession of the country for the crown of England . He had conceived the design of settling upon it a colony of French protestants . One of these ships entered the river . The following year an English corvette of twelve guns , was met in the river by the French commander , 20 leagues from its mouth , and ordered to withdraw . The English commander obeyed the order , threatening to return with a stronger force . The part of the river where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Turn to this day . The English made no permanent settlement in this country , though they continued to claim it as their territory . Coxe , in his description of Carolina , published in 1722 , argues at some length in support of their right to the country . He says that the French had . lately made a settlement called Fort Louis , near the mouth of // the Mobile , which is the usual residence of the governor of Louisiana . In this fort were some companies of soldiers , and from them were sent various detachments to secure the several stations in the interior among the Indians . Between this river and the Mississippi the English had resided peaceably for several years , and carried on a considerable trade , till about the year 1715 , when in consequence of the intrigues of the French , they were either murdered or obliged to retire . The Fiench had in consequence secured to themselves a profitable trade through an extent of five hundred miles of country , of which the English had been before sole masters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to the proprietors of Carolina , as well as by that of king Louis to Crozat , or Pie West india company , and the question which had the best right to grant the patent , or what parties had by possession acquired the strongest claim to the country in dispute , was a proper subject of adjustment by negotiation . The question of limits between the American colonies in fact made a subject of discussion at almost every negotiation between the maritime powers , for a long course of years , but these negotiations terminated without any definitive settlement , and in the mean time the colonies were left in a state of perpetual hostility . By the fifth article of the treaty of Utrecht , made in 1713 , it was provided , that commissioners should be appointed to determine the boundaries between Hudson 's bay and the places belonging to France , and it was also provided , that the same commissioners should likewise regulate the boundaries between the French and British colonies in those countries . ' It does not appear that there were any commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , under this treaty. * The fifth article of the peace of Aix la Chapelle adopted the status ante 6ellum , in relation to the American colonies , and directed that ' every thing should be restored to the state in which it was , or ought to be , before the war . ' This expression , ' says the author of the Diplc.nnatie Francaise , became ; from its ambiguity , the foundation of discussions relating to the boundaries of Acadia ; and Canada , being bounde4 on the east by the river Mississippi , was a new subject of liti // gation , because the English and the French both claimed a right to the lands situated between this river and the Apalachian mountains . ' After giving a history of the unsuccessful negotiation on this subject , which is familiar to every one conversant with the history of this period , the same author says , that France committed a double fault , in not settling the question of boundaries at the peace of Aix la Chapelle , and in not having afterwards repaired this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still greater losses . As to the merits of the question in relation to boundaries , the commissioners could never agree ; and the boundaries had been always so badly defined , that it is difficult to say on which side was the right. ** While the mother countries were in a state of profound peace , and these negotiations for the settlement of disputes relating to the colonies were going on in Europe , open hostilities began between the French and English colonies in this country . The latter became seriously alarmed at the extravagant pretensions of the French , and their design , which now became apparent , of uniting their settlements in Louisiana with those in Canada , by a string of military posts . While Great Britain , ' says Chief Justice Marshall , in his Life of Washington , claimed an indefinite extent to the west , in consequence of her possession of the sea-coast , and as appertaining thereto , France insisted on confining her to the eastern side of the Apalachian or Alleghany mountains , and claimed the whole country whose waters run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first discoverer of that river . The delightful region between the summit of those mountains and the Mississippi was the object for which these two powerful nations contended ; and it soon became apparent that the sword alone could decide the contest . ' A Virginian regiment which was sent , under the command of Col. Washington , to protect a grant made to the Ohio company , was attacked by the French and Indians in 175*3 . An active campaign was opened in 175F* , and the same year the memorable defeat of Gen. Braddock took place . Yet war was not declared until the following year . It was thus , ' says the French author , whom we have before quoted , while in Europe overtures of conciliation were mak. * mg , war broke out in America , kindled by the ambition of the // English , according to the court of Versailles ; and according to that of London , by the aggression of the French , who , before any act of hostility , had sought to dislodge the English from a post situated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sway over the whole country watered by the Ohio and Mississi*pi. ' * In 1756 war was openly declared by Great Britain . After five years of actual hostilities , in the course of which Great Britain , with the assistance of her colonies , had conquered Canada , negotiations were opened for peace . France proposed to cede and guaranty Canada to England on four conditions ; one of which was , that the limits of Canada on the side of Louisiana , should be immediately and clearly fixed , as well as those of Louisiana and Virginia , in such a manner , that after the conclusion of the treaty of peace , there should be no difficulties between the two nations , upon the interpretation of the limits in relation to Louisiana , either on the side of Canada or on the side of the other English possessions . ' t France made a more specific proposition in relation to the limits of Louisiana , in which she proposed that the Indian nations between Louisiana and the English colonies should be considered neutral , but under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In regard to fixing the limits of Louisiana , on the side of Canada or the English possessions situated upon the Ohio , and also on the side of Virginia , it can never be admitted that all which is not Canada shall belong to Louisiana , nor that the bounds of the last mentioned province shall extend to the confines of Virginia , or of the British possessions on the banks of the Ohio . The nations and countries which lie between , and which form the true barrier between the said provinces , can not on any consideration be directly , or by necessary consequence , added to France by allowing them to be admitted , as included in the desqription of the limits of Louisiana . ' t The French government *treplied to this note in the following terms . France has not affirmed that all that does not belong to Canada belongs to *ouisiana , but demands that all the intermediate nations be corfsidered as neutral , independent on the sovereignty of both crowns , and a barrier between them.X* It was again proposed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 30. j Mably , Droit public , iii . 271. * Note to Mr Bussy , July 29 , 1761. * Memoire Historicjue stir la negotiation par le Duo de Choiseul. // turn of France , that the boundaries of Louisiana should be regulated upon a map , in such manner that they might be particularly delineated before the signature of the treaty , and Mr Bussy was ordered to agree to the limits according to the English map . Mr Pitt agreed to the ultimatum of France , with certain exceptions , the first of which was as follows . The limits of Louisiana , as drawn in a note from Mr Bussy to Mr Pitt , dated August 18th , can not be admitted , because they in one part include vast countries which Vaudreuil yielded to England , under the description of Canada , and in another , extensive countries and numerous nations , who have been always reputed to be under the protection of England . ' France made another proposition , containing a modification of her ultimatum relative to Louisiana , but the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This whole negotiation was conducted upon the express admission that the boundary of Louisiana was unsettled , and was to be fixed by treaty between the conflicting claimants . There is not a diplomatic note , or an official document of any de .. scription extant , that we have been able to find , in which it is pretended that there was any settled boundary to that province , previous to the period of which we have been speaking . The French claimed an extensive tract of country on this side the Mississippi , extending from the gulf of Mexico to the lakes , but it was uniformly regarded as a disputed , as well as an indefinite claim . Accordingly we find in all the maps published before the year 1763 , a great variety in the extent which is given to the province of Louisiana . If France had an undisputed claim on the east of the Mississippi below 310 N. lati .. tude , she had also in 320 and 360 . Most of the old French maps , indeed , carry Louisiana much farther eastwardly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida-some of them for instance as far as Flint river . We have not observed any map of any considerable note , that makes the Perdido the boundary between Louisiana and Florida . In the chart of the coasts of Louisiana and Florida , made at the depot of maps , plans , &amp;c. of the marine , by order of the duke de Choiseul , ' the French prime minister , underwhose direction the negotiation we have spoken of was carried on , although the boundary is not definitely laid down , Florida extends beyond the Perdido , and as far as the Mobile . We do not find the slightest authority , for assuming the Perdido as the boundary on the side of FloriArew Series , No. 7. 11 // Florida . da , except that it is so marked in some of the inferior French maps , for no better reason probably than that it was the nearest river to Pensacola , an acknowledged Spanish post . In an atlas now before us , published at Amsterdam in 1757 , Carolina extends to the Mississippi , from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch language , Georgia . extends to the mouth of the Mississippi . Of the maps published from 1719 to 1764 much the greater number do not fix any definite eastern boundary to Louisiana , except those which bring it to the Mississippi . This we mention , not to prove that the Mississippi was the proper boundary , but to show that the limit was considered as a subject which was unsettled , and to be determined by negotiation . Such a negotiation was begun , as we have shown , in 1761 , and proved fruitless . It was renewed , however , the following year , with better success . The propositions already entertained were assumed as the basis of the new negotiation . We have not the particular history of the discussions then held in relation to this question , but we have the result of them in the sixth article of the preliminary treaty of peace , signed November 3d , 1762 , and the seventh article of the definitive treaty , signed at Paris , February 10th , 1763 , viz. In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove forever every subject of dispute in relation to the limits of the British and French territories on the continent of America , it is agreed for the future , that the confines between the states of his Britannic majesty and those of his most christian majesty , in that part of the world , shall be irrevocably fixed by a line drawn through the middle of the river Mississippi , from its source to the river Iberville , and thence by a line drawn through the middle of this river , and the lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain to the sea ; and to this end the most christian king cedes in full property and guaranties to his Britannic majesty , the river and port of Mobile , and all that he possesses or should possess on the left side of the river Mississippi , with the exception of the city of New Orleans , and the island on which it is situated , which shall remain to France . ' This was the first settlement of the disputed boundary ; and the eastern bank of the Mississippi was by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , for the lEnglish had made no conquests in that quarter , but is a // country to which the English had before the war a rightful claim , and that not as a part of Louisiana , but as a part of Virginia , the Carolinas , and Georgia , in the patents of which colonies it was all included , it is by virtue of charters granted long before the date of this treaty , that the claims of those colonies , since become independent states , have been extended to the Mississippi . If those claims were not well founded , how could these states , in ceding their western territories to the United States , impose burdensome conditions , as the price for which they relinquished their title ? By what right did the state of Georgia in 1802 , in ceding to the United States the lands lying between the Chatahouchee and Mississippi rivers , demand in consideration of this cession , one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in money , besides other considerations , which have already cost the government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia , granted by the king of Great Britain before the treaty of 1763 , did not extend to the Mississippi ? It can not be contended that one rule of construction is to be adopted in relation to that part of the boundary line of Louisiana , which divides the province from the United States , and another in relation to that part which divides it from Florida . If the treaty of 1763 was the acknowledgment of a previously existing right in Great Britain , to the western territories of Virginia , Carolina , and Georgia , it was a like acknowledgment of her right to Florida westward of the Mobile . There is not a document extant , published before the late cession of Louisiana , which makes any distinction in this respect . To admit , therefore , that France ever lawfully possessed an inch of territory east of the line drawn by the treaty of 1763 , is to annihilate the claims of Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia beyond the mountains , under their charters granted before the date of that treaty . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military post at Mobile in Florida , but of forts Tombeckby and Thoulouse , each more than a hundred miles north of the Florida line ; and of several other posts farther north . Not only the history of the negotiation , and the terms of the treaty itself , but the uniform language of the historians of this period , show that this transaction was not regarded as a cession of a part of Louisiana , but as a definition of the boundaries of that colony , as possessed by France . // By a secret treaty between the courts of Versailles and Madrid , signed on the same day with the preliminary treaty of peace , November 3d , 1762 , and which has never been published , Louisiana and the city of New Orleans were ceded to Spain . The French inhabitants of Louisiana , however , had no knowledge of this cession until April 21st , 1764. * They protested earnestly against the transfer , and the Spaniards did not take possession of the colony until August 18th , 1769 . The king of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director general and commandant of Louisiana , says , that by a special act , done at Fontainbleau , November 3d , 1762 , he has ceded to the king of Spain in full property , purely and simply , and without any exceptions , the whole country known by the name of Louisiana , together with New Orleans , and the island in which said city is situated . ' t This letter furnishes additional proof , if any can be supposed to be necessary , that France , in acknowledging the Mississippi as the boundary , did not consider that act a cession of a part of Louisiana to Great Britain , but an admission that the whole country known by the name of Louisiana , as rightfully possessed by France , was situated on the west of that river . The king of Spain who was a party to the treaty of Paris of 1763 , by the twentieth article , ceded to Great Britain ; Florida and all that Spain possessed on the continent east of the Mississippi . In consequence of this treaty , the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued his proclamation , declar. ing that he had , by letters patent under the great seal , erected within the countries ceded and confirmed to him by the treaty , four distinct and separate governments , viz. Quebec , East Florida , West Florida , and Grenada . East Florida was bounded west by the gulf of Mexico and the Apalachicola river ; north by a line drawn from the mouth of Flint river , to the source of the St Mary 's , and by the course of that river to the ocean ; east and south by the Atlantic ocean and the gulf of Florida , including all islands within six leagues of the sea coast . These are the precise boundaries which this province retains to this day . West Florida was bounded south by the gulf of Mexico , including the islands within six leagues of the coast ; west by lakes Ponchartrain and Maurepas , and the Histoire Abrt*g*e des Trait*s de 1'aix. j EUi*ott 's Journal ; also Laws of the United States , edition of 1814 , i. // Mississippi ; north by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and east by the Chatahouchee and Apalachicola rivers . The northern boundary was afterwards extended to a line drawn from the mouth of the Yazoo river due east to the Chatahouchee , that the colony might include the settlements at Natchez . The letters patent for an establishment of these governments authorized the governors , as soon as the circumstances of the colonies would admit , to call general assemblies , who with the governor and council should have power to make laws for the good government of the colonies , under the regulations and restrictions used in the other colonies . The two colonies thus constituted remained under the administration of British governors , until West Florida was conquered by the Spanish arms in 1779 and 1780 , and that colony with East Florida was relinquished by treaty . By the treaty of peace between Great Britain , France and Spain , the former ceded and guarantied to Spain , in full property , both East and West Florida . The treaty between Great Britain and the United States , however , made on the same day , established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern boundary of West Florida , on a line drawn along the thirty-first parallel of latitude , from the Mississippi to the Chatahouchee . Spain remained in possession of West Florida with the limits which had been given to it under the British government , until the settlement of the boundary line between the United States and Florida in the year 1797 . It was then with difficulty that the Spanish commandant at Natchez was induced to surrender that post to the officer of the United States* Spain in the mean time continued to govern West Florida , including Natchez , and the other settlements on the left bank of the Mississippi as a distinct colony . The governor at Natchez , however , was subordinate to the governor general at New Orleans , who had the title of Commandant General of Louisiana , West Florida , &amp;c . ' October 27th , 1795 , a treaty of friendship , limits , and navigation was concluded between the United States and Spain . By this treaty it is agreed that the boundary between the United States and the colony of Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that the southern boun-* dary of the United States , which divides their territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida , shall be designated by a line , beginning on . the river Mississippi at the northernmost // part of the thirty-first degree of latitude . ' This shows that it was still understood by the governments of Spain and the United States , that the colony of West Florida extended to the Mississippi . By another article of the treaty it is agreed , in consequence of the stipulation relative to the boundary , that the citizens of the United States shall have permission to deposite their merchandise and effects at New Orleans , or at some other equivalent establishment on the bank of the Mississippi . It is agreed by the same treaty , that the navigation of the Mississippi in its whole breadth shall be free to subjects of Spain , and citizens of the United States . On the first of October 1800 , by a treaty no part of which except the article here cited has been published , made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul of the French republic , it was agreed as follows ; his catholic majesty promises and engages on his part to retrocede to the French republic , six months after the full and entire execution of the conditions and stipulations herein relative to his royal highness the Duke of Parma , the colony or province of Louisiana with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain , and that it had when France possessed it ; and such as it ought to be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other states . ' Before possession of this colony was actually given to France , by virtue of this retrocession , the treaty was made between France and the United States , dated at Paris , April 30th , 1803 , by which the province . of Louisiana was ceded to the United States , with all its right and appurtenances , as fully and in the same manner as they have been acquired by the French republic , in virtue of the abovementioned treaty . ' The government of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have considered themselves not bound by the definition of the limits of Louisiana in the treaty of 1763 ; but on the ground that when France formerly possessed that province , it extended to the river Perdido , they have considered that part of West Florida lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido as a part of Louisiana , and have accordingly , by virtue of the Louisiana treaty , taken possession of that country , and annexed to it the states of Mississippi and Alabama . Upon the construction of the passage just cited , of the treaty of Ildephonso , depends the extent of the territory ac // quired by the United States , under the treaty of 1803 ; but that construction can be settled only by reference to the history of the previous transactions . We have , therefore , given* a brief narrative of the material facts which have a bearing upon the question . If the view of facts which we have given be correct , and we find no authority for any different view1 the language of the treaty now quoted admits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his catholic majesty promises to cede back to the French republic the colony or province of Louisiana , with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain , and that it had when ceded to her by France ; subject , however , to such engagements as have been since entered into in relation to it , between Spain and other states . ' The territory ceded , as described in the treaty is , 1st , the colony or province of Louisiana . ' The country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido did not at the time when the treaty was made constitute a part of Louisiana , but formed an important part of another province , known both officially and in historical and geographical works , and in common language , in Spain , France , and America , under the name of West Florida . 2d . It is Louisiana with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain , ' and consequently bounded on the east by the rivers Mississippi , and Iberville , and the lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with the same extent that it had when France possessed it . ' What more obvious meaning can be given to this clause , than that it was to be ceded back with the same extent that it had when France ceded it ? But grant that this construction will admit of doubt , it has been seen that France never possessed , by a clear title , any thing east of the Mississippi ; that what she claimed beyond this river always was disputed , and when the boundary was settled , the whole east bank of the river was given to her adversary , expressly on the ground of a previous right , and not as a cession of a purchased or conquered country ; that France possessed Louisiana , actually bounded by the Mississippi , from the year 1763 to 1769 ; and finally that the king of France , when he informed the governor of Louisiana of the cession to Spain , told him that he had ceded without any exceptions the whole country known by the name of Louisiana . ' It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the extent that it had xvhea France posses6ed it , ' are of naore exten // sive import than the words of the king of France immediately after the treaty of 1763 , the whole country known by the name of Louisiana , without any exceptions ; ' yet it is perfectly well known that the latter description was meant to apply only to Louisiana , as it was bounded east by the Mississippi and the Iberville . The conclusion is irresistible , that this part of the description Was not intended to enlarge the actual province of Louisiana . 4th . It is ceded back to France such as it ought to be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other states . ' And what ought it to be subsequently to the treaties alluded to ? Had Spain made any treaties by which she engaged to enlarge the boundaries of Louisiana ? No ; but she had entered into a treaty with Great Britain by which she had acquired East and West Florida , and it is contended that this is the treaty alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what West Florida obtained from Great Britain *by the name of West Florida , and retained by the name of West Florida , ought to become a part of Louisiana , when there is no engagement in that treaty , or in any other document , to annex it to Louisiana ? But on the other hand Spain bad entered into a treaty with another power , viz , with the United States , restraining the limits of Louisiana , and subjecting that province to certain territorial engagements . It is these engagements which France ought to have assumed in obtaining the retrocession of Louisiana , and it is these which we contend these words of the treaty actually embrace . By virtue of this clause , France received Louisiana subject to the stipulations of the treaty of 1795 , not only in relation to the eastern boundary , but in relation to the right of deposit , and the navigation of the Mississippi . We avoid , for various reasons , going into any examination of the negotiations for the cession of Louisiana and Florida , between France and Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of the negotiations between the United States and Spain in relation to the disputed boundary . But be fore closing what we have to say on this topic , we will quote a passage from a state paper of very high authority , in support of the interpretation which we have given of the Louisiana treaty . In the year 1804 , Mr Monroe , then our minister plenipotentiary to the court of Spain , while on his way to Madrid , with instructions to open a negotiation for the settlement of the disputed boundary , and also for the purchase // of Florida , and Mr Livingston , our minister plenipotentiary in France , addressed letters to Mr Talleyrand , soliciting of the emperor of France , at that time on the most friendly terms with this country , his good offices with the king of Spain , in accomplishing the objects of the negotiation . They also laid before Mr Talleyrand the translation of a memoir on the limits of Louisiana , which had been sent to them by the Secretary of State . The application of Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated December 21st , 1804 , from which the following passage is extracted . Among the observations made on this subject by Messrs Livingston and Monroe , his imperial majesty has been obliged to give particular attention to those bearing on the discussions , of which the object is peculiarly interesting to the French government . He has perceived , that he could not be a stranger to the examination of these discussions , since they grow out of the treaty by which France has ceded Louisiana to the United States , and his majesty has thought that an explanation , made with that fidelity which characterizes him , on the eastern boundaries of the ceded territory , would put an end to the differences to which the cession has given rise . France , in giving up Louisiana to the United States , transferred to them all the right over that colony which she had acquired from Spain . She could not , nor did she wish to cede any other , and that no room might be left for doubt in this respect , she repeated in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literal expressions of the treaty of St Ildephonso , by which she had acquired that colony two years before . Now it was stipulated in her treaty of the year 1801 , that the acquisition ot Louisiana by France was a retrocession ; that is to say , that Spain restored to France what she had received from her in 1762 . At that period , she had received the territory bounded on the east by the Mississippi , the river Iberville , the lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain . The same day France ceded to England , by the preliminaries of peace , all the territory to the east* ward . Of this , Spain had received no part , and could , therefore , give back none to France . All the territory lying to the eastward of the Mississippi and the river Iberville , and south of the thirty-second degree of north latitude , bears the name of Florida . It has been constantly designated in that way , during the time that Spain held it ; it bears the same name in the treaty of limits between Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Livingston , of a later date than the treaty of retrocession , in which the name of Leulsiana is . N'eu* Series , No. 7. 12 // given to the territory on the west side of the Mississippi ; of Flarida , to that on the east side of it . According to this designation , thus consecrated by time , and even prior to the period when Spain began to possess the whole territory between the 31st degree , the Mississippi and the sea , this country ought , in good faith and justice , to be distinguished from Louisiana . Your excellency knows , that before the preliminaries of 176* , confirmed by the treaty of 1763 , the French possessions , situated near the Mississippi , extended as far from the east of this river towards the Ohio and the Illinois , as in the quarters of the Mobile ; and you must think it as unnatural , after all the changes of sovereignty which that part of America has undergone , to give the name of Louisiana to the district of Mobile , as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , which formerly belonged to France . These observations , sir , will be sufficient to dispel every kind of doubt with regard to the extent of the retrocession made by Spain to France , in the month of Vendemaire , An . ix . It was under this impression that the French and Spanish plenipotentiaries negotiated , and it was under this impression that I have since had occasion to give the necessary explanations when a project was formed to take possession of it . I have laid before his imperial majesty the negotiations of Madrid , which preceded the treaty of 1801 , and his majesty is convinced , that dLlring the whole course of these negotiations the Spanish government has constantly refused to cede any part of the Floridas , even from the Mississippi to the Mobile . His imperial majesty has , moreover , authorized me to declare to you , that at the beginning of the year xi , General Beurnonville was charged to open a new negotiation with Spain for the acquisition of the Floridas . This project , which has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France had not acquired by the treaty , retroceding Louisiana , the country east of the Mississippi . There are other circumstances tending farther to illustrate the view which we have taken of this topic , which we forbear to enumerate ; having already protracted this part of our article to a much greater length than we had intended . We have thought the question , notwithstanding the*settlement of the controversy between our government and that of Spain , still deserving of great consideration . It will probably become a question of considerable interest in a pecuniary view , to many of our citizens , as it is already to Spanish claimants of lands in the debatable territory . By the Spanish treaty , the // amount of claims on Spain for which our citizens get an indemnity , is charged with interest upon the sales of lands in Florida . As there is little probability that the proceeds of sales of lands in Florida will ever be sufficient to cover the annual interest of the stock proposed to be created , it may be of some consequence to the holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annexed to the states of Mississippi and Alabama should be considered as included in the pledge of lands for its redemption , and for the payment of the interest . XVe return after this long digression , to complete the brief sketch which we have undertaken to give of the principal events in the history of Florida . Menendez , the Spanish governor , rebuilt the fort of St Mattheo , after it was destroyed by De Gourgues , and continued for some time in the command of that place , and of St Augustine . There was less of eclat however in the sequel of his administration , than in its commencement . We have already mentioned that he never fulfilled the condition of his appointment , viz , that he should furnish an accurate chart of the coast of Florida . No survey of this coast was ever made by the Spaniards , though they have been in possession of it for the space of two centuries . A variety of nautical observations were made by Gonzales Carranza , about the year 1718 , but they remained in manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1755 , Thomas Lopez and Juan de la Cruz , published a marine chart of the gulf of Mexico , and the isles of America , but the coast of Florida is very inaccurately laid down upon it . After Florida came into the possession of Great Britain , the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty , sent out Mr George Gauld to make a thorough survey of the whole coast . He was employed in surveying the coasts and harbours of West Florida , and the west coast of East Florida from the summer of 1764 , to the year 1781 , when he was made prisoner by the Spaniards , in their invasion of Florida . These surveys were not published until the year 1790 , after the death of Mr Gauld. * Mr Ellicott , speaking of the navigation of this coast , says , Mr Gauld 's surveys of the Dry Tortugas and the Florida reef and keys , easterly to Key Largo , made by direction of the Board of Admiralty of Great Britain , may justly be considered as one of the most valuable works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorimer 's pamphlet . tJournal , p. 254. // mains to be done by our own government in improving the charts of this dangerous coast . It does not appear precisely at what time Menendez left his government of Florida , but we find him mentioned by Grotius , as unsuccessfully employed in 1575 in another service , and as infamous among his own countrymen for his treachery and cruelty in Florida . In consequence of his failure in the expedition here alluded to , he put an end to his own life . His nephexv , Don Pedro Menendez Marquez , the same person who was admiral of his fleet , on his first Florida expedition , succeeded him as governor of the province , and we find him in the office in the year 1586 . This shows the inaccuracy of Mr Brackenridg&amp;s statement , that about the time of the ex* pedition of De Gourgues , St Augustine and all Florida were abandoned by the Spaniards. * In the year last named , Sir Francis Drake returning with his fleet to England , after a successful cruise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal town of St Jago , one of the Cape de Verd islands , levied a contribution of 25,000 ducats on the town of St Domingo , and a sum of 110,000 ducats on Carthagena , after having burned a part of the town ; - coasting along the eastern shore of Florida , accidentally discovered a beacon , which he thought indicated that some Spanish settlement was near . No person on board of his fleet had any acquaintance with the coast , but he landed with part of his troops , and marching a little distance up the river , discovered a fort and a town three miles distant . The Spaniards on seeing him approach , after firing a few guns , abandoned the fort with great precipitation , leaving behind fourteen pieces of brass ordnance , and a chest containing ? 2000 sterling in silver . The garrison consisted of 150 men . The next day , after a slight opposition , he entered the town , which he found was called St Augustine , and that it was , with another post on the St John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The valiant admiral was one of the first among the Spaniards , to seek safety by flight . Drake learning that there was another fort at St Mattheo , with a garrison of 150 men , at first resolved on attacking it ; but on considering the hazard he should run , from a want of knowledge of the coast , he changed his purpose and proceeded to Virginia , and after // taking off the infant colony there , returned to England . Hume , speaking of this adventure , says they burned St Anthony and St Helen , two town*s on the coast of Florida. ** There was no such town as either . He plundered and burned St Augustine , but for the reason above mentioned , did not visit the only other town in Florida , distant twelve leagues towards cape St Helens.t After the date of this adventure we hear little of Florida for many years . De Laet in 16 ' 33 , and Sanson in 1662 , describe St Augustine and St Mattheo as the only Spanish settlements in Florida , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , admiral of a squadron of pirates , landed near St Augustine and marched directly to the town , which he took possession of and plundered , without the slightest opposition from a garrison of two hundred men in the fort . The fort at this time consisted of an octagon defended by round towers . ' In the year 1696 the Spaniards , under Arriola , established a colony at Pensacola , where they erected a fort , called Fort Charles , a church , and several houses . They maintained a small garrison here for several years . About the same time probably they established themselves at St Marks . In the year 1702 Col. Moore , governor of Carolina , procured an act of assembly to be passed , authorizing an expedition against Florida . It is asserted by a historian of that time , that the true design of the expedition was no other than catching and making slaves of Indians , for private advantage .

A part of the expedition under Col. Daniel , a brave officer , sailed for the St John 's , there landed and took possession of two small Spanish settlements , and proceeded thence by land to St Augustine , and entered the town without opposition . The inhabitants had retired with their most valuable effects into the castle , and were prepared for a siege . Gov . Moore , arriving the next day with the fleet , landed and entrenched himself before the town . It was found necessary to despatch Col. Daniel to Jamaica to procure mor * History of England . * De Lact , 19.
