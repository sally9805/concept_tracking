JV'antcs . Paris , 1822. 8vo . Mr Louis SAY , the author of this treatise , is the brother of Mr J. B. Say , whose book on political economy , is generally regarded as the most valuable elementary work on that subject . Mr Louis Say has already published a work entitled Principal causes of the wealth of nations and individuals , ' which we have not had the good fortune to see , and which in the course of the treatise now before us , he defends against some objections on the part of his brother J. B. Say . Mr Louis Say , at the close of his introduction , modestly claims // indulgence for his work , as not being the production of ' a man of letters , but of a merchant resident in a sea port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of many persons be any objection to the work . ' It is certainly none in ours . Nothing is more interesting to those , who pursue the study of political economy , than to compare the statement of intelligent merchants , manufacturers , and farmers , with the principles of the science . Nay , more , it is on an accurate and extensive acquaintance with the facts , which it is the business of the merchant , manufacturer , and farmer to observe , that we must depend for the solidity of the theories on the production , distribution , and consumption of national wealth . Besides the interest which naturally attaches to the writings of practical men , on the subjects with which they are respectively conversant in political economy , there have been several examples of individuals , particularly of the mercantile profession , who have acquired reputation as writers on the science in general . The larger number , however , of approved writers on political economy have not been men actually engaged in either of the great pursuits ; and it may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of a political economist . It is scarcely possible that the merchant , the manufacturer , and the farmer , should not be respectively not only acquainted almost exclusively with the details of his own pursuit , hut more or less biassed in favor of the system , in which that pursuit plays the first part . There is nothing in political economy itself , which requires a practical man , in the common acceptation of the term . If there were , it is plain that the science could not exist , for no such individual could be found on earth . There are practical merchants , and practical farmers , and practical manufacturers ; but we presume there are no persons in society who are all three at once , to any consider . able degree . It must not , therefore , be demanded of the political economist , that he be practically concerned in all the great forms of acquiring , accumulating , and consuming wealth . The very fact that the political economist must be equally versed in all these pursuits , proves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , be practically engaged in either . To the justice of this remark in Europe , few we think will object , who are acquainted with the structure of European society . Here in America , the class of professed philosoph* *7V'cw Series , No. 16. 54 // ical writers can not be said to exist , and the duty of directing the opinions of their fellow-citizens on all subjects necessarily devolves on some class of professional or practical men . Besides this necessity of the case , our merchants are a class of men in general , most interested in manufacturing establishments ; and the most extensive agricultural improvements have , also , in the northern and eastern states , been made by those , who , in earlier life , were employed in commerce . The agriculture of the great planters at the south is indeed an independent pursuit , but , as is judiciously observed by Mr Webster , in his discourse at Plymouth , of the agriculture of the West Indies , it is in its leading features of the nature of commerce , dealing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accordingly not uncommon to meet with intelligent individuals in this country , who are in reality acquainted , as practical men , with two , if not with three , of the great pursuits in question , to a degree beyond what is often observed in Europe , where the partition walls among the different vocations in society , are much more lofty and solid than with us . And yet , notwithstanding this favorable circumstance for the formation , in this country , of what might be called a class of practical , political economists , it is the lawyers upon whom the task generally devolves of writing and speaking on the subject ; and who , from Mr Hamilton down to Mr Baldwin , have done the most to give a direction to public opinion , on this subject . As political economy is purely a speculation , there is no wonder that it should have fallen into the hands of that profession , whose business it is to reduce all the affairs of life to principle , and to unfold , in the perplexed tissue of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled . There is perhaps no study whose materials are to be drawn from out of doors life , of which the principles are more abstruse than political economy ; and when we add to this the very extensive range from which these materials are to be gathered , it will not be wondered at that they require to be collected and digested , not in the walks of business , but in the solitude of meditation . We make not these remarks in disparagement of the efforts of Mr Louis Say , who evinces a powerful mind , and who has evidently employed the intervals of his leisure in a profound study of the science , on which he has written . The treatise before us is of a critical nature . It passes in review the sys // tems of the most distinguished political economists , from that of Dr Quesnai down to that of the Vicomte de Saint Chamans , an author whom we shall presently introduce to the notice of our readers and the admiration of one portion of the political economists of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles and theories unfolded in the works of Quesnai , Dupont de Nemours , Adam Smith , ( to whom one of the longest chapters is devoted , ) of Mr Canard , the Earl of Lauderdale , of Mr Ganilh , of Mr Ricardo , ( whose views are also investigated at length , ) of Mr Maithus , of J. B. Say , of Destutt de Tracy and finally of the Vicomte de Saint Chamans . Th* work of our author being itself of a critical nature , and it being really necessary to put some limit to the range of reviewing , we shall not think of going into an examination of all its parts . We shall content ourselves with selecting as a specimen of Mr Say 's criticism , his remarks on the division of labor , as explained by Adam Smith , and shall then borrow from him an account of the last named author , the Vicomte de Saint Chamans . One of the greatest tributes to the merit of Adam Smith may be found in the numerous criticisms made upon him by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some errors . In the first attempt to constitute political economy into a science , it is no disparagement to say that errors have crept into his work ; while the care and the acumen , which succeeding writers have bestowed on the Wealth of . JV'ations , prove that the reputation of Adam Smith has not sustained itself , through the blindness and indifference of those who have followed him . No subject in this most sharp-sighted age , has been so keenly scrutiniz ed as the wealth of nations , and no philosopher who wrote seventy years ago , has so well maintained his reputation as Adam Smith . The vehemence , not to say passion , with which he has been lately assailed in this country , leads us , before quoting Mr Say 's observations , to remark that the work of Adam Smith was closely studied by those immortal statesmen , who framed the American Constitution . Mr Gallatin , in his profound discourse on the finances of the United States , * expresses the opinion , that in the provision relative to direct taxation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to * A Sketch of the Finances of the United States , by Albert Gallatin . NewYork , 1796. // Mr Gallatin , peculiar to that philosopher , are made use of by the framers of the constitution . Whoever will compare the first portion of Mr Hamilton 's report on Manufactures , with the chapters of the Wealth of Nations , where the same topics are treated , will perceive that Mr Hamilton has often done little else than repeat in his own language what had been not ill said already by Dr Smith ; to which indirect mode of quotation he seems to allude , when , towards the close of the preliminary part of that report , he introduces a quotation from the Wealth of Nations , ' thus : the following remarks are sufficiently judicious and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation. ** Lastly , we may observe , that Mr Gallatin , in the tract to which we have ah*eady alluded , repeatedly quotes , and in a respectful manner , this immortal work , which it is the practice of one class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to treat with affected derision . We have made this short digression , in the hope that the names of Gallatin , of Hamilton , and of the framers of the Federal Constitusion , will have some weight with that large class of our citizens , who may want leisure to read many books themselves , and whose prejudices are excited against the soundest deductions of political economy . by the assertion that Adam Smith and his followers are a school of dreamers . We now proceed to Mr Louis Say 's remarks on the doctrine of the division of labor , as taught by Adam Smith . Those , who may think that he detects an error on this subject , in the Wealth of Nations , ' may spare their triumph over its author , when they reflect that this error at least is common to all schools of political economy , and by the phrase division of labor , ' is , as it were , incorporated into our language . This phrase , according to our author , is confused and scarcely significant , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is ascribed by Adam Smith to the division of labor , is chiefly owing to the use of machinery . One man may in this way do the work , which twelve would have been necessary to perform without the requisite machines ; and twelve men , deprived of the machines and tools which the pinmakers , for instance , use , would be far from fabricating as many Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the subject of Manufactures , ma ( le I ) ec . 5 , 1791 . Reprinted by order of the House of Representatives , Dee . 7 , 1809 . See page 77. // in the same space of time as one man , with the proper instruments and the skill to use them . This , pursues our author , is simple and evident ; but Adam Smith seems to have rendered the subject complicated and obscure , in attributing the increase of wealth to what he calls the division of labor . In the first place , this expression is indistincA in itself , and Adam Smith before dwelling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood by this phrase . Nevertheless from the example which he cites of the pins , in which every one of the ten operations , necessary in making a pin , is performed by one man exclusively , it may be inferred that , by division of labor , he understands the separation of the different sorts of labor necessary to complete the production of a work , and the assignment to different workmen severally of those different operations . To a division of labor thus explained , Adam Smith attributes the increase of wealth , but it seems to us that his example shows that it is to the use of machines and instruments that it is to be ascribed , and not to the division of labor . In this example he begins with naming twelve operations necessary to the production of a single pin ; divided as follows , among ten or twelve laborers , namely : 1 . One who draws the wire . 2 . One who straightens it . 3 . One who cuts it . 4 . One who points it . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the head . 6 , 7 , 8 . A first , second , and third workman , in making the head. * 9 . One who puts on the head . 10 . One who whitens the pins . 11 . One who pricks the paper . 12 . One who sticks the pins . He continues , " I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed , and when some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations . But though they were very poor , and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery , they could , when they exerted themselves , make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size . Those ten persons , therefore , con 1 ( 1 make among them upwards of 48,000 pins in a day . Each person , therefore , making a tenth part of 48,000 pins , might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins , in a day . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business , they certainly could not each of them have made twenty , * Mr Louis Say ( or Gamier , the French translator of Adam Smith ) makes the most of the latter here . His words in the original Eubhish are , ' to make the head requires two or three distinct operations . ' Wealth of Nations , Book I. c. 1 . In summing up the matter however , A. Smith observes , that the amportant business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct ope. rations . ' // perhaps not one pin in a day ; that is certainly not the two hundred and fortieth , perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing , in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations . ' ** In the first place we remark on this example , that it is asserted that the ten workmen made in a day twelve pound of pins ; which at the rate of twelve hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each hour of labor . Now as this pound contains 4000 pins , and as there are but 3600 seconds in the hour , it follows of consequence , that neither of the workmen can devote the whole of a second to the longest operation on one pin ; because in one hour , four thou sand pins must have passed through his hands , in order that at the close of the day , no one of the 43,000 be deficient in respect to any one of the operations . This is , at first , rather hard to believe , but there is nothing to reply to the words I have seen , with which A. Smith introduces the example . We may suppose , however , that these ten workmen were not charged with pricking the paper or sticking the pins , for these two operations would probably have required two workmen , so that there would have remained but eight workmen for the manufacturing of the 48,000 pins ; which at the rate of ten operations to a pin , would make 48,000 operations a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to each operation , the twelve hours containing 43,000 seconds . Confining then the manufacture to the ten first operations , by which a pin is produced , we may suppose very reasonably that a master pin-maker shall have learned and practised for himself each of these operations , and that he has been successively drawer of the wire , straightener , cutter , pointer , &amp;c. ; and consequently that in a factory which yields twelve pounds of pins in a day , or one pound of 4,000 pins in an hour , such pin-maker might have performed four thousand times in an hour any given operation , or , what is the same thing , 4,800 times in an hour and twelve minutes . Suppose then that the pin-maker , after having labored an hour and twelve minutes on the first operation , passes to the second and labors upon that , also , for one hour and twelve minutes , at the end of two hours and twenty-four minutes , he will have performed 4,300 times the two first operations . In continuing in tMs way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have labored for ten times one hour and twelve minutes , that is , for twelve hours ; and he will have performed in this time four thousand eight hundred times every one of the ten operations , which compose the manufacture of a pin , that is to say , he will have manufactured 4,800 pins in the day , instead of twenty or even one , as maintained by Adam Smith . Allow that this pin-maker lose twelve minutes , at every change of operation by a little less // 1823.1 Louis Say 's Political Economy . dexterity for want of exclusive employment on one , and that he employ an hour and twelve minutes upon the operation which would have cost but an hour , to one devoted solely to it , and he will have made in the day 4,000 pins only , instead of 4,800 ; that is , only one sixth less , instead of four thousand eight hundred times less , which , according to Adam Smith , would have been the result of a want of the division of labor . ' p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to the dexterity acquired by exclusively performing one operation , yet we agree with him , in the main , that Adam Smith has most unreasonably exaggerated the beneficial effects of a division of hbor ; and we have no doubt that on analyzing the mechanical trades , where the greatest gains are ascribed to this division , it would be found that the chief saving was in the use of tools . Still , however , the mistake of Smith is rather in too great a detail of his example , and above all in using the phrase of division of labor , ' than in his principles . When he comes to explain how the division of labor is advantageous , he very correctly ascribes its advantages , first , to the superior dexterity acquired by being confined to one operation ; secondly , to a saving of time , which would be lost in passing from one operation to another ; and thirdly , and lastly , ( and we will add mainly , ) to the use of proper machinery. * The true doctriun of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in this proposition , namely , that , other things being equal , those manufactures will be most productive , where the business is conducted on so large a scale , that appropriate machinery and separate workmen will be assigned to every operation . ' This proposition implies a great market , and a great capital , and in short all those things , well known to favor the rapid accumulation of wealth , and leaves little or nothing to result from the metaphysical notion of division of labor . The whole error of Smith , like most of his other errors , is merely a little of that looseness of language , which must necessarily creep into the first essays on a moral science . We proceed now to make our readers acquainted with a work entitled Du systeme d ' import fondt* sur les princ*pes de 1 ' *conomie politique ; - a system of taxation founded on the * These three modes in which the advantageous operation of the division of labor is explained , are mentioned in Hamilton 's report on manufacture* ' , nearly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , ' by the Vicomte de Saint Chamans , master of requests to the council of state , and prefect of the department of the Haute-Garonne . Mr Louis Say treats this work , with great external magnanimity , but it is plain that he regards it with mingled pity and horror , and he reasons against it with that melancholy earnestness , with which a sensible man always urges self-evident truths on those , who he knows will not comprehend them . The works hitherto noticed , says he , are all of the school of Adam Smith , and their errors arise from the faults of his nomenclature . The work we are now to examine belongs not to this school ; it may be regarded as representing the vulgar opinions on political economy . It is for that reason that I proceed to refute not so much the errors contained in it , as those of people ill instructed in what concerns the interest of nations ; and what is singular enough is that the greater part of governments are of this number . ' For ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but quote a few of M. de Saint Chamans ' maxims , and leave them to the judgment of our readers . His fundamental maxim is , all consumption is productive ; ' from which postulate he deduces three consequences : 1 . That saving , instead of enriching , empoverishes the state ; he who spends all his income , enriches society ; he who spends his capital ruins himself , but does not impoverish society ,  --  on the contrary he enriches it . 2 . Luxury is the greatest source of wealth for countries , where there is industry enough to supply all kinds of demand . 3 . That the expenses of the government do not iml ) overish the country any more than private expenses , and that taxes , well laid , instead of impoverishing enrich a country . ' Having quoted these principles and the illustrations which M. de Saint Chamans subjoins , Mr Louis Say states the reasons , why the worthy viscount can not , as would at first he suspected , be thought ironical . The only reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Say ; it is , that the prefect of the Haute Garonne is ignorant of the subject of political economy. - Happy for the world if the Haute Garonne were singular in its prefect . The second chapter of his work is entitled on gold and silver coin and on the balance of trade , a chapter which , if we // mistake not , will procure the viscount the honor of being trans*. lated in this country , and of passing through three or four editions in as many weeks . There is a wrathful naivet* in Mr Say 's manner of introducing his notice of this chapter , which has a good deal pleased us . The ideas of M. de Saint Chamans , on money , and on the balance of trade , are those which are the most generally adopted by persons who have reflected but little on the matter , and who regard first appearances as decisive ; like children who because they see the sun every day traverse the heavens from east to west , believe they know the nature of this luminary , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , in proportion to their own ignorance , laugh at those who tell them the sun is at rest in the centre of the system . ' The following is M. de Saint Chamans ' system of the balance of trade . That a country is growing rich by drawing specie to itself from foreign countries ; that it grows poor when specie passes from it to other countries ; to take , in consequence , all modes of discovering which country sends the most merchandise to the other , and draws the most specie from it ; to adopt every step either by prohibition of foreign merchandise , or by forbidding the exportation of gold and silver , to make one 's country sell more than it buys , and by consequence , receive a tribute in money , which is called having the balance of trade in its favor , in a word , to have this balance in our own favor , and to prevent its being against us , mila , says M. de Saint Chamans , the system long adopted by the governments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom Mr Say has made us acquainted , are certainly not peculiar to him , thoii*h not often embodied in treatises of political economy . In the principles , which we now proceed to quote , though our readers may not espouse his opinions , they will probably do full justice to his consistency . His third chapter is entitled , on Prohibitions and . Mia-. chines , and thus he handles them . A premium of a million of francs , says he , has been offered for the invention of a machine for spinning flax and hemp . What would become of the persons of the two sexes now employed in spinning by hand ? It would be wiser to pay a million to bury the secret , if it should be discovered . It were to be wished that governments would cease to rush blindly towards such improvements , and weigh the danger which arises from machines . ' // Fortunate for Sir Richard Arkwright , that he was not a native of the Haute Garonne ; fortunate for Mr Whitney , that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamans , unless he should think that in the viscount 's proposal to pay a million francs to keep the machine secret , he should have fared better than he has done by making the saw-gin known . The tenth section of this classical treatise , is on the advantages of taxation , which the viscount esteems one of the great blessings of civilized society . The illustration which he offers in support of it , shows the practical economist . A robber takes from me a purse of a thousand francs , and buys with them a fine horse , which I proposed to buy . I perceive indeed , that I have sustained a change and a loss , but I see that society has suffered neither , and is quite indifferent whether I or the robber be the rider or the walker . ' This author adds with astounding frankness , the government who taxes , is a legal robber , ' a proposition which Mr Say professes his willingness to take on the credit of the viscount , who being an agent of the government is competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to leave this noble author , whose work we believe is the only one bearing the name of a treatise on political economy , in which such doctrines as we have quoted from it are held forth . These doctrines , it is true , have a great and extensive agency in the world ; not as Mr Louis Say thinks , because the governments at the present day share the opinions of Mr Saint Chamans , but because they dare not adventure on great changes . M. de Saint Chamans declaims against machines ; did the invention of machinery depend on governments , the terrors of a Luddite mob , might often influence the weak nerves of a minister to prohibit the most brilliant izm. provements . Adam Smith observes , in the so often quoted and admirable illustration , that at about thirty times the expense of French wine , very good wine could be raised ifl Scotland . Suppose that the ministers of a former day had followed up their theory resolutely , had prohibited all foreign wines , had offered bounties for the juice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far that the Lothians were covered with green-houses and intersected with flues ; that many millions of pounds sterling were invested in tLiC estab // lishment , and that six hundred thousand laborers received from it their support . Would any minister dare to repeal the laws , by which this preposterous burden was laid on the nation ? Let the history of Spitalfields  --  the miniature of this supposed monstrous case-furnish the answer . It requires only that an abuse should be established , that a strong local interest he pledged to its support , that capital be invested in sufficient quantity , and laborers depend in sufficient numbers on the continuance of the nuisance , and ministers will love their popularity too well to abate it . The interested few , are ever more zealous than the oppressed many . Various such partial interests combine to support each other . The dealer in Port wine , lends a vote to the silk mercer , against the importation of French silks , and has his reward in another vote against the importation of claret . There is no doubt but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well adapted and long pursued , industry , even when disjointed on the rack of legislative interference , may yet fix itself in a firm , though in an unnatural posture , as a man may get to walk about upon a limb which has been dislocated and has grown callous out of the socket . But his motions are stiff and inconvenient ; and what is worse , the evil can not be remedied , or only by cruel sufferings . Thus the great remedy of the gathering abuses in states , is too often derived only from the last solemn act of an over taxed , an over governed , an over wrought people from the stern and elementary legislation , which passes not beneath pillared domes* nor on the luxurious sofas of a senatehouse , among the benignant mockeries of black rods and white rods , and the tinkling of speakers ' bells , and the putting down and taking up of maces ; but in the stormy tribunals of the multitude , long suffering , late awakening , and slowly satiated . Prohibitions , bounties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compromise of rival interests , delusion , or timidity of rulers , till the whole action of society is disordered , and when the evil is too great to be lotiger borne , the populace rising in its strength and in its wrath , as blind as it is infuriated , conscious only of its sufferings and ignorant of the remedies sweeps all off at one blow , and substitutes Jack Cade 's tariff in its stead : Then shall seven halfpenny loaves be sold for a penny : the three hooped pot shall have ten hoops , and I will make it felony to drink small beer . ' By the blessed device // of a representative government , our beloved country has hitherto been spared from a near approach to these evils . In the expressive language of Mr Gallatin , at the close of his report on Manufactures , April 17 , 1810 , no cause has more promoted , in every respect , the general prosperity of the United States , than the absence of those systems of internal restrictions and monopoly , which continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The various , and , if we must call them so , the conflicting interests , find their respective advocates on the floor of congress , and there will ever be much reason to acquiesce in what is there done , as being done on a large view of the general welfare .
