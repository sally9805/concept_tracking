TO THE PUBLIC . Strange things the neighbors say have happened here : Wild shrieks have issued from the hollow Tombs ; Dead men have come again and walk 'd about ; And the great Bell has toll 'd , unrung , untouch'd.  --  Rous 'd from their slumbers , In grim array the gristly Spectres rise , Grin horrible , and obstinately sullen , Pass and repass , hush 'd as the foot of night . Again the screech-owl shrieks ; ungracious sound ! I 'll hear no more , it makes one 's blood run chill . BLAID . In presenting you with this Drama , or ' Tale of Tancred , ' in a theatrical dress , I must rely on your indulgence for whatever errors may appear on my part , it being the first attempt . The language of the author of the Tale , I can not pretend to correct  --  I do not flatter myself competent for the task . I shall endeavour to give you an idea of the repute of each character . Tancred , the Hero of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the latter , a character that can not be introduced into the Drama , ) is a heroic , brave , feeling and generous-hearted bandit , and privileged heir to Rochdale Castle , was , ( when an infant , ) immediately after the murder of his father , bound to a tree in the forest , by the instigation of his cruel mother . It was thought he had perished  --  but he is preserved , to be the downfall of his unhappy mother . Hengist , the companion of Tancred , and partner in his wretchedness , maintains , among the male characters , a very eminent part in the Drama . Lawrence , is , in every'respect , a villain .

Lady Marguritta , the author of the tale informs us , is a blood-thirsty woman , wishing to destroy the Baron Rochdale , ( her husband , ) to make room for Rothsay , ( another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought was a more coequal heir to her charms and person , proposed a tournament , in which she might disguise her deep-laid schemes . The attack by Rothsay was so furious that he wounded his antagonist deep in the side with his lance . The battle now became so desperate , that it appeared doubtful to the crowd of spectators which would receive the prize , ( a shield and lance ) At length Rochdale , overcome with loss of blood , fell a prey to the lance of Rothsay . His remains were interred in the Chapel of St. Mary . Rothsay had not long been the husband of the Baroness , than a trifling circumstance roused her ambition ; and influenced by her crafty Squire , Rothsay fell a victim to their barbarity . Murcia was the next she endeavoured to entrap , as he was Rothsay 's kinsman and had a claim on the possessions of Rochadale Castle ; but a timely supernatural interference informs him all is not right , and the Castle immediately becomes a scene of bloodshed . The then sudden appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroness and Baron Rochdale , has but little to say . Rachel is a beautiful character  --  a lovely wife  --  an ornament to her sex . The Tale of Tancred must be nearly out of print .

Main text ACT I. SCENE I  --  Inside Fitz Adams ' Cottage . Enter Fitz Adams and Rachel . Rachel . Rachel Dear Father , how often have you told me that you would inform me of the contents of your last letter from my dear Tancred ; there must be something serious , or you would not keep me thus in pain and misery . Weeping . Did you but know how my heart bleeds for his safety . you would not keep the contents of that letter a secret from your child . Fitz Adams . Fitz Adams Out on thee , girl !  --  thy old father knows his duty . I 'm always careful how I disturb the feelings of a tender wife ; ' t is this that has kept me so long silent on the subject , but if it be your wish , I may venture to touch upon it ; but first of all , I 've a tale to tell , which will make thy young blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that about four years before you made your appearance on this busy stage of action , my mind led me to take a stroll on the skirts of the Rochdale Forest . I had left off the work of the day at an earlier period than usual . The sun yet in his splendour , had shed his last rays upon our little cot , and was fast rushing down the west , when I girded on my faithful sword , and by giving my silver call a blow , old Ponto , rugged with age , left his kennel and ran on before me , wagging his tail , for I never went abroad without his company . I followed my usual footpath along the edge of the mountain ; ' tw s the middle of spring , when nature puts forth her richest attire . There was not a sound to be heard , save the warbling notes of the feathered tribe , who were fast retiring to the thickest of the forest , till the morn should again light them forth . The long , dismal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peaks , burst upon my listening ear . A screech owl , commencing early his nightly rounds in quest of prey , darted several times across my path , and in the moment , my old dog came to me from the direction of the forest , and making every token in his power for me to follow him . Thinking he had tree 'd some animal , I ventured to retrace my steps towards home , when he took hold of the skirts of my coat , and his teeth insisted that I should follow . I did so , he led the way , and every moment he would look behind him and stop until I could overtake him . The moon , in her meridian , shone with all her native brightness on the desert mountain behind us . Still onward we went , until the intermingled yells of some unknown animals set on end every hair in my head . I stopped . I imagined that to proceed would be entering upon the brink of death . It was impossible to return  --  the dog again arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the cause of this mysterious conduct . He led me into the thickest of Rochdale Forest  --  All was darkness .  --  My dog appeared to stop .  --  The groan of an infant caught my ear  --  I found it ! alas , with but little life remaining , bound fast to a tree . With but one stroke of my sword I liberated the helpless little victim . Rachel . Rachel Screams Oh Heavens !  --  You kill 'd the child , how could  --  Fitz Adams . Fitz Adams No , no , I cut every particle of chord and rope in twain . Kill the child , indeed Where can you borrow such base imaginations from . But to proceed  --  I again sought the footpath with the child in my arms Having found it , I hurried onward when again the horrid yell of wild animals rung in my ears . I drew my sword , by which time two monstrous wolves rushed upon us . Favorably the light of the moon , I made a blow at one , which partly severed his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I found that my poor dog , having been attacked by the other , was quite exhausted . I sprang on his antagonist with redoubled vigor , but the contest was long and doubtful , for the first blow I aimed at him I lost a part of my sword . I at last got the better of him , but not before he had twice clenched his jaws together , tooth-deep , into my left leg . I approached my dog , who lay motionless in his blood ; but poor , faithful , sagacious animal , he had ceased to breathe . ' T was near midnight . I bound a handkerchief around my wounded leg , and made the best of my way home . I found your mother bathed in tears , for she imagined I had lost my path . She took the child , gave it nourishment , and on examination , we found its garments were very rich , and a necklace about his neck , engraven with a name  --  Rachel . Rachel Interrupting him A name ! What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tancred . You may well heave a sigh at its recital , for he must have perished , had not my poor dog led me to the fatal spot . I can say no more . Unhappy youth ! Rachel . Rachel But the letter , the letter  --  you have not mentioned a word about the letter . Fitz Adams . Fitz Adams My feelings , Rachel  --  After a pause . In short then  --  he has killed his commander 's son in a duel , and he now stands arrested to await his trial . Rachel Rachel I 'll away instantly  --  night and day will I travel un'il I reach him  --  throw myself at his commander 's feet , and implore his pardon .

Oh , Tancred  --  tell me if these eyes are to be the mournful springs of everlasting sorrow , or rid me of my wretchedness at once . Tancred . Tancred Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away immediately , for there is a reward offered for us all , dead or alive We must part , yes , at the moment of our meeting . Hengist . Hengist You need not be parted yet , for on our way here we found a cavern , where we can remain secure from our pursuers . Your father and wife can attend you frequently without danger . It is but halt a league distant . Tancred . Tancred My thanks to you , worthy friends . But let us all away to it immediately . Not a moment must be lost  --  for aught we know , our persecutors may be in close pursuit of us . Hengist , be you our guide Rachel , farewell ; embracing her to-night I will venture to see you . Come , friends  --  lead on . Exit severally , in confusion . SCENE II  --  An apartment in the Castle . Lady Marguritta , Lady Marguritta solus .

Hengist My brave friends and companions in misfortune , I am now going to propose a measure of future existence , which , though at first may appear rude and disgraceful , necessity demands an immediate compliance with its compulsive summons . We have no friends , no money , and at present no means of satisfying the calls of nature . Are not we exiled by our fellow creatures ? Then let our fellow creatures answer for their cruelty  --  God forbid ! my friends , that we should extend our enmity to brother sufferers in distress ! No ! the rich  --  the powerful alone shall supply our wants  --  our enemies , alone , shall feel the force of our resentment ! in short , my dear comrades , we must rise and prey upon mankind ; secure in this inaccessible retreat , we must form an united Banditti . Tancred starts Oh ! my dear Tancred , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsive measure ! but were we to abandon it , how can we exist ? Speak , friends . Outlaws as we are , how can we hope for protection , and support ? and united as we are , what , Tancred , have we to fear ? Oh ! say , my comrades , who is here that would not fall the martyr to a thousand wounds , ere his friend should be grappled on by the rude hand of authorized opposition . What plan can be more preferable to our hard and distressed fate ? Shall we or shall we not form ourselves into a band of robbers ? Speak all , all freely speak A pause I propose , dear Tancred , that you be our Captain . They all exclaim ' long live Tancred ' Tancred . Tancred As I am chosen captain of this brave banditti , I propose that this night be our first excursion and depredation on mankind , and laws of our country .

Bowing . Lawrence . Lawrence My lord , and gentlemen , Marguritta de Rothsay , the famous Baroness of the North , having understood that you were on your way to Rochdale Castle , to claim , by kindred to her late lord , that inheritance which she is so lawfully possessed of , has deputised me , her humble Squire , to welcome you on terms of amity . The late Baron fell by my hands  --  Nay , start not , my lord , but hear me out . Behold in me the champion of my lady 's cause . The Baron Rothsay , spurred on by cruelty and ambition , would have basely murdered the Lady Marguritta , had not I , prompted by my duty and manhood , drawn in her defence . Armed beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinsman 's life , which else would soon have cut the thread of hers , whose sex and qualities demand soft endearment , and not , my lord , the ruthless point of fury and ambition . The Lady Marguritta , hearing of the Baron Murcia 's courage and his courtsey , thro ' me , my lord , she offers you her hand in marriage ; your fame has gone before you , and she wishes you to be the participator of her person and her fortune . But if you reject her offer ,  --  spurn her condescension , and after this , dispute her rights ,  --  through me she dares defy you . I am the murderer of the Baron Rothsay. ( if self-defence deserves so harsh a name , ) and behold me here prepared and willing to defend any actions of my life , and my mistress 's honor .

Had you but curbed the rude licence of your cruel speeches , you might have passed on unhurt . ' T is true you see in us outcasts of our country ! Unhappy exiles ! and the innocent objects of an unmerited persecution .

Rachel But sure , sir , you need be under no apprehensions of its escaping the threshold of this humble cottage . Pardon a woman 's curiosity , but depend on it , it shall remain a secret ever in this dwelling . Stephen . Stephen Shall it ? why then I may venture to reveal it . We are on our way to Rochdale Castle . Owing to the present inconvenience of the ferry , we were compelled to leave our horses on the other side of the river , and proceed on foot to the Castle . We crossed the ferry , and had no sooner set our foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rachel starts They demanded our purses , and the Baron answering them rather harshly , and refusing their demand , a battle immediately ensued . You may depend the whole dwelt particularly on my valour ; yes , I fought like a hero , till the Baron cried for mercy , being desperately wounded . One of the Baron 's friends was killed on the spot . Their leader , ( as I supposed ) would not admit of their plundering us , and appeared to be extremely sorry for the cause of so much bloodshed .  --  Some vassals , having been despatched from the Castle to meet us , made their appearance , upon which they fled into the forest .  --  Fitz Adams . Fitz Adams Starting up from his seat . By holy Paul , that was bravely done . Rachel . Rachel Hush , hush , father , speak low , you will disturb the Baron . Stephen .

Lawrence , the Lady Marguritta 's Squire , will bring a suitable carriage with him shortly , for the more easy conveyance of the Baron ; and I 'm certain if those fellows are above or under ground , he 'll have them if he has to bring the whole force of the Rochdale Castle .

The Baron Lewellin , my lord , had a particular circumstance attending his birth . The Baroness , his mother , was walking one day in her domains , when she was taken in labor , and with some difficulty was delivered of this son in a beautiful fish-pond.  --  Baron M. Baron Murcia Interrupting him . A fishpond did you say , Stephen . Stephen . Stephen I beg your lordship 's pardon , I meant a meadow . As the Baron , my lord , grew in years , he grew in every manly accomplishment . His father now tho't it high time to look out for some lady of equal rank , that by marriage he might perpetuate his family and hand his name to posterity . No one was thought so proper a match as the Baroness , his mother . Baron M. Baron Murcia Who ? his mother ? I pray thee , Stephen , leave off those jokes and tell the story better . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have made use of any jokes , they slipt entirely unknown from me . Taking another look at the portrait . The Lady ApGriffi , the paragon of beauty  --  no goat that ever wantoned o'er the running stream was half so beautiful as she . It makes my heart glad to think of it . The sauce was of the most delicious flavor , and the pomegranates too were supper-excellent . Well , it was an entertainment worthy of the generous donor . The nuptial day , my lord , was solemnized with all the utmost splendor ; the bride and bridegroom were all joy and harmony . Never shall I forget it . Trembling . Oh ! how they fought ! and when your lordship fell , with what amazing fury did he fly at me.  --  Again looking at the portrait . Fire and sword ! If I shall not remember it to my dying hour . Oh !

No ! take my life ,  --  aye , liberty and all !  --  nor think , vain man , to scare me into cowardice and treachery ;  --  for here I swear , by the holy and immortal saints above , that death and torment in the worst of colors shall never wring the secret from my breast .

Passions , which undivided dwell within the confines of thy hardened bosom . Lawrence draws his sword to strike him , when Rachel leaps between them . Rachel . Rachel Hold , relentless man ! Thou shall not take my husband 's life . Come with me , I 'll conduct thee to the spot where the banditti dwell ; but have a care ; carry all thy strength and all thy resolution with thee , or in the womb of their retreat thou meet'st a melancholy tomb !

Must I never see him more ? Oh , sir , retract those words , or rid me of my agony at once . My poor father , Hengist , I left him asleep in the Cottage . Hengist . Hengist Calm those sorrows , my dearest Rachel ; I mean not to separate you from your father ; no !

Yes ! that superior Providence which watches over and protects the life of innocence , will defend unhurt the precious life of Tancred . United as we are , what have we to fear , what force dare we not oppose ? As they have entrapt him in the net of treachery , we will regain him by treacherous means .  --  At night , when the Castle is enwrapt in sleep , we 'll break upon their slumbers , and restore your husband to your arms .  --  Come , take refreshment !

Stephen I hope your lordship feels more easy , since the surgeon has dressed your wounds . Baron M. Baron Murcia Thanks to thee , good Stephen , I feel much refreshed . Since the first moment of our expedition we have encountered little else but misfortunes .  --  Our first meeting with the Squire of the Baroness , was I think fatal and omnious . I fear I have acted with as much credulity as he has duplicity . I was far too hasty , Stephen , in the acceptation of his undeliberated propositions ; there 's some instinctive spirit within , which whispers me , my suspicions are not without foundation . Did you observe with what familiarity the Baroness treated this suspected servant , Lawrence ; and do you not recolect his swelling embassy at our first meeting . No champion of his mistress 's honor , though of royal birth , could have gone beyond this challenger in actions and in words . Stephen . Stephen Or in looks my lord ! yes , I shall recollect for some time to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in challenges , as your lordship very well knows  --  but for the future , I shall take very particular care to be more cautious than ever . Baron M. Baron Murcia Oh ! Stephen ! there is something in my bosom which , like a faithful index of some approaching ill , informs me , that my dear kinsman was most foully dealt with . Yes : that almighty power which never suffers the horrid crime of murder to pass on with impunity , is the heavenly dictator of my rising thoughts ; if so , I beg of his omnipotent power to make me the instrument of his vengeance ! to appoint me the avenger of my dear friend 's wrongs ? Stephen . Stephen Oh ! my lord ! for mercy 's sake , do n't say so !  --  have we not already had wrongs enough of our own , without burthening ourselves with those of others ? And only recollect what we have got by them , hard blows and cruel treatment ! Let me entreat you , my lord , to think no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him must be attended with any more misfortunes ; as he is gone , you know my lord he is gone , and nothing in the world can be plainer ; therefore be advised by your poor Squire , and accept of the hand of the Lady Marguritta , as soon as your lordship has recovered . Baron M. Baron Murcia There again you make me miserable . Oh , Stephen , if I mistake not , my bosom feels a passion elsewhere ; my eyes deceived me , or I perceived in the fair Helen 's visage a gloomy sadness , which she could not for her soul conceal . She was indeed concerned ; perhaps for my misfortunes ; flattering idea !  --  When pity enters the heart , Stephen , love they say soon follows . I could not discover either of those tender sensations in the countenance of her mother .  --  Her grief in my eyes appeared extorted :  --  and did not you mark her signifying aspect when she commanded her Squire 's speedy attendance at supper ? I liked not that . Stephen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in his place ; there would have been some signification then , my lord , for I feel pretty hungry But a truce with all complaints . In my opinion , we should think ourselves supremely fortunate in having escaped from the jaws of that savage banditti . Baron M. Baron Murcia Silence , Stephen , nor brand them with so gross a name ; their generosity demands both our silence and forgiveness . Their captain ( for so I judge my conqueror to have been ) whose portrait caused you so much terror in the Cottage , appeared of that exalted stamp which seldom characterizes a lawless and a savage robber . Their humanity and forbearance can not be too frequently admired . Stephen Stephen I can not be of the same mind ; your lordship is one instance of it , and poor Egbert , that lies buried at the foot of the oak tree is another ; If you call that forbearance and humanity , my lord , pray heaven I never feel the effects of them . Enter a Servant . Servant . Servant The Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance at supper . Exit . Baron M. Baron Murcia Stephen , I am unable to attend .  --  Go you and observe every transaction at supper ;  --  note the behaviour of the Baroness , and mark well the carriage and behaviour of her Squire , Lawrence  --  remember me to the beautious Helen , to her good graces most particularly remember me . Stephen . Stephen I shall endeavour to obey your lordship in every respect . Baron M. Baron Murcia First assist me in reaching my apartment . Stephen . Stephen I shall then have the honor to address the Lady Helen in your behalf , my lord . Exit . SCENE IV  --  The Chapel of St. Mary .  --  In the back ground an altar , with tapers burning . On the right of the alitar stands the statue of the Bavon Rochdale , or the left the statue of the Baron Rothsay . The portrait of the Lady Marguritta hanging against the wall . Slow Music . Enter Helen , cautiously . Bell tolls . She approaches the Altar . Kneels as if in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two on each side  --  they lean upon the Altar . The Ghost of the Baron Rochdale rises up out of the stage  --  Helen rises ; seeing the Ghost of her father , she starts back with horror . The Ghost sinks down , and the scene closes . SCENE V.  --  An apartment in the Castle . Enter Lawrence and Lady Marguritta . Lawrence . Lawrence My lady , I have taken the leader of the robbers , and have him confined in the dungeon . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta I very much wish to see him . Lawrence . Lawrence I have already given orders that he be examined in the hall to-morrow , when the Baron and his friends may have an opportunity of attending the trial . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Well , be it so . Proceed with the information that you have called me here for , respecting the young Baron . Lawrence . Lawrence My dear mistress , you now have it in your power to rise superior to the shafts of fortune and of fate . If you neglect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ill-contrived stroke of policy . ' T is true , that by a marriage with the Baron Murcia you will secure the rights and inheritance of this lordly Castle , to which , as being the only male heir , it is supposed he is justly entitled . That power which has ever favored our stratagems and undertakings has once more thrown it in your path to secure both your title and estates . The wounds the Baron received from the banditti are far from being mortal . Curse on them , I say , for their ill-timed lenity !  --  Had they behaved like men I would have forgiven them the sufferings I experienced from my late defeat ,  --  but for that one act of womanish forbearance , they shall feel in Lawrence an unforgiving foe . The surgeon , my lady , may be bribed ; he may be persuaded by gold and preferment to administer to his patient some poisonous draught , which properly applied , shall defeat the researches of his friends . Nay , madam , ponder not  --  your all depends upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prove the downfall of both yourself and me . Lady Marg Lady Marguritta Lawrence , I must own your counsel is politic , well timed , and the fair result of loyalty ;  --  but recollect , my faithful friend , that our hands have already been imbrued in the blood of Rochdale and Rothsay . The first , I confess most frankly , was the effect of youthful fire and discreet love . Forced on me by the commands of a determined parent , the Baron Rochdale was at first but an object of my indifference ; an object which the presence of the Baron Rothsay soon converted into a bitter hatred ; though not the fountain head of homicide , still we acted as the leading springs ; yes , Lawrence , we made our second husband the murderer of the first . Though the Baron Rochdale 's death was the effect of love and of ambition , but say , how can we palliate the cruel exit of his innocent son Tancred ? The father fell the victim of our passions , whilst Rothsay was the deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms , my person , and my soul to become the disdained refusal of an upstart worm ? Was he to insult my power with impunity ? No , nor did he ! And may that restlessness of mind which to me , he shewed , alive , haunt him in his untimely grave . Rothsay dared us to the very brink of death . But say , my dearest Lawrence , shall the Baron Murcia fall the hapless victim of a harsh and rigid policy ? His youth , his beauty , courtsey and rank , all call for succor from the out stretched hand of lenient mercy ! No , my faithful Squire , when the young lord deserves the death you say that policy so rigidly demands , then and then alone must be feel the ruthless edge of its unsparing dart . If he pursues the haughty steps of his unthinking kinsman , like him he shall pass unthinking to his grave . Lawrence . Lawrence My dearest lady , I now perceive the personal charms and accomplishments of the Baron Murcia have had too successful an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your faithful Squire would never make an opposition to any pleasure that could aford you one moment 's gratification . I have served you long ,  --  served you with truth , fidelity and loyalty ;  --  bred up with you from my infancy . I have ever felt an affection for you , that no danger could diminish , or hardship could eradicate ! your peace and happiness have ever been the study of my soul ; and the object of your resentment was always my implacable foe . As I have lived to serve you , and you alone , I will die in the continuation of that faithful office . Alas ! my lady , there is something in my bosom , which at this moment tells me my services will soon be at an end . I forebode some evil attending this approaching marriage , which will ultimately strike at our dearest vital parts ; in short , at the commencement of the Baron 's power , I prophesy the conclusion of both yours and mine . I know not why , and I care not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern eye of anger and suspicion . Curse on his anger and suspicions too !  --  conscious of my merit and my loyalty towards you , my dearest mistress , what have I to fear ? Oh , pardon the offered counsel of your faithful servant , but again and again I repeat it , that the destruction of this haughty Baron would be to us a source of uninterrupted peace and happiness . After a pause . What have I to fear ? Stamping his foot on the floor . Coward that I was to let so vile a phrase escape my lips . No , Lawrence , this arm that has so well sustained the honor of thy mistress and its own security , shall never flinch though coop 'd within a thousand dangers !  --  Few have been thy hazards hitherto , but they now shall fall , with such successive weight , with such redoubled force , as to summon all thy strength and all thy fortitude to support its charge . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Lawrence , banish from thy mind these evil-boding prophecies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  The Baron Murcia ? Weak incentive ! By my honor , this arm , this woman 's arm , should hurl a thousand such presuming boys beyond the world 's vast confines !  --  Here , giving a ring. take this ring , pledge of my truth and of my affection : for here I vow , by all the immortal powers above , that if our new lord dare but momentarily insult me , the mistress of this mansion , or thou , the faithful Squire and servant of her will , he mingles with the dust of his departed predecessors . We will now retire for the night . Exit severally . Enter Helen cautiously from behind . Helen . Helen So I 've overheard the whole of this conversation without being observed . It 's well I had to pass this way to night . I have learned some measure of preserving the young lord , or rather the means of reserving him for myself . I 'll caution his Squire to have an eye over the surgeon at least . Exit . SCENE VI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an easy chair . Stephen attending . Baron Murcia . Baron Murcia Well , Stephen , what passed at supper ? What did the beauteous Helen say ? How did she look , and how did she receive my compliments ? Quickly tell me , my faithful Squire ; inform me of every thing that passed in the hall since your absence . Stephen . Stephen First of all , my lord , the Lady Helen courteously requested of me to sit myself by her , which I as courteously accepted ; she then particularly asked how I did , and said a thousand tender things . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Beauteous angel ! All , all this courtsey was in respect to me ! Yes , I begin to think I am not an object of indifference ! Pleasing imagination ! Stephen . Stephen Me , my lord , you mean ; why bless your lordship 's soul , all these tender things were said to me ! Yes , ' pleasing imagination . ' Now do n't frown , my lord , do n't be angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds of ill-nature eclipsing the pleasing hemisphere of a smiling aspect ; for my part , I am so seldom accustomed to look at it , that the approaching shadow terrifies me in an instant . Do n't be angry , my good master . I said numberless good things in both our favors . I touched the Lady Helen with some degree of taste . My rhetoric was not lost , and by the smiling beauties of her countenance , I plainly discovered that our business was done already ; but whether in your favor or mine , I 'm at a loss to determine . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Smiling . Go on , honest Stephen , and inform me how fared my worthy friends ? Stephen . Stephen Oh ! most sumptuously , my lord . Oswald and Edward did honor in particular to the supper , for in my life I never see two men eat with more glee and cordiality . Nor was the good knight Sir Hubbert behind hand in the feast , for on my honor he played a delightful knife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no gout for any thing , and believe me when I say it , that some smoking venison of most delicious flavor passed me but six pounds the lighter than when it first came to me . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Surely , why thou hast lost thy appetite indeed  --  But tell me , Stephen , what said the lady Marguritta ? Hark ye , sirrah , shake off that counterfeit grimace , and attend your lord . Say ! did'st mark the manners of her crafty Squire ? Stephen . Stephen Alass , my lord , I marked nothing but the venison ! My loss of appetite fell so sharp upon me , I was insensible to every subject else . The Lady Helen too , poor soul ,  --  alas , she ate as little as myself . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Why , sure the Lady Helen ate not six pounds of your delicious venison . Oh , Stephen , I am , as you can see , an hypocrite in humor  --  too little inclined to participate in thy mirth and pleasantry Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , levelled at my sorrows ; but , alas ! they are too numerous to admit dispersion . In your absence Stephen , I have finally determined that interest shall yield to happiness , that power and ambition shall cede to love and calm tranquility . Yes , the Lady Marguritta may still continue to be the mistress of this proud Castle and its demesnes . Give me , heaven , but the beauteous Helen , and let the world henceforward use me as it will . Stephen . Stephen But recollect , my lord , tho ' pardon me for the remembrance , your sacred oath to avenge the death of your dear friend and kinsman , the Baron Rothsay  --  Your lordship well knows my bitter antipathy to murder , cruelty and mischief ;  --  all their attending terrors , however , could never force me to err so much against my conscience ; I should abhor myself , weak as I may be , if I attempted to persuade , or saw my worthy master trespass on the bounds of offered faith and undemanded retaliation , to tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Stephen , you now wound me to the soul ! But sure , my sainted friend , in pity to my sufferings , will interpose his bright celestial aid , and make some kind administering angel blot out an oath ( too rashly offered up ) from the sacred register of Heaven  --  A long and dismal groan is heard . Good heavens ! what melancholy voice of woe is that ? Sure it is the groan of some departing being . Stephen , go look , perhaps a timely interference may save a fellow creature from the jaws of death and misery . Stephen Stephen Terrified . Me ! me ! my lord , I go look ! Oh ! not I , for all the whole creation . Who knows but this Castle is haunted , and that the Baron is now taking his evening walk in some part of it . Ghosts they say have the privilege ; and though I had a greater regard for the Baron when he was alive , and it always did my heart good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordship , I will dispense with that pleasure at present . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Hold thy coward tongue , which ever dwells on terror and surmise ! None but spirits treacherously slain thus terrify mankind with their nocturnal yells . Did not the Squire Lawrence , swear by every sacred saint above , that my kinsman fell of his own treachery , cruelty and ambition ? Though suspicion in my mind points its doubtful arrow at this Squire , uncertainty must , for a while , retard its flight . Then say , why should I on a dubious throw venture my life and the lives of those who perhaps may be innocent in the end ? If the immortal parts of murdered men remain unquiet in their dark abodes , till the authors of their unhappy exit receive the just reward of perfidy and of masacree , then let the spirit of my friend convince me , by some supernatural token , of his murder , and it shall find in me a speedy executor of its high commands .  --  Two groans are heard , more distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal noise forbode ? from whence can these horrid sounds of woe find their gloomy passage ? Stephen . Stephen O Lord ! O Lord ! as certain as I am terrified out of my senses , they must come from the statue on the stairs . I should not be at all surprised if I were to see our old friend come stalking into the room ! No , no , heaven forgive me for saying so , but I should be very much surprised .  --  Your lordship may frown and look big , but I have heard wiser men than either of us , say , many and many a time , such things are , and such have been . Baron Mur . Baron Murcia Starting up and clasping his sword between his hands Oh ! ye Almighty powers above , if those dismal sounds are sent to me as the melancholly signals of my kinsman 's murder , and fatal spurs to stimulate me to revenge , let me know your high decrees , by tokens somewhat more convincing , that I , your humble supplicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A voice cries  --  " Revenge your kinsman 's murder . " Stephen . Stephen For heaven 's sake , my lord , do n't ask for any more tokens . Let us retire . Exit . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  The Hall of the Castle  --  A small stage with a throne erected in the middle . In front a long table , covered with books and stationary Enter the Lady Marguritta , Helen , and friends of Baron Murcia . They take their seats at the table The Lady Marguritta is seated on the throne . Helen attending on her right Music . Enter Lawrence and Stephen , followed by Tancred in chains , and guarded by six Soldiers . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta After a pause . Lawrence , I command you to give in whatever evidence you have against the prisoner . Lawrence . Lawrence Madam , we had but just landed from the boat that we crossed the river in , when that savage in disguise and his outrageous band rushed out upon us from their lurking places , and demanded our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they then drew upon us , and a battle ensued  --  Stephen . Stephen Interupting him Did not the prisoner tell us that we might proceed unhurt , if we would but satisfy their demands ? The Baron drew upon them first , and at the same time gave token to us to do the same . Then , of course , a battle took place , and I was an eye-witness of the whole . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Proceed , Lawrence . Lawrence . Lawrence After we cried for mercy , they were preparing to pillage our pockets , but luckily , the vassals you dispatched to meet us were discovered by them , upon which they fled into the forest . Stephen . Stephen Sir , you have omitted one circumstance . Did not the prisoner address the Baron in a very feeling manner , and requested of his comrades not to plunder us  --  that they were pursued by mankind , and that necessity compelled them to rise upon them in return ? Did he not furthermore say that he was sorry that the Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much like slaves ? that they wanted our property and not our lives ? Lawrence . Lawrence My lady , after we were again set on our journey , the Baron 's wounds began to bleed afresh  --  we stopped at a Cottage on the skirts of the forest , where we left the Baron . I returned , with the palanquin , to the Cottage , when Stephen took me aside and shew me the portrait of the prisoner hanging against the wall . I then had a clue to my revenge . I went back to the Cottage at night , followed by a few soldiers . I saw the prisoner enter the door ; we then rushed in and seized him in the embrace of his wife . For his life and even liberty he would not reveal the hiding place of his comrades . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta I express an ardent wish that the Baron confront his enemy . Stephen . Stephen If the prisoner 's liberty depend on the Baron 's judgement , he would be immediately emancipated . For the noble behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banditti , excited his wonder and not revenge ; and as the Baroness wishes that my lord should attend , I 'll go immediately and persuade him to comply with her inclinations . Going . Lawrence . Lawrence Staying him by his mantle . Hold , sir ! Nor dare to stop the course of justice . What , shall our lives , our properties and lands be pillaged by a band of lawless pilferers , and we suffer them to sleep secure ? Have not all these noble strangers been the unhappy witnesses of the disorder that this man and his associates have so recently committed ? Has not one brave youth already fallen the victim of their barbarous depredations , and were not all our lives like his endangered ? Who present can refute this charge ? Not one ! If so , this robber 's life now stands the forfeit of his country 's laws ; a terrible example to his remaining friends .  --  He sinned first by trespassing ! Then should we not doubly sin were we to overlook this trespass ? No doubt ! no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighbours , were we to suffer them to pass unpunished , might with justice charge their future losses to our ill-timed lenity . Stephen . Stephen I intreat that the Baroness hear my evidence in behalf of the prisoner , as my brother Squire has omitted many circumstances in his favor .  --  Lawrence clasps his hand upon the handle of his sword  --  frowns steadfastly on Stephen , who immediately takes a seat . A long silence . Tancred . Tancred Since none will speak , hear me ! Mercy I expect not , for its seems a stranger of this proud castle . That man , pointing to Lawrence , that blood thirsty man , who seems so anxious for my life ; may , frown not , mighty sir  --  your frowns and threats I hold in the same contempt I do yourself ! Thy rancorous persecution now forces me to speak , what honor and what manhood would otherwise make me blush to say ,  --  for well thou knowest it , t'was I , the sacrifice that saved thy life , which else would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great canopy of heaven is o'er the judgement seat .  --  Then frown and threaten not ; but if thou wilt take that life which unhappily was the saviour of thine own , mark me , be not so unguarded as to suppose it shall be taken with impunity ; by heaven , no ; for those brave followers who made thee flinch at every look shall revenge my fall , tho ' at the certain fate of meeting with their own . Yes , thou implement of cruel treachery , thou violator of innocent hospitality , there 's some prophetic power informs my soul , e'er long , this proud castle shall be thy body 's monument , and thy departing spirit , in descending to the flames below , shall , with its unnatural howlings , scare the ill-omen 'd bird of night .  --  Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta In a loud and angry tone of voice . Silence , slave ! by heaven , the audacious villain dares to level his rebellious answers at our sacred persons .  --  I 'll hear no more ! Send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest tree that it may dangle conspicuous to the passing carrion . The Baron 's friends approach the throne , and appear to supplicate mercy for Tancred . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Well , if it must be so , I pardon him his life on one condition  --  that he reveals the lurking cavern of those lawless ruffians of whom he talks so loud and proudly . Tancred . Tancred And canst thou think me such a wretch ? such an abject wretch ! but for a moment to suppose I would so basely deliver up what I hold most dear , my friends , my faith , my honor  --  to ransom this poor person ? Invaluable exchange , inconsiderable to the extreme . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Indeed ! is then thy life of so little worth ?  --  Say ! what country claims thy birth , and what misfortunes has haunted thee into this rugged road of life ? Tancred . Tancred What country claims my birth I will answer to  --  but what misfortune has thus haunted me I can not speak of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by disclosing of their cause , I should banish her from my bosom to the seat of harmony and friendship . To this country I expect I owe my birth ; for when an infant I was found in the neighboring forest , tied to a tree , Lawrencestarts. / by a good old man , who adopted me as his son , and sent me at a suitable age to fight the battles of my country ; henceforth I speak not . Lady Marg . Lady Marguritta Obdurate man ! mercy thou canst expect not ! it has already stretched out its hand to save thee , but justice draws it back and calls for judgement . Mark me then ! One day is thine to consider on my offered conditions to spare thy life  --  if on the expiration of that period you still remain inflexible , no power on earth can save thee from thy fate .

Good heavens ! what a melancholy abode is this :  --  Gloomy as the mansion I must now prepare my soul to enter .  --  Oh my lovely Rachel .  --  Hark !  --  How the wind and rain impetuous beat against my iron casement . The heavens appear as though warring with nature , and the loud thunder gives dreadful notice of some approaching evil .  --  Alas , are there no means of escaping ? no means of once more joining with my beloved wife and friends ?  --  At this moment a clap of thunder strikes the Dungeon and bursts in a piece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastens through it with joy .

Helen Most gladly ! most willingly ! follow me , and I 'll direct thee to a way through which you may escape undiscovered  --  for I would not have you attempt to pass through the Castle gates at this late hour , as a discovery would be certain .

Thou art the only heir to all my great estates and all this lordly Castle , for Oh ! my son ! thy mother was the cruel murderer of thy sire ! the death of me and of the Baron Rothsay ! she would e'en have been the death of thee , but for the benign interposition of that Almighty Providence to whom nothing can or ever is impossible .

By supernatural measures , I am well confirmed in what I had long suspected . That Almighty who never suffers murder to pass without its punishment , has been pleased to acquaint me , upon the witness of my Squire , with the damned villany of this assassin . Lawrence partly draws his sword . Ah ! durst thou clap thy hand upon thy sword , thou slave ?

Lawrence In yonder knight pointing to Tancred is the noble bandit who caused so much consternation in the Castle ; that is the true and lawful heir of the Baron Rothsay  --  the son of the Baron Rochdale ! who , when an infant , was supposed to have been destroyed by some wild beast in the forest , but preserved by divine Providence to be my unhappy downfall .

I now perceive the hand of fate is armed against me , but still I scorn its utmost vengeance . I 'll reveal what the wretch has left untold . Lets fall the lance .
