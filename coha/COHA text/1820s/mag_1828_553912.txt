txt ART . ViI. -1 . * View of West Florida . By JOHN LEE WILLIAMS . With a Map . Philadelphia . 1827. 2 . Letters of the lion . J. M. WHITE , Delegate of the Territory of Florida . 3. , /lnswers of DAVID B. M'COMB , Esq. , with an accomranying Letter of General LAFAYETTE . Tallahassee . THE country which bears the beautiful name of Florida , has been the theme of numerous writers , and the scene of many adventures , since the discovery of America . The shores of the Gulf of Mexico , lying opposite the islands of Cuba and St Domingo , would naturally be the first points of discovery on the continent . Hence the discovery of the coast of Florida , and that of New Spain , were almost simultaneous , and in consequence , North America was at first designated by these two names alone . The name of Florida , however , was gradu .. ally confined to a narrower space , by the French settlements in Canada , and by the successive establishments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming the'whole ' ofthe continent in virtue of the right of discovery and the pope 's bull , viewed every settlement by other European powers as an encroachment ; hence the numerous hostile occurrences between her and the colonies of France , Spain , and England , recounted by early writers . Spain was finally restricted to the comparatively insignificant portions which continued to be known by the name of Florida , and whi4Th , after several changes of ownership , has at length become a part of the United States , and is now one of their territories . The circumstance which has been stated , may acc6imt for the space which Florida has always occupied in the history of America , apparently so disproportioned to its intrinsic im. * portance . Garcilaso do la Vega , who is supposed to have adopted in his compilation rather too many of the fictions of other writers , has given almost an entire volutn* to the transactions and events in Florida , from the first discovery by Ponce de Leon , in 1512 , by whom it was named , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay in 1539 . Charlevoix , in his tedious folios , bestows a liberal por* tion of them on the affairs of this country , with copious accounts of its productions and climate , and of its natives . The Abb6 Raynal , Adair , Burke , if he be the author of the History of the European Settlements , ' have given it a place in their pages . The last relates the story of the enchanted fountain , supposed to possess the property of perpetuating rind restoring youth to those who were so fortunate as to bathe in its waters ; and sarcastically adds , that this precious liquid would be the most valuable , article which the new world could export to the old . While this country was in the possession of the British , a period of fourteen years , several interesting accounts of it were published , describing its productions and general features , with considerable accuracy . The best known are those of Roberts and Romans ; but the interior being occupied by numerous tribes of jealous and hostile Indians , it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ventured into the country while under the dominion of Spain , has written a very interesting work , but highly colored , and chiefly valuable for its botany . The survey of the coast under the direction of the British government , executed by Gault , is entitled to praise ; his chart is still used , and is remarkable for its accuracy . Florida was considered by that government an important pos // session , not only on account of its position in the gulf , which , among other advantages , it was supposed , would enable its subjects to carry on a forced trade with New Spain , but also on account of its adaptation to many valuable productions of southern climates , its timber and naval stores , and the Indian trade . Some valuable information , relative to this country , is contained in the work of Major Stoddard , a gentleman of considerable literary merit , who lost his life during the late war , in consequence of the bursting of a shell at the siege of Fort Meigs . We are prompted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more has been done towards obtaining an accurate knowledge of Florida during the few years that it has been in our possession , than during the whole period which elapsed from its first discovery . Previous to the late war with Great Britain , it was inhabited by a warlike race , the Seminoles , emigrant Creeks , or wild people , as the term in that language denotes , so called , from their having wandered away from the main body of the nation . The more ancient races had been overcome by the Creeks , particularly the Yainasees , who had been either destroyed , or reduced to slavery , some of their descendants existing in this state even within a few years . The Seminoles and Creeks , therefore , having a common origin and relationship , it was natural they should unite for mutual support and assistance against any European enemy . Although the nation resided within the limits of the United States , they were continually exposed to be acted upon by Spain or England , by means of those who resided in Florida . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Great Britain , but in conformity to that wretched policy , as ruinous to the Indians as derogatory to her own character , these people were excited to take up the tomahawk against our defence .. less women and children . The first plan of operations , adopted by the British in 1813 and 1814 , was to get a footing on the Appalachicola river , near the junction of the Flint and Chatahouchy , and draw around them the Seminoles and the Creeks ; to possess themselves , through their means , of the country be .. tween this river and the Alabama , where another strong hold was to be made , with a deposit of arms , and a combined force collected , and finally to unite with the Choctas and Chickasas , and reach the bank of the Mississippi , five or six hundred miles above New Orleans . A moment 's reflection will show the alarming // consequences of such a plan , if successfully accomplished . It was happily 7frustrated by the premature movements of the Creeks , and the rapid succession of signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were completely broken and subdued . When the British arrived , and constructed their temporary fort near the mouth of Flint river , it was too late , and the attempt to take possession of the Mobile bay , was successfully repulsed by the guns of Fort I3owyer . The reduction , we may almost say destruction , of the Creek nation was the primary cause which led to our subsequent acquisition of Florida . We could never be safe while this country was in the possession of a power either unwilling or too weak to prevent our enemy from occupying it , as a point whence to assail us , and to Spain it now became a useless , expensive , and perhaps dangerous possession . The hostile Creeks , who refused to treat with the officers of the United . States , fled into Florida , and there , uniting with the Seminoles , still continued their hostility long after the treaty of pence with Great Britain . This led to General Jackson 's campaign of 1818 , when they were at last completely overcome , while an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves had been excluded with jealous care by the Indians , and several fertile tracks were discovered , which at this day constitute the most valuable parts of the new territory . After taking possession in 1821 , one of the first measures of President Monroe , in relation to Florida , was the removal of the Indians from the valuable lands which they occupied . This task was successfully performed by Governor Duval , and two gentlemen , Colonel Gadsden and Mr Segui , who were associated with him . Their present number is supposed to exceed two thousand souls , scattered in little villages or ham .. lets . A tract of land has been assigned them near the centre of the peninsula , in the rear of Tampa bay , where a strong military force has been established ; but it has been found necessa*y to supply these unfortunate people with provisions for several years , as they declare the country which they inhabit is too poor to raise corn . This , however , may well be doubted , as an attempt was made by Mr White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to induce them to remove beyond the Mississippi , which , however , they absolutely declined . The removal of the Seminoles , . from a country peculiarly adapted to // their mode of life , abounding in game and fish , and possessing a fruitful soil , is a circumstance which can not be viewed by the philanthropist without pain . It can be justified on no other ground than that of the vis major , probably the same argument which justified the Seminoles a century before , in dispossessing and reducing to slavery the unfortunate people by whom it wa* then occupied . To the mind of the statesman , the measure was justified by its necessity ; for without it , there was no possibility of uniting the eastern and western parts of the territory , under one government . ' The centre was occupied b* the Seminoles , and of course all communication between the extremes was cut off . The memorial of the first legisiatiV* council of Florida , which is ascribed to the present del*gat* ' in Congress , and which shows an enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory , and has ' since been so ably followed up in detail by its author , recommends the selection of a spot between the Appalachicola and ' the Suwany , for the seat of government , so soon as the Indiafls shall have been removed , and in the mean time , the construction of a national road from Pensacola to St Augustine . Both these objects have been successfully accomplished , and may be con* sidered the groundwork of the present territorial organization * had it been otherwise , the probability is , that the western part would , before this , have been annexed to Alabama , and the eastern to Georgia . Shortly after the acquisition of Florida , several publications made their appearance , but containing very meagre accounts . The book of Mr Forbes is a wretched compilation from old works , which represent the country as resembling the West Indies in its productions , such as cocoa , coffee , cassava ; , whereas this description is only applicable to the extreme ' southern part of the peninsula , or to the neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his map , ' except as to a small portion of East Florida , is not to be depended on . It was not until the operations of the land ' office were nearly completed , that we could be said to possess anything like an accurate one . We believe , no country in the world contains such admirable delineations of its surface , as may be seen in the land office at Washington , of those portions of the new states and territories , which have been laid off in townships and sections . By these means every mile square is laid down with minute accuracy , and every six miles form a // complete map , where the smallest streams are traced with the greatest precision . Such a work , however , is not effected without great expense ; the surveys in Florida alone have probably cost not less than one hundred thousand dollars . Free access is allowed to these valuable documents deposited in the public offices ; and Mr Tanner , well known as a skilful and enterprising geographer , by whom the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of this article , has been engraved and published , has laudably used these advantages , in the numerous valuable works of this description , which he has given to the public within the last four years . We contemplate , with great satisfaction , the unceasing attention to this department of useful knowledge , which is in truth the foundation of all exact acquaintance with any country . The various new maps , and improvements on old ones , which have been executed in this country , within the last ten years , would form the subject of *n interesting article . From the Preface to Mr Williams 's book , it appears to have been composed merely as a memoir to accompany a map of Middle and West Florida , the first which has appeared since the execution of the public surveys . The memoir , although modest in its pretensions , contains much valuable matter ; but as it does not purport to be a complete geographical and statistical work , many subjects of interest are left untouched . It is , however , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natur4 features of the country , and the author appears to possess a respectable acquaintance with two important branches , mineralogy and botany . The work , is evidently the pi*oductkrn of a plain , candid man , who seems to be under no influence calculated to deceive himself , or to impose on others , for he hats given many facts , and hazarded but few opinions . If the faults of mere composition may be passed over in any instance by a reviewer , it ought to be in favor of a work like the present , which in point of utility is before every previous publication on the same subject . Still , it is to be regretted , that some parts of it had not been previously subjected to the operation of a friendly file . Mr Williams begins his memoir with a very brief , much toc* brief an account of the boundaries of Florida . For the last quarter of a century , this has been a fruitful subject of contention* , and seems likely to be revived in a new and unexpect-. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Geor-. gia . The correspondence between our government and that of Spain , on the subject of the western boundary , occupies a large space in our diplomatic history , and although the matter was finally closed by the late treaty , yet the question was never expressly determined ; so that some serious questions arising out of it , in relation to land titles , may at some future day be referred to the courts . A labored argument in favor of the right of the United States , is found under the title of The Florida Question stated , by H. M. Brackenridge , ' in Mr Walsh 's Register , ' for 1816 . The author is at present one of the judges of the territory , and the writer of the letter in the Appendix to Mr Williams 's book . The northern boundary was settled by the treaty of 1795 , at the thirty-first degree of north latitude , to the Chatahoutchy , thence down that river to its junction with the Flint , and thence in a straight line to the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was actually run and marked by Mr Ellicot ; but it was impracticable to complete the survey , in consequence of the hostility of the powerful tribes on the eastern part of the line . Mr Ellicot contented himself with seeking out the head of the St Mary 's river , and there erecting a mound , which exists to this day , and drawing an imaginary line on the map , between this point and the junction of the Flint and Chatahoutchy . Within the last twelve months , the President and the Governor of Georgia respectively appointed commissioners to mark the boundary , which was supposed to be determined by these two points , the one fixed by the treaty itself , the other established by the commissioner of the United States , and acquiesced in by Spain . But it appears , that after the line was nearly half completed , the Georgia commissioner was recalled by Governor Troup , who had determined not to regard Ellicot 's mound as indicating the head of the St Mary 's , there being a more southern branch , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its source . The business was in consequence suspended , and has given rise to another message of the Governor to the legislature of Georgia . This subject is now before the Congress of the United States . In the mean time ; the gauntlet thus thrown down by Governor Troup , has been manfully taken up in a quarter , where we did not expect to find a champion . The acting Governor of Florida , Mr M ' Carty , in a temperate , well written , and judicious message to the legis // lative council of the territory , boldly resists the pretensions of Georgia , which extend to the most valuable part of Middle Florida . We are informed by Mr Williams , that on taking possession of Florida for the United States , General Jackson divided the province into two parts , by the Suwany river , which was intended to conform as nearly as possible to the Spanish divi*sion of East and West Florida . The part which lies to the west of the Suwany , now composes the two districts called the Middle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being situated in the first , and Pensacola , our present naval depot , in the gulf , near the extreme western boundary of the latter . The two districts form a tract of country t*boui* two hundred and seventy-six miles long , from east to west , and from forty to ninety miles from north to south ; containing sixteen thousand and five hundred square miles , and ten mu-. ions , five hundred and sixty thousand acres of land , which is about one third of the whole surface of the territory ; and possessing a population of eight or nine thousand souls , rapidly increasing . Of the general appearance of the country Mr Williams gives the following description . The face of the country is , generally , rolling , but there are neither mountains nor hills of any considerable magnitude . It is intersected from north to south by numerous rivers , many of which are navigable quite through the territory . A large portion of the country is covered with forests , the trees usually at a considerable distance apart , without underbrush ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass and flowers most of the year . The borders of the water-courses , however , as well as the hammocks , are covered with thick woods of hard timber , tangled with innumerable vines . An abundance of lakes and ponds diversify the interior ; while the seacoast is indented with bays , bayous , and lagoons , abounding with fish of all kinds , and affording every facility for internal as well as foreign commerce . Although the largest portion of the country is coverea with pine barrens , and much of it extremely poor , yet there is also much upland , interval , and hammock land , of the most excellent quality ; peculiarly well calculated to produce sugar , rice , cotton , tobacco , indigo , corn , small grains , vines , and fruits ; and all the timbers necessary for ship-building are found here in abundance . The pine barrens afford excellent grazing for cattle , and they are abundantly stocked with wild game . The climate is healthy and the seasons mild . ' pp. 5 , 6. // 486 April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we believe is one peculiar to the southern states . It means a piece of ground thickly wooded , whether a plain or a hill , and distinguished from the open oak and hickory land , or the immense forests of thinly scattered pines , which with few exceptions cover the whole face of the country . The word has been confounded with hummock , used by mariners to designate the knolls , or small elevations , along the coast . The description of the coast , which follows , is interesting in a geological view . From the Perdido bay to Cape St Bias , the coast presents a remarkable appearance ; the beach is composed of sand as white as snow , with occasional hummocks of pure silex , which , to one sailing along , have the appearance of distant snow-capped hills . From St Blas to the Appalache bay , this changes to a yellowish brown sand , with occasional white hummocks ; but after this , the coast is composed of a calcareous rock , covered with grass and rushes , for several miles into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chactahatchee river consists , for the greater part , of a mass of sand , from fifty to an hundred feet in thickness , upon a base of limestone . The difference in the appearance of the coast to the east and west of Cape St Blas , is ascribed by the author to the currents of the gulf being thrown so far out to sea by the shoals of the Tortugas , that they scarcely strike the coast of Florida , until they reach Cape St Blas ; and thence westward , the coast being more acted upon by storms and currents , the fine white sand is washed upon the shore . We are not prepared to combat the theory of Mr Williams , but we confess that we are less satisfied with it , than with the simple fact , that this difference of appearance on the coast does exist . Our author proceeds to divide the country into various regions , or districts , for the convenience of a more minute description . The first is the tract between the Escambia , the principal river of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms the boundary line which separates Florida from Alabama . This tract is represented as chiefly alluvial , but of uneven surface , in some places even hilly , and finely watered with numerous springs and streams . Tbe substratum is generally a clay of various colors , white , blue , yellow , and red . Strata of dark iron sandstone pervade it in many places , and are often thrown up in small hills , especially in the low grounds , near the water courses . To pursue the description in the words of the author ; // This clayey substratum is generally covered with a fine , white , siliceous sand , which in its native state produces little more than pine forests and grass ; except where the tide or the streams have thrown upon it fossil or vegetable remains ; these form hammocks and intervals , rich in vegetable productions . The peninsula , extending between Pensacola bay and St Rosa sound , has not even clay beneath the sand . Peat is sometimes found there in extensive beds , with abundance of cypress and cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sandstone , three or four feet in thickness , is forming , some twenty miles from the west end of the peninsula , but it is yet too tender for building . ' p. 7 . The second division , is the tract which extends from the north side of St Rosa , or Chactahatchee bay , to the thirty-first degree , and bounded on the east by the Chactahatchee river . Excepting a few narrow strips of land on the river just mentioned , along the Yellow Water , which forms one of the branches of Pensacola bay , and a few tracts on som**f the smaller streams , such as the Alaqua , Shoal , Uchee , and Bruce creeks , it is a dreary waste of pine forests , much of it hilly , but abounding with an extraordinary nurnl5er of streams of the purest water , and extensive pastures for horned cattle . This tract , together with that which has been described , constitutes the two counties of Escambia and Walton ; but out of the town of Pensacola , the whole population of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the Alaqua to the Chactahatchee , the country is somewhat better , but by far the greater part of it consists of pine woods unfit for tillage ; the places of better soil uniformly rest on soapstone and limestone formations . The soapstone is found in strata , from five to eight feet thick , and extends to the Shoal river . The limestone has been discovered west of the Chactawhatchee , only in the Uchee valley , where it is abundant . On the eastern bank of the Chactawhatchee , the limestone is found less compact than on the western ; it seems a congeries of shells , some of them entire , cemented together by a tough aluminous matter . Buhrstone of an excellent quality is found in large masses near the Alabama line . Millstones are made here of a better quality than can be procured from abroad . This stone extends as far eastward as the Flint river , and northward for a hundred miles or more . The structure is nearly compact ; the cavities are very small ; it appears like a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like marble . The color is from a light gray to a brown , the break conchoidal , and has an earthy appearance . Ponds and sink holes // 488 April , are numerous between the Chactawbatchee and Chapola rivers , and large springs , forming navigable streams , often burst from this formation ; the waters , though perfectly transparent , are highly impregnated with lime , and are not generally considered healthy . ' pp. 7 , 8 . The third division includes the extensive tract of country , which lies between the Chactahatchee and the Appalachicola rivers , and forms the counties of Washington and Jackson . its surface is very various ; but like the division last described , with the exception of the valley of rich land on the Chipola river , by far the most valuable body in the territory , and the river alluvions of the Appalachicola , subject to inundatiQns in summer to the great injury of the crops , and very sickly , this is also a vast forest of pines . There are some smaller spots of tolerable land , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *e Econfina , in all , including the larger bodies already mentioned , falling short of three hundred thousand acres . It is to be observed , however , that the quality of the soil covered by a growth of pine* is not entirely alike ; the sand ridges , although covered with grass , are utterly hopeless in an agricultural view ; but there are tracts dispersed in all directions of considerable extent , where the clay lies near the surface , distinguished by a larger growth of pine , intermixed with dogwood and scattering hickories , which may be made to produce by cowpenning and manuring . When our country acquires a dense population , such lands may perhaps be cultivated . A remarkable feature in this third division is the number of large ponds , or small lakes , which are scattered over its surface , but not , like those of Tallahassee , surrounded by borders of rich land . Another feature equally remarkable , is the large springs , such is Holmes 's , Shackleford 's , Big spring of Chipola , and various others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , we find one of the finest bays of the Gulf of Mexico , that of St Andrew 's , which will one day become important . It presents a noble sheet of water equal to that of Pensacola , to which it is only inferior as to the quantity of water on its bar . Should the Appalachicola river be conducted into it , and it is said that a canal of a few miles will suffice to accomplish it , a town will rise up as rapidly as did Mobile , and , as a place of commerce , will very soon out strip Pensacola . The fourth division stretches from the Appalachicola river // to the Suwany , and is divided into Gadsden and Leon counties . We shall give the description of this last division in the aLithor 's words . East of the Appalachicola river , there are few indications of stone , until we approach Leon county . Here a ridge appears above the earth , from four to six miles from the coast , and parallel with it ; it dips a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of that stratum which forms the coast . The navigation of all the streams between St Mark 's and Suwannee is impeded by it . This rock resembles chalk , generally of an ash color ; some of it , however , is quite white , and is used for chalk . A kind of imperfect flint is imbedded in it , in form of a shelly nucleus . It becomes hard on exposure to the air . The flint is of a light gray color , full of holes , which are filled with the calcareous matter . It breaks with a conchoidal fracture ; gives fire freely with steel ; is quite opaque , but void of the greasy feel which is peculiar to pure flint . On points of the coast , where the waves have washed the calcareous matter away , these flinty nuclei form extensive and very rugged reefs . The fort of St Mark 's is built of this limestone . Grass grows spontaneously on this rock , whether covered with salt or fresh water , even to the depth of twenty feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are very hard to separate from it . Through the centre of Gadsden and Leon counties , ridges of clay extend , and form the base of an excellent soil . The upper stratum is red and very pure , and has an unctuous feel ; but very small sandstones , of the size of a buck-shot or bullet , pervade the whole mass ; this stratum is usually fourteen feet , more or less , in thickness . Under this , a white clay , similar in quality , extends from twenty to thirty feet , which reposes on a rotten limestone ; somewhat different , however , from that found in the western part of Jackson county . The shells which compose it are more perfect , and the cement is a calcareous , instead of aluminous matter . It is found to make excellent lime . The springs and streams in this part of the country are very pure ; they rise and run over the aluminous formations , but they all at length sink beneath the limestone rock , where , having united their currents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigable rivers ; such are the St Mark 's , the Wakulla , and Oscilla rivers , which from these springs pass over the chalky formation to the sea . ' pp. 8 , 9 . On the subject of climate , the work before us contains some good remarks . West Florida , from its proximity to the gulf , enjoys the seabreeze , which contributes to health and comfort . The pine woods , especially where it is hilly , are perfectly // healthy at all seasons , but the vicinity of ponds , marshes , and river alluvions , is subject to all the varieties of bilious affections , heightened by the warmth of the climate . All countries , while covered with their natural forests , may be considered healthy , excepting where , from peculiar circumstances , vegeta .. ble putrefaction is hastened in an extraordinary degree . The writer next devotes several pages to the bays and in*-lets along the coast . The Perdido , which is the first in order , from west to east , is about thirty miles in length , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the shallowness of the water on its bar , it is of little importance , excepting as the means by which , at some future day , the Bay of Pensacola may be united with that of Mobile . The Bay of Pensacola iS decidedly the finest in the Gulf of Mexico , and as a naval station and rendezvous , was worth to us half the price paid for Flori .. da . The least quantity of water , ever found on the bar , is twenty-one feet six inches , which is usually in the winter , after a continuance of northerly winds . Frigates , of the largest size , can enter without difficulty , and by means of lighters , there is very little doubt , that ships of the line might be brought in . The entrance is easily defended , and the sheet of water within , which is free from shoals , is wide and spacious . It has been for two years past our naval depot for the West India station ; extensive works are about to be constructed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores around the bay are not flat and uniform , but in many places elevated , presenting , particularly above the town , situations beautifully picturesque . St Andrew 's bay , which has already been men tioned , was , until lately , but little known ; it has at least eighteen feet of water on its bar , is easy of access , has a good anchorage , and is perfectly sheltered from every wind . It divides into two arms , each of which extends far into the country . The rich settlements of Chipola , and several counties of Alabama , will give an impulse to the trade of such establishments as may be formed here , or have by this time probably been effected . St Joseph 's bay lies farther to the east5 but is more properly a cove formed by the gulf , as it receives no fresh water river . The entrance is at least six miles wide , the greater part of this space being occupied by a middle ground . The depth of water , at its entrance , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such appears to have been the general opinion , until a special examination was // ordered last summer , when it was found to have hut eighteen feet , to the great disappointment of . many , who had begun to speculate on the removal of the naval depot from Pensacola . The Appalachicola bay , at the entrance of the fine river of that name , said to he one of the best for steam-boat navigation in the south , is formed by the islands of St Vincent and St George ; but is wide , and exposed to the full sweep of the easterly winds . The entrance affords little more than twelve feet of water , while vessels drawing more than eight feet are compelled to lie a long way off from the mouth of the river . The immense marshes , for nearly a hundred miles up this river , must always render any settlement near its mouth peculiarly unhealthy . The Appalache bay is next spoken of ; but it is a mere indentation of the coast , which receives the Ocklockney and St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into St Mark 's , but the river is so much obstructed by oyster banks , that not more than seven or eight feet can be carried up to the Fort , which is notwithstanding the eutrepot to the rich county of Tallahassee . The next ten or fifteen pages of the work are taken up with an account of the capes , the islands along the coast , the rivers , and the lakes of West Florida ; but as it is not our intention to make an analysis of the whole work , we must recommend its perusal to those who are desirous to make themselves acquainted with these particulars . A considerable portion of the work is occupied with zoology , ornithology , and botany , perhaps greater than would be agreeable to general readers . This can not be said of the historical outline , which was necessary and useful . We extract the account of the limestone caves of Chipola , which is curious and amusing . These natural curiosities consist , principally , of natural caverns , sinking rivers , great springs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public road , about three miles west of the ferries on Chapola river , in Jackson county . It opens , to the east , an aperture under a vast limestone rock ; about five feet high , and thirty feet wide . This passage descends gently , for three or four rods ; the cavern then opens , to the extent of a hundred feet wide , and fifty feet high . A deep channel of transparent water skirts the south side for some distance ; it then breaks off in wells , and finally disappears altogether . The course of the cave now turns northwest ; it grows narrower , and resembles an arch of the gothic order . After proceeding about sixty yards , the cave is crossed by a stream twenty feet wide , and // 492 April , five deep ; in this , numbers of crawfish are seen . After passing this stream , the passage turns north of east and presents a hall , one hundred feet in length ; pretty straight , with a very uneven floor of red clay , covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather cluster of stalactical columns , supports the centre of this hall , while thousands of stalactites stretch down their long tubes towards the white bases , which are growing up to meet them , from the floor . Many large holes , in the rock above , are filled with bats , which , on the approach of lights , flit off to other dark recesses , with a roaring sound , like heavy wind . The passage now becomes crooked and intricate , for a few rods , and then opens into another lofty apartment , from which there are many avenues , most of which remain unexplored , as well as two water courses , one of which bounds the passage . This cave has been explored about four hundred yards . The congelations , on the sides of the walls , have the appearance of grey ice , through which , a sparkling crystallization appears . They often project into curls and folds , representing draperies , and mouldings of inimitable forms . The projections are nearly white , but the same sparkling crystalline appearance continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft chalky decomposition ; the centre , irregular sparry crystals , of a yellowish hue . In the neighborhood of the Arch cave , Colonel Stone attempted , in three sever*i places , to sink wells ; but in every instance , he came to hollow spaces in the earth ; and the welldigger , becoming at length frightened at the danger of entombing himself in some fathomless cavern , abandoned his work . The Ladies ' cave is about one mile southeast from the Arch cave ; it opens to the northwest ; the entrance is wider , and easier of access , than the former ; it is , also , more spacious within . About fifteen paces from the entrance , it is divided into two passages ; the left , about fifty yards in extent , terminates in a deep river , which passes to the north , under a bold arch of sparry congelations , which has not been , and can not , without a boat , be explored ; the banks are bold , rocky , and difficult of access . The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillars , curious excavations , and fanciful galleries , which it would be difficult to describe . The congelations are fine and infinitely various . The passage terminates in a narrow chasm , which has the appearance of a water-course , through which , at about three rods distance , another room appears . This has been but imperfectly explored . To the right of this last branch of the cave , the excavation has been examined about one hundred feet ; many holes appear to lead off in different directions ; some of these may lead to other caverns . ' pp. 35-37. // Upon the whole , this little volume is creditable to its author , and well deserves a place in our libraries . We have only to add , that it is much to be desired , that Mr Williams should persist in the intention announced in his Preface , of giving the public a similar account of East Florida . The Appendix contains a number of interesting documents , principally the letters of Mr White , the present delegate of the territory , on various subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the character and resources of the country . We have perused these documents with much satisfaction , and approve highly of this mode of bringing subjects directly before the department which is ultimately to act on them . Mr White possesses a highly liberal and enlightened mind , and has ever manifested himself an active , zealous , and efficient representative . He has , in fact , already laid the groundwork of almost every important measure calculated to ensure the present and future prosperity of the territory which he represents . In procuring the passage of the preemption law , which met with serious opposition in Congress , he rendered a signal service to his constituents , many of whom , had he failed , would have been driven from their homes , or have fallen victims to merciless speculators . The proposition introduced by him last win*. ter , respecting the propagation of the live oak , has been considered highly deserving of public attention . From a recent survey of Florida , under the direction of the secretary of the navy , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-building , it has been discovered , that this is much less than has been supposed . Extensive plantations of live oak , which is said to be of rapid growth , have been ordered by the government to be made in the most suitable places . This kind of forecast is highly commendable . A private English gentleman , Evelyn , a century ago , formed those plantations of oak , which now supply the British navy . But Mr White is chiefly indebted , for the reputation be has acquired , to his well written letters on the subject of Florida canals , and his zealous efforts in Congress to carry his plans into execution . Mainly in consequence of his exertions , aided by the efficient codperation of Mr Webster , a sum of money , sufficient to cover the expense , was appropriated , and a corps of the most skilful engineers proceeded last spring on this important duty . Their surveys lx ye been completed , but the // result has not yet been made known to the public . When the practicability of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first suggested by Mr White , it produced a great sensation in our commercial cities , where the dangers and delays of the present navigation round the cape , and among the Bahamas , were known to their sorrow . The importance of such a passage , in every point of view , was so obvious , that many expressed it as their opinion ; that if the whole peninsula could be swept away by some convulsion of nature , we should be vastly the gainers by it . The idea of a thorough-cut had something magnificent in it . Its practicabili. ty , or rather impracticability , could not be ascertained without a previous examination . If practicable , the benefits which might flow from it , were b'eyond calculation ; and if it ex*cu** tion exceeded our present capacity , the suggesticm was still a noble one , though unsuccessful , and by no means deserving the appellation of visionary . Humboldt has suggested the practicability of cutting through the Isthmus of Darien , but it would not follow , if a board of engineers , however able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visionary projector These remarks are made in justice to Mr White , as the first to suggest a project of great *iational benefit , but which , it is rumored , has not been found within the reach of any reasonable sum of money to ticcoruplish . It is understood , however , that their report on the second plan suggested in the letters of Mr White , but not entirely* original with him , will be decidedly favorable . In importanc*e , it is inferior only to the first . We allude to the continued inland navigation fer steam-boats , by connecting canals , from the Mississippi to the St Mary 's . If a canal of stifficient size for the passage of steam-boats could be made , it would almost compensate for the failure of the thorough-cut ; and it is highly probable , that if the public attention had not been so mtich awakened by the prospect of accomplishing this last , the practicability of a steam-boat canal would never have been ascertained . The Answers of Mr M ' Comb appear to have been elicited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berne , Switzerland , and transmitted through General Lafayette . It appears from the answers of Mr M ' Comb to these queries , that he is a practical planter , residing in the neighborhood of the fine tract of land voted to the General by Congress , and selected adjoining the city of Tallahassee . Mr // M ' Comb has given some interesting . particulars ; but we fear somewhat *colored by a warm fancy . We can not he brought to believe that the blessings of this life are so unequally and so paxtially dispensed among the dwellers on different portions of the earth , as , by the perusal of this paper , we should be led to suppose . We can not help thinking that the advantages of the Tallahassee district are somewhat exaggerated ; and that the counterpart of the picture has not been shown us at all , That it does possess a counterpart , we can not doubt ; otherwise it would be a paradis9 . It is true , the answers are limited to the questions proposed , and d*o not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting forth what is bad , as well as what is good . Now , judging from a presentment of a grand jury of Tallahassee , which has gone the roi*nds of the newspapers , we should not pronounce a very high opinion of the state *f society and manners in that part of the , world . It may be a paradise , but its inhabitants are - not angels* It may be said , that such a state of things is incident to new countries . This is doubtless true , and how many other things are incident to new countries , which are nuisances or annoyances to emigrants from old countries ? The infant state of settlements , is , like the infant state of the world , a savage or harbarpus state ; not indeed literally so but in a greater or less degree . New settlements are undoubtedly most pleasant to those who are accustomed to them , or who , from long absence from the older settlements , have forgotten the comforts , and conveniences which they there enjoyed . , No one , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aware of the habits or the conveniences , which he must be prepared to give up , when he thinks proper . to erni*ate ; others indeed may be found in their stead , but they are ' such as to be most pleasing to one of the cast of mind of Colonel Boon , who loved the solitude of the forest , the freedom from society and its restraints , and who preferred a residence forty miles from any place . ' * However rapid the increase of population and the improvements of a new country may be , many years n-inst elapse before it can possess the comforts and advantages of an old one . Of these we are not fully sensible until we find the want of them ; and as to the delights of the former , This was part of Colonel Boon 's description of a tract of land in Kentucky , entered by him in the Virginia Land-Office. // one half of them exiat . onJy*ia the ittiagination* We have no desire . to throw discouragernents in the way of those who think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ag*iinst expectations which must lead to disappointment* Mr NI ' Comb prefers a Swiss colony to tiny other . We think it highly probable , from the steady and perseverhig char .. acter *f that people , that theywould be most lik*ly to pros** per . The French have too much imagination ; * they will pahn a thousand things in the'distant perspedtive , which will r* be realized on a near approach ; they ' will becorhe impatient of delay , and disgusted with unexpected obstacles* The Swiss and the Germans have uniformly been found the most con* tented and persevering . of the European emigrant , and con** sequently the most useful . Mr NI ' comb states an iiiiportant fact with respect to wlrUe laborers in Middle Florida . Ho says they can and do endure the heat of the sun in their agri-. cultural operations , without experiencing the least inconve** nience from it . This is owing to the elevation of the land , and to the contiguity of the gulf , and consequently the inflr* .. ence of the seabreeze . The two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea. - island cotton and the sugar .. cane , both of which have succeeded , and of coursb will succeed . In addition to these , he mentions indigo , rice , and all the various grains , and cerealia of the southern states . He thinks the Swiss colony might soon derive a profit fr&amp;n the culture of the vine , of which there are eight or ten different species , natives of the woods , where they bear an abundance of grap'es* The woods are filled with wild grape vines , which require only the skill of the vine-dresser . The French blue grape , it seems , has in many instances been engrafted on the wild vines , and has borne the second year , and the third abundantly . This is a very important fact , as it goes to prove , tLiat , by ' tak* ing advantage of the numerous stools or roots , a vineyard might be rendered productive in half , perhaps one third of the time requisite farther north . A population , therefore , acquainted with the culture of the vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our population in getieral is entire .. ly ignorant , would be a valuable acquisition . Mr NI ' Comb states , that the olive and the orange have been cultivated in other parts of the territory with success , and that the few orange trees about Tallahassee , from three to four years old , have never suffered the slightest injury frdrii frost . The white // mulberry has been successfully introduced ; the purple mulberry is a native of the forests , and very abundant . Mr M ' Comb says that fruit trees from Prince 's botanic garden , New York , have succeeded well , particularly peaches , nectarines , and apricots . The plum , cherry , mulberry , olive , orange , and applegrow* wild* In fact , I never knew a country where the forests abound with a greater variety of indigenous fruit . ' The celebratnd botanist , Michaux , speaks of a wild olive found in : FIorida* it is believed the only part of America where it is known , unless in the adjoining portions of the southern states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no value . Perhaps it might furnish valuable stocks to engraft on . The apple spoken of , we presume , is the crab-apple . It is generally understood , that the orchard apple and the garden cherry are not . successfully cultivated so far south . The wild oranges spoken of1 are mentioned by Mr Williams as the sour , and what1is called the bitter-sweet . These are only a few of the facts stated by Mr M ' Comb , in his paiiphiet , which contains much valuable information for emigrants , making some allow. - ance for what , to us , appears somewhat overcharged . Florida is undoubtedly a most important acquisition to these United States , in a military and political , if not in a commercial and agricultural view . We should always have been uneasy with this country in the hands of a foreign power . Tribes of Indians not under our control ; the mouths of some important*southern rivers in a foreign territory ; the communi** cation on the lii*e of seacoast interrupted between the southern states ; important harbors on the gulfin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least favor those who were ; . - these auck many other considerations urged to the acquisition of Florida . Tue sovereignty was well worth the five millions paid for it , especially as the amount was employed in relieving our own citizens , and creating a capital which contributed to the more rapid developement of the resources of our own country . All that can be added to Florida may be considered as so much clear gain , by increasing the wealth , commerce , and resources of the nation ; and we think it decidedly the policy of the government to give every encouragement to its speedy population and improvement .
