DRAMATIS PERSON . BOAZ , Two citizens of Bethlehem , REAPERS , GLEANERS , NAOMI , ORPAH , RUTH , AMRA , GLEANERS . Main text SCENE FIRST , THE OPEN COUNTRY IN THE LAND OF MOAN . Naomi Naomi ( alone. )  --  Why is my heart with anguish deep distress 'd , Or why do doubts distract my fearful breast ? Does my faith waver ? O thou power above , Who yet will guard the children of thy love , Thou who , with mighty arm my fathers led , And o'er the desert wild thy glories spread  --  From Sinai thunder 'd  --  on the wave didst ride  --  Sav 'd thy own people , when proud Egypt died ; Thou God of Israel , hear Naomi 's prayer , Let her that holy boon , thy mercy share  --  For now an exile , with a people strange , Far from Canaan 's groves alone I range This cheerless world ,  --  as Noah 's dove , in vain , Seeking , amidst the waste , a spot to gain To cheer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , home and children , all bereft ; Like her , I 'd hope an arm of help from high , May aid me to the ark of safety in the sky . ENTER RUTH . Ruth . Ruth  --  No children left ? O say , Naomi say , Would'st thou then drive me from thy arms away ? When Mahlon died , then died that holy claim , Which bade me hail thee by a mother 's name ? Naomi . Naomi  --  Died that sweet claim ? no , true affection 's child , Thou , still the same , as when gay fortune smil 'd , When wandering hence , the memory of thy love , A healing balsam to my heart will prove  --  For fancy then , with no deceitful hue , Will sketh the scene , that in affection true , One spirit , still commingled with my own , One heart to meet a kindred heart had flown . Ruth . Ruth  --  Naomi cease , think'st thou to fly from me ? That I can live , and thy departure see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side , No earthly hand from me shall her divide , See  --  Orpah comes , my fond request to join , Anxious to pray , that we may still be thine . ENTER ORPAH . Mother , thus low , thy children bend to thee , Leave them not yet  --  Naomi . Naomi  --  Cease , daughters cease , rise to my aged arms , Now , now , I feel affection 's truest charms , " The joy of grief " Footnote : 1Kb when on sad virtue 's eye , Beams love , true image of its native sky , But Orpah  --  come  --  see where yon willows wave Their dark green branches , o'er thy husband 's grave ; There sleeps his brother , there his father rests , No kindred sod lies lightly on their breasts . And , O if none shall watch that sacred spot , Soon will their names , their memories be forgot . Ah ! be it thine , while hence my footsteps rove , To guard yon mounds with true connubial love , Thy aged parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  leave not those prospects fair , To follow one , who widow 'd and alone , Is in her native land , forgot , unknown  --  Farewell my child , receive this last adieu , And let my blessing ever rest on you . Orpah . Orpah  --  Thy last adieu ? that parting word  --  farewell  --  O God ! what anguish in those accents dwell  --  And must Naomi , lone and friendless go ? Yet Thou O God ! canot heal the mourner 's woe : Lead her , O Power Supreme , with guardian hand  --  Let her find friends , a home , and parent land : While mine the task , to watch the graves of those , Who sleep in dust , secure from earthly woes : As kneeling , there , my evening prayers I raise , I 'll think Naomi 's spirit ' round me strays ; And patient wait , that blisslul morning nigh , When souls , with souls unite in yonder sky . Exit . Naomi . Naomi  --  Be still my heart , one parting pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last ; See , Ruth , to Moab 's smiling vales , again Thy sister goes , and dost thou here remain ? Return thou , too , thy friends and country join  --  Naomi 's prayers , and blessings shall be thine . Ruth . Ruth  --  Now , in the presence of that POWER ABOVE , God of all Gods , Eternal Source of Love , I pledge myself , unchang 'd , forever thine , By every tie of sacred truth divine ; Where'er thou goest , my following steps shall go , I 've shar 'd thy bliss , I 'll also share thy woe ; Naomi 's people I will call my own , Naomi 's country shall be mine alone ; Her God , my God  --  not death shall us divide , For Ruth will slumber by Naomi 's side ; And that last trump , which thou bast said , will sound To call the blessed from their sleep profound , Shall wake us both , then springing through the air , We 'll seek those mansions , ever pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms above , Unite again , in bonds of deathless love . Naomi , Naomi  --  Yes , thou shalt go , thy love will cheer my heart , And I from thee , will never , never part , Those sacred vows have bound you fast to me , And all my earthly hopes now rest on thee . Exeunt . SCENE SECOND , BETHLEHEM . NAOMI AND RUTH . Ruth . Ruth O what a lovely scene  --  methinks the moan Of weeping sorrow , here might change its tone , To bless that hand which scatters plenty ' round , And strews , with lavish wealth , each spot of ground , Naomi ! say  --  is this that spot so dear ? No wonder thy affections center 'd here ; Whilst gazing on these charms , the stranger 's eye Would cease to weep , his soul forget to sigh ; For sure entranc 'd his native land must fade , As here , he views Heaven 's minature display 'd  --  But , say Naomi , whose rich fields are those , Which art the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi  --  My child , forgive , thy question call 'd a start Of something wrong , quick springing from my heart  --  I do not cavil , or regret , that He Who once gave blessings , also bade them flee  --  But now , as memory , with her mirror true , Brings back the scenes of early life to view ; Those hours , when oft , from yonder verdant scite , I gaz 'd , as now , on all the landscape bright , And felt pure gratitude and love alone , As my Elim'lech said , " these are our own ; " When thro ' the groves and woods my children stray 'd , Crop 'd the first flowers , among my hair to braid , When the poor mendicant , low bent the knee , And pray 'd our God to bless thy sire and me , When  --  but , O cease ,  --  He , who my joys hath shorn , Takes that He gave , and which is still His own . Ruth . Ruth  --  Have I , unconscious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afresh those tears of anguish flow ; Dear parent , look to Heaven for thy reward , His favor 'd people , God will ever guard , But see , we 're view 'd  --  those curious strangers nigh , Now gaze on us with scrutinizing eye . ENTER TWO CITIZENS OF BETHLEHEM . First Citizen First citizen of Bethlehem  --  Yes , yes , ' t is she , not mourning weeds , or woe , Can change Naomi , that I should not know Elim'lech 's widow , Bethle'ms brightest star , Which long , too long , has shone in realms afar , Shedding the blessings of her bounteous hand , While Israel mourn 'd , on Moab 's distant land . Second Citizen . Second citizen of Bethlehem  --  Is this Naomi ? no it can not be  --  So chang 'd , so alter 'd , not a trace I see , Of her , who mistress of these wide domains , Once bless 'd each heart , within her native plains ; Her hair dishevel 'd , and those weeds of woe , Those tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that harvest queen , Who crown 'd with flowers , once rul 'd the autumnal scene . Naomi . Naomi  --  Yes , I am she , who once , with high acclaim , Bore all the honors of that happy name ; But ah ! no more ! for in this vale of tears , No sigh of heavenly peace , to me appears ; And as our sires , by toil and thirst oppress 'd , Did by the wave of bitter Mara rest , That wish 'd for fountain , gurgling in their ear , With high-born hopes , their fainting souls did cheer . Forward they rush 'd , the expected aid in view , But ah ! how quick the enchanting vision flew  --  No sweet relief the smiling prospect gave , Sick'ning they turn 'd them , from the bitter wave  --  Thus stern , on me , the wrath of Him on high , Falling , has bade my fondest wishes die . Then call me Mara , let that mournful name , My lot adverse , and bitter woes proclaim . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How at the Lord 's command , An od'rous branch , sent by the prophet 's hand , Sweeten 'd that wave , and bade our fathers know , Though God chastises , still his mercies flow ? And if Naomi , meekly owns his power , Will he not save her , in the darkest hour ? Naomi . Naomi  --  Old man , thy kind rebuke , doth here proclaim , ( laying her hand on her heart . ) Naomi 's weakness , stains her cheek with shame , Shall she dare murmur ' gainst that mighty power , Whose mercies shine in every fleeting hour ? E'en now , again I greet my native shore , And hail Canaan 's happy land , once more , Her smiling plains , her cultur 'd fields arise , And all her beauties burst upon my eyes . Away regret , remembrance sad , away , I too , will join with all , to bless this rich display . SCENE THIRD , A SPACIOUS COURT BEFORE THE PALACE OF BOAZ . Enter a band of Reapers with Sickles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine Harvest sheds her gifts divine ; All is bright , is gay , and fair ; E'en the poorest scarce know care ; For Boaz ' bounty , finds each spot , Nor is God 's lowliest work forgot  --  No widow sheds the bitter tear , No orphan pines with hunger here ; Nor longer forc 'd afar to roam , Here the poor wand'rer finds a home ; For he , to whom so much is given , Repays the debt he owes to Heaven . ENTER BOAZ . Boaz . Boaz  --  Repays that debt ? O no ,  --  ' t were vain , To give those holy gifts again , If I 've reliev 'd one anguis 'd sigh , Bade hope re'lume misfortune 's eye , Then those blest gifts , from Heaven that flow , Gain ten fold value , shar 'd with woe . For not on me alone , was shed This harvest plenty ' round us spread , I 'm but the steward of that POWER , Who shines on all , in every hour  --  First Reaper . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Reaper . Second Reaper  --  Guide him , our Father thron 'd above ! Boaz . Boaz  --  Thanks , thanks , my friends , such prayers sincere , The Almighty donor still doth hear ; Such the best bliss on earth that 's given , A foretaste sure , of coming Heaven . First Reaper First Reaper  --  My lord , behold you little band , They do not come with empty hand , They 've toild from rising sun , till now , But joy sits blithe on every brow ; With loaded arms they homeward spring , And loud their notes of gladness sing . Boaz . Boaz  --  But who is she , so sad and fair , Whose mourning dress , and foreign air , Distinguish her , from our gay train , Whose buoyant spirits feel no pain ? First Reaper . First Reaper  --  This day , at noon , she join 'd the gleaning band , Her name we know not , nor her native land , But I have mark 'd her graceful , noble mien , The tear that frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , by adverse fortune led , Whose better days , and happier hours have fled . ENTER A BAND OF YOUTHFUL GLEANERS , Bearing in their arms baskets and sheaves of Wheat . CHORUS OF THE GLEANERS . Gleaners What though we 've felt the bitter griefs , Which from want and misery flow ; A kindly hand , our woes relieves , Now we Boaz ' bounty know . Here in Bethlehem 's happy plains , No widow mourns , or orphan sighs ; Nor captive pines in galling chains , Nor stranger vain for succour cries . For each one shares the yellow store , Which harvest sheds with lavish smile ; Despair his empire here gives o'er , And laughing hope decks every toil . Now let us raise our notes of joy , May gratitude inspire each sound , To Him who kindly did employ , Such steward bless 'd on earthly ground . ( Gleaners and reapers pass off with music . ) SCENE FOURTH . AMRA A GLEANER , AND BOAZ . Amra . Amra  --  My lord , I 've often heard thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early bloom , Young Mahlon , the dear son of thy lov 'd guide , Who far in Moab 's distant country died . See yon sad mourner ,  --  she was once his wife  --  Now reft of almost all , that sweetens life , Save the approvings of a virtuous mind , Meek , as an angel , lovely , pure resign 'd ; She leaves a palace ,  --  learns the gleaners art , To succor one now dearest to her heart  --  Who , but Naomi ?  --  friendless and alone , Leaning her hopes , on Moab 's child alone ? Boaz . Boaz  --  Naomi live ? and Mahlon 's widow too ? Almighty goodness ! dost thou give to view Some Heavenborn vision , far too sweet to last , That , scarcely known , will soon , too soon be past ? Amra . Amra  --  No , my good lord  --  no vision cheats thy right , But virtue claims thy goodness , as a right . I view 'd yon mourner 's meek and timid mien , Who , gleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn 'd , pure friendship bade her leave , Friends , country , all and to Naomi cleave . ( As she speaks Ruth is crossing the stage with a basket of ears which she has gleaned , Boaz stops her . ) Boaz . Boaz  --  Forgive this rudeness  --  but young stranger , stay , Bid shine , as light of truth , that glim'ring ray , Which scarce appears , say , does Naomi still , Survive , my heart with grateful joy to fill ? Ruth . Ruth  --  Ah yes , my lord ! Naomi lives  --  but why , Such anxious meaning , in thy asking eye ? O hast thou known like me , her virtues fair , And learn 'd like me , to prize such treasure rare ? Boaz . Boaz  --  Have known them ? yes  --  O ' t were in vain to find , Words to express the emotions of my mind  --  But ' t is enough to say , my parents died , That Mahlon 's mother all their care supplied , And that Elim'lech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , and of truth ; That Mahlon , image of his parents good , A more than brother , ever by me stood , Twice , death defying , sprang beneath the wave , And snatch 'd me , sinking , from a wat'ry grave , And thou , his wife , doth glean within those fields Which the same right , as me , to Mahlon yields ? Throw down thy gleanings , with Naomi come , And share the harvest of my well stor 'd home . Ruth . Ruth  --  No , stay me not , for I the task will choose , To bear my parent dear , this blessed news . Yes , I am right , ' t is Boaz now I see , So often nam 'd , my Mahlon , lov 'd by thee ! raising her eyes to Heaven . Nam 'd as the friend to thy fond bosom dear , Who shar 'd thy every smile , and every tear ! How will Naomi 's aged bosom glow , When I to her this wond'rous tale shall show , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The God , she loves , hath given a rest at last . Boaz . Boaz  --  Well go , and let Naomi learn from thee , That Boaz , waits , in anxious love , to see Elim'lechs widow , Mahlon 's dearest pride , To me , by every grateful tie allied . I too will follow , after thanks are giv'n To Him , the Dweller High , of yonder Heav'n . SCENE FIFTH . AN APARTMENT IN A SMALL COTAGE . NAOMI AND RUTH . Naomi . Naomi  --  ' T was pride , my child ,  --  a mendicant to come , And sue for shelter where was once my home ? My soul revolted at the painful thought , And rather , here a rest obscurely sought . But wond'rous are the ways of Him on high , Unsought , new scenes , now open on my eye  --  The man as gen'rous , as the tender boy , Welcomes the suff'rer back , with heart felt joy . Ruth . Ruth  --  To live obscure ?  --  when Bethl'ems streets have rung , Naomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly swifter than the winged wind , " Say , do we once , again Naomi find ? " Ah vain thy wish , the cheering sun to hide , From fruitful vales , its beams , with life supplied . ENTER BOAZ , He rushes forward , seizes the hand of Naomi , and sinks at her feet . Boaz . Boaz  --  Naomi !  --  mother !  --  God of Heaven !  --  indeed , Hast Thou this last , this blessing best decreed ? That I , again , a parents smile should taste ? For now , e'en paradise , would seem a waste , Without the mingled throb of kindred hearts , Devoid of bliss , which love to love imparts . Naomi leans over him weeping ,  --  a pause , she raises him . Naomi Naomi  --  Now I can weep , now tears are sweet relief , Symbols of joy , which chase desparing grief , Child of my happier hours !  --  thou still as true , As she , ( who when receded from her view Her native hills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to Naomi clung  --  And say , canst thou , like her , love one whose eye Sees no possession , but in yonder sky ?  --  Boaz . Boaz  --  Naomi yes  --  but see yon lands around , Which scarce our utmost , distant gaze can bound ; These , by thy husband , were reserv 'd , if e'er An heir of his , in Bethlehem re-appear , Whose wants should need them ,  --  O ' t is bliss indeed , To see Naomi claim them as her meed . To Ruth . And thou , whose virtues , might a palace grace , Could I but half supply thy Mahlon 's place , Then would I speak  --  thy wond'rous faith hath made Me to aspire , to what no art can shade  --  A heart sincere , a soul , which ever true , Will bear alike , her God 's and mortal 's view , ' T is Mahlon 's friend , Naomi 's child that sues , And let not Ruth my anxious prayer refuse .  --  Naomi . Naomi  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Can e'er supply my lov 'd , my long lost son .  --  Boaz , who early , shar 'd his tender heart ,  --  Boaz alone , deserves his dearest part . ( She joins their hands . ) My husband !  --  children !  --  from your seats above , Look down and bless this moment with your love . And Thou , O God , grant bliss without alloy , These , thy deserving , ever may enjoy  --  But hush !  --  what glorious visions now arise ? What dazzling splendor bursts upon my eyes ? ' Mid thy descendants , a long glorious train , Of kings and heroes , sweep the battle plain , One , with an angel 's voice , and seraph 's fire , Sounds in loud notes , his grand prophetic lyre , One , stands array 'd in wisdom 's robes divine , Around whose brow , bright rays of glory shine . But who is HE , who fills the world with light ? Who comes obeyed , by angel myriads bright ? Ha !  --  ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brighter than thousand suns , yet mild as even , At HIS command sin flies , on wings away , And darkness fades before ETERNAL DAY ; Before Him , comes the sign of Love unfurl 'd He calls to rest , the nations of the world .
