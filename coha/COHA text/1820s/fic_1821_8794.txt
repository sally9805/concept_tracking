DRAMATIS PERSON . Count de Croissy Justin Paul Lubin Hubert Roland Gregoire Gaspard Sentinel The Baroness Marceline Louise Main text ACT I. Scene 1st.  --  The hamlet of Olival , in Provence .  --  On one side Hubert 's cottage  --  opposite , Marceline's.  --  Sun-rise . Enter Hubert , from his cottage . Hub . Hubert Broad morning , and not a soul to be seen  --  when our yearly feast is to be celebrated to-day , and a wedding into the bargain ; ' t is a shame , that such an old fellow as I , should be the first stirring . But , of all the lazy spots in France , this same village of Olival , in Provence , is the laziest ! Holloa ! Marceline ! Marceline ! Enter Marceline , from Cottage . Well , Goody , is your daughter , the bride , getting ready for church ? Marc . Marceline Drest this half hour , neighbour  --  I help 'd her , and thanks to my taste , she does look so genteel ! Oh ! Hubert ! ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hubert Why , yes ; I have a monstrous long memory . Marc . Marceline My Louise , my last chick of fourteen , is as like what I was on that very day  --  which is now a good five and twenty years ago . Hub . Hubert Five and thirty , short measure ! You know , Dame , I never compliment ! Marc . Marceline That you do not indeed ! such rudeness ! let me tell you , I have not been used to . Hub . Hubert Then it must be some time , Dame , since you laid by your looking-glass . Come , come , my ancient neighbour , the hey-day is over with you and me . The winter of life may , and perhaps should , be cheerful , but when old folks pretend to be young , they provoke derision , instead of commanding respect . Marc . Marceline Well , well ; but you are monstrous blunt , neighbour Hubert ! But , where 's the bridegroom ? where 's your nephew , Lubin , that 's to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his nest yet , I fancy ; but I 'll rouse him . Lubin ! Holloa ! Lubin ! Lubin thrusts his head out of the window of Hubert 's cottage . Lub . Lubin Well , here 's Lubin ! Lawk ! Uncle , how you do bawl ! I be'nt deaf , no , nor dead neither . Marc . Marceline He has been dreaming on his happiness , I 'll be bound . Hub . Hubert Aye , trying to snort through a nose too short for a snore ! what have you been about all this time ? Lub . Lubin Titivating myself , to be sure ; to look pretty , you know , when I 'm going to be married . Marc . Marceline Come , be quick , Lubin ! the morning wears , and  --  Lub . Lubin Now do n't , mother-in-law  --  do n't flurry me when I 'm going to plight my vows ! I sha n't be long now  --  but it takes a deal of time to make myself killing . ( Retires from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing youth ! Marc . Marceline I hope he 'll be ready soon ; for often as our village feast has come round , never did it promise to be so joyou , as to-day ! Hub . Hubert Ah ! Dame ! it has lost all joy with me now ! our noble benefactor , who founded it , with a charity for orphans annexed to it  --  he is dead  --  dead ! or , what is as bad , if not worse  --  pining , perhaps , a prisoner of war , in a savage enemy 's dungeon ! He was the kindest hearted nobleman ! Marc . Marceline The Count de Croissy was an angel of a master , to be sure ; and our present lady , his niece  --  Hub . Hubert Is a devil in petticoats ! a disgrace , a scourge to the noble house of De Croissy . Marc . Marceline Ay  --  your old way of talking ! you always will be suspecting ! Fie , Hubert ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself . Hub . Hubert Look'ye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts than I ever trusted you with before . Did n't her uncle , the Count de Croissy , marry the Lady Adeline ? Did n't two boys bless their union ? Marc . Marceline Well , and what then ? Hub . Hubert What ! why , the marriage and the children , crush 'd this niece 's only hopes of inheritance . Three years after his marriage , the Count set sail on business of importance , for Sicily , and has not been heard of since . Shortly after his departure , a fire broke out in the castle at midnight . Marc . Marceline Aye , by accident . Hub . Hubert Yes , and by accident it burst forth in two distant apartments at the same moment ; both too , in that wing of the building , and under the very rooms where Lady Adeline , and her poor innocents lay . She , and her lovely babes  --  it makes one 's heart bleed to mention it  --  perished in the flames ! The niece , of course , escaped  --  Providence can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate ! Marc . Marceline And why not sooner suspect the steward  --  the down-looking , smooth-spoken Mr. Roland ? I 'm sure he 's a hypocrite  --  though now they say she trusts him with every thing . Hub . Hubert Why , he 's wretch enough to  --  but , he could have no motive , only , as an agent , to have done the hellish work ! and what a fiend must be his employer ! Marc . Marceline It was once whisper 'd that the children had been saved , and conveyed secretly away , by my lord 's old butler , Baptiste , who died here shortly after ; and sent by him to be brought up in a distant country , by his sister that lives there . Hub . Hubert That can hardly be , Marceline ; for the boys would be old enough now , to have come forward , and with the help of protection , and proofs , claimed , their inheritance . Lubin heard singing within  --  then enters from the house , dress 'd ludicrously , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lub . Lubin Here I am at last ! a pretty suit , a n't it ? I 'm quite ready . Hub . Hubert And you have been two hours making yourself such an ape ! Lub . Lubin An ape ! some folks would have been longer about it , and not looked like some folks , after all . Marc . Marceline Well , Lubin , the happy day that all you impetuous young men sigh for , is come at last . Lub . Lubin Yes  --  it 's come  --  Only put your hand on my heart , it flaps , and flutters like a duck in a warming pan ! Where 's my Louise , the bride that is to be ? Where 's my little diddlety-dumps ? Hub . Hubert Do n't talk like a blockhead ! Lub . Lubin Why , lawk , uncle , every body does till the end of the honey-moon . Marc . Marceline Your Louise is waiting to be fetched . Lub . Lubin Is she ? then her Lubin flies . ( Going . ) Hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't fly yet . Stay where you are , you owl ! Ar n't all the folks in the village to be assembled first , according to form , on the feast day ? Marc . Marceline Aye , true , true ; you must stay where you are child . Lub . Lubin She calls me child ! lawk !  --  if I am , I 'm a wapper ! Hub . Hubert Dame , you and I have some business yet , with the notary , before the wedding . When we return , the feast may begin . Be sure , now , you do n't stir till we come back . Come , Marceline . Marc . Marceline Have with you , neighbour . Exeunt Hubert and Marceline . Lub . Lubin Uncle 's grumpy . Now they 're gone , I 'll call Louise . ( Goes to the door of Marceline 's cottage . ) Miss ! Miss ! Mamselle ! How the wind whistles down one 's throat thro ' the key hole ! Miss Louise ! I think she heard that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be snubb 'd by uncle tho ' after I 'm married . He has n't a right  --  I 'm grown up  --  I 'm a man  --  and that 's a lord of the creation . Enter Louise from Marceline 's cottage . Louise . Louise Did n't somebody call ? Lub . Lubin Only little I ! Oh ! Miss Louise , how tasty you do look ! Louise . Louise And I declare , Lubin , you are dizen 'd out so gay ! Lub . Lubin A n't it a nice dress to be married in ? I thought you 'd admire it . Louise . Louise Nothing can be better , that 's certain . Lub . Lubin It might be a little better , if the coat did but come near my wrists , and the waistcoat did'nt come so near my knees , should'nt mind the pinching under the arms , a fig ! Well , and  --  how did you sleep , last night , Miss Louise ? Louise . Louise Very ill indeed , Lubin . Lub . Lubin Did you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the fine clothes I was to put on this morning , to be sure . Lub . Lubin All for me ! your own Lubin ! Well now , I slept like a peg top ! but then , I dreamed a dream ; a kind of a vision-like . Guess what it was all about . Louise . Louise Dear ! how should I tell ? Lub . Lubin It was all about myself , and you ! I thought that you was Venus , come to the foot of my bed , with a pigeon on your fore-finger ; and that it said to me , out of its beak , " Lovely youth ! Venus adores you ! " just as plain as a poll-parrot . Louise . Louise I , Venus ! Nay now , Lubin , you are flattering me ! Lub . Lubin It 's as true as husbands go to heaven ! Look , what a flashy nosegay I 've brought you , for the wedding ! bachelors buttons all round , with a sun-flower in the middle . Louise . Louise Prodigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's all for beauty  --  there 's no smell . Hubert without . Hub . Hubert Now , Dame . Lub . Lubin There 's uncle , come back with your mother ! run , or by gosh , we shall catch it . Louise runs into the cottage . Re-enter Hubert and Marceline . Marc . Marceline So  --  we have settled with the notary  --  the lads and lasses of the village , may come as soon as they please . Hub . Hubert ( To Lubin . ) What are you about there , ey ? Lub . Lubin Standing stock still as you bid me . Hub . Hubert But I did'nt bid you stand like a post . Marc . Marceline Nay , now , Hubert , you are too cross with poor Lubin ; he 's a good lad . Lub . Lubin That I am ; a very good one  --  You wo n't see such another in a hurry . Marc . Marceline And though his head may want a little furnishing , who knows what marriage may'nt do to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's help to give it a finish . ( A flourish of rustic music . ) Hub . Hubert Our neighbours are coming . Dame , bring out your daughter the bride , to your own door , while I stand with the bridegroom at mine , to receive them , according to form , on the feast day . Music ,  --  To which enter , two by two , several peasants , drest for the feast . Shepherds and shepherdesses with their crooks , scrips , garlands , &c.; led on by one , who appears to direct the ceremonies . As they lead round the stage , and are preparing to go off in procession , when Paul and Justin are heard without . Just . Justin ( Crying . ) I ne  --  e  --  ver was so u  --  u  --  sed ! Enter Justin and Paul , dress 'd in the costume of the Swiss peasantry  --  Justin with a bundle at his back . Paul . Paul Never you mind that ! keep a good heart , I tell you . ( Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The procession stops . ) Hub . Hubert Stay  --  who are these ? Marc . Marceline Two pretty lads , I declare ! Lub . Lubin How one blubbers ! but t' other seems as brisk as a tom-tit . Just . Justin Oh ! Paul , what will become of us ? Paul . Paul Why , foolish , what signifies snivelling ? Bad luck now , better another time . And see ! see , if here ar'nt some good natur 'd looking souls already ! they 'll give us a little refreshment , I 'll warrant ' em . Wo n't you , kind gentlefolks ? ( Bowing . ) Hub . Hubert Who are you , my young friends ? Paul . Paul ( Bowing . ) We are two poor unfortunate lads , sir . One of us is apt to whimper a bit , but , you 'll find me a tolerable tough one . Marc . Marceline What are your names , children ? Paul . Paul My name is Paul , madam ; and my brother here , his name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J  --  u  --  ustin  --  Justin , madam . Lub . Lubin Do n't you cry any more  --  do n't , little Justin . Hub . Hubert Where do you come from ? Paul . Paul We come just now from that great ugly castle , sir , at the end of your village . Do n't be affronted , sir , your village is a mighty pretty village ; but , your castle there , is as black as the devil , on the outside , that 's the truth o n't ! Hub . Hubert I 'm afraid there 's a great deal more of the devil within . ( Aside . ) Just . Justin We rung at the gate , in hopes of getting in , sir , for we are a little tired  --  Paul . Paul And a grumpy old fellow , sir , came out , and did so abuse us ! just as if we had been a couple of pick-pockets . Just . Justin If we had'nt run away , I do think , brother , he 'd have beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have seen that , though ! hang me ! if I would'nt have given him such a  --  Marc . Marceline ( To Hubert . ) Sure as can be , they mean that outlandish porter , my lady 's steward hired about a month ago . Hub . Hubert Yes , and who , being deaf , ca n't betray the secrets he never hears , ( aside . ) What country do you come from ? Just . Justin From a long , long way , indeed , sir . Paul . Paul From near Berne , sir , in Switzerland . Just . Justin And we have been travelling a-foot , above a month , sir . Lub . Lubin How they must want to sit down . Hub . Hubert What is your father ? Paul . Paul We ca n't remember him , sir . Lub . Lubin Many knows nothing about their own fathers . Hub . Hubert Your mother , then ; how came you to leave her ? Just . Justin Oh ! we never could have left mother . Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our dear mother , she  --  she  --  Paul . Paul ( Much affected . ) She  --  she left us  --  Oh ! Justin . ( The boys embrace , and weep on each others neck . ) Hub . Hubert Poor lads ! Paul . Paul You shall hear part of our story , sir , as Justin sings it , when we travel along , at the rich folks ' gate . Come , Justin . SONG .  --  Justin . Justin 1st . Our cot was shelter 'd in a wood , And near a lake 's green margin stood ; A mountain bleak , behind us frown 'd , Whose top the snow in summer crown 'd ; But pastures rich and warm to boot , Lay smiling at the mountain 's foot : There first we frolick 'd hand in hand , Two infant boys of Switzerland . 2d . When scarcely old enough to know The meaning of a tale of woe , ' T was then , by mother , we were told , That father in his grave was cold ; That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labour , yet : And tears within her eyes would stand , For her two boys of Switzerland . 3d . But soon for mother , as we grew , We work 'd , as much as boys could do ; Our daily gains to her we bore  --  But , Oh ! she 'll ne'er receive them more ! For long we watch 'd beside her bed ; Then sigh 'd to see her lie there dead ; And now we wander , hand in hand , Two orphan boys from Switzerland . Hub . Hubert Have you no relations left , then ? Just . Justin Not one in the world ! nor no friends , sir . Hub . Hubert And whither are you going now , my lads ? Just . Justin Going to Marseilles , sir . They say we may find births on board a ship , there , perhaps . Marc . Marceline But , you are out of the road , children . Just . Justin Yes , ma'am ; for , about a league and a half off , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Olival ; with a fine wedding , they said , and a handsome bride  --  Lub . Lubin And bridegroom ; they said that , did'nt they ? Paul . Paul No , sir . Hub . Hubert How old are you , boys ? Just . Justin Paul is a year younger than I , sir . Paul . Paul And I am just turned fourteen , sir . Hub . Hubert That will do ! Look'ee , neighbours ; though I have the power in this matter , I should'nt like to do any thing that would'nt please you all . But , here are two poor lads come in the nick of time ; and , in my mind , just answering to the article of the Count 's intentions . Shall I fix upon these poor little fellows ? What say you neighbours . All . All Aye , aye , Hubert , aye . Hub . Hubert Then , my lads , there 's no travelling for you to Marseilles . Paul and Just . Paul , Justin No , sir ? Hub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your limbs too , for the present ; for , from this moment , you are adopted here  --  taken care of for life ; and to be placed in honest employments , fitting your stations , by the bounty of our lord of the hamlet , the noble Count de Croissy ! Paul . Paul What , we ? No ! Huzza ! O , Lord ! O Lord ! Just . Justin For life ! Oh , dear , dear sir ! Oh , brother ! The boys utter the above in a hurried manner , Paul in the highest glee , Justin seriously affected  --  so as to mark their different dispositions ) Oh ! dear , good sir . Paul . Paul But , you a n't joking , now , I hope , sir , are you ? Hub . Hubert No , no , my lads ! but do n't thank me  --  bless the name of the noble founder of the charity  --  ' t is a fix 'd thing , be assured . Lub . Lubin I consent ; so does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix 'd thing be assur 'd . Hub . Hubert I wish your tongue was a fix 'd thing , with all my heart . But , come . Look'ye boys ! yonder 's my cottage  --  go in , and put down your bundle  --  you 'll find a brown loaf , and half a bottle of wine on the table  --  stay your stomachs , and then return to us . Paul . Paul Thank ye , sir ; we are sharp set  --  we sha n't be a minute , I warrant you . Exeunt Paul and Justin into cottage . Hub . Hubert Come , now for dancing  --  and then , neighbours , away to the Olive Field for the feast DANCE . ( At the end of the dance . ) Now , Lubin , now , Louise  --  away with you to the church . Marceline and I will follow . Lub . Lubin Well , you wo n't be long  --  Come , neighbours  --  come , Louise  --  you and I must get up into that wicker thing , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated portable seat , with a kind of canopy , formed of trellis-work , and decorated with flowers . Now I after you ! ( Seats himself . ) Here we are , caged , like a couple of Canary birds ! Our time 's come ! so play up , neighbours , and turn us off ! Music  --  to which the procession marches away , bearing off Lubin and Louise . Movent , Hubert and Marceline . Re-enter Justin and Paul  --  from the cottage . Hub . Hubert Well , my lads , you have stowed all safe . Paul . Paul Oh , yes , our bundle in a cupboard ; and the brown bread and wine in our stomachs . Just . Justin There 's one thing tho ' we forgot to tell ; and you have been so good to us , sir , that it would be a shame to hide any thing from you . Paul . Paul So it would ; but what have we forgot ? I do n't remember any thing . Just . Justin The little box , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hub . Hubert What 's in it , my boys ? Just . Justin We do n't know , sir . Hub . Hubert No ! Paul . Paul Shew it , brother . Mother gave it to Justin to keep , sir , for he 's oldest , and she always said he was the steady one . Justin takes a small casket from his bosom , and gives it to Hubert . Hub . Hubert Curiously bound and sealed ! Here 's writing ; let us see  --  ( Reads . ) " To Justin and Paul  --  Never open this box , ' till Justin has reach 'd his 18th year . "  --  Very mysterious ! Marc . Marceline I should monstrously like to know what 's in it . Hub . Hubert I do n't know a woman that would'nt . Marc . Marceline I hope you have never tried just to peep a little inside , if you could , children ? Hub . Hubert Pshaw ! they know nothing of the contents  --  do you , my lads ? Just . Justin No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before I shall be eighteen ; and neither of us would open the box for all the world , before the time our dear mother has mentioned . Hub . Hubert Did she say any thing , when she gave it you ? Just . Justin When she gave it us ? Oh ! we had rather not talk of that . Hub . Hubert Nay , my good fellows , it may be of consequence . Paul . Paul Well then  --  " My dear children "  --  said she  --  we were at her bed side  --  she was dying , and  --  Oh ! Hub . Hubert Come , come , cheer up , my good lad ! Paul . Paul " Take this box , " she said  --  Here Roland enters behind . " And be sure to keep it safely . The happiness of your lives depend on it , and  --  " Just . Justin Stop , Paul , here 's somebody coming . Hub . Hubert ( Looking out and thrusting the box in his bosom . ) As I suspected  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . Paul Who is the gentleman , sir ? Hub . Hubert Mr. Roland , the steward , from the castle ; and comes , no doubt , with a message from his mistress . Paul . Paul ( Half aside . ) Hang that castle . I ca n't fancy any body that belongs to it . Roland as he advances glances his eyes on the boys , but endeavours to conceal his observation of them from Hubert and Marceline . Rol . Roland Honest Hubert , good day ! Marceline , my comely dame , I am happy to see you . Hubert and Marceline bow and courtesy , sullenly . Marc . Marceline ( Aside . ) He 's a black sheep , if ever there was one in a flock . Rol . Roland I met the procession in the way to the church , and heard you were following . Do n't let my presence interrupt you . Hub . Hubert Your presence , Sir , is an honour we did'nt look for . Rol . Roland The sight of so many joyous faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hub . Hubert Then I wonder , Sir , you do n't cheer your heart a little oftener . ( Aside . ) Mischief 's a-foot , he 's so devilish civil . Rol . Roland Those are two pretty boys . Whose are they , Hubert ? Hub . Hubert ( Alarm 'd , but firm . ) They are mine , Sir . Rol . Roland Yours ! Marc . Marceline ( Eagerly . ) Yes  --  and mine too , Sir . Rol . Roland And yours ! Why , Hubert ! Marceline ! would you bring scandal upon yourselves ? Marc . Marceline I defy any one to bring scandal upon me , Sir ; they belong to all the Hamlet . Hub . Hubert In short , they are Orphans , newly arrived on the Feast-day ; and adopted by me , to the content of all our neighbours . Rol . Roland Oh ! according to the Charter of the Count de Croissy . Hub . Hubert And , according to that Charter , they are under my particular care and protection . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good friend , they can not be under better . How old are you , my lads ? Just . Justin Paul , do you speak ; I 'm frighten 'd . Paul . Paul Frightened ! pooh ! ( Coming up to Roland . ) Sir , I 'm fourteen , and brother was fifteen last Monday . ( Very bluffly . ) Rol . Roland A fine little fellow indeed ! Hubert , why hav'nt you introduced them at the Castle ? Hub . Hubert They are but just arrived , Sir . Paul . Paul Thank you for nothing , Sir ; but we have had enough of the Castle , already . Rol . Roland Are those the same boys , then , that the porter , as I heard just now , drove away from the gate ? Just . Justin He used us very cruelly indeed , Sir . Rol . Roland Oh ! you must not think of that  --  I have reprimanded him , and you must forgive him ; he is stupid and deaf . The Baroness must see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you have nothing to fear , I will take you to her myself . Hub . Hubert Oh ! the devil ! ( Aside . ) Rol . Roland I 'm sure they 'll be glad to go ; sha n't you , my lads ? Just . Justin No thank you , Sir . Paul . Paul Ecod , somehow , I should like to talk to a Baroness , too . I do n't think I ever saw one in all my life . Rol . Roland Come then , let us lose no time . Hub . Hubert ( Aside . ) For their sakes , I must hide my fears ! I 'm ready , Sir , to attend you with them directly . Rol . Roland ( Stopping him . ) You forget , my good friend , that you are waited for at the church . As soon as the Baroness has seen them , I 'll bring them back to you myself in the Olive Field . Bid good-bye , for a very short time , to your protector . Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Just . Justin Good-bye , dear , dear Sir ! ( Embracing Hubert . ) Oh ! but the little box , Sir . Hub . Hubert Hush ! ( Aside to Justin . ) Rol . Roland Have they a box ? Hub . Hubert A paltry casket ; a toy that  --  I 'm going to lock up in the house directly . Just . Justin Oh ! no , no , no ! Rol . Roland They seem very eager about it  --  what does it contain ? Hub . Hubert Only some trifles of their deceased mother 's . Rol . Roland And why keep it from them ? Their anxiety for it is very natural . Just . Justin Besides , mother told us never to part with it . Hub . Hubert ( Putting it into Justin 's bosom , having taken it from his own . ) There then  --  mind you do take very great care of it . Paul . Paul Do n't you be afraid of the steady one ! Now , Sir , we are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland We shall be at the Olive Field almost as soon as you . Paul and Just . Paul , Justin Good-bye ! Hub . and Marc . Hubert , Marceline Heaven preserve you ! Good-bye ! good-bye ! Music .  --  Roland leads the boys off .  --  Hubert and Marceline watch them , till out of sight , then exeunt . END OF ACT I. ACT II . Scene 1st.  --  On about the 3d wing , a high square tower with a vaulted staircase , much out of repair , leading to a door in the middle of the tower . About the 1st and 2d wings , under a spacious archway , an arbour , formed with lilac , honeysuckles , &c.; &c.; so disposed as in no way to intercept the vault of the staircase .  --  On the opposite side , ( about the 2d wing , ) a high terrace , below which is a side door , low and narrow , leading to a dungeon , with a grated window , &c.;  --  At the upper end appear the battlement-walls , decayed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , &c.; &c.; The entrance-gate to the castle , is supposed to be at the inhabited part .

Gaspard There he sits , as deaf as a post ! nine times out of ten , whoever pulls the bell , or blows the horn , I must trudge ; for master Francis there , never heeds them .  --  What a shame for him to be head-porter , with a sharp fellow like me under him !

Gregoire No , no , my lord ; an emissary announced from the Count de Croissy had not long to wait .  --  I placed your letter in the minister 's hand , and scarce an hour elapsed ere ' t was in the sovereign 's . Count . Count de Croissy What did you verbally explain to the high officer of state ? Greg . Gregoire Your being captured at sea , by the pirates of Algiers  --  your twelve years imprisonment in their dungeons ,  --  our method of escape , and arrival on your estates , as seeming wanderers ; both so worn and altered from captivity , no tenant recognized us !  --  Next I touched on what you , too soon , learnt , on our return  --  your  --  ( Hesitates. )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Croissy ( Strongly affected , but recovering himself . ) Did you , mention too , that I had induced this scoundrel steward , Roland , to employ me as keeper of my castle-gate ?

Gregoire What could it be but favourable , most favourable to your wishes ? Troops are marching from the capital to assert your rights .  --  This night , perhaps , or by to-morrow 's dawn , they may arrive .  --  Meantime , I have , by artifice , joined myself with these commercial travellers , from Paris , to cheer you , my dear , dear lord , with the intelligence . Count . Count de Croissy Meantime , too , Gregoire , I am in the Baroness ' power . Greg . Gregoire And must be cautious .  --  Let us break off , my lord :  --  be sure , I shall be hovering near .  --  Behind the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit ; then , when the troops arrive , you may head them as befits your rank . Count . Count de Croissy Oh ! friend ! can your fidelity to me ever be repaid ? Greg .

Exit . ( MUSIC . ) Roland . Roland ( Without . ) Come , boys , come !  --  My master-key will open it . ( He is heard opening the gate . ) Count . Count de Croissy The villain , Roland !  --  ( Looking out. ) and with him the very boys , whom , from mere compassion , I scared this morning , from this den of infamy !

The Count bows , and withdraws on the right hand  --  Roland observing him till he is out of sight . Stay where you are , my lads , I shall soon return . Exit on the left hand . Just . Justin Why , brother , that old man , that drove us away from the gate , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? so different , I could n't help wondering at it . Just . Justin And how cross Mr. Roland is to him ! Paul . Paul I suppose that 's to shew his consequence , because he 's the great lady 's great man .  --  Did you mind him ?  --  " Francis ! Francis ! " ( Imitating Roland 's tone and action . ) Lord ! ' t is mighty easy to be a great man , if ' t is only to be pompous .  --  For my party I hate your pompous folks . Just . Justin But , Paul ,  --  when this great lady comes , dear what shall we say to her ? Paul . Paul Why that puzzles me a bit :  --  Do n't you remember that Blaise the carrier , who used to travel to Geneva , told us once , that all your great folks there , did talk so flourishing  --  They have always " the honour to see one another ; and their visits flatter one another "  --  and all such round-about speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroness comes , if I do nt try something after that fashion . Just . Justin Do , Paul ; and you must speak first , though I am eldest ;  --  remember that !  --  Here she comes , Paul , I declare !  --  through that other court there of the castle . Paul . Paul No ! does she though !  --  I  --  I begin to feel a little queerish , somehow ! How fine she is dress 'd ! Here she comes  --  off with your hat , Justin ! Enter the Baroness , she looks at them and starts . Bar . The Baroness Those lineaments ! Do then De Crossy 's sons still live , or has my conscience conjured up a likeness ? Good day , boys , and welcome to the castle ! Paul . Paul Welcome to the  --  Lord , Justin , she 's very good natur 'd !  --  I a n't frightened at all now  --  hem ! ( Bowing to the Baroness . ) Your head-gentleman , Mr. Roland , told us , ma'am , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit from us , ma'am ,  --  and so we flattered ourselves , ma'am , that we would'nt do you the honour to refuse you , and  --  here we are , ma'am  --  Speak , Justin ! ( Pulling him forward . ) Just . Justin Yes  --  here we are , ma'am . Bar . The Baroness ( Aside . ) They talk like cottage-boys ; yet , with an intelligence that  --  and their air , how noble !  --  Their countenances seem to say , disperse our fog of ignorance , that we may shine in kingly courts , two stars of chivalry !  --  Roland informs me , you are adopted in Olival , by virtue of the established charity . Boys . Boys ( Bowing . ) Yes , ma'am ! Bar . The Baroness Were the noble Count de Croissy here ,  --  who , I fear , lives not , I think that his unerring judgment would discover in your appearance , my young friends , something above those peasants for whom this bounty was designed . Paul . Paul I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just . Justin And we shall receive the bounty very thankfully , ma'am , and pray for the Count as long as we live . Bar . The Baroness Yet , ' t is to me a gratifying duty to act as , I imagine , were he present , he would act himself . I must , therefore , supersede the worthy Hubert 's charge of you , and take you under my protection . Paul . Paul Ma'am ! Just . Justin Oh ! dear lady !  --  indeed , indeed we do n't deserve it . Bar . The Baroness Oh ! I am confident my hopes in you will be fulfilled .  --  You must receive through me , my amiable young friends , an education suited to those qualifications with which , I perceive , partial nature has gifted you . Paul . Paul Why , Justin ? ( Apart to each other . ) Just . Justin Oh ! Paul ! ( Apart to each other . ) Bar . The Baroness You shall lay aside your coarse apparel ; and to-morrow appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place you . Just . Justin What , what can we say , madam ? Paul . Paul Say !  --  thank you , thank you , dear , dear madam .  --  From this minute , Justin , you and I are two little gentlemen . He embraces Justin with all the riotous happiness of a boy , till the box falls from Justin 's bosom on the ground . At this moment , Enter Roland . Rol . Roland ( Observing the box , and speaking rapidly , in a whisper to the Baroness . ) Quick , and secure it ! ( The Baroness eagerly takes it up . ) Rol . Roland It is the box I told you of . Just . Justin I 'm sorry you should have stoop 'd for it , madam . ( Holding out his hand for it . ) Bar . The Baroness That hand so prettily held forth , must not be drawn back empty  --  Here , here is money for you both . ( Putting a purse into Justin 's hand . ) Roland will accompany you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy whatever trinkets please your fancy . Just . Justin Thank you , madam , but the box is  --  Rol . Roland ( Interrupting him . ) Should n't you like now , to see the castle gardens ? They are so beautiful ! Paul . Paul Are they ? Well I should like it of all things ! Just . Justin But the box , you know , Paul . ( Apart to him . ) Paul . Paul Pooh ! do you think such a grand lady as that wants to cheat us ? and we shall be back directly . Just . Justin So we shall , directly  --  Well , sir , then  --  ( To Roland . ) Rol . Roland Yonder is your way , boys .  --  ( Pointing . ) You can not miss it . Paul . Paul Come , Justin . ( MUSIC . ) Exeunt boys . Roland looks after them , till he seems to have ascertained they are out of sight and hearing ; he then turns eagerly to address the Baroness .  --  At this instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive him . He paces the courtyard to and fro , as in the capacity of porter ,  --  that should they happen to see him , they may not suspect him to be watching them ; which , during the action , he appears to do most minutely . Rol . Roland That casket quiets or confirms our present apprehensions . Bar . The Baroness ( Reading the superscription . ) " Never open this box , till Justin has reach 'd his 18th year . " Rol . Roland Let me inspect it , madam . ( Receiving the casket from her . ) Count . Count de Croissy ( Aside . ) What can this mean ? Bar . The Baroness May we not be observed here ? The Baroness and Roland glance their eyes to the right . The Count , who is behind them , paces on to the left , and they do not consequently see him . Rol . Roland No ; I have permitted the domestics to attend the feast .  --  No soul remains within the castle-walls , but your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; excepting Francis  --  and he is deaf and superannuated . During the above speech , Roland untwists the binding , and breaks the seal of the box . Bar . The Baroness Be expeditious then !  --  Rol . Roland ( Taking two portraits out of the box . ) Confusion !  --  the portraits of the Count de Croissy and Adeline his wife !  --  These brats then must be theirs . Count . Count de Croissy ( Clasping his hands in violent agitation . ) Oh ! heavens ! my own children ! The Count utters this in an under tone  --  but the act of clasping his hands produces a noise , which is heard by the Baroness and Roland .  --  They turn round , and as they turn , he resumes his walk in seeming inattention to them . Rol . Roland ( With a menacing tone and gesture  --  and waving his hand to motion him away . ) Fellow , begone ! The Count retires , and by this movement in sending away the supposed porter , the Baroness and Roland have approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man be dangerous ? He is eternally pressing upon our footsteps . Rol . Roland ( Searching the casket . ) Merely , the old fool 's zeal !  --  a driveller ! beneath your notice !  --  Stay , here 's a letter ! De Croissy now glides in and places himself behind an angle of the decayed tower  --  so that the Baroness and Roland , who are near the arbour , can not see him . Rol . Roland ( Having broken open the letter . ) ' T is written , as the date instructs , twelve years ago , and signed ( turning over the letter ) Baptiste !  --  Nay , then , our suspicions were too true .  --  That grey adherent to De Croissy did save the urchins ! Would he were now alive !  --  for if in our power  --  Bar . The Baroness Read ! read ! The Count at intervals shews himself from the angle of the tower , eagerly listening . Rol . Roland ( Reading . ) " Dearest sister .  --  I write this letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will recount to you a story of wickedness and terror , I send to you , my dear lord 's , the Count de Croissy 's sons , whom , thank heaven , I have saved !

Roland Madam , madam , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two boys is like the axe of justice hanging above our heads , suspended by a hair ! The mother is surely gone .  --  Wars have swept off , or seas , perhaps engulphed the father !  --  The children only , are in our way  --  and for our safety they must die ! Bar . The Baroness They are so interesting ! Could you use violence ? Count . Count de Croissy ( Aside . ) Not while this arm has power to defend them . Bar . The Baroness Beware , too Roland ! for they are now the adopted of the village ! their sudden disappearance would create suspicions , that  --  Rol . Roland Oh ! hush all these alarms  --  no suddenness , no violence , good lady ! a subtle , and slow poison  --  I have it ready in my apartment . Count . Count de Croissy ( Aside . ) Horrible villain ! Bar . The Baroness I never , never can consent ! Rol . Roland My own consent then must suffice .  --  Baroness , our fates are linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that you must follow . ( The boys heard without . ) Rol . Roland They come ! Bar . The Baroness I scarce dare look on them ! Enter Justin and Paul . Paul . Paul Well , of all the grand gardens I ever saw !  --  There 's fountains , and statues , and grottos  --  What 's that stout marble man , with a short sword in his hand , sir , at the end of the great walk ? Rol . Roland Oh ! a gladiator !  --  But , after your ramble , I suppose , you will be glad of some refreshment ? Paul . Paul Yes , if you please , sir . Just . Justin But we promised Mr. Hubert to be back , soon , brother , and we must keep our word . Rol . Roland Yes , yes ;  --  a slight repast , first , and  --  Should'nt you like it in that pretty arbour ?  --  Here , Francis . ( MUSIC . ) Roland beckons to Francis , and orders him to bring refreshments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to obey .  --  The boys are very busy in assisting the Count , as he brings on the things . Paul . Paul This will be a nice place , Justin , wo n't it ?  --  I did n't observe this arbour before .  --  Is n't it mighty pretty ? Just . Justin Very ; and to say the truth , I 'm so very hungry  --  Rol . Roland ( Apart , and going away . ) Most opportunely so . ( To boys . ) Bar . The Baroness Stay , Roland ; whither are you going ? Rol . Roland Only to bring them something , madam , as a slight addition to their meal . The Baroness catches him by the hand as he passes by her , and by action and countenance mutely supplicates him to spare the boys . Rol . Roland ( Disengaging himself . ) It must be so . Exit . As he goes out the Baroness appears violently agitated . The boys observe her . Just . Justin Only see , Paul , how she looks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , madam ? Bar . The Baroness ( Trying to collect herself . ) Yes  --  yes  --  boy ! Paul . Paul I 'm very glad of that , ma'am ; and to be sure , you can have nothing to make you uneasy , because you are so rich . Bar . The Baroness Do riches always give ease to the mind ? Paul . Paul Yes ,  --  rich folks must always be happy , for they can make every body else so . Just . Justin And if we were rich , we would try to be as good as you , ma'am , and do no harm to any body . Paul . Paul Harm , foolish !  --  I 'm sure the dear lady would not hurt a living creature for the world !  --  Oh ! here comes Mr. Francis ! Just . Justin Then , you and I , brother , must help him . ( MUSIC . ) The Count comes in with a tray , containing eatables , in one hand , and a wicket wine-basket in the other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of wine is in one of the partitions  --  The Baroness fixes her eye upon them ; so that the Count appears to wish in vain for an opportunity of speaking to them  --  The boys assisting him to unload .

Paul Here  --  take it  --  and here 's ham  --  and there 's salt  --  and here 's bread , and knives and forks  --  and there  --  Just . Justin Now it 's all snug  --  and the bottle of wine ; I 'll pop down on the ground before the arbour . ( Sets down the basket . ) Thank you , Mr. Francis ! Paul . Paul Now , then .

Roland ( Affecting surprise . ) Indeed !  --  I knew not that .  --  But this is very choice .  --  Come , then  --  there is good fellowship in exchange ; so you , my gay young friends , shall drink of mine , and I of yours . Count . Count de Croissy ( Aside . ) Monster ! Just . Justin Thank you , good sir ; it shall be just as you please .

The Baroness I can not bear to look upon them . ( Going round . ) Rol . Roland Stay , stay , I entreat you , madam . As Roland goes eagerly to the Baroness , the Count , who is near the arbour , ( as in readiness to wait on the boys , ) turns the basket , so that the partitions which hold the bottles are exactly reversed , and the poisoned wine now stands , of course , farthest from the boys , who do not notice him . Rol . Roland ( Apart to Baroness . ) You must remain ! Bar . The Baroness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand from her . ) Let me depart ! Exit . Just . Justin What ! is the Baroness gone , Mr. Roland ? Rol . Roland She will soon return . ( Going to them . ) In the mean time , we will drink her health . He motions to the Count , who is waiting on the boys , to go back  --  the Count retreats a little , standing behind Roland . Just . Justin If you please , sir . Paul . Paul Aye  --  with all my heart ; I should like something nice to drink now . Rol . Roland Come , then ,  --  we have exchanged , you know ; this nearest the arbour is for you ; and this for me . He fills the boys ' glasses with the wine next to them , and his own glass from the poisoned bottle , which is now next himself . Just . Justin What bumpers !  --  Lord , sir , we shall be fuddled . Paul . Paul Never you mind that , brother ; ' t is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes ; health and happiness to the Baroness ! Paul . Paul Health and happiness to the Baroness ! Just .

Justin And now , sir , if you please , we 'll go back to keep our promise with Mr. Hubert . Rol . Roland There is no hurry . Paul . Paul No hurry !  --  why , you told him you would bring us back almost directly . Rol .

Should they converse , and utter aught you think should be communicated , bring me instant intelligence .  --  Be vigilant . Exit . The guard paces near the door of the dungeon , out of sight of the boys .  --  Paul puts his head out of a window over the door of the tower . Paul . Paul Justin ! brother !

Marceline I do n't believe a word o n't . Hub . Hubert Peace , Marceline ! Rol . Roland ' T is shocking , Hubert , to find so much depravity in youth ! Hub . Hubert ( With pointed contempt . ) Sir ! ' t is shocking to think there should be a deep depravity any where . Rol . Roland You will find on them a purse . Marc . Marceline This moment , as they came back , they told us the Baroness had given them money .  --  Did n't they , neighbours ? Hub . Hubert They did . And if the charge rests only on this presumptive proof , let it never be said in any civilized country , that the dispensations of the affluent to orphan poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theft on the receivers . Just . Justin Here 's the purse , Sir . ( Giving it to Hubert . ) He knows very well the great lady gave it us with her own hand ; for he saw her . We have never opened it yet . Rol . Roland ( To Hubert . ) Feel its weight : ' t is full of gold .  --  Think you the Baroness ' true and regulated bounty , would lavish , at first sight , so large a sum on boys , to whom , this morning , a few doits obtained from charity upon their journey , appeared a treasure ? ' T is not possible . Just . Justin Possible or not , we will go back with you now ! Our characters for honesty are dearer to us than life ; ' t was all our dear mother had to leave us , and  --  Paul . Paul That 's true ; and for her sake , we will preserve it .

Rol . Roland Be it so ! then , on ! ( MUSIC . ) Hubert takes the boys by the hand  --  encouraging them . Roland precedes them  --  the castle guard follow ; and they range , taking a sweep , to march out at the back  --  when a shout and flourish of trumpets is heard  --  and , in an instant , the whole back of the scene is covered with troops  --  Gregoire , in a military dress , at their head . Rol . Roland What are these troops ? Greg . Gregoire ( Advancing . ) The King 's ! Obey , then ! Rol . Roland Are you their leader ? Greg . Gregoire I ! good Mr. Roland , deign to remember me ; and cast your eyes upon an humble follower of the Count de Croissy ; somewhat more faithful to him , than yourself . Hub .

Roland Well , well , embrace them , Count , you will not long hold them in your fraternal arms ! a subtle poison now is running through  --  Count .

( Roland is taken off by 6 guards . ) My friends of Olival  --  Hub . Hubert ( Kneeling . ) Welcome , dear master ! Count . Count de Croissy Gregoire ! Hubert ! to you my gratitude is due ; and my thanks to all those , who have afforded protection to the WANDERING BOYS . Back matter FINIS .
