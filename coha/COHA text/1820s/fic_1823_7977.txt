Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : Dedicatory Poem . INSCRIBED TO THE FRIENDS AND PATRONS OF THE AUTHOR . from The genius of oblivion ( 1823 ) NO mercenary muse inspires my lay ; But Gratitude would her deep off'ring pay  --  Her patrons and her friends would number o'er , And , kneeling to the Orphan 's God , implore A blessing , pure as Pity 's tear refin 'd , Rich as the treasures of the liberal mind , Lasting as virtue , large as faith , to rest On every feeling heart , and generous breast , That , quick to hear , and prompt to grant relief , Scarce waited till bereavement told her grief , But patronized a muse unknown to fame , And gave to hope , an energy , an aim : Benevolence so delicate , so dear , That words express not , but the grateful tear .  --  To those who with their bounties , praises bring , The muse , with pride , her warmest thanks shall sing . Ye Maidens , fair as good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye can not heal ; For you , may Spring 's first blushing roses blow , And on your cheeks , Health 's sweeter roses glow ; With innocence your guard , and peace your guest , In blessing others , may you still be blest . And Mothers , while your infant charge you tend , And with caresses soft instruction blend , And treasure up each prattler 's tale with care , As sweetest music for their father 's ear  --  Oh , you are happy ! happy may you be ! Such happiness no more will smile for me . And may those generous Youths , who boast a mind Learning may grace , but nature hath refin 'd , Who felt a widow 's woe , a woman 's claim , And gave , from sympathy , a patron name , Feel the proud throb that conscious merit knows , When genius treads the path that virtue shows , Till manhood rip'ning every youthful hope , They rise , their parents ' pride , their country 's prop Within those academic halls they grace , Then haply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindle , when the names they see , That aided , blest their orphan infancy . But chief doth to the Mystic Band belong The hallowed tribute of my grateful song . Ye , whose souls swell 'd with sympathy sincere , When bending o'er a brother 's early bier , And when his widow 'd wife and infants sued , Could feel the " luxury of doing good . " Oh ! may you still , in every fortune , know The peace approving conscience can bestow ; And heaven , to crown its bounteous blessing , send Each faithful heart , a dear and better friend , That still , though earth should frown , and life were fled , Would love you living , or lament you dead . And lives there one , who , with ungen'rous part , Will spurn this offering of the broken heart ! Whose envy of the man , he living , fear 'd , Now to his helpless family transferr 'd , Would crush them in the dust , a sacrifice , That his vain race might on their ruin rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let me hail thee , Charity divine ! Chief of the heavenly sisters , from thy throne Oh , bend , and bless each heart that throbs thine own ! My Friends , my Patrons , bless with life and love , With hope below , and happiness above . Though my lov 'd country should reward my toil , And on my lay , approving , deign to smile , And Taste bestow the meed the muses prize , And Fancy all her day-dreams realize ; Still , still your patronage shall be my boast  --  You kindly gave it , when ' t was needed most . Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE GENIUS OF OBLIVION . A Tale . from The genius of oblivion ( 1823 ) CANTO FIRST . Poem section The freshening breeze o'er ocean blew , And curling vapors upward drew , As morn , in robe of misty grey , Peep 'd forth  --  the harbinger of day : The sea-fowl rais 'd her plaintive cry , And coursed the wave in circles high ; Or dashed the flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , often vain . The fisherman trill 'd his merry lay ; No cares disturb his active day ; And labor roused the village train , And shook his unshorn locks again . The flowers , that droop with nightly fears , A kiss of Sol soon dries their tears ; And all is fresh and fair to see , As smiles on lip of infancy ;  --  E'en sickness lifts her cheek , so pale , And fancies health may wing the gale ; And scarce a heart so cold , forlorn , That glows not with the glow of morn . Poem section Beneath an oak , with thoughtful eye , Young Ormond watch 'd the kindling sky And there on many a morn was he , And still , as if ' t were novelty , He dwelt with that unsated gaze , Which , far more eloquent than praise , Pours the beholder 's spirit forth , E'er thought can yield to language birth ; Till , from th ' enthusiastic tone , Each movement of the mind is known .

Yet neighbors call 'd him " truant boy , " " Who spurn 'd control , and scorn 'd employ ; " Because no trifling play or jest E'er gave his boyish pleasures zest ;  --  The lonely ramble he preferr 'd , Where human voice was never heard ; With eager step , and wild delight , He climb 'd the mountain 's dizzy height ; Or days , beside the glassy brook , He lay and watch 'd his floating hook ; Yet still , when to repay his toil , He chanc 'd to snare the finny spoil , With sympathy he mark 'd its pain , And cast the struggler home again . Then would he choose some curious flower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , and trace design , Th ' impression of the Power divine . And to that One all great , all good , His spirit only bowed , subdued ! His fellow men , for much he thought On man ,  --  his end and duty sought But saw him stoop from aims divine Saws reason kneel at folly 's shrine ; And fair integrity give place To bribes , or fawns , or cunning base ; And vice and ignorance parade , Whilst worth and wisdom pine in shade ; And Slander 's arrows , foul as hell , That pierce with griefs incurable , By Envy forged , and Malice sent , Oft wound the good , the innocent  --  Oppression 's ruthless gauntlet fall , And peace and safety weep their all .

' T was wrong , perhaps : the mighty mind , That soars with pinions unconfin 'd , And searches , with discerning skill , The cause , effect of good and ill , Traces the harmony that springs From seemingly discordant things , And finds the universal plan Is love to God , and love to man . Then , lest its knowledge mar its peace , It still must judge with tenderness ; For heaven 's pure truths may be discern 'd , And priz 'd , by weak as well as learn 'd : Unfathom 'd depth of glorious grace ! That links all being  --  fills all space . Pride may , at times , with knowledge dwell , As men are frail in court or cell ; But empty heads its favorites are ; With dress attendance , title , glare , Self-love aspires , like balloon light , As airy , and as useless quite  --  Yet hears the world this clamorous crew , Nor gives to modest worth his due ; But , with some trite and trifling rule , Dooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ormond , if his mind approv 'd , Could hear " the world 's dread laugh " unmov 'd , Nor o'er his philosophic soul , Its spleen or censure held control . Mirth never formed his happiness , Nor passing compliments his peace ; But solitude was company , Where his wild fancy sported free . And ne'er , in any clime or age , Did Nature ope so fair a page To awe , enrapture , elevate , With the sublime , surprising , great , As where untamed by man , she reigns O'er sky-wrapp 'd mountains , boundless plains , With rivers laced , whose sweeping tide Makes eastern streams like riv'lets glide ; For Nature 's dress deep forests spread , Where mammoths made their lonely bed ; And at her call , earth , ocean , air , Her table heap with viands rare ;  --  When Sirius glows , her thirst to slake , Her cup 's Superior 's foaming lake , Whose wide unrivalled grandeur mocks All Europe 's narrow seas and lochs .

No wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared his sight ; A tear perhaps , was gath'ring there  --  Then rose his home , so calm , so fair ; Like vanished joys , unprized till gone . He sighed  --  but now the ceaseless sun Warned him to snatch a farewell view ; Turning , he breathed a warm adieu . But the sequestered haunt had power To soothe him in the moodiest hour , Like holy charm , it lulled to rest Each stormy passion of the breast ; For swells a heart , or strives a will To rage , when Nature cries ' be still ! ' With moral pointed spreads her page To woo the wild , instruct the sage , Reprove the wayward , rouse the dull , And stamp th ' immortal truth of Soul ! Kind monitor  --  like conscience , given To preach a God , and point to heaven . Poem section ' T was now that animated time , When spring rejoicing rules our clime In beauty robes the youthful year , No artist 's pencil rivals here . On earth is there a soul so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warms not , melts not , when the grove Is fragrance , harmony and love ? Not so our trav'ler 's ; every view Was pleasure , as the season new ; The crystal brook , where osiers sip , The rose as sweet as beauty 's lip ; The lofty oak a monarch frown 'd , But tender woodbine clasped him round , And graced , for her support , the tree , Like woman in society . From blossomed boughs the songsters sent . Sublimed as their fine element , Hosannas in each matin song , Or brushed with rapid wing along , To lure the stranger foot , that near Their slender dwellings , raised their fear . With nut in mouth , and glance so sly , The roguish squirrel darted by ; A little thief  --  yet steals he nought , Save what instinctive nature taught ; Her law his rule , absolve him then ; Reason and conscience are for men . Poem section But past are soon the glade and grove , Those scenes of bloom , of peace and love . As frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast there , When Ormond left those haunts of bliss , Where Spring was bride to Happiness , And o'er the Alleghany 's steep His rugged course prepared to keep .  --  And wary was his footing held , Slowly , yet oft to pause compell 'd , Where scattered fragments , tempest riven , And from the rock 's huge masses driven , Lay heap 'd , and choked the broken path , Whilst yawned some horrid gulph beneath . There stubborn guilt must shrink to see One step might reach Eternity ! Poem section But Ormond passed unmoved , or sought From every change new fund for thought . The cloud that clothed the mountain 's top Was emblem of life 's shifting hope  --  At every view its shades were lost , As every hour man 's hopes are cross 'd : And while he reached one pinnacle , Still more and more before him swell ; He mused  --  ' Ambition here must sigh , ' ' ' T is thus his wishes multiply . ' And oft he lingered to explain Some fissure 's deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That guides the planets in their course , And draws each pebbly particle Within the rock 's huge mass to dwell . He gains the summit  --  boundless mind Then bursts and revels unconfin 'd ! Nor for the languid senses waits , Nor pauses , nor discriminates , Till all the mighty round she flies  --  No barrier , save the bending skies ! Poem section And poor the joys that wait a throne To Ormond 's , when he called his own Such varied prospect rich and grand , Where art and nature , hand in hand , Their treasures or their toil display . Here hamlets , farms beneath him lay , Bright'ning with glow of vernal sun  --  There rivers rushed all foaming on ; Or winding through the meadows gay , As sleeping warrior , calm they lay . At once were groves and forests seen , And swelling pastures stretched between ; The mines whence freedom draws her wealth , And industry repays with health ; And where each yeoman reigns a lord : Such spot , can eastern world afford ? Poem section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles , to merit blind , The shapeless clouds in volumes vast , Borne onward by the rushing blast , Their dark and heavy shadows flung , And o'er the mountain landscape hung ; Still gleams of light would intervene , As loth to leave the lovely scene  --  These bright as smiles of pity be , Those dark as frowns adversity . And now , as war would rend the sky , The quivering coils of lightning fly  --  Low , deep the thunder burst around , And cave and cliff reverbed the sound ! The gathering storm drove fierce and fast ; But , like the spirit of the blast , A cloud his robe , a crag his seat , Thus Ormond 's strains the tempest greet . Ormond 's Song . 1 . Oh , say , hast thou seen , with a thrilling emotion , The mountain mist roll its dark form ? Or listened , with feelings of awe and devotion , As elements mixed in the gloomy commotion , And loud rose the voice of the storm ! 2 . Then , in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speck of earth ! Possessions were folly , and pleasures were madness  --  From heaven  --  with mingled contrition and gladness , The soul hail 'd in triumph her birth ! " What make ye here ?

" " A trav'ler , ha ! well , come with me , " My roof , my fire , my fare , are free " To strangers in such boisterous hour ; " Come , hasten  --  yonder cloud will pour " In torrents like the cat'racts wrath .

Why here , where whirlwinds hold their court , And clouds and storms in vag'ries sport ; Whilst man their empire quits with awe , And yields to nature 's changeless law ; And hungry brute unsated flies , And stinted vegetation dies  --  Lone , sterile all , should choose to dwell These Hunters in their hermit cell , Not here it boots us to explain ; A wilder theme demands our strain .

Visions like these o'er Ormond 's soul , In grandeur , or in beauty , stole  --  He mus 'd on these , and ' neath his head Felt not the rocky pillow spread ; Nor heard the groaning wind complain , Nor listened to the driving rain ; And fix 'd at morning light was he , Through pathless wilds to search and see , And ponder o'er this mystery .

How earnest , yet how impotent  --  To know from whence , and who these were ? How came  --  how perished they ?

When lo ! on his abstracted soul A swelling note of music stole ! Solemn as midnight 's deepest hour ; Yet sweet as breath of morn its power ! It trembled  --  paused  --  and hark ! again  --  Was it a hymn from the starry train ?

But pleasure , with electric sway , Presided in that circle gay ; Nor fears , nor cares disturb their mirth ; And few such blissful scenes on earth , Where happiness with splendor vies To form an earthly paradise . And whilst of nectar , gods might taste , The golden goblets foaming pass 'd , Exhilaration 's laughing train Commenced the revels of their reign  --  All pleased , all pleasing ; joys that be Reciprocal , and though they flee Lightly as gossamer , are still An antidote for present ill .

But where will that lone bark be driven  --  The anchor hope , the compass heaven ! See how the dark waves , rippling , break , While flashes far the foaming wake ! Loud swells the breeze , recedes the shore , And rowers quit the useless oar . Will morn some sheltered harbor show , Where rest , refreshment wait ? ah , no Bright glows the sun ; but billows blue Still bound the wide horizon 's view ; Onward , and onward , see she bears : Nights frown  --  days dawn , nor land appears  --  Or seen , ' t is but the rugged rock , Where eddies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unvarying gale Westward drives the fleeting sail ; And skies serene , and billows smooth , Smil 'd , as they would their terrors soothe ; And stretching round the vast expanse , Far as the straining sight could glance , No object , not a speck was seen , Save that blue sky , those billows green . So calm , yet awfully sublime , It looked a resting place for Time , Where , leagued with silence , he might reign ; Nor change disturb the wide domain . But now to greet and safely guide This wonder o'er the lonely tide , Around see dolphins circling play , Then gaily darting , lead the way ; As sea-nymphs ' fore their goddess ' car , When Neptune 's trident sway 'd afar ; And from their writhen shells the song Might still entrancing steal along . 1 .

Within the gay , umbrageous hall , All rich with Flora 's treasure , Shall Cora on her handmaids call , And tread the mazy measure ; Or list , reclining ' mid the grove , While summer gales are sighing , The warbling melody of love , To nature 's smiles replying . 4 . The city 's haunts are fair to see Where wealth attends on fashion ; But nature 's lonely majesty Ennobles every passion .

Athwart my way , The ice-hills lay , As magic cities high ; And palaces , And towers arise , Where glittering colors vie . 5 .

SECOND PILGRIM 'S Song . 1 . My days have been to suff'ring given , Unknown my sorrows , save to heaven , Since wealth and freedom lost ; An exile from my native land , A captive to the robber band , I roam 'd Arabia 's coast . 2 .

How ample is Flora 's fair page , Array 'd by the skill of the Swede  --  ' T is the wisdom of youth or of age , This volume of nature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd , All rich did its beauties appear ;  --  I thought that the study I lov 'd  --  ' T was his accents I listened to hear . My books now neglected may lie , Or opened , I gaze but to weep , For mute is his voice , and his eye Forever is shrouded in sleep  --  Oh , death ! why so stern in thy sway ? So eager frail mortals to call ? Like the rose , they may flourish to-day  --  The morrow must witness their fall . They fall , are forgotten , the earth Doth their names and their ashes receive  --  But my husband , thy mem'ry and worth , Embalmed in my bosom , shall live  --  Nor death can the union destroy , That 's linked with the life of the mind ; We shall meet in those mansions of joy , Where love is divinely refin 'd : And soon will that moment arrive , For time never ceases his flight ; Yet who for existence would strive , If life were but winter and night ? And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its warm radiance shed , While the spot at each turning , I see , Where he sleeps in his cold , narrow bed . June 14 , 1823.
