The following little dramatic piece was written by the author , for the purpose , of having it represented , by her youthful pupils  --  It was never intended for publication , but at the particular request of some of her friends , she has consented to add it , to this collection  --  As it was designed , for a school exhibition , and calculated to the capacities of children , the plan and ideas are necessarily contracted . The situation , of the unfortunate Irish Emigrant , is too well known , for any one to suppose , that the scenes here delineated are the mere dreams of fancy  --  The American , ( though in the full possession of his darling Liberty ) can never fail , of commiserating the destiny of the Irish Exiles , when he thinks of what would have been his fate , had , the plans of our Washington and the fortitude of our revolutionary patriots failed . There is a link , which chains the heart to its native country , that never can be broken  --  We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Irishman receives here , his soul should still linger , in fond affection , around his native isle . And does he not often look there with delight ? England is taught , by the eloquence of a Philips , to feel that she is indebted , to oppressed Ireland , for her brightest ornaments in the senate and in the field . We trust , she will ere long listen to the dictates of justice , reason , her own honor , and the voice of the world , by emancipating the Irish Catholic , from his present , degrading slavery . Mrs. Balfour , Irish Exile . Evelina , her daughter , Irish Exile . Mrs. Merton , the wife of an American farmers . Emily , her child . Adeliza , her child . Alfred , her child . Miss Armyne , a young Lady of Fortune . Scene  --  The farm house of Mr. Merton , in a small inland town in America . Day  --  4th of July . Main text SCENE FIRST . EVELINA BALFOUR Evelina  --  ( alone . ) Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray this weakness to my mother  --  I blush for myself , and would fly from that accusing throb which proclaims to my conscious heart , that it is envy which at this moment drives my brain almost to distraction  --  While all here is joy , festivity and gladness  --  while Liberty 's holy seal is impressed on every brow ,  --  my soul in kindred fondness nees but thy chains , O lost unhappy Ireland  --  Yes , yes ;  --  there is more  --  Methinks at this moment , I hear the dying groans of my beloved father and Henry best of brothers  --  Emmett too , my noble martyred cousin  --  Merciful Heaven help me to support these heart rending remembrances  --  ENTER MRS . BALFOUR . Mrs. Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  Evelina , my sweet child , for one day at least , let that clouded brow of thine be illumined with a sunny smile  --  We will not forget Ireland , but we must not be ungrateful  --  Our tears can not break her chains , nor will the life of my precious Evelina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ransom to her unfeeling oppressors  --  Arouse you my child , remember there is but one tie that binds your parent to earth . Our gratitude due to that land , which has given us an asylum . This is Columbia 's national birth day , and shall our dejection damp the sweet peace that reigns in every heart ? Evelina Evelina  --  Forgive me , mother , but give me a draught of Lethe then  --  Bid me forget , that such , and so lovely , Ireland might also have been . Hide from my wandering fancy , the once verdant plains and silvery streams of our native land , now crimsoned with the blood of her bravest sons , our dearest friends . Then , then I will rejoice , with happy , blessed America . Mrs. Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  And does Evelina no longer say in the spirit of resignation  --  " God thy will be done . " Has she so soon forgot the parting words of our noble Emmett ? " Ireland " said he " is no longer a place for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liberty still rests  --  There shall my Evelina find repose , in her protecting bosom "  --  Evelina Evelina  --  Cease , dearest Mother cease  --  I will think of the noble sainted Emmett ; I will endeavour to be like him , and I shall find comfort in the exertion . Mrs. Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  ( Aside . ) Ah sweet child of my heart , thou art already too much like him for thy own peace of mind . ( to Evelina . ) How much reason have we to thank Heaven , who has given us protection with this kind hospitable family . You must join in their celebration . Emily just informed me that Miss Armyne is to be a spectator  --  You would like to appear to the best advantage before this tender friend ? Evelina Evelina  --  Name her not Mother  --  O how cruelly she has deceived me  --  With a heart warm and enthusiastic how often have I dwelt with peculiar pleasure on that hour , ( which I believed would yet arrive ) when my heart should beat with kindred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time , did I meet with Miss Armine ! We were strangers and friendless , she appeared like an angel of light and almost made us forget our sorrows . While she clasped me to her bosom , and impressed the warm kiss of tenderness on my cheek , it was re-coloured by the animation of hope  --  my heart bounded with a lighter throb , for it felt that it could now mix with a congenial mind , whatever was the difference Fortune had thrown into the scale . Mrs. Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  And now you believe she was but deceiving you ?  --  Indeed I can not think so . Time may yet unfold this mystery , and present her to you , fond , faithful and sincere , as we once believed her to be . Evelina Evelina  --  My dearest Mother , I do not think she meant to deceive us , she was herself deceived . It was the exiled daughters of Erin that first interested her . With all the warmth of her animated and impetuous feelings , she expected to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much  --  In this she was mistaken . She found an unfortunate , but not an uncommon person . When she tendered me her heart , I could not but too keenly feel the mortifying difference which Fortune had thrown between us , as a bar ( so it seemed ) to our affections . But while she half convinced me , where hearts are congenial this world 's dross is nothing ; by a sudden and cruel neglect she made me rightly judge my first conclusion true . Mrs. Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  Well yonder comes one who knows no guile . Innocent herself , she believes all the world the same . Incapable of art , she reveals every thought of her heart , with the sweetest simplicity  --  We never should have dreamed of finding such refinement of manners , as distinguishes the family of our amiable host , in a simple peasant 's hut in Ireland  --  Bnt so true it is , that while Liberty refines the cottage , as well as the place ; Slavery , with a blasting breath defaces all . ( Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting tears which you would conceal from your child , convince her , that like her you feel all our Erin 's wrongs  --  But can feeble women avenge her ? Alas no  --  then be it mine to imitate thy noble , thy self commanding fortitude . SCENE SECOND . ENTER EMILY MERTON  --  MISS . BALFOUR AND EMILY . Emily Emily  --  Blessings on you my noble friend , I dare not enquire of your health , your pallid countenance has told me already . I hope you will not be ill to day . Evelina Evelina  --  My sweet girl , it is long since my cheek has worn the rose that now plays on yours . A walk in the garden will quite refresh me . But methinks you look uncommonly happy to-day , may I guess the cause ? Emily Emily  --  No , no , you need not guess , for I am not ashamed to tell you  --  This is the Anniversary of our National Independence  --  the day on which , bursting her chains , America took her seat among the nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a meteor of light to view  --  It was then that he and his compeers in the field and council , received the tribute of heartfelt gratitude from a united and rejoicing people . My father was one , who fought for the liberties of his country ; and though now confined to the smaller duties of cultivating his little farm , that day can never be forgotten . He has always celebrated it , in his own way , in the little garden on the top of the hill . I am sent to request Miss Balfour to join in our ceremonies  --  We have selected you for a particular part . You are to personate the Goddess of Liberty . Evelina Evelina  --  You forget , my dear Emily , when you request me to personate Liberty , that my country is groaning under the weight of her chains . Reverse the case and tell me if Emily would forget her America thus ?  --  Emily Emily  --  Hark ! a cherub sings  --  ( music and singing behind the scenes . ) Cherub Cherub Cease , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry thy tears Thy Emmett whispers words of peace , And points aloft , where Heaven appears . Behold , Columbia 's hero there , And mark his mild majestic eye , With Emmett join 'd in upper air , They guard their friends , from realms on high . For blissful , is that holy hour When souls congenial meet above ; Then weep not Erin 's drooping flower , But wait the kindred call of love . While Erin 's martyr joins aloft , With Washington where sorrows cease , Let Erin 's daughter mild and soft , Partake the joys of free-born Peace . Evelina Evelina  --  ( With suppressed emotion , ) Your artifice has succeeded , I will join you  --  But from whence did those enchanting strains proceed ? I could almost believe them celestial . Emily Emily  --  Well as you please ,  --  but yonder comes the little seraph minstrels , without harp or lyre  --  But remember old Eolius sends his music amongst us  --  Today he has given Zephyrus who wafts a thousand strains on every sighing breeze  --  Now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine , were fairies from your own little island of green , I should be quite happy  --  but I am wasting time  --  Farewell  --  ( exit . ) SCENE THIRD . ENTER ALFRED AND ADELIZA MERTON . ( Carrying baskets of flowers and evergreens . ) Evelina Evelina  --  Fairies indeed  --  sweet children , innocent and happy . Well Alfred what is to be done with all those flowers and evergreen ? Do you intend to rig all the family in the same manner with yourself and sister ? Adeliza 's fine eyes are quite obscured , I scarce know her . Alfred Alfred  --  We are first to trim your room finely , and then the little temple for our celebration . Adeliza Adeliza  --  Why , Miss . Balfour , here is not half as many as we have brought . We have been three times before , and are to go again for our dress wreaths . Evelina Evelina  --  And who , my dear children , bade you bring those beautiful branches hither ? Adeliza Adeliza  --  We go by Emily 's directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I selected for you myself , because I thought it resembled you , so pale , so lovely  --  when I plucked it , the dew fell from it in large drops . " Thus , said I , to Alfred have I seen Miss . Balfour , so kind and good shed more tears than has now fallen from my rose "  --  And thus I will always kiss them off thy cheek . Evelina Evelina  --  Enchanting child ! here surely is no deceit . Artless and innocent , how lightly beats thy heart . Yes just and true were the words of HIM who said " suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not , for of such is the kingdom of God "  --  Well Alfred can you tell me what is to be done to day , in the little woodbine temple on the hill ? Alfred Alfred  --  Yes , we are to have as many ladies as there are states  --  You are to be a Goddess , and Adeliza , with two of our little cousins are to be graces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you  --  We are to march up the Elm Walk  --  Evelina Evelina  --  But you forget to mention yourself Alfred  --  Alfred Alfred  --  Well wait , I have not come to it yet that is what made me hurry so  --  Emily , I forgot to mention her too  --  She is to be the Genius of Ireland  --  Evelina Evelina  --  The Genius of Ireland ? Alfred Alfred  --  I do n't wonder you start so . I guess Miss Balfour could act that part better herself  --  I 'll run and see if Emily does not want me  --  Adeliza can finish the story better than I  --  Adeliza Adeliza  --  Dear Miss Balfour , Emily I know , had rather you should hear nothing about it , till you see with your own eyes . But I will tell you , a young Irishman is to speak to us . Evelina Evelina  --  A young Irishman , what is his name ? Adeliza Adeliza  --  I do n't remember ; it was Emily 's plan to please you . Then we are to sing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  By Emily , does Emily write Poetry ? Adeliza Adeliza  --  She writes sometimes , for her friends . Did not Miss Balfour know that the little piece we just sung was Emily 's composition ? Evelina Evelina  --  No indeed  --  Excellent , excellent girl , how much does my heart owe you for this kindness  --  Adeliza you need tell me no more  --  Your sister may have her way . Let the other part come unexpectedly . Adeliza Adeliza  --  Well , I am glad of that , for I would always do as Emily wishes , and as Miss Balfour wishes also . I 'll away after Alfred , and bid him come and help me arrange these flowers . Evelina Evelina  --  How do this amiable family entwine themselves around my heart , and give to it new life and new enjoyments . How sweet to love and be beloved ! This rose ,  --  I will wear it next my heart . It is styled the emblem of innocence . Grant , Gracious , Heaven , that the semblance the dear child made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspotted as this lovely flower !  --  Ah Adeliza , like thy rose I was torn from my native bed , and Erin 's green sod witnesses the tears that dewed it , in that distracting hour . But I must think no more of it . I will repay these good people 's kindness with returning love . I will imitate my beloved mother , and no longer in wild despair , be deaf to her kind solicitation . America shall be my country , though Ireland and her wrongs can never , never be forgotten . Yet I will say in spirit and truth with my excellent parent  --  God thy will be done . SCENE FOURTH . MRS . MERTON Mrs. Merton  --  ( alone . ) How sweet to see the smile of heart felt happiness re-illumine the brows of those , who have almost banished hope from their bosoms . How will the heart of my lov 'd Emily expand with rapture when she beholds , the noble Evelina clasped in the arms of a brother ( to appearance ) like Lazarus raised from the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to witness such moments as these  --  Spirit of our sainted Washington ? dost thou not smile on thy children and the exile alike , on such a day as this ? ( ENTER MRS . ARMYNE . ) Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  Miss Armyne ! Miss Armyne Miss Armyne  --  Do not speak and look surprised . Give me your hand , to be plain my business is not with you . Where is my charming little exile ? I want to see her and clasp her to my bosom . I must witness this meeting between her and her restored brother  --  It will be quite in the novel style . Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  Indeed ? I concluded you had long since lost all interest in the charming exile ; at least I believe she thinks so ; I am now convinced , that the gay and fashionable world have but little time to think of those lovely flowers , which bloom in secret , and waste their sweetness in the desert air . Miss Armyne Miss Armyne  --  You are too severe , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I always am , ) the romance of the thing has worn off in some degree . I always like some adventure quite out of the common line ; and a native of the sweet little island of green , was something of a curiosity you know . But really Mrs. Merton , you must be sensible what a busy time a person in my situation must lead . Visiting and visited , balls , parties , and rides  --  and if , without a breach of politeness , I could have introduced Miss Balfour to the gentry of my grade in life , I should have been quite happy too , I assure you  --  But this you know , was next to impossible  --  Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  I can assure you Miss Armyne , I know of no one that would not be honored by Miss Balfour 's acquaintance . If it is in the gaudy tinsel of fortune , that you , and your friends look for true worth , Miss Balfour will soon be possessed of that , which though it will not enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable world . Miss Armyne Miss Armyne  --  What do you mean ? Is her brother then rich ? How did he escape when they thought him dead ? It must be a marvellous story , I am very sure ,  --  quite sentimental and affecting , no doubt  --  You need not preface your tale with  --  Ye who have tears , prepare to shed them now  --  for mine are ready to flow with the picture which fancy has even now wrought  --  Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  ( smiling ) You may save them for another time . My story will be too short for the display of much sensibility . Mr. Balfour , the night before he was to have been executed , was led from prison by a friend , who dared only in private to be so . A part of the wreck of his large fortune was also saved , and embarked with himself , on board a ship bound for America . Here he will soon embrace his Mother and Sister . But see , the party are moving up the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the win . Miss Armyne Miss Armyne  --  Which I would not for worlds  --  adieu , adieu .  --  ( Exit . ) Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  What an inconsistent being ,  --  the sport of fashion , her passions are whirled by every gale that blows from the grand point  --  As the great of the world think  --  this , and this alone can give happiness  --  How different does Evelina appear !  --  I shall soon see if in prosperity , she will forget those who have loved her in adversity  --  but this can never be , Evelina will be Evelina still . SCENE FIFTH . MRS . MERTON AND EMILY . Emily Emily  --  Yes dearest Mother , it was a blissful meeting . I contrived to have that little ode of mine sung first .  --  Evelina 's feelings were harmonised  --  All the nobleness and sweetness of her disposition shone in every feature . The speaker arose ;  --  at first his voice was low and broken  --  but in a few moments he became animated , and while his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever pictured of a Demosthenes or Cicero , America and Ireland passed at once in review before us . Mrs. Merton Mrs. Merton  --  What  --  and did not Evelina discover him immediately ? Emily Emily  --  I watched her varying countenance , as she listened to his voice , for his face she could not see ( as he had turned it purposely from her . ) A slight tinge of the rose once more reanimated her colourless cheeks .  --  Again it faded and left a deathlike paleness  --  Every limb trembled with emotion , and as she leaned forward and said  --  " Emily do you believe the spirits of the departed are ever permitted to visit these earthly scenes ? " Balfour turned to catch a glance of that beloved being  --  In a moment , the fears of the one , and the eloquence of the other were lost in the brother and sister . A mother clasped them both to her bosom , as they were twined in each other 's arms  --  Beloved parent , I can no more  --  Your imagination will easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balfour Mrs. Balfour  --  My dearest friends , how can I thank you ? I have once more the hope of seeing sweet peace re-animate the cheek of my darling Evelina ; God of Heaven , THOU hast taken from me my country  --  Thou hast taken the early partner of all my joys and sorrows , friends and fortune , but THOU hast left my children yet  --  Enough , I thank THEE  --  ENTER EVELINA . Evelina Evelina  --  Come my friends , let us thank the Giver of all Good for his mercies . O how ungrateful was I to doubt that guardian watchfulness which presides over all HIS works . Emily , dearest Emily , you shall hence-forth be the friend of my heart ; and while I rejoice with you over the happy prospects of free America , you shall sometimes retire to weep with me for my ever loved , though enslaved Ireland . Let us kneel and raise our thankful hearts on high . They all kneel as the curtain falls . FINIS .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
