txt ORATIONS , addresses , eulogies , and the like , come upon us so thickly , that we find it impossible to do them any justice , within the compass prescribed to us , either by a formal criticism , or general notice . The number of pamphlets of this description , which have been laid on our table during the last quarter , if brought under review in detail , would afford matter more than enough to fill up the entire pages of our journal . This multiplicity renders a selection , which shall do equal justice to all , by no means easy , even if we had much more room to spare , than our accustomed limits will allow . We hope this will be a sufficient apology to publishers and authors , for not acknowledging their liberality in supplying us with works of this kind , in a more substantial manner , than merely inserting their titles in our list of new publications . From the nature of our work , which is meant to contain , not a review of books only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rarely do more than this with the mass of new books . The American press is becoming so fruitful , that a short notice of every work would so much encumber our pages , as to leave little or no room for the execution of its main purpose , and we must be contented with making what we deem the less sacrifice . It is our aim , however , to bring before the public whatever is most valuable , and most worthy of observation , in the literary as well as the political progress of the country . But , as we can not do everything , we are fully sensible that our judgment may not always guide us to do what is best , and herein we claim as much indulgence , as the good nature of our readers shall incline tl*m to think we deserve , and no more . We call attention to Mr Hunter 's oration , chiefly to bring out a few historical facts , which the author has interwoven with his discourse , relating to the State of Rhode Lsland . Beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Williams , the founder of Providence Plantations , the learned and popular divine of Salem , insisted for freedom of conscience in worship , even " to Papists and Arminians ; " with security of civil peace . He was banished in 1*34-5 , as a dis // lurber of the peace of the church and commonwealth . You know the rest- I dare not dilate upon it . The water of that spring near which he took refuge , overlooked from the neighboring hills by arnied , but to him harmless savages , ought to be on this day the exhilarating beverage of his descendants-more exhilarating and heartcheering " than costliest wines of Chios or of Crete . " Mrs ilutcheson , who , as Cotton says , " was once beloved , and all the fitithful embraced her conference , and blessed God for her fruitful discourses , " with Coddington , and all her train of Antinomians , were disfranchised and banished , and in their place of refuge , the great island of Adquidneck , Rhode Island , passed in solemn resolve , the earliest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religious concerumnents , the world had ever known . The third and last , but not less interesting foundation by these primary associations that formed this state , all proceeding from the same persecution , and the same manful opposition , was the settlement of the Gortonists , on lands l ) urcliased of Shaw Onmet , the Sachem of the NarracTansetts. rhese are the men of Kent , the settlers of the town of Warwick . If ever there was a complete and victorious vindication against the sarcasm , that our ancestors were so barbarous , as not to be capable of good sense and good English , it is furnished by the paper issued by the owners and inhabitants of Shaw Omet , dated 25th October , 1643 . This paper was addressed to certain men styled Commissioners , sent from the Massachusetts , supported by an armed force , whose names , they say in contemptuous defiance , " we know not . " That paper is heroic , and 1-lomeric ; Demosthenian , but superior to Demosthenes . " If you come , " say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity and peace , together therewith , shaking a rod over our heads , in a band of soldiers ; be assured that we have passed our childhood in that point , and are under the commission of the *rcat God , not to be children in understanding , neither in courage , but to acquit ourselves like men . We strictly charge you hereby , that you set not a foot upon our lands , in any hostile way , but upon your perils ; and that , if any blood be shed , upon your heads shall it be . And know , that if you set an army of men upon any part of our land , contrary to our just prohibition therein , we are under command , and have our commission sealed , all ready to resist you unto death . For this is the law of our God , by whom we stand , which is written in all men 's hearts , that , if ye spread a table before us as friends , we sit not as men invective , envious , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , who point us unto our dish , but we eat with you , by virtue of the unfeigned law of relations , not only to satisfy our stomachs , but to increase friendship // and love , the end of feastings . So also , if you visit us as combatants , or warriors , by the same law of relations we will resist you unto death . " But their courage could not save them from overwhelming force , preceded , however , by the basest treacliery . Gorton , and his associates , Green , Holden , and others , were imprisoned ; and Gorton was condemned as a blasphemous enemy of the true religion and its ordinances , adjudged to be confined and set to work , and to bear such bolts as may hinder his escape during the pleasure of the Court ; but should he break his confinement , then to suffer death . ' pp. *21-24 . Again ; The charter ultimately procured by the talents , address , and good fortune of Clark , under the form of a corporation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , after he granted it , virtually excluded himself from any interference with it . He had no viceroy , he had no veto on the laws of the colony . We endured not his actual or constructive presence . We felt his power hardly at all , his influence rarely , but always benignantly and beneficially . in the first session of the Assembly under that charter , and indeed before it had passed through all the ceremonies of a royal grant , we anticipated and settled that topic of controversy , which a century afterwards convulsed the world . In March , 1663 , in an act for declaring the privileges of his majesty 's subjects , it was enacted " that no tax shall be imposed or required of the colonies , but by the act of the General Assembly . " When Andros , under the commission of James II , called for the surrender of our charter , we did not surrender it . Though we bent before the storm , we did not break down under it . We preserved the charter as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idol of our affections . Awaiting the revolution of 1688 , we temporized , and though the charter had been , so far as irregular power could do it , annulled , after that glorious event , viz , the revolution of 1688 , we went on acting under it , without clamor or apology , as unharmed and unforfeited . When the mother country was in the right , or we thought it so , nothing could surpass the energy and enthusiasm of our l ) patriotism . Under the fascinating influence of the administration of the elder Pitt , we sent five hundred men into the Canadian expedition . ' pp. 528 , 529 . The following events show the determined and noble spirit of the people of Rhode Island , in resisting the first symptoms of British aggression , which hastened the revolution . It will doubt* less be thought , that Mr Hunter a little overrates the importance of these events ; but the lofty feeling of patriotism and self respect which prompted them , can never be estimated too highly . // Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws of Trade , we grew up with prodigious thriftiness . The new system adopted after the peace of 1763 , not only checked our commerce but indicated a systematic design of oppression . Of this design , we had an intuitive conception , and to it an invincible repugnance . It has lately , not two months ago , been stated by a British minister in the house of Commons , " that however the attempt at taxation might he viewed as the immediate cause of the American explosion , yet the train had been long laid , in the severe and unbending efforts of England to extend more rigorously than ever the Laws of Trade . " " Every little case , " he says , " that was brought before the Board of Trade , was treated with the utmost severity . " * The two really great cases that occurred , originated here . The first was the attack at Ne*vport , on the 17th of June , 1769 , of the armed revenue sloop , Liberty , whose captain had been guilty of some oppressions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , who cut her cables , let her drive on shore on the point , where they cut away her masts , scuttled her , carried both her boats to the recently planted liberty tree , at the upper end of the town , and burnt them . The second was the affair of the Gaspee , on the 9th of June , 1772 . The first blood that was shed in the revolutionary contest , by that very act begun , stained her deck , and it was drawn by a Rhode Island hand . Yes , the blood of Lieutenant Duddington was the first blood drawn in the American cause . The scene of the transaction is within our view , and you have now in this assembly four of the lads , now veterans , who were zealons and foremost partizans , on that brave occasion . How powerfully permanent is the effect of early principle and habit , how indestructible the cast of original character How true it is , that " as the txvig is bent , the tree inclines . " From all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal-from all their merits and their peculiarities , I should have said , that these were the men , that were engaged in that enterprise . They are they , who on the proposition of their patriotic lender , John Brown , exclaimed , " We are the boys that can do it . " ' PP ' 30-32 . The same spirit was kept alive , till the revolutionary contest became general , as will be seen by the following statement . In 1774 you did an act , if possible , more positive , daring , and decisive , more unequivocally indicative of your warlike spirit , and your determination to be independent . You rose , as the British lawyers said , from common felony to high and atrocious treason . // As soon as the proclamation , prohibiting the importation of arms from England , was known here , you dismantled the king 's fort at Newport , and took l ) OssCssiofl of forty pieces of cannon . All our leading men , not only had at heart , but avowed the same sentiment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a member of the first Congress , dated on the 4th of June , 1775 , at the camp on Prospect 11111 . " Permit me , " says he then , " to recommend from the sincerity of my heart , ready at all times to bleed in my country 's cause , a declaration of independence , and call upon the world and the great God who governs it , to witness the propriety and rectitude thereof . " We anticipated Congress in the declaration of Independence ; for , by a solemn act of our General Assembly , we dissolved all connexion with Great Britain , in the May previous . We withdrew our allegiance from the king , and renounced his government forever , and , in a declaration of Independence , we put down in a condensed , logical statement , our unanswerable reasons for so doing . ' pp. 35 , 36 . There are two or three of General Greene 's letters in existence , in which he urged the declaration of Independence more than a year before that measure was resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem , is due the credit of the first formal declaration by any colony ; although South Carolina had two months before formed a new constitution , and instituted an independent government , which , after all , was perhaps as strong a declaration of independence as could be made . Virginia did the same in May , al ) out the time of the Rhode Island declaration . But , in recurring to this subject , we must not forget the Mecklenl ) urgh declaration of independence in North Carolina , made in a solemn manner on the nineteenth of May , 1775 , a year before that of Rhode Island . This event is as well authenticated , as any in the revolutionary history . We have examined the subject in another place . See Vol . XII . p. 35 , for January 1821 . We take the liberty of correcting a slight error , into which the author has fallen , in a matter of some importance . Speaking of the religious freedom early enjoyed in Rhode Island , as established by Roger Williams , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its legal exercise , long before the able and amiable Roman Catholic , Lord Baltimore , adopted and enforced it . ' But it happens , that Lord Baltimore settled his colony in Maryland , in 1634 , the very year in which Roger Williams was banished from Salem . Religious freedom was a first principle with Lord Baltimore from the beginning of his settlement . It can not be said , therefore , that Rhode Island enioyed this privilege long before Maryland . We have expressed // our opinion on a former occasion L Vol . XX . p. 1O*. , and we still believe it true , that the first legislatioc act in favor of unlimited toleration , which is recorded of any government , was passed by the Roman Catholic colony of Maryland . We have not taken up Mr hunter 's Oration for the purpose of criticism , yet one or two remarks are demanded from us on this subject . With a good deal of vigor of thought , a rapid style of composition , and a high tone of patriotic feeling , there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passed over . You will find , for instance , such words as rationalize stcdnlitaied , inobstructible , insurgency , violative . Some of the author 's metaphors are strained in no ordinary degree . He tells us , that the Rhode Islander , in the enjoyment of his religious liberty , may drink the waters of life , in rude simplicity , from the palm of his iv'nd , from the crystal cup of reformed episcopacy , or from the embossed and enchased golden chalice of papal gorgeousness . Again , Rhode Island is like the fabled sea nymph , described in the Grecian Anthology , and depicted on antique gems and cameos , of exquisite exility of form , but whose long , slender , and streamy arms embrace , in their graceful fold , a hundred other islands arid shores . ' Once more , a certain operation of the mind sublimates imagination to evanescence . ' Few other passages are so extravagant as these , yet there are many examples of loose expressions , and an indefinite use of language . which should not have escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
