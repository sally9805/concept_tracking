TO CAPTAIN BENJAMIN F. LARNED , PAYMASTER IN THE ARMY OF THE U. STATES Sir , THE friendly relations which exist between us , will , I presume , supersede the necessity of an apology for dedicating to you this little production , which is intended for our mutual amusement , and that of our friends , the Thespians . But in perusing it at your leisure , you will doubtless , discover many imperfections , which will be readily accounted for , when you are informed that I have appropriated only forty-eight leisure hours to the accomplishment of this novel task . Permit me to add , that so far from having made writing a profession I have seldom attempted any thing of greater importance than an epitaph on some favorite quadruped , or a dutiful family epistle . I have the honor to be , With respect and esteem , Your obedient servant , THE AUTHOR . St. Louis , Mo . May 17 , 1821 . DRAMATIS PERSON . THESPIANS . MEN . Old Prairie , Mr. T.

( Window opens , old Prairie puts the head and the muzzle of a rifle out . ) Old Prarie . Old Prairie Who the devil are you , Mr. Im pudence ? Nut . Nutmeg A travelling merchant , sir  --  all the way over the mountains , from the town of New Haven , with a cart load of very useful , very desirable and very pretty notions : such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed , wooden clocks . flax seed and lanterns , Japanned coffee pots , and tea sarvers , together with a variety of cordage and other dry goods .

Old Prairie Well stranger , you may keep you cordage , you may have use for it , but I 'll buy lantern , if we can agree on the price ; but if you 'd bro't a few ploughs , and cart wheels along with you , I recon you could have sold a smart chance , about these parts .

Hieghho ! I 'll e'n stow ' em away , against a rainy day , as the saying is ; or a dark night , as the saying should be . ( Gathers them up . ) Well , if they were lighted up , I might succeed better than old Diogenes did , in searching for an honest man , at mid-day , with one of these ; the most rare article of dry goods in these hard times . Now I think of it , this pedlar must be the same ' scape gallows , that sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a common ram , with a merino skin sewed over his own pretty carcass . Dod rot all pedlars , say I. It 's very fortunate , however , that my old friend Continental is a justice , that I can have Mr. Swindler 's business done for him , in a crack .

I made an exchange a few days since , with a fellow in a cart ; I believe the land-lubber cheated me , for the poor beast misstays most damnably . Old Pr . Old Prairie The same fellow who sold out his stock in trade to my poor family  --  I 'm glad to see you , stranger  --  misery loves company . H. Em . Harry Emigrant Not so miserable neither , old boy , for I intend to cast anchor in the first snug harbor I come to , so I sha'nt want a horse , as I 've a poor prospect of finding my old father , that I 've never seen , since I was the size of a marline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Exit old P. ) Well , he 's weathered many a gale , and I understand he 's seen some service too ; had one spar shivered , and  --  What 's this  --  a frigate under easy sail , by all that 's charming  --  ( enter Mary with a book ; passes H.

Nutmeg Honesty ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business as a merchant , is the same when mounted on a cart , as it would be behind the counter of a shop . I press my customers to purchase ' and charge them as much as I can possibly obtain , without regard to cost and charges . And if in the course of business , my eloquence is put in requisition , I have only to own the fact , and plead the custom of the profession  --  In fact , reasoning , less forcible than mine , has saved more than one culprit from the gallows ; and it has often induced a girl of less spirit than yourself , to leap from a second story window , into the arms of a more disagreeable fellow than I am . Pecanne . Pecanne I wish my uncle 's cabbin was two story high ( aside ) .

In the old canvass bag , where my provision is stored , I 've hid a bag of gold . Now , every particle of my goods will be sold at Auction ; my appearance will excite suspicion ; you must bid for the bag , and bring it off  --  when I get possession of it , your uncle will readily consent to our marriage .

Not a particle of onion seed , the glory of Wethersfield , my native country , will be left me . But my tears will flow without onions .  --  But where is your philosophy , Nutmeg ?

I believe I 'm not quite as neat in my person , and habiliments , as a country lass should be . I 'm a little soiled and drabbled . Now I fancy I look amiable , like a garden , or a young widow in the weeds . But since I left the toilette , I have passed thro ' fiery trials . I 'd as soon be cast into a Lion 's den , as a tin cart , or coach and one , as my delectable nephew-in-law that would be , is pleased to term it . To be jolted through a back-woods road , four or five miles , was not enough ; I must be capsised , at the end of my journey . I begin to smell a rat , or a yankee , in this business , but if my old friend Continental , can but succeed in getting off my daughter safely , I 'll e'en put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be him , if my old eyes do n't deceive me .

Enter Mary and Pecanne , laughing . Pecanne . Pecanne A fine lot of goods here ! Let me read the Invoice : One old woman in wedding garments , with a beard on ; one young sailor , in love with old Mr. Prairie , and about to lay violent hands on himself ; one superanuated captain , colonizing the Blacks ; one little mink , just a going , going , going , will nobody say any more ? Mary . Mary To Harry You would'nt disappoint your blooming young bride there , pointing to old P. would you .

If you had called yourself my mother , ' t would have done better ; you 're old enough , and in that dress , ugly enough , to be the mother of Macbeth 's witches . H. Em . Harry Emigrant Listen to me , one moment , my dear angel . Mary . Mary Fallen angel , you should say . Oh ! Harry , I did'nt think so much depravity could have been concealed under your blunt frankness . What villainy !

Oh , the fruitful little hussey  --  how fortunate am I , in escaping this little petticoat Governor . I 'd as soon be under the command of Benedict Arnold . I 'll resign ; I 'm deranged already . I 'll retire , and spend the remainder of my days , in rendering unto tin Pedlars , the things that belong unto them . Enter Nutmeg . Nutmeg . Nutmeg That 's right Mr. Justice . I 'll reciprocate the favor . First , let me introduce you to your son : Mr. Emigrant this is your worthy old father that you 've been so long pursuit of .

But I 've cheated the devil for once . Do n't be alarmed , it is a will , a few deeds , &c.; all real estate  --  no use to me , could'nt stow it into my cart . I deal altogether in moveables .
