txt ART . VIII. -. /I General Description of JV'ova Scotia , Illustrated by a New and Correct Map . 8vo. pp. 208 . Halifax , N. S. 1823 . THE near vicinity of the province of Nova Scotia to our own frontier , and the extensive commercial intercourse between it and this country , afford us a sufficient motive for wishing to obtain an accurate acquaintance with its history , condition , and prospects . The intimate connexion of its early history with that of the Massachusetts Colony also gives it a claim on our attention . For more than a hundred years , while it was a French Colony , it was an object of great // jealousy to its neighbors of Massachusetts , on account of their respective conflicting territorial claims , and more especially on account of the influence , which the French of Nova Scotia , as well as of Canada , were supposed to have in exciting the hostilities of the Indians , the dangerous and cruel enemy of all the early New England settlers . In consequence , Nova Scotia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which were repeatedly retaliated upon her the seventies , which the latter had suffered from the natives . The country , formerly known under the name of Nova Scotia , or Acadia , was of much greater extent than the present province ; its limits were for a long period quite indefinite , and the question of boundary was several times the subject of national controversy . When the French possessed it , they claimed the right of territory as far west as the PenobScot river , and even to the Kennebeck . They made several settlements within the territory , which now forms the state of Maine , regarding it as a part of their province of Acadia . A celebrated controversy arose on the question of the limits of Acadia , as ceded by the treaty of Utrecht , which lasted many years . When the boundary between that province and the United States was established , by the treaty of peace in 1783 , it was fixed upon the river St Croix . A point of some difficulty remained , and that was to ascertain what river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a further question arose , as to the islands belonging respectively to the two governments situated between the mouth of the St Croix and the ocean . These several controversies lasted for a period of near two hundred years . Soon after the peace of 1783 , that part of Nova Scotia bordering on the United States was made an independent province by the name of New Brunswick . Since that time , the province of Nova Scotia has been confined to the peninsula on which the earliest permanent settlements were made , together with the neighboring island of Cape Breton . The first discovery of Nova Scotia was made by John and Sebastian Cabot , Venetians , domesticated in England , and appointed by Henry Seventh to the command of two public vessels , destined for the discovery of a western passage to India . They sailed from Bristol in England , in May 1497 , // and while sailing in a westerly direction , not dreaming that they should meet with any obstruction to their voyage , until they approached the coast of China , they were surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land . The place was named Pri*ma Vista , and it is generally supposed to be the part of the island of Newfoundland now called Bonavista . Others , however , suppose that the first discovery was made on some part of the peninsula of Nova Scotia . From the point first discovered , Cabot coasted along a great distance , both north and south , and being disappointed in the object of his voyage , returned to England . By virtue of this discovery , the whole country from Labrador to Florida was claimed as a possession of the crown of England , though the English for a long time neglected to avail themselves of the advantage of the discovery . In the year 1524 , John Verrazani , a Florentine in the service of France , discovered the continent in latitude thirty four degrees north , and sailed northwardly along the coast , as far as Newfoundland , and called the whole country New France . Ten years afterwards , James Cartier was commissioned by the king of France to explore the country , with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bonavista , and after sailing northwardly along the coast of Newfoundland , entered the Gulf of St Lawrence by the strait of Bellisle . Having visited several harbors , which he found cold and inhospitable , he passed over to the southwesterly side of the gulf , and discovered a bay , which from its contrast with those he had previously visited , he named Baye de Chaleur . After taking possession of the country in the name of the king of France , he proceeded northwardly and discovered the mouth of the river St Lawrence . He made another voyage the next year , 1535 , ascended the river as far as Montreal , and wintered at a place to which he gave the name of St Croix , near Quebec . In 1540 and 1541 , the river was again visited by Cartier and Roberval , but no permanent colony was founded until many years after . In the mean time the fishery on the banks of Newfoundland was diligently prosecuted by the English , French , Spaniards , and Portuguese , and the coasts and islands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing vessels . It is not generally known to what extent this fishery was carried on long be- // July , fore the first settlements were made on the Atlantic coast . As early as 1578 the state of it is thus described . There are about one hundred sail of Spaniards , who come to take cod ; who make it all wet , and dry it when they come home ; besides twenty or thirty more , who come from Biscay to kill whales for train . These are better appointed for shipping and furniture of munition than any other nation save the English , who commonly are lords of the harbors . As touching their tonnage , I think it may be near five or six thousand . Of Portugals there are not above fifty sail , whose tonnage may amount to five thousand , and they make all wet . Of the French nation are about one hundred and fifty sail ; the most of their shipping is very small , not past forty tons ; among which some are great , and reasonably well appointed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spaniards ; the burden of them may be about seven thousand . The English vessels have increased in four years from thirty to fifty sail . The trade which our nation bath to Iceland , maketh that the English are not there in such numbers as other nations . ' Hakluyt , vol. iii . p. 132 . It was not until the year 1604 , that any permanent settlement was made on this part of the continent of America . In the year preceding , king Henry Third , of France , granted to the Sieur De Monts , a patent constituting him lieutenant general of the territory of Acadia , from the fortieth to the forty sixth degree of north latitude , with power to subdue the inhabitants , and convert them to the Christian faith . De Monts sailed in March with two vessels for his new government , taking with him as a pilot Samuel Champlain , who had the preceding year visited the St Lawrence , and who afterwards became the founder of the colony of Canada . He was also accompanied by Mr Poutrincourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They arrived on the 6th of May at a harbor on the southeastern side of the Peninsula of Acadia , now Liverpool , where they found one of their countrymen , named Rossignol , trading without a license with the Indians . They seized his ship and cargo , thus obtaining a seasonable supply of provisions , without which they must have abandoned the expedition , and left him only the poor consolation of giving his name to the harbor where he was taken . They coasted along the southern and western shore of the peninsula , entering the Bay of Fundy , until they came to the mouth of Annapolis river . Poutrincourt was so charmed with // the beauty of this place , that he resolved to establish his residence there , and having obtained a grant of it , he gave it the name of Port Royal . De Monts proceeded to make a farther examination of the bay . On coming to the river to which he gave the name of St John , he ascended it a distance of fifty miles . Cruising farther along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a river , where he resolved to pass the winter and build a fort , to which he gave the name of St Croix . At a subsequent period it became a matter of great importance to identify this island , and although it is very particularly described both by Lescarbot and Champlain , in their histories of the voyages of De Monts , it was found very difficult to determine it with certainty . The descriptions , however , were sufficient to indicate Bone Island , in the Schoodick river , as the probable seat of this encampment , and the discovery of bricks , iron spikes , and other articles , buried beneath the soil , confirmed the supposition , and led to the establishment of the boundary line of the United States upon that river , as the true St Croix . After passing an inclement winter at St Croix , De Monts , in the spring of 1605 , removed the colony to Port Royal , where houses were erected , and measures were taken for cultivating the soil , and obtaining the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden vegetables were planted . This was the first permanent European settlement in America north of Florida . The first permanent settlement in Virginia was made two years after , and the first in Canada a year later . In the year 1613 , at a time of peace between France and England , Captain Argall came with a hostile force , and pillaged and destroyed the place , and carried off to Virginia the greater part of the inhabitants . The rest dispersed themselves in the woods and took refuge among the savages , or escaped to the St Lawrence , and joined Champlain at Quebec . Argall also destroyed the buildings , which De Monts had left standing at St Croix . The date of this exploit is erroneously given in the work before us as in 1618 . In 1614 , Poutrincourt , who had been in France , returned to Port Royal , where he found a remnant of his colony still remaining . In 1621 king James the First of England , made a grant of this country , extending from the river // St Croix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotia , to Sir William Alexander . No settlement was ever made under this grant , though an expedition was fitted out for the purpose , which only reached Newfoundland the first season , and after arriving on the coast of Nova Scotia the following spring , soon gave up the design , and returned to England . We do not propose to go into a detailed history of this colony , but we will enumerate some of the vicissitudes of fortune to which it was subjected . Its weakness , and its vicinity to t he more powerful English colonies , exposed it to a hostile visit at every successive war , in which the mother countries were engaged . In 1628 Port Royal was captured by an English squadron , as Quebec was in the year following , but by the treaty of St Germain , in 1632 , both Canada and Acadia were restored to France . Before this date the French had made other settlements in Nova Scotia , and soon after they established themselves upon the St Croix and the Penobscot , then called Pentagoet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an encroachment upon their territory . When , therefore , in 1654 , a squadron was sent by Oliver Cromwell to Boston , for the purpose of aiding in an expedition against the Dutch at New York , but which , in ' consequence of a long passage , did not arrive until after the news of peace , it was concluded to direct the force , which bad been destined for the Manhadoes , against these intruders , although the English and French governments were not at open war with each other . Their visit was probably unexpected , and they took possession , with little resistance , of Pentagoet , St John 's , Port Royal , and three other posts in Nova Scotia . On the following year a treaty of commerce was entered into between the two countries , and the English government putting in a claim to Acadia , the question was referred to commissioners . It remained in the mean time in possession of the English . By the treaty of Breda , in 1667 , Acadia was retroceded to France , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , he declined at first executing the order , on the ground that only Port Sable and La Heve , were within the limits of Acadia , and that Pentagoet , St John , and Port Royal belonged to Massachusetts . These places were , however , given up to the French in 1670 , but in 1674 and 1680 , Pentagoet // and St John were captured by expeditions fitted out from Boston ; but they were again , in pursuance of orders from England , given up to the French . In 1689 war broke out again , and in the following spring an armament of eight vessels , with seven hundred men , under the comi'nand of Sir William Phipps , was fitted out from Boston , by order of the Massachusetts General Court , which took possession of Port Royal , and the other French posts in Acadia ; but at the peace of Ryswick in 1697 , they were again restored , to the great dissatisfaction of the people of New England . In 1702 hostilities were again declared against France . During the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years agitated Europe , the colonies of New England were involved in a disastrous conflict with the French of Nova Scotia and Canada , and their allies the Indians . These colonies made great efforts to reduce both of the French settlements . An expedition fitted out from Boston in 1707 against Port Royal was unsuccessful , but a more formidable armament was raised three years afterwards for the same object , which was more fortunate . After a short siege the Governor of Port Royal surrendered by capitulation , and the place was from that time called Annapolis Royal . By the treaty of Utrecht , which terminated this war in 1713 , Nova Scotia , otherwise called Acadia , according to its ancient limits , was ceded to England . The island of Cape Breton , and the other islands situated in the Gulf of St Lawrence were not ceded , but were expressly reserved to France . Louisburgh , the capital of Cape Breton , became an important military post for the security of the French American possessions , and it was consequently fortified with great expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1745 , France and England being then at war , the colony of Massachusetts , with some aid from the other New England colonies , fitted out an armament of four thousand men , for the reduction of this place , which , with . the fortunate cooperation of several British ships of war , succeeded in compelling the surrender of the place , after a siege of forty nine days . The success of this bold enterprise exasperated the French , and they made the following year an effort to retake it , and to recover Nova Scotia , but failed of their object . By the treaty of Aix la Chapelle , however , the island of Cape // 144 July , Breton was restored to France , and as other parts of the treaty were to be executed before the restoration of this conquest could be effected , it was stipulated that two English gentlemen of rank should remain in France as hostages for the faithful performance of this engagement . Lords Sussex and Cathcart were sent to France as hostages , where they were detained until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of commissioners to settle the boundaries of Nova Scotia , as ceded by the treaty of Utrecht , and other questions in dispute . These commissioners met at Paris in September 1750 , and continued their conferences until 1755 . Their discussions were afterwards published in four quarto volumes . The English commissioners maintained that the ancient limits of Acadia , recognised by the treaty of Utrecht , extended from the river Penobscot to the river and bay of St Lawrence . The French commissioners on the other hand maintained , that the province of Acadia included only that part of the peninsula along the southeastern coast , extending from Cape Fourchu to Cape Canso . These discussions were interrupted by the war of 1756 , in the course of which Louisburgh was again captured by a powerful British force , and at the close of which , by the treaty of Fontainbleau , France renounced to Great Britain all pretensions to Nova Scotia or Acadia in all its parts , and guarantied to her , in full property , Canada with all its dependencies , together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulf and river of St Lawrence . Nova Scotia thus became , by an undisputed title , a British province . The government had before this date taken some measures to establish in it a British population , the whole number of inhabitants being at this date about twelve thousand , of whom less than three thousand were French Acadians . The French inhabitants were at an earlier period much more numerous . At the date of the conquest of the country by Sir William Phipps , they were estimated at six or seven thousand souls . They carried on an extensive fishery , and a trade in furs and lumber . Soon after the treaty of Utrecht , an English governor was sent into the province , but not more than five or six English families resorted thither . The French inhabitants were permitted to keep their possessions , and to enjoy their religion . They // would however gladly have chosen the alternative offered them by the English governor , of leaving the country , had they the means of transporting themselves with their property . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where their countrymen were founding a colony . Those who remained were repeatedly required to take the oath of allegiance , but they constantly refused it , alleging that they were detained in the country against their wishes . They claimed an exemption From the obligation to hear arms against their countrymen on the ground of a promise , which they alleged was made to them . They were in consequence of this exemption called the French neutrals . All the powers of government were at first vested in the governor , but a new captain general of the province was appointed in 1719 , who was instructed to form a council of the British inhabitants . For want of inhabitants , he was obliged to take his council from the officers of the garrison , one inhabitant only being admitted to it . Paul Mascarene , in a letter dated in 1748 , to governor Shirley , which is preserved in Hazard 's Collections , complains that there were no proper persons to form a civil government , there being no British planter or inhabitant , that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not , on act*ount of their religion , take the oath of supremacy , and they were besides generally of the lowest class of farmers , poor and unlearned , of whom not more than one in a hundred could either read or write . To keep up some form of government among these people , who had no magistrates residing among them , and were entirely unacquainted with the English laws , they were ordered to choose annually , in their several districts , persons called deputies , to act in their behalf , and to publish the orders of the governor . These deputies , twenty four in number , were authorised to act as arbitrators , in small matters of controversy between the inhabitants , and from their decision an appeal was allowed to the governor and council . For the hearing of these appeals , the council sat three times a year ; on these occasions the inhabitants generally pleaded their own causes , assisted by an interpreter , who repeated their arguments to the council in English . The Abbe Raynal gives a highly embellished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period . // He represents them as leading a life of virtuous simplicity , free from the cares and the vices of more polished communities , having but few wants , and those easily supplied by the fruits of their cheerful labor , upon a productive soil , and in extensive fields . The lands upon the borders of the bays and rivers were highly cultivated , and produced large crops of wheat , oats , rye , and potatoes . They had an abundance of cattle , sheep , and horses , and bred also large quantities of poultry , which afforded an agreeable variety to their food . They manufactured from the fleeces of their sheep , and the flax of their own cultivation , coarse cloths and linens , and the few foreign luxuries , which they had learned to prize , they procured by means of a small trade which they carried on with Louisburgh . No magistrate came among them , they paid no taxes , and performed no military duties . They lived a life of continued harmony like a society of brethren . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration of persons of their own election , and as to crimes none were committed among them . The state of manners , and the ease with which the means of subsistence were procured , led them to contract early marriages . Neither conjugal infidelity , nor an unlawful intercourse between the sexes , was known among them . The consequence of this happy state of society was a rapid increase of population , which was stated by the author above named to have reached eighteen thousand . In this description there is undoubtedly some exaggeration . During the war which preceded the treaty of Aix la Chapelle , the French neutrals became highly excited , they were solicited by their brethren in the neighboring provinces to take up arms , and they were regarded by the English with great jealousy . At the close of the war , the British ministry turned their attention to the importance of procuring a settlement of Nova Scotia by a British population . In a pamphlet , published in the year 1748 , written for the purpose of recoinmending measures for this object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the northern colonies , that the population of Nova Scotia should be put on a different footing , that this can not be done better than by encouraging protestants to settle among them , and that such is the attachment of the French Acadians to the Romish faith , that // 1824 . , Vova Scotia . 147 it will prevent the settlement of protestants , unless it be done in compact bodies , and under the cover of fortifications . It is asserted , that ever since the subjection of the province to the British crown , the inhabitants have preserved their attachment to France , that before the war they supplied the French at Louisburgh , not only with provisions , but witb wives , that they assisted them in erecting their fortifications , in their fisheries , and in piloting their vessels , and that during the war many of them actually joined a body of French and Indians in arms . This pamphlet gives a very satisfactory description of the state of the province at that time . The author estimates the number of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annapolis river , at about three hundred , those at Chignecto and in that neighborhood at two hundred , those at Chipotee at sixty or seventy , and those at Mines , composed of a number of villages extending six or eight miles in length , at one thousand . Besides these settlements there were three or four families on the river St John , and a few at Malagash . The whole population was estimated at ten or eleven thousand . The greater part of their agricultural improvements were confined to the cultivation of the marsh lands , large tracts of which were rendered very productive by raising dykes to exclude the tides . The soil , thus protected from the sea , was very rich , and admitted of long cultivation without the use of manure . In the summer of 1749 , a colony of three thousand seven hundred and fifty persons , induced by the encouragements offered by the British government , sailed from England for Chebucto , and there planted the town of Halifax . The government besides making grants of land to the settlers engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the passage and of the first year 's subsistence . Colonel Cornwallis was appointed by the king governor of the colony . Before the approach of winter , three hundred comfortable wooden houses were erected , and surrounded by a strong palisade . The new colony was soon involved in hostilities with the Indians , and with the French neutrals . It would be too long a digression from our main purpose , to enter into a history of this unhappy contest . The colony , aided by a considerable body of British troops , was able to dictate to their enemy such terms as they saw fit . The Indians were reduced to subjection , and of the // French Acadians , some were destroyed , some escaped to the neighboring provinces , and others were transported by the British to distant countries , so that at the date of the peace of 1763 , those who remained were reduced to the small number above stated . In 1753 , two hundred Dutch and German families were transported to Lunenburgh , at the expense of the British government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Other settlements were formed in Nova Scotia by emigrants from New England . In 1763 , a settlement was made at Barrington , near Cape Sable , by one hundred and sixty families from Cape Cod , who transferred thither their stock and fishing vessels , and laid the foundation of a prosperous town . In 1783 , on the acknowledgment of American Independence , a large number of loyalists from the United States , many of them men of property and education , resorted to Nova Scotia , to the great benefit of the province . Some of these injudiciously attempted to build a large town called Shelburne , at port Roseway , where there is a fine harbor , and in a short time the town contained ten thousand white inhabitants and twelve hundred blacks . But it was soon found that the situation was not well chosen , and it began to decline . Many of the inhabitants returned to the United States , and others settled in different parts of the province . Emigrants from the United States have also settled in other towns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of less note , the population of Nova Scotia for the last seventy years has rapidly increased , so that the present number , exclusive of Indians , is estimated at one hundred and twenty five thousand souls . This number , however , is considerably greater than the result of any actual enumeration . A census taken in 1817 gave but seventy eight thousand three hundred and forty five ; but this was known to be quite defective . From the history , which has been given of the origin of this population , it must be obvious , that it is of quite a mixed character . It is composed of Indians , French Acadians , English , or the descendants of English , Germans , Dutch , Scotch , Irish , and American royalists . These various ingredients have not yet had time to amalgamate , as individuals survive of nearly all the classes of emigrants . In some also there is // little tendency to Jose their original character . The French Acadians form several small distinct settlements , have little intercourse with the other inhabitants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain a corrupt French dialect , though many of the men understand English . They are moral in their habits , simple in their mode of life , cheerful in disposition , contented and happy . We are not able to ascertain their present numhers . Of the Indians there are about fifteen hundred persons , or three hundred and fifty families , cbnsisting of the tribe of the Micmacs . They were formerly a ferocious race , but the French succeeded in conciliating their friendship , and induced them to embrace the Roman Catholic religion , of the ceremonial parts of which they became strict observers . They still live in a savage state , subsisting principally by hunting and fishing . They however manufacture baskets , buckets , and other articles of simple workmanship , which they barter with their venison and furs , for cloths , blankets , powder and shot , knives , and other articles of necessity in their way of living . They have no domestic animals but the dog , and all attempts to lead their attention to agriculture have been unsuccessful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hundred miles in its greatest breadth , and embraces a superficies of fifteen thousand six hundred square miles . Its shores are extremely irregular , and it is so intersected by bays and inlets , that navigable waters come within thirty miles of every part of the province , it is divided into ten counties , one of which consists of the island of Cape Breton . The counties are subdivided into townships , after the manner of the states of New England . It lies in about the latitude of the state of Maine , but being nearly surrounded by water , the climate is milder than that of Maine . The air is in general clear and pleasant , except in the neighborhood of Halifax , and some other parts of the Atlantic coast , which are subject to fogs . The earth is generally covered with snow from the last week in December to the first in March . The opening of the spring is often retarded by the quantity of ice , which floats along the coast , but when vegetation begins , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumns are remarkably pleasant . The soil is quite productive , particularly in the quarter bordering on the bay of Fundy , where // there are extensive tracts of alluvial land , which are extremely rich . There are also in all parts of the province , large tracts of interval land , on the borders of the rivers and brooks , which are very fertile . The upland varies materially in quality and value , but much of it , and often in extensive tracts , is of a good quality , and capable of being made very productive . Agriculture , bowever , has been until within a few years much neglected , but recently , in consequence of the exertions of a few persons , a very rapid improvement has been made in this branch of industry . No country could be more thoroughly watered than Nova Scotia . It abounds in bays , rivers , and lakes . The bay of Fundy on its western border , and the small bays and streams which open into it are remarkable for their very high tides . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal rivers are the Shubenacadie , or river of Acadie , which rises near Halifax , and running in a northwesterly direction into the Mines Basin , nearly divides the province into two equal parts , and the Annapolis , which is navigable for large vessels to a distance of forty miles , and is bounded by rich and extensive meadows . The province is furnished with a great number of excellent harbors , as well as with abundant facilities for internal navigation . These latter are capable of being greatly improved by canals , for which two or three projects are in agitation , but none of them are in the progress of execution . An act , however , was passed by the provincial legislature in March last , authorising the incorporation of a company for making a canal by the river and lake of the Shubenacadie , to unite the waters of the Basin of Mines with the harbor of Halifax , and a sum of money was appropriated to enable the lieutenant governor to procure the surveys necessary for judging of the practicability of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants are made annually for the construction of roads and bridges throughout the province , which are expended under the superintendence of commissioners appointed for the purpose by the lieutenant governor . At the last session of the legislature , in addition to the customary ' grants , the sum of a thousand pounds was placed at the disposal of the lieutenant governor for the erection of stone bridges over the // brooks on the principal roads , in the place of those of wood , which go to decay . The trade of Nova Scotia is perhaps not so extensive as might be expected , from the remarkable local advantages which it possesses for this pursuit . The regulations under which it is placed by the British government are more liberal than they have formerly been , and afford a wide field for profitable enterprise . There are still restrictions of which the colonists complain , and which the mother country may perhaps hereafter remove . By an act of parliament passed on the 24th of June 1822 , it was made lawful to import into the port of Halifax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from any part of North or South America , or the West Indies , certain articles enumerated , including most of the varieties of produce of the soil and forests , either in It3ritish ships , or in ships of the country of which the articles imported are the produce . By another act of the same date , it is made lawful to import into Halifax , in British ships , from any port in Europe or Africa , a variety of articles enumerated , including wine , brandy , fruits , flour , grain , oil , &amp;c. and also to export to those countries any articles , the growth , produce , or manufacture of the colony , or which have been legally imported . Since the date of these acts , the people of Nova Scotia , in addition to the West India trade , the fisheries , the trade with the other colonies , and that with Great Britain , carry on a trade with the United States , in their own vessels and in those of the United States , and also in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other parts of Europe and Africa . The duties paid on foreign imports are low . On fruits , brandy , and most other articles imported from Europe , the duty is seven and a half per cent on the cost ; on Madeira wine , ? 7 7s. the tun of 252 gallons , and on French wines ? 10 lOs . the tun , in addition to the seven and a half per cent ; on flour and grain from the continent of Europe , the duty is twelve per cent on the cost . These duties are much lower than are paid on the importation of like articles in the United States . According to a statement which has been published , of the amount of dutiable goods imported into Nova Scotia in the year 1823 , there were imported 21,517 gallons of brandy and gin , 484,989 gallons of rum , 25,277 gallons of wine , 243,957 gallons of // molasses , 14,907 cwt. of sugar , 44,396 lbs . of coffee , and goods paying a duty of three and three quarters per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 217,014 , all of which paid a duty of ? 38,385 9s. 8d . The imports into the province from the West Indies in the same year , employed 186 vessels of 16,410 tons , with 954 men . The exports to the West Indies , employed 197 vessels , of 18,038 tons , and 1057 men . The imports from the United States , consisting principally of flour , meal , and corn , were made in 62 vessels , and the exports to the United States , consisting of fish , gypsum , coal , and other articles , were made in 62 vessels . The vessels employed in the coasting trade between Nova Scotia and the neighboring American colonies are from one to two hundred . The provincial legislature consists of three branches , the governor or lieutenant governor , the council , and the assembly . The governor , who is appointed by the crown of Great Britain , is the captain general and commander in chief ; he commissions all officers of the militia , appoints the judges of the courts of common law , justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of pardoning offences , except in cases of murder and high treason ; he presides solely in the high court of chancery , and exercises within his jurisdiction the powers of the lord high chancellor of Great Britain ; he is ordinary , and has the power of granting probate of wills , and administration , and with the council sits as a court of error . The council consists of twelve members , who are appointed by the governor . They act as a council of state , as judges in the court of error , and also as a part of the legislature , in which latter capacity they sit as the upper house , distinct from the governor . The house of assembly consists of forty one members . The county of Halifax chooses four members , and the other counties two each . The town of Halifax also chooses two members , and there are seventeen towns which choose one each . The qualifications for a voter , or a representative , are a yearly income of forty shillings from real estate , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , or a hundred acres of land , five of which are under cultivation . The legislature has the power of making local laws , not repugnant to the laws of England . The king , however , reserves the right of disannulhing any law within three years after its publication . // There is a university , called King 's college , situated at Windsor , which is regarded as the parent of all the literary institutions in Nova Scotia . Its charter was granted in 1802 . It has at present four professorships , viz , of divinity and Hebrew ; of the moral sciences and metaphysics ; of mathematics , natural philosophy and astronomy ; and of grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Other professorships are to he established as soon as the revenues of the college will render it practicable . There are four lay scholarships , of twenty pounds sterling a year , which may be held for four years , and twelve divinity scholarships , of thirty pounds sterling , which may be held seven years . There are at present about thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden buildings , three stories high , all under one roof . Subordinate to the university , and in its immediate Vicinity , is the collegiate school . The principal of this school is eminently qualified for his station , and the school has acquired a high reputation , and has a large number of students . It has a building of freestone , erected at an expense of five thousand pounds , which affords apartments for the head master , his family and ushers , and forty boarders . At this school are twelve divinity scholarships , of thirty pounds each , which may be held for seven years , or until matriculation at the college . There are two or three other useful public schools , which are under the direction of trustees . In the year 1811 a law was passed to establish a grammar school in each county , in which Latin and Greek , mathematics , English grammar , and other studies should be pursued , to be under the direction of trustees appointed by the governor , and the masters to be paid out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed , called the school act , providing , that in any settlement consisting of thirty families , if the majority of inhabitants shall vote a sum not less than fifty pounds for a school , to be assessed in the manner of poor rates , they shall receive from the provincial treasury the further sum of twenty five pounds . These laws have suffered some modification , and we are not able to ascertain how far they are now carried into effect . Considerable sums , however , we know are appropriated from the public treasury for the support of schools . Among the appropriations by the legislature at their last session , we observe a grant of a hundred and twenty pounds to // each county and district , for the encouragement of education , and a hundred pounds each to the trustees of three incorporated schools described in the grant . in addition to these means of promoting education in Nova Scotia , a college was established at Halifax in 1820 , under the patronage of the Earl of Daihousie , then governor of the province , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for the education of students in the several branches of science and literature , as they are commonly taught in the university of Edinburgh . ' A very spacious and handsome stone building has been erected , arid the sum of nine thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling has been invested in the three per cent stocks , as a fund for the support of its officers , but its professorships are not yet filled , and the author of the work before us expresses his regret , that so much money should be expended in a way not likely to be useful for many years , instead of being appropriated to the endowment of additional professorships in King 's college , and to the erection of the new buildings , which are much wanted in that institution . These various provisions for the encouragement of education in this infant colony exhibit a liberal and enlightened spirit on the part of the people and legislature , which deserves to be noticed and commended . The efforts of individuals to improve the agriculture of the province have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of the funds raised by voluntary contribution , to be distributed in the form of premiums for agricultural improvements . The legislature in March last granted the sum of five hundred pounds , to be divided for these objects among the agricultural societies . By the exertions of these societies the face of the province has been much improved , and from the zeal and intelligence of their leading members still greater benefits are to be expected . The book , whose title is placed at the head of this article , and to which we are indebted for much of the information here given , is quite a reputable work , of an unpretending character , apparently accurate in its statements , and affording a much more ample and satisfactory view , than has been presented in any previous publication , of the present condition and prospects of the province .
