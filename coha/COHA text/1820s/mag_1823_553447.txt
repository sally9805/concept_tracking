XVL-JV'otizie vane sullo state presente della Republica degli Stati Urtiti deli ' Ilmenica setterttrionale , scnitte , al pninejyjo del 1818 , dal Padre Giovanni Grassi , della compagnia di Gesi* . Edizione seconda . Milano , 1819 . A BOOK of travels in the United States , written by a Jesuit , published at Rome , and reprinted at Milan , is in itself a novelty not to be passed over without notice . These are not the only peculiarities of the publication now under consideration . It is recommended by a still more . extraordinary circumstance : it is a pamphlet . This we mention as matter of congratulation to our readers , not doubting that they will fully participate in the complacency with which , after the scores of folios , quartos , and octavos we have had to grapple withal , we hail the , appearance of this literary anomaly , a pamphlet of travels . ' They need not to be reminded that amplification is the crying fault of writers of the present day . So rare , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to pronounce the densus et brevis ' in composition , like charity among the virtues , the sum and substance of all excellence . We may , however , solace ourselves with the reflection , that the fault we complain of is not peculiar to our own times ; at least we may infer as much from the practice of those sturdy reviewers , the curate and barber in Don Quixote , who ftave left us an admirable sample of practical criticism . We are informed that these worthies , after having condemned a great number of // authors , one by one , to the flames , at length , without giving themselves the trouble of reading any more titles , ordered the housekeeper to dismiss all the large books into the yard . ' We do not intend to hint that it will ever become expedient to purge our modern libraries after the manner of these primitive critics , but merely to premise , that if we are more indulgent to this little book , ' than strict justice would seem to require , we think it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular above mentioned . Father Grassi , the author of this treatise , resided some years in the United States , in the capacity of superior of the Catholic seminary at Georgetown in the District of Columbia . On his return he was persuaded by his friends to publish the result of his observations , with a view , as his editor expresses it , to give an idea of the rapid progress that country is already making in commerce , population , manufactures , the Catholic religion , and every other species of improvemeiit . ' This last topic and the subjects connected with it occupy a large portion of the book ; the remainder being principally made up of very general statements relating to the climate , soil , and pro . ' ductions of the United States , taken from the common statisti-* cal tables , and from a letter of our obliging countryman , Dr Mitchell . These are interspersed with such personal observations as the reverend author had opportunity to make within the limits of the District of Columbia-for he does not appear to have extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar , which he has adopted with a degree of credulity altogether surprising . We have had our doubts , so extravagant are some of the absurdities detailed by father Grassi , whether he had himself been duped , or had a mind to make his countrymen a little merry at our expense . The latter conclusion would have been the most desirable , as being more honorable to the writer , and by no means offensive to ourselves , for we are so much the friends of good humor , as to be ready to forgive it under almost any shape . But the profession of the author and the grave character of the work forbad this interpreta1*mon . We leave it to our readers to determine , from the translations we propose *o give of certain portions of the book , what foundation there is for the first supposition . The coarse jests and bromtd caricatures , which the good father has , with overweening simplicity , retailed , are not // 1823 Grassi 's Present State of.Imerica. quoted either for their novelty or spirit . We have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show how much of the misrepresentation we impute to foreigners is the reflected picture , which in the excitement of party animosity or local prejudice ) we have drawn of ourselves . While the various sects , religious and political , as well as the different sections of our country , are but too willing to paint their neighbors ii* ridiculous , not to say odious colors , it should not be matter of surprise or complaint , that their distorted portraits are copied by the credulous or illiberal traveller , to the infinite disadvantage of our national character . That the feelings of father Grassi are unfriendly to us , as a nation , we are far from believing ; on the contrary , his observations , on points where his religious prejudices do not operate , denote an artlessness of character quite inconsistent with such a presumption . The following remarks will perhaps excite a smile . In respect of food , I can truly say , that after having been in most of the countries of Europe , in my judgment , the mass of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where both flesh and fish are very abundant . The French , who have been there , have justly observed , that in the United States one sees literally fulfilled the wish , which did so much honor to Henry IV of France , who was used to declare , " that he should not think himself happy until each of his subjects had every Sunday a fowl in the pot . " I can not say that this country is equally well furnished in the article of drink , which consists of zrhiske* ( a sort of brandy , ) rum , and other distilled spirits , mixed with water . Wine is very dear , and beer exceedingly rare* ' p. 10 . This reminds us of the remark we have somewhere seen of a French traveller in Ireland : - Le yin ordinaire.de ce paysci , ' he observes , est un boisson execrable , 9ue I'on appelle vzski . ' After some further remarks on the productions and resour* ces of the United States , the authox proceeds to state generally the number of inhabitants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population are negroes , who are held in slavery , in open contradic4ion to one of the first articles of the general constitution of this republic , which declares freedom to be a privilege inherent in man , and inalienable . It c*innot be denied , however , that there are many power // ful reasons against granting liberty to the blacks in a mass . It must not be supposed , that the shores of the American republic are at this day disgraced by the inhuman spectacle of ships discharging cargoes of the miserable victims of human avarice . The present race of negroes in the United States are the descendants of those Africans , who in former times were transported from their native country to the colonies of the New World . The importation of slaves from abroad is now prohibited under severe penalties , but nevertheless , the internal traffic in these unhappy beings still continues . Men are sold to their fellow men , and in the land of liberty , we but too often hear the mournful clank of servile chains . In many states the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants of Europe , but in many others they are left in a total ignorance of religion ; no attention is paid to their morals ; they are never baptized , nor joined in the holy bands of wedlock . The sordid master asks but their labor , and then leaves them like brutes to the blind impulse of their passions , and to follow vices and superstitions that exceed belief . This applies principally to the southern states ; in the more northern ones , slavery is abolished , and the example begins by degrees to be imitated elsewhere ) p. 17 . As a counterpart to the foregoing , we shall translate a sketch from the north , which occurs afterwards in describing the character of the people of our country . Among the inhabitants of the United States , those of New England are regarded as thorough knaves , practised in the most artful deception , and are nicknamed Yankis . The great number of small dealers , who distribute themselves from this quarter into i41 the other states , and resort to every art and device to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an appellation which the English bestow indiscriminately on all Americans . It is very certain , ' adds the doctor , that to deal with this sort of people , requires no little shrewdness and a pretty exact acquaintance with their ktws in relation to contracts . But it seems to * he adds with an appearance of candor , which we fear he ( lid not learn at Georgetown , it seems to me unjust to apply a reproach , which belongs to individuals , or at most to a class of persons , to all the inhabitants of those states . ' p. 29 . After the preceding samples , the reader will not be entirely unprepared for the following description of American manners . The unrestrained freedom which obtains , the drunkenness which abounds , the rabble of adventurers , the great number of // negro slaves , the almost infinite variety of sects , and the little real religion that is met with , the incredible number of noveIs* that are read , and the insatiate eagerness for gain , are indeed circumstances , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first view , however , one is not aware of the depravity of this country , because it is hidden for a time* under the veil of an engaging exterior . But it is not difficult to discern it , when a little familiar with the inhabitants , particularly in the cities . The vices of gaming and drunkenness prevaiL there to a degree altogether incredible in Italy* and frequently prove fatal in their consequences , not only to the individual , but to whole families . Their general intercourse is civil , but notwithstanding this civility , not a few among them commit frequent breaches of good manners . To pare the nails , for instance , or comb the head in company ; to sit with the feet resting on the nearest chair , or braced against the wall in the air , are not considered indecorous . When a stranger is introduced into company , he is pointed out by name , and presented in turn to *each individual present . Friends who meet , even after an absence of many years , never embrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nursing their own children , a custom which would be still more praiseworthy , if performed with a little more reserve . The richest individuals do not disdain to hold the plough or the spade in their own fields , and to take their meals with the laborers . Luxury in dress is carried to a degree hardly known in Europe ; they dress in the country with the same expense as in town , and on holidays rich clothing forms not the smallest indication of the circumstances of the wearer . Dancing is the most common recreation in America , where the passion for this diversion seems to be even as strong as in France . An absurd point of honor gives rise to frequent duels , and to evade the rigor of the laws , the parties retire to the frontiers of some neighbouring state for the purpose of deciding their quarrels in this barbarous , shocking , and superstitious manner , in which the aggressor is frequently triumphant , and the injured party has the satisfaction to be left wounded , crippled , or perchance dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks on education those which relate to the female sex . The education of young ladies rarely consists in learning the use of the needle or the spindle , or in working linen or woollen stuffs ; but as soon as they are taken from*the English school , they never fail to learn to dance , and sometimes a few lessons in music , drawing , and perhaps French complete their educatio*i. // It is of no moment that this is forgotten in the course of a few weeks . Their vanity is satisfied in being able to say that they have studied music , drawing , and French . ' - p. 25 . From the observations on literature we select those which relate to public speaking , as the most remarkable . Greek and Latin are generally cultivated , but with very few exceptions , not in a sufficient degree to give a perception or taste for the beauties of the great masters of Greece and Italy , otherwise could it be possible that in the public prints they should boast of the Columbiad of Barlow , as a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the speeches of their representatives as models of eloquence infiflitely above those of iDemosthenes and Cicero ? * It is not to be denied , that the Americans express themselves with great facility and elegance , and sometimes display fine traits of real eloquence . In short , after gold , this is their idol ; but of the various branches which , according to the greatest masters , make up the art of speaking well , elocution is the one on which they bestow the greatest care . Provided a speaker or writer deals in choice expressions , elegant phrases , and harmonious periods , nothing more is required to stamp him as a great orator , however deficient he may be in the richness of invention , felicity of thought , weight of sentiment , force of argument , accuracy of arrangement , and command of the passions , which would be required elsewhere. *-p. 39 . In the foregoing extracts , the reader has found little to flatter national vanity ; but we have translated them , not only with a view to show how much injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we think his discrimina-. tion will discern , through a great deal of prejudice and misapprehension , not a little wholesome truth . It can not be necessary to comment upon this part of father Grassi s treatise . If we feel that any of his strictures are just , we have only to profit by them , and where we know them to be otherwise , it can give little satisfaction to ourselves , and will add nothing to our real merit , to refute them . We now proceed to notice the reverend author 's observations on the religious character of the United States ; and here we are sorry to be obliged to say , * It were well if this rodomontade were confined. , to newspapers , but strangers may well call our taste in question when they see a grave biographer quote , as a most happy illustration of the powers of a late distiuguished southern orator , what was said of him by another orator from the same state namely , that he was Shakspeare and Garrick combined . ' // that on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaves all his candor and moderation behind him . It must not be supposed that , at this period of the world , we look for a great degree of either of the above qualities in theological discussions . But we own we did not expect to see stale jokes from the jest books brought out and gravely applied in illustration of the religious character of a nation . We admit that , if one half the abuse which father Grassi complains of has been bestowed upon the Catholics by the American protestants , the account stands pretty fairly balanced between them . This , however , is not to our present purpose , and we do not intend to enter into the controversy any further than to explain the feelings which dictated the following statements . After bestowing due praise on the perfect toleration , which is not only professed but observed in the United States , he proceeds to remark : " Among the peculiarities of America which have attracted the notice of travellers , few are more striking than , that people frequently live for years together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when interrogated upon that point they do not answer , I believe , but I was brought up in such a sect or religion . But in order to give a better idea of the consideration in which religion is held , I shall state a few facts . There was a regiment stationed at Georgetown , a suburb of the flourishing city of Washington , and among other regulations the soldiers were required to attend church every sabbath . But as they were of various persuasions , it was difficult to determine what church or congregation they should attend . So the affair was compromised in the following way . They went the first Sunday to the Catholic Chapel , the next to the Methodists , on the third to the English , then to the Calvinists , and so on through them all in succession . It is not uncommon to find persons who have professed all the sects , and the reasons for these changes are diverting enough . A young lady related of herself , that she took it into her head that that must needs be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city . She was brought up in I know not what sect , but observing every Sunday a greater number of carriages before the congregational meeting-house than any where else , she forthwith became a Congregationalist . Her parents changed their plate of residence , and she her religion , because she observed more carriages near the English Church . The family again removed , and by the standard of carriages she was again converted . At length she wa ' * // 236 April , married , and took the creed of her husband . It is not uncommon to see parents who do not think it best to instruct their children in the principles of Christianity , but are satisfied with giving them notions of natural honesty , observing , that the children at the proper time can choose the sect that shall be most to their taste ; accordingly , you may frequently see in a family as many sects as individuals . In New England the sects are more rigid than elsewhere , consequently various superstitions and vain observances are there most in vogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' find here the greatest encouragement for their impositions. " - p. 63 . What particular class of dignitaries is intended by father Grassi under the English name of Sticks Doctors , or dottori dalle bacchette , ' we are entirely unable to conjecture , although we have run over all the titles of honor in law , physic , and divinity , in which , thanks to the liberality of our literary institutions , we may hold up our heads with any nation , ' ancient or modern . Perhaps some of our readers may be able tofur. - nish an explanation for themselves . Notwithstanding , ' continues our author , the indifference which prevails among these various sects , there appears , particularly at the north , a great display of piety . Every body reads the bible , and in New-England no traveller , not excepting a courier , is allowed to proceed on his journey on Sunday , and they are every year presenting memorials to Congress to prohibit travelling on the Lord 's day . The captain of the vessel in which I sailed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at Domino , nor sing on the Sabbath , at the same time that he permitted all sorts of indecency and profanity among the sailors , and happening to arrive in port on a Sunday morning , he kept them hard at work all day without the smallest necessity . Anciently the observance of fasts at the north was carried to a most extravagant height . There still remain in several states laws relating to religious worship , which insist strosigly on the observance of the third commandment . ' These laws , though still in existence , are not now strictly enforced , and are called Blue Laws , of which the following may serve as a specimen . To the end that the Sabbath may be more exactly observed , it is enjoined on those who intend to go to church , to saddle their horses the day before . On fast days the ladies will not be permitted to scour the floor , make thekeds , or comb the children 's heads-No beer to be made on the Saturday , lest it should work on the Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wag who furnished the doctor with these extracts should have given him so poor a sample of this venerable code , for we think there is scarce a lad of any cleverness among us who would not have been able to invent a better . Having displayed a general view of the state of religion among us , father Grassi attempts to enumerate the different sects in the United States , which he names in Italian as follows : Congregazionalisti , Metodisti , Anglicani , Presbiteriani , Anabaptisti , Universalisti , Unitari , Luterani , Puritani , Quacqueri , Dunkers e Chrystiani . All these are passed upon in turn , with appropriate denunciations , and the author then proceeds to consider the style of preaching in our country . The passion for elegant preaching is universal in this nation , and some traveller has remarked , that religion here reduces itself into the mere fondness for fluent preachers . Hence the great end of their ministers is preaching , that is to say , a polished diction , which flatters and sooths the ear ; their sermons are more commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastors , and not unfrequently political rhapsodies , suited to the taste of the majority of the audience . They affect an air of great indifference , to which they give the plausible name of liberality towards other sects , but commonly conclude with " my hearers , stick to your own . " That the Catholic re , . ligion is the only one which rarely participates in their liberal*.ty , will not appear strange to those who are acquainted with them . It is indeed matter of surprise , that men of honest priaciples , and some of them not without sense and information , *nould persist in the grossest prejudices and the most ab*surd errors in regard to the Catholic religion . Our astonishment will subside , however , when we reflect , that in addition to the force of education , and early impressions , the circumstances of the American protestants are very different from those of the German and English . In these countries the walls of their temples , the inscriptions on the tombs of their ancestors the sacred relics that are preserved , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands remind the protestant that he has renounced the religion of his fathers , and reproach him as it were with his heresy and apostacy . But in America , there is nothing of all this-all is new , and in many parts they have heard nothing for two hundred years hut a repetition of the prejudices and calumnies against the Catholics , which their fathers have handed down to them ; there , a catechism is never seen ; there , so much as a Catholic preacb*r is never heard . ' // Had our author confined himself to remarks like the foregoing , we should not have thought him deserving of very serious reprehension . That a stranger , particularly a native of a Catholic country , should be surprised , not to say scandalized , at the little regard that is here paid to the established modes of belief , and the apparent indifference that prevails as to forms of worship , is not wonderful . We admit the fact , and are by no means prepared to repel the censure . It is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to find as good an apology for the insertion of low and vulgar abuse , which is applied to particular sects merely on the authority of some prating story-teller , or scandalous newspaper . We select an instance from his account of the Methodists . I have seen in print the following dialogue between a shopkeeper and his domestic , both Methodists . William , have you sanded the sugar , lad ? Yes , sir . Have you watered the spirit ? Yes , sir . Have you wet the tobacco well ? Yes , sir. - Come to prayers , then . ' We shall take two other anecdotes of the same character , which we think will suffice . Three years ago a minister of the Church of England in Maryland , substituted cider ( a liquor made of apple juice ) for wine in the ceremony of the Lord 's Supper . The fraud being afterwards detected , and charged upon him , he replied with the utmost co4ness , " that wine was dear , and it was all the same thing . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true one , but he had four strong objections to it . Pray what are they ? he was asked . A wife and three children to support , was his reply . ' We believe our readers are by this time pretty well apprized of what father Grassi considers canonical . His doctrine of reform is simple , if it has no other recommendation . If his word may be taken , our course is plain before us , and but one thing is wanting to draw us from the depths of barbarism and heresy to the safe ground of orthodoxy and refinement . We can not but respect the zeal of father Grassi , and have no doubt he is perfectly sincere in his professions . We are really afraid , however , that Martin and Jack are not yet prepared to take it for truth , even upon the assurance of Peter , that bread contains the quintessence of beef , mutton , veal , venison , partridge , plum pudding , and custard . ' The work closes with an ac // count of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress and present state of that religion in this country . The following description of their principal seminaries and religious houses is not without interest . The fathers of the society of Jesus , besides their missions , have in Georgetown , near Washington , in a charming situation , a College for the education of youth , which was authorised by an act of the first of March , 1815 , to confer academical degrees , as is done by other colleges and universities in this country . Jt is owing to a want of students that this order has not kept up the school they opened at New York , under the title of the Literary Institution , where they still own the building destined to that use . The priests of St Sulpice have a respectable college at Baltimore , on which the Legislature of Maryland has bestowed the privileges of an university . They have also a house of education at Emitzburg* The English Dominicans have a convent in Kentucky , with a school and church under the title of St Rosa di Lima , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probationers . Several gentlemen have lately arrived from Italy in the western states , from the mission of St Vincenzo di Paolo , and are only waiting the arrival of the bishop of New Orleans to commence an establishment . There are , besides these , several other religious communities in America , the most ancient of which is the nunnery of mendicant Carmelites , of the reform of St Teresa . Three nuns of this order had the courage to leave their English convent at Antwerp , and cross the great Atlantic to establish a nunnery here ; in a few years their numbers increased to twenty-six . Their nunnery , which is entirely of wood , is situated near Port Tobacco in Maryland . Archbishop Neal , full of zeal for the education of youth , has established in Georgetown a society of nuns of the visitation , who superintend the religious education of little girls . In a short time this society increased to the degree , that last Summer it consisted of thirty-six nuns* Another establishment for the same object has been founded by the abbe Dubois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emitzburg to Philadelphia , where they have the care of a foundling hospital , whose little inmates they lead on holy festivals in good order sometimes to one church , and sometimes to another , to the great delight and edification of the public , and with some advantage to the charity , which is supported by the alms of Catholics and several benevolent protestants . The truly zealous abbe Nerinx has founded a nunnery in Kentucky*iwhich is called the " Sisterhood of Mary at the foot of the Cross . " Lastly , the abbe Their , Thayer ? who from a *aIvhuistic preacher became a // Catholic at Rome , and died lately in Ireland , has left a fund sufficient to establish in Boston , his native place , a convent of Ursulines for the education of young women . ' This relation will give some idea of the exertions the Catholics have been and are still making to diffuse their doctrines in this country . The return of his holiness to Rome , after his unhappy and atrocious exile , seemed a fit occasion to be signalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore its tottering authority . One of the first steps towards the attainment of this object was the revival of the order of Jesuits , which had by its zeal , perseverance , and admirable discipline added greatly to the influence and grandeur of the church . The persecuted remnant of this once powerful order , which had survived their day of adversity , repaired to the holy see , and soon evinced by their ardor and industry , that they had not lost their distinguishing characteristics . The other orders and religious communities , which had been dispersed by the French , were reassembled , and the affairs of the church assumed a tone of spirit and animation to which they had been long unaccustomed . Nor was this excitement confined to the restoration of the establishment in Italy , or even in Europe . The effects of it have extended themselves to our own country , where the missionaries from Rome have been active and viailant . Their efforts , as we have already seen , and the experience of every day convinces us , have ' not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successful , we are unable to foresee , nor do we think it of much moment to inquire . Although we do not expect from their labors the golden harvest which father Grassi seems to promise himself , we are still far from regarding them with the apprehension and anxiety , which some of our fellow citizens appear to entertain . The assertion of father Grassi is certainly in a degree true , that there has heretofore existed in this country an unwarrantable prejudice against Catholics , which ( we say it with shame ) is not yet erajicated . That a dread of papacy should at one period have been entertained is not surprising , but it is surely time to have done with it . The temporal supremacy of the pope , and the other bug-bears , which are regularly marshalled to fright the . good protestants of England from consenting to Catholic emancipation , have no terrors for us . Are we reminded of the extravagance and // absurdity of some of their observances , and the impolicy of their institutions ? In answer , we will merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanciful vagaries , the incredible inventions of modern protestants ? It will hardly become any persuasion to object to the tenets of another , until we can say with certainty where the exuberant ingenuity of man will stop . For ourselves , we welcome Catholicism , or any other sect , so long as it shall be recommended , to use the words of our author , by that mild and persuasive charity , which marks the true ministers of Jesus Christ . ' Good policy , as well as brotherhood , requires that the numerous emigrants who flock to us should be encouraged , rather than otherwise , in their national belief . We need not look beyond our own city for the good effects of a Catholic establishment , under the guidance of mild , enlightened , and exemplary pastors . We are not to ask ourselves whether we should prefer to make new corners Presbyterians , Lutherans , or Quakers , according to our belief , but whether we will have them Christians or not . The foreigner , who comes among us , and finds the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around in va* for the worship he has been taught to revere ; - is it to be supposed that he will readily adopt any of the sects he finds about him , all of them perhaps equally revolting to his conscience ? Every one finds an answer in his own breast . He will probably become indifferent to religion , and insensible to its sanctions he may become an infidel-he will rarely become a convert . As friends of toleration , we never look with jealousy on the growth of a weak sect . The multiplication of creeds , which , according to our author , is viewed by many with alarm , as the germ of future discord , is regarded by us in a very different point of view . Despairing of unanimity in matters of faith , we look for the preservation of religious quiet in the infinite variety of belief . The maxim of the poet , that All nature 's difference makes all nature 's peace ' may with strict analogy be applied to the present case . With these sentiments we consider every new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny . Weakness is always tolerant ; but we shall think the death blow of religious freedom given , the moment that any one sect , be it which it may , is strong enough to dictate to the rest .
