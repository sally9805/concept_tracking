txt ART . II. - . Me2noirs of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania . 8vo. pp. 228 . Philadelphia . McCarty &amp; Davis . It was said by Lord Bacon , that nothing is so seldom found among the writings of men , as true and perfect civil history . ' This remark is as pertinent at the present day , as it was in the time of Bacon . There would seem to have been no essential improvements on the models of the ancients , in the art of writing history , and Herodotus may still be cited as standing at the head of the first rank of historians , as Homer of the poets , and Demosthenes of the orators . The voice of ages has been as unanimous in favor of the one as the others , notwithstanding the discourteous criticisms of Plutarch on the writings of Herodotus . To inquire into the reasons , why historical compositions have not been improved by the moderns , would lead us away from our present purpose . It is enough to admit the fact , and assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect history stands on the same footing , as poetry and eloquence , architecture and sculpture . Lucian tells of a certain historian of Corinth , who began his work by a formal argument to prove , that none but a ivise man should attempt to write history . Were all historians to set out with this position , and gravely apply themselves to establish its truth , we should probably meet with fewer unsuccessful invocations of the historic muse , unless , like the same Corinthian author , each should think his own case sufficiently clear without proof . In his rules for an accomplished historian , Lucian mentions what he calls two grand qualifications , namely , a genius for political investigation , and a command of language , or a power of describing his thoughts with force and accuracy . The first , says Lucian , is a gift of nature , and a thing not to be taught . The second can be acquired by industry and emulation , by study and practice . The great historians have possessed both these qualifications . Their patience and labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in travelling , observing , conversing with men of different nations , and polishing his compositions , before he ventured to submit his work to the critical ears of a Grecian audience . Froissart was a travelling chronicler , and he holds the first place in the department of history , which he cultivated . In short , a man without talents or industry may compose a wretched history , a she maybe a dull // orator or poet . Genius in either ease is a feeble flame , unless cherished by severe mental application ; and industry will plod in vain , when not quickened by some portion of the celestial fire . Sometimes the historian fails , on account of his subject ; at other times , for the want of materials . It is not in the power of the greatest mind to make that dignified and interesting , which in its nature is low and unattractive . The first step to be taken by a historian , therefore , is to exercise his judgment in selecting a subject , which will not cause him to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that have nothing in them to command the admiration , or awaken the sympathy of mankind . Next come the materials of history , and in no part of his task are the resolution , the patience , the ardor of the his-. torian , more seriously tried than in collecting these . Some writers have avoided this burden of research , and proved themselves to be politicians , rather than historians . Xenophon related his own adventures , and Hume worked upon the stock of others . Herodotus , on the contrary , sought out the very fountain heads of knowledge with untiring diligence ; and Gibbon delved deeply and laboriously in the unproductive mines of the literature of the dark ages . In applying these hints to our own country , we perceive no reason , why historical compositions of the highest order may not be written among us . There is no appalling deficiency of any one requisite , either in regard to writers , subjects , or materials . As to the first , to be sure , the best proof is a successful experiment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of establishing this proof with some degree of triumph , even from the present list of American historians ; although we confess , that no work apprQaching to the character of a complete history of America , or of the United States , or of the American Revolution , has yet appeared . Of the single states we have some respectable histories , rather of the narrative than the philosophical kind ; telling much of events , but little of causes and consequences ; describing the visible motions of the political machine , but hardly acquainting us with the springs that actuated it , or the mass it moved . These are valuable chiefly as materials , and indexes to materials , for future use , in composing a perfect colonial history . In glancing over this subject , however , nothing is more obvious , than the scattered and loose condition of all materials for history in the United States . So many dis // tinct governments existed in this country , from the time of its first settlement , that the records of events were not only very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never well preserved in the public offices , and at the Revolution there was a universal confusion . Important papers belonging to individuals were subject to similar accidents . Since that time many have been lost , and those which remain will gradually suffer the same fate , unless some special means shall be used to collect and preserve them . To efli*ct this end no better plan could be adopted , than that of societies in the several st'tes expressly established for the purpose . Some of these societies have already been efficient and eminently serviceable . Twentyone volumes have been given to the public by the Massachusetts Historical Society , and one volume at least is annually published . By the New York Society three volumes have been printed , and we understand that a fourth may soon be expected from the press , comprising a second volume of Smith 's History of New York , left by the author in manuscript . The library of this Society is valuable , and is well supplied with books on American history . It must not be concealed , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been prosecuted recently with the same ardor and success , as at the beginning . The New Hampshire Society has begun to publish its collections , and a good deal is to be expected from that quarter . There is a Historical Society in Connecticut , but we do not learn that the l ) ublic has as yet been favored with its contributions . We hope that gentlemen of leisure and inquiry in other states will shortly follow these examples , so hono* able , and so well calculated to rescue from oblivion the memorials of the lofty spirit , the brave deeds , and the enduring fortitude of our fathers , who settled and subdued the land of our inheritance , and planted the seeds of liberty from which we are now enjoying an abundant and grateful harvest . A new Society has been formed in Pennsylvania , with the design of collecting materials illustrating the history of that state ; and in the volume before us , we have the first fruits of its labors . The specific objects of this Society , as set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . These are stated to be the national origin and domestic habits of the first settlers of Pennsylvania ; biography of William Penn , his family , and other settlers ; biographical notices of eminent persons in modern times ; aborigines of America ; principles // to which is to be ascribed the rapid peopling of Pennsylvania ; general polity , revenues , and expenses of the colonial government ; judicial history ; medical history ; literary history ; agriculture , manufactures , and commerce . It is thus seen that the Society has given itself a great latitude of research , and that the zeal of its members need not flag for the want of suitable incitements . A separate committee , consisting of several gentlemen , is appointed for the investigation of each of these topics . Eleven years ago a committee of the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia was formed , expressly for literary and historical purposes , and why it has been deemed necessary to create a new society for the same objects , and in the same place , we know not , nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity and usefulness of both will be promoted by such an arrangemeut . It is to be feared , however , that by this division of forces the strength of the whole body will be weakened . There can be no question , in short , that much the greatest results would be produced by a union of the zeal and exertions of all parties . That no one can be associated with the Historical Committee , who is not a memher of the Philosophical Society , is a very serious bar to the usefulness of that committee , and unless this obstacle could be removed , by some more liberal conditions of membership , the reasons perhaps were sufficiently cogent for setting up a new association on a broader basis . It is not to be supposed , that the persons most ardent in antiquarian and historical research , will always be the best qualified to belong to a philosophical society . Yet we think the president 's language a little too strong , when he says in his inaugural discourse , speaking of the Committee , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the silence which they have maintained , since the publication of their first volume , seven years ago , it may he inferred rather that they are indifferent to the public , than that the public is indifferent to them . Another volume is understood to be in preparation , if not now ready for the press . Besides the inaugural discourse of Mr Rawle , president of the society , the volume now under notice contains a memoir by Roberts Vaux , on the locality of the famous treaty between William Penn and the Indians ; notes on the provincial literature of Pennsylvania , by Thomas I. Wharton ; and a memoir on the controversy between William Penn and Lord Baltimore , respecting the boundaries of Pennsylvania and Maryland , by James // Dunlop . These are all judicious tracts , and throw as much light as could he expected or desired on the points of history , which their authors attempt to discuss . Among other things Mr Rawle goes into an elaborate argument , to prove the rights of the aborigines to the soil of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave the Indians as strong claims , as in a more advanced stage of civilization . On this topic we do not fully agree with him , believing his reasoning to he more refined than practical . It is true in general , that what is right in one sense is so in another ; but there are such things as conditional rights , and we apprehend this case of the Indians to be one of that description . A right to the soil depends on the mode by which possession was acquired , ' says Mr Rawle ; it is only by military conquest , or voluntary cession that the rights of the original occupants are divested . ' Now in our view there is a previous question to be disposed of . What was the nature of the right by which the Indians held possession ? Was it the right of occupancy ? Doubtless it was , as far as the European settlers were concerned , for no other proof of right could he exhibited by the Indians ; nor would any other be required to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants bore any proportion to the quantity of land they claimed . But to argue seriously , that a handful of savage people has a right to retain exclusive possession of as much laud as it can wander over , during the four seasons of the year , in pursuit of game , andre ject all other people from this domain , is carrying the metaphysical side of the question a little too far . Mr Raxvle goes back to Adam , and says that to him was given dominion over the earth , ' and adds , that dominion thus became a quality incident to rational existence . ' Take this for granted , the question then occurs , How much dominion ? Every human being undoubtedly has a natural right to soil enough to procure his subsistence , but here his natural right ends . If he possesses more , it must be by some conventional or conditional right . The laws of nations have recognised the rights of conquest and purchase , the first chiefly from necessity , and the second from convenience . Hobbes believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Puffendorf in that of excellence . But take it as you will , the dimensions of the Indian rights become very scanty . As to the dubious right of conquest , we know not enough of their history to say anything on the subject ; they made no pre // tensions to purchase ; they were few in numbers and comparatively feeble in sirength ; and for mental or moral excellence they were not distinguished . Where then is the validity , or sacredness of the Indian rights , which rendered it unlaxvful for the inhabitants of other regions to settle in the wilderness , which the Indians did nothing to subdue , or to draw nourishment and riches from the soil , which they left desolate and barren ? Did the first Indian , who stepped upon the western continent , actually possess in fee simple one half of the globe , and had he a right to exclude all the rest of the world from his hemisphere , if such were his will and pleasure ? Was this dominion incident to his rational existence ? It is presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been as legitimate and substantial a proprietor of the hemisphere , as the first settler . The same may be said of ten , or twenty , or a hundred . The reason is , that as yet they possessed nothing by a conventional right , and no individual by his natural right could claim more than was sufficient for himself , and those immediately dependant upon him . As the people multiplied , and property increased , conventional rights grew up with the advancement of society , existing in different degrees according to the progress of civilization , and the recognised rules of social and civil order . When the Europeans came first to these shores , had the native population been dense , the country covered with villages and cultivated fields , the streams and bays filled with commerce , had manufactures and the arts flourished , and had an immensely increased value been given to the soil by the labor and skill of men , there would then have been in the condition of the people all the constituent qualities of a perfect right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excellence , or purchase . Encroachments then would have been unlawful , because civilization had stamped the mark of property on every foot of land , and every other desirable object of possession . But the case , as it stood with the Indians , was as different from this as possible . They were found here in the midst of a wide wilderness , scattered over a vast tract of country , savage in their habits and manners , paying no attention to agriculture or any of the arts of civilized life , roaming from place to place , amid exliansting their whole powers of mind and body in gaining a precarious subsistence by the chase , and waging bloody wars with each other . To all appearance they had been here for centu // lies , without advancing a single step in the road of human improvement . This applies we believe with strict accuracy to all the Indian tribes north of Mexico . Now to suppose that such a people had a right to this whole continent , or to any large portion of it , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were peaceably seeking an abode in some corner of the same wilderness , is in our view to misapprehend the true nature of aboriginal rights , and to overlook the wise and beneficent designs of Providence , as seen in the progress of human affairs , and the government of the world . Thus far we have been speaking of right ; but when we come to the facts of history we shall not differ from Mr Rawle and others , whose warmth of sympathy in the cause of the Indians has been such , as the melancholy fate of that unhappy race s calculated to kindle . It would be in vain to attempt to justify the first settlers in many of their acts . If they had a right to a quiet occupancy of the soil , they had no right to wabe unprovoked war against the natives , to drive them back , and seize the lands which they valued as being the dwelling place of their fathers , and on which the council fires had been lighted up for ages . The power of association , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chained them to spots from which they ought not wantonly to have been driven . Even the pilgrims at Plymouth landed in a hostile attitude under their military leader , Miles Standish . The first settlers seemed to have a contempt for the indians , and to regard and treat them as possessing but few of the attributes of human beings . The Indians perceived this . They knew , moreover , that the whites practised deceptions upon them , overreaching and defrauding them whenever they could . They felt the indignity and injury , and it was natural that they should show resentment and seek revenge . Then followed fightings and bloodshed , with all the horrors and cruelties incident to savage warfare . Nine times in ten , we are convinced , these calamities were the direct consequences of the fiinaticism , indiscretion , ignorance , or cupidity of the whites . A particle of wisdom , or of a knowledge of the savage character , with another particle of honesty , would have prevented the destructive wars , which at last nearly exterminated the red men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites . When we look back upon these scenes of our early history , and survey the picture they present , however much we may be shocked at the a1arin* atrocities of the barbarous natives . // we can find no apology for their intruding neighbors , who pro . yoked these atrocities , and whose duty and policy it was rather to conciliate and soothe , than stir up and inflame the wild passions of uncivilized men . They drove the Indian to his ruin , but they nerved his arm with revenge , and brought a blow down upon their own heads , from the deep effects of which they did not soon recover . It is consolatory , however , in running over these dark records in the annals of our forefathers , to light upon some brighter spots , which show their character to better advantage . The fame of William Penn has derived much lustre from his friendly , peaceful , and honorable mode of treating the Indians , in making all his acquisitions by fair purchase . The praise of this conduct has perhaps been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Mr Rawle 's discourse is that , in which he examines the early history of the colonies , with direct reference to this subject . It appears that in all the colonies , from the time of their first settlement , purchases of lands from the Indians were frequently made . Belkuap speaks of purchases at Plymouth , and as early as 1629 , a company of persons from iN'Iassachusetts purchased of the Sagamore of Penacook , and other chiefs assembled at Squamscot falls , a tract of land , for which a regular deed of conveyance was obtained , with the universal consent of their subjects , for what they deemed a valuable consideration in shirts , coats , and kettles . ' * Morton says , that the lands at Plymouth were a donation to the first settlers by Massasoiet , king of the country . Purchases were afterwards made from him , but by the following passage , quoted by Mr Rawle from Hutchinson , it would appear that the terms were not always unexceptionable . In speaking of king Philip , it is observed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other conveyed to the English all that they were possessed of , yet Philip had sense enough to distinguish between a free , voluntary covenant , and one made under duress . ' And afterwards the general court of Massachusetts urged a claim to the Pequot country by right of conquest . Several purchases were made in Connecticut , particularly of the Pequots by Lord Say and Seal , and of others by John Mason . We can not forbear in this place to quote Mr Rawle 's short description of the brave and lofty spirited Pequots . We think it discriminating and just . // Tl*e Pequots were a highminded race ; the only nation which , in that part of the world , had refused to pay tribute to the imperial Mohawks ; they knew and valued their own rights , they foresaw the ruin that impended on their national existence by the introduction of a superior class of beings , armed with destructive weapons , and eager to use them . The praises due to patriotism and courage , the admiration we bestow upon ancient nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties , and their soil , should not be withheld from the Pequots . Like the Carthaginians , they have no historians of their own . We take their history , and our impressions of their character , from the pens of their enemies , their oppressors and ultimate destroyers . If we find them soon afterwards engaged in a severe and bloody war with the English , we are not thence to infer , that the Pequots were the aggressors . ' p. 60 . It has been the fate of all the tribes to be like the Carthaginians , in having their history written by their enemies . Could they now come up from their graves , and tell the tale of their own wrongs , reveal their motives , and describe their actions , Indian history would put on a different garb from the one it now wears , and the voice of justice would cry much louder in their behalf than it has yet done . In pursuing his inquiry into the origin of titles to Indian lands , Mr Rawle finds that the same amicable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Netherlands , and by others to a certain extent in New Jersey , and on the Delaware river ; and particularly by the Swedes on the western bank of that river in 1637 . In Virginia , the Carolinas , and Georgia , there is ample testimony of titles having been acquired by purchase . The result of Mr Rawle 's inquiries , in relation to this subject , is on the whole more favorable to the whites , than has commonly been supposed . Whatever aggressions may have been committed by them , and it is well known that these were neither few nor small , the proofs are incontestible , that numerous purchases were made in a peaceable manner before the time of Penn . And this may be said , without detracting anything from the high and just praise due to that distinguished philanthropist and legislator . In Mr Vaux 's memoir , respecting the place in which the famous treaty between William Penn and the natives was ratified , he establishes the common opinion , by arguments as strong perhaps as the nature of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // Delaware in Kensington , the northern suburbs of the present city of Philadelphia , under a large tree , which was to be seen there till 1810 , when it was uprooted by a storm . A vague notion has gone abroad , that this treaty was formed farther down the river , at the Uplands , the present site of Chester . Other places have claimed this distinction , as did the Grecian cities the honor of hem5 the birthplace of Homer , but the testimony is in favor of the great elm tree in Kensington . The following extract from a letter on this subject , by the venerable Richard Peters , dated September 6 , 1825 , will be read with interest . It appears that the seat of Penn 's government was first established at Upland , or Chester ; where several of his letters are dated . Now I have always understood that Talks with the Indians , preparat*ry to a final arrangement by a conclusive treaty , were held at Upland , or Chester . But it is almost indisputably probable , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn chose to hold this treaty beyond the reach of any jealousy about the neighborhood of fortified places , and within the lines of his province , far from such places ; and at a spot which had been an Indian settlement , familiar to , and esteemed by , the natives ; and where neither Swedes nor Dutch could be supposed to have influence ; for with them the Indians had bickerings . This view of the subject gives the strongest confirmation to the tradition of the treaty being held at Kensington ; and the tree , so much hallowed , afforded its shade to the parties in that important transaction . The prudent and necessary conferences , or talks , preparatory to the treaty ; if any vestiges of them now remain , may have given the idea that the treaty was held at Upland . The name and character or William Penn , denominated by the Indians , Onas , was held is veneration , through a long period , by those who had opportunities of knowing the integrity of his dealings and intercourse , especially by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations and tribes with whom he had dealings in his time , and his successors thereafter who adhered to the policy and justice practised by him . At Fort Stanwix , fiftyseven years ago , I was present when the Delawares and Shaxvanese were released by the Iroquois , or Six Nations , ( originally five , ) from the subordination in which they had been held from the time of their having been conquered . The ceremony was called " taking off the petticoat , " and was a curious spectacle . When I was adopted into the family of a Tuscarora chief , at the time of the treaty of Fort Stanwix , he made to me a speech , in the style used on such occasions , in which he assured // me of his affection , and added , that he was pleased with my being one of Ike young people of the country of the muck respected and highly esteemed Onas , " which means a quill or pen . lie gave to me one of his names- Tegochtias . He had been a celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilsome and dangerous , against the southern Indians . The feathers , and desiccated or preserved birds , called by the Indians Tegocklias , i. e . Paroquets , were brought home by the war parties , as Trophies . The feathers decorated the Moccasins ( whereof I had a pair presented to me ) , mixed with porcupine 's quills in l ) eautifully ornamented workmanship . If there be any thing in my Indian name of Paroquet , ludicrous in our estimation , I shall not be ashamed of it , when the great and good Penn , was denominated , not a whole bird , but merely a quill . My moccasins cost me an expensive return , in a present the ceremony required ; but I considered the singular honor conferred on me , richly deserving remuneration ; though , in fact , I was more diverted than proud in the enjoyment of the amusing and curious scene , and had no doubt but that this expected remuneration was an ingredient in the motive leading to my adoption . lJIy nation is reduced , as is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely annihilated ; though at that time it ( the confederacy ) could bring three thousand warriors into the field . ' pp. 89-952 . Mr XVharton 's Notes on the literature of Pennsylvania contain curious facts , concerning the early history of that colony , which we recommend to our readers . It will be recollected , that this was the theatre of Franklin 's labors as a printer , and the place where the foundation of his great fame as a writer was laid . In connexion with his main subject , Mr Wharton has glanced occasionally at the literary condition of other colonies , lie has drawn our attention to a remarkable letter of William Berkeley , governor of Viro*inia to the Committee of the colonies in England , written in the year 1671 , more than sixty years after the first settlement of the colony . The state of learning at that time in Virginia will be understood , by the closing paragraph of his letter . The same course is taken here , ' he observes , for instructing the people , as there is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children according to his ability . We have fortyeight parishes , and our ministers are well paid , and by my consent should be better , if they would pray oftener and preach less ; but as of all other commodities , so of this , the worst are sent us , and we have few that we can boast of , since // the persecution in Cromwell 's tyranny drove divers worthy men hither . Yet I thank God there are no free schools , nor printing . For learning has brought disobedience , and heresy , and sects , into the world , and printing has divulged them and libels against the best government . God keep us from both . ' * This extraordinary doctrine was uttered by a governor of one of the most powerful provinces in America , towards the close of the seventeenth century . Happily it accorded in nothing with the spirit of Penn , or of the descendants of the Pilgrims . Mr Dunlop 's Memoir , on the controversy respecting the boundaries of Pennsylvania and Maryland , involves a discussion upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successful in elucidating a somewhat entangled point of colonial history , and placing it in an intelligible form before the reader , which has not been attempted we believe in any other treatise , drawn up expressly for the purpose . Before closing these remarks , we are tempted to say a word more on the utility of Historical Societies . The importance of speedy exertions , in collecting the remnants of such scattered materials as we possess , and of securing them in safe and accessible depositories , needs not to be urged . Every day adds to the chance of their being destroyed or lost . Time besieges them with its wasting power , or the tide of oblivion rolls over them . Let them be brought together , arranged , and preserved according to their purpose and value , and be made fruitful sources of knowledge to future historians , and the efficient means of abridging their labors . The deeds of our forefathers , their early struggles and protracted sufferings , are themes worthy to be had in remembrance and deep reverence by those , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted in perilous tunes , with such sacrifices of blood and happiness . To lay these up in the chambers of our memory , and transmit them as a choice inheritance to our children , is no more than a dictate of nature , confirmed by the example of all ages , and the first impulses of the heart . The patriots and heroes , who achieved our liberties , are equally to be held in honor , and the records of their great actions engraven on tablets , which time shall not destroy , nor * Chalmers ' Annals , Book I. chap . 13 . The first printing press introduced into any part of America , north of Mexico , was set op in Cambridge , Massachusetts , in 1638 . Printing was introduced into Pennsylvania as early as 1686 ; and into Virginia about 1727. // accident mar . By a good history of the country only can this be effected , and such a history can not be written , till the materials , of which it must be composed , shall be collected and made easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society to search out every printed volume , pamphlet , and document relating to the history of America , and such manuscripts particularly as come within the professed compass of its inquiries . A person , who has not examined this subject , would be surprised at the exceedingly small number of books in our public libraries , on the history of this country . Nothing is more rare in these collections , than a copy of many of the colonial histories . After we have mentioned the library of Harvard College , of the Athena*um and Historical Society in Boston , of the Historical Society in NewYork , of the Philosophical Society and the city library of Philadelphia , and the library of Congress , we know not another , in which the whole stock of books relating to America may not be ranged in the corner of a single case . The collection at Cambridge is by far the most ample , and it is a poor compliment to our native zeal , that this was made principally by foreigners , and has been transferred from Hamburgh and Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our wealthy citizens . The library of Congress is remarkably deficient in this department , having gained no acquisitions since the purchase from Mr Jefferson , except of the new current books . If there be a library in the Union , which ought to be more rich than any other in works of ' this description , it is that belonging to the nation . The city libraries of Charleston and Baltimore are judiciously selected for general purposes , but as to American history they are meagre . In neither of them can be found a full set of the printed books , journals , and documents relating to the state of which it is the metropolis . You can learn more of the fabulous ages of Greece and Rome , or of the Saxon Heptarchy , than of America , in the greater portion of the public libraries in the United States . A few private libraries are well supplied with works on American history , one of the most copious of which is understood to be that of an eminent jurist in New Hampshire . State libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patronage of the legislatures , as in North Carolina , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey . This example is worthy to be imitated by all the states . If the representatives will cherish a proper interest in the subject , every important historical record // and paper in the states may soon be collected into these centres . The state library of North Carolina exhibits the rarest instance of bibliornaniu , probably , which has occurred on the western continent . Lawson 's history of Carolina , a thin quarto volume , of small size and a good deal worn , was recently purchased by the library committee , at the sale of a private bentleman 's books in that state , for the round sum of sixty dollars . The book was printed in London , 1718 , and at the bottom of the title page xve read , Price five shillings . ' * The state library at Harrisburgh , * The entire title of the work is as follows . The History of Caro* lina , containing the exact Description and Natural History of that Country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand Miles , travelled through several Nations of Indians , giving a particular Account of their Customs , Manners , &amp;c . By John Lawson , Gent . Surveyor General of North Carolina . London . Printed for T* Warner , at the Black Boy in Pater Noster Row , 1718 . Price five Shillings . ' The volume consists of two hundred and fiftyeight pages , about one third of which is taken up with an account of the Indians . At the close of his Introduction the author makes the following remarks . The merchants of Carolina are fair , frank traders . The gentlemen seated in the country are very courteous , live very nobly in their houses , and give very genteel entertainments to all strangers , and others , that come to visit them . And since the produce of South and North Carolina is the same , unless silk , which this place produces great quantities of ; and very good , North Carolina having never made any trial thereof as yet , therefore I shall refer the natural produce of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions are much the same . The Christian inhabitants of both colonies are pretty equal , but the slaves in South Carolina are far more in number than those in the North . I shall now proceed to relate my journey from this settlement to the other , and then treat of the natural history of Carolina , with other remarkable circumstances , which I have met with during my eight years ' abode in that country . ' Accordingly he proceeds next to his Journal , which he opens thus . December the twentycightli , 1700 . I began my voyage for North Carolina from Charles Town , being six Englishmen in company , with three Indian men and one woman , wife to our Indian guide . ' In this manner they journeyed , till they came , as the author expresses it , to Pamticough river in North Carolina , *vl*ere , being well received by the inhabitants , and pleased with the goodness of the country , we all resolved to continue . ' How long he continued we are not informed , but his work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in Dublin , in the year 1737 , entitled , Natu* ral History of North Carolina , by John Brickell , M. D. ' which is remarkable for being *mn almost exact verbal transcript of Lawson 's History , without any acknowledgment on the part of the author , or even a hint that it is not original . Periods and paragraphs are transposed ; parts are occasionally omitted , and words and sentences here and there interin // Pennsylvania , contains many portly folios , in antique garb , presented by William Penn , among which are the best of the old English authors . To these have been added the standard works on politics , history , and legislation . Printed journals , pamphlets , and documents relating to the Revolution , constitute another kind of historical matter , which should be speedily collected . It is an extraordinary fact , that in hardly a single state can be found , in any one place , a full copy of the journals and records of that state , during the period of the Revolution . In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first conventions , when the colonies began to take upon themselves the powers and the acts of self governmeat , and when new constitutions were framed . The negligence iu this respect is unaccountable . No doubt a few perfect copies might be obtained , by proper exertions , for although no individual may possess the whole , yet all the parts may be in the hands of several . It would be a worthy enterpris* for any historical society to appoint a committee , for the express purpose of collecting a perfect copy of the printed journals of the conventions and assemblies , from the beginning to the end of the revolutionary contest . The unsettled state of the times may perhaps be considered the cause of the carelessness , which prevailed in preserving papers , whether printed or in manuscript . Another desideratum of immense importance in a historical collection , is a perfect body of the statutes of all the colonies and states , down to the formation of the federal constitution . The various editions of revised laws are not enough , for it will often happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more essential as a historical record , than half a score of others , which have been kept in force . At the period of the Revolution , particularly , the laws , which illustrated most strikingly the state and spirit of the times , were the very ones soonest out of date . The entire statutes are alone valuable for history , and we do not believe there is a library in the Union , which can boast of possessing these for more than one or two states at the utmost limit . Vir0inia is the only state , which has published its own laws in polated ; but , as a whole , a more darirrg piece of plagiarism was never executed . The fact that this volume was published by sabseription , only nineteen years after Lawson 's History , is presumptive evidence , perhaps , that this latter work , for reasons now unknown , had become so rare , as to reader a detection of the plagiarism improbable . Both of the above works are in the Boston Athena*umn* // Oct* . Materials for *mericctn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statutes at Large , in thirteen volumes , is &amp;xvork reflecting the highest credit on the wistlom and liberality of Virginia , as well as on the industry and good judgment of the editor . With the full body of the laws , printed in chronological order , are mingled historical illustrations . The work , indeed , has no parallel in any other state , in regard either to its origin and execution , its extent , or the mode of its publication . It was printed at the charge of the commonwealth , and we presume at a considerable pecuniary sacrifice , for it is sold at a price hardly adequate to the cost . The project was designed for public benefit , and in attaining this end it has been successful . The proceedings of the conventions of Virginia , at the beginning of the Revolution , have also been reprinted by order of the legislature . It may not be out of place here to correct a prevalent erroi ' , respecting the first written Constitution in this country . It has been generally supposed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Jefferson 's letter to Major Cartwright , lately published in the biographical memoir of that veteran friend of liberty , he writes , Virginia was not only the first of the states , but 1 believe I may say the first of the nations of the earth , which assembled its wise men peaceably together to form a constitution , to commit it to writing , and place it among their archives , where every one should be free to appeal to its text. * In this paragraph there is a mistake , in respect to its main point , as will be perceived by referring to dates . The convention , which formed the constitution of Virginia , assembled on the sixth of May , and continued by adjournments till the fifth of July , 1776 . But the constitution of South Carolina was adopted on the twentysixth of March preceding , more than two months before that of Virginia , at what was called the Second Session of the Second Provincial Congress , ' which assembled at Charleston on the first of February . The president of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February , a committee was appointed to prepare a plan or form of government , as had been reconimended by the continental Congress in the preceding November . Of this committee , Charles Cotesworth Piuckney was chairman , as would appear from the journal . A constitution was reported a few days afterward , which was discussed and amended from time to time , till it was finally adopted on the day abovementioned . The constitution itself may be seen in the journal // of the second provincial Congress ol ' South Carolina , printed immediately after the session . The same day on which this constitution was adopted , that is , March 26th , 1776 , the officers of the new government were elected . John Rutledge was chosen president , or governor , and Henry Laurens vice president . From these facts , it is evident that the constitution of South Carolina was promulgated before that of Virginia , and , as far as we know , it was the first written constitution in America . A primary object of historical societies should be to collect manuscripts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of less value in such a manner that they can be consulted by the historian and curious inquirer . The country abounds with historical manuscripts , in the hands of individuals and in public offices . It is to be lamented , however , that few public colonial manuscripts remain . In some of the states , the early journals of the assemblies and of the councils have been kept unbroken , but it is a fact worthy of particular remark , that in very few of the states , in none certainly south of New York , can be discovered a vestige of the correspondence of the provincial governors , nor any of the unpublished state papers anterior to the Revolution . This can be accounted for only upon the supposition , that the governors took away with them all the papers of this description . The journals are barren in matters of history , exhibiting little more than a dry detail of the daily proceedings of the legislative and executive bodies . The journal of the Council of South Carolina , under the provincial government , amounts to forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and occasional copies of letters . In Georgia there is very little to elucidate early history , but what there is , we have good reason to believe , has been thoroughly examined , and will be faithfully reported , by Mr Bevan , who is now engaged under the auspices of the legislature in writing a history of the state . North Carolina is not without materials for early history . Mr Francis Xavier Martin many years ago made preparations for writing a history of that state , but his project never came to maturity . Judge M urphey is engaged in the same undertaking . Williamson 's history is very imperfect . in Virginia all the public records and papers were burnt in January , 1781 , when the British took possession of Richmond under Arnold . Up to that date the offices are blank . Maryland was more fortunate , and its provincial records are well preserved . In Pennsylvania these continue without interruption from the first session of Penn 's council , // down to the end of the old government . The journals of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the government . But none of these sources is by any means fertile in the best materials . In short , the colonial history of America is shut up in the office of the Board of Trade and Plantations in England . The original papers are all here , and no tolerable history can be written without a free and full use of them . A copy of the entire mass of those papers , as far as they relate to this country , ought to be obtained and deposited in the national archives at Washington . TI*e government is the proper organ for managing this business , and we can hardly imagine an act more honorable , or more indicative of wisdom , good sense , and patriotism , than an effort to procure such a copy , through our minister at London . It can not be supposed , that the British cabinet will at this day have any objection to copies being taken of papers , relating solely to this country , especially when we consider the enlightened and liberal men of whom that cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finding out and collecting manuscripts , at present in the hands of individuals , which have a direct bearing on the origin and events of the Revolution . This is the grand period in our national history , upon which future ages will look back with peculiar interest , and mark as a prominent epoch in the progress of mankind . The correspondence of the officers of the army , the first governors of the states , the delegates in Congress , and other leading men of the times , should be eagerly sought and rescued from the fate , which is impending over it . Much of this we know has already been lost , by the carelessness or indiscretion of the persons , into whose hands it has fallen . It will all gradually disappear , unless seasonably deposited in the safe keeping of some public body , where a perpetual watchfulness will be exercised over it . The history of some private manuscripts has already been curious . Our readers will recollect , that two or three years ago a large bundle of letters was brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which proved to be the private correspondence of Paul Jones . When Paul Jones left America for the last time , he committed to the care of his friend , John Ross , of Philadelphia , several packages of manuscript papers , consisting of letters , journals , and vouchers of his landed and other property in America . A power of attorney was afterwards sent to Mr Robert Hyslop , merchant of New York , to receive those packages in // rust for the heirs of Paul Jones . An agent came to this country and settled the pecuniary affairs , but the papers , on being examined , were allowed to remain in the hands of Mr Hyslop in trust , as undivided property belonging equally to all the heirs of Paul Jones . At length Robert Hyslop died , and the papers then fell into the hands of his executor , John Hyslop , haker in Nexv York . This is a brief explanation of the somewhat singular circumstance , of papers of this sort having been discovered in a baker 's shop . They were valuable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the Revolution . Another remark we may add respecting the papers of Paul Jones . By his will he left all his effects to his two sisters , who resided at or near Dumfries , in Scotland , to be divided equally between them and their children , in as many shares as there were individuals in the two families , constituting his two sisters guardians of their respective children during their minority . In 1793 , one of the sisters , and the husband of the other , went to Paris , to recover a debt due from the French government to Paul Jones , and took with them to Scotland , among other things , all the papers left by him . A division of the effects and papers was immediately made , by a gentleman appoiuted for the purpose , with the mutual consent of the parties , who bound themselves to abide by his decision , This gentleman pursued an extraordinary course in regard to the papers . He portioned them out in two parcels , by weight and measure , just as they happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or connexion . The two families resided for some time in Scotland , and when Dr Duncan , eight or nine years ago , prepared the short biographical sketch of Paul Jones , for the Edinhurgh Encyclopa*dia , he appears to have had access to all the papers . Since that time a branch of one of the families has removed to America , and brought hither a part of the papers , all , it is presumed , which this branch had in its possession . A few years ago , a niece of Paul Jones , who inherited from her mother the portion of papers that fell to her lot , made an overture to the Historical Society of New York to publish them . The negociation was not successful , hut the manuscripts were sent out to New York for inspection , where they now remain in the hands of an individual in trust for the owner . They are fair copies , collected into four volumes , the three first of which relate chiefly to the part the author took in the American Revo // lution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted wholly to his services in Russia . The contents of all the volumes are chiefly letters , and official papers , some of which have been published . To the first volume is prefixed a memoir of his life , but by what hand we know not . There is also a short narrative of the transactions in which he was engaged during the American war , but the substance of this is nearly the same as that , which he presented to the king of France . It is a mistake , however , which some way or other crept into . the Edinburgh Encyclopa*dia , that Paul Jones has left anything , which can be properly called a memoir of his own life by himself . What is to be the destiny of these papers we are not informed , but they are obviously essential to any correct delineation of the life and character of Paul Jones . In closing these hints , we can not but repeat a suggestion made by us on a former occasion , that individuals , who possess manuscripts of public interest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archives of public institutions , where the chance of their being preserved will be much greater than in private hands . The example of Mr Richard H. Lee , author of the valuable biography of his grandfather , is in this respect worthy of the highest commendation . The numerous papers , which belonged to his grandfather , Richard Henry Lee , he has resolved to deposite in the library of the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia , and the papers of Arthur Lee he intends in like manner for Harvard College . Thus will these wise men , and warm patriots , speak to posterity through their writings , and the writings of their friends , which for many reasons it might not be expedient to publish in detail . As works of reference such collections will be invaluable to the historian ; and members of historical societies , and of similar institutions , can not exercise their influence or their industry in a more profitable way , than in gathering up from every quarter materials of this kind .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
