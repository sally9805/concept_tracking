txt ART . VI. -. /2 History of the Life and Voyages of Christoplier Columbus . By WASHINGTON IRVING . 3 vols. 8vo . New York , and London . 1828 . THIS is one of those works , which are at the same time the delight of readers and the despair of critics . It is as nearly perfect in its kind , as any work well can be ; and there is therefore little or nothing left for the reviewer , but to write at the hottom of every page , as Voltaire said he should be obliged to do , if he published a commentary on Racine , Puic/tr* ! bene ! optirn* ! And as the reputation of the author is so well established , that be does not stand in need of our recommendation as a passport to the public favor , it may appear , and in fact is , almost superfluous to pretend to give a formal review of 1 ) iS book . Nevertheless , we can not refuse ourselves the satisfaction of adding the mite of our poor applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has already rewarded the labors of our ingenious , excellent , and amiable fellow citizen ; nor would it , as we conceive , he proper to omit noticing in this journal a work , however well known to the public , which we consider as being , on the whole , more honorable to the literature of the country , than any one that has hitherto appeared among us . Before we proceed to give our opinion in detail of the History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus , ' we shall offer a few remarks on the character and merit of Mr Irving 's other works , premising that we write under the influ // Jan. ence of the feelings that naturally result from a good deal of friendl*r personal intercourse with this gentleman . If any reader shall suspect , that we judge Mr Irving too favorably because we know him too well , he is quite at liberty to make any deductions from the sum total of our commendation , that he may on this account deem in candor to be necessary . Mr Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory that belong to the illustrious hero of his present work , that of leading the way in a previously unexplored and untrodden path of intellectual labor . He is the first writer of purely Cisatlantic origin and education , who succeeded in establishing a high and undisputed reputation , founded entirely on literary talent and success . This was the opinion expressed by a very judicious and discerning writer in the Edinburgh Review , upon the first publication of the Sketch Book ; ' and it is , as we conceive , a substantially correct one . In saying this , we are perfectly aware that there have been found among us , at every period during the two centuries of our history , individuals highly distinguished , both at home and abroad , by important and useful labors in various branches of art and science . We mean not to detract , in the least , from their well-earned fame , which we cherish , on the contrary , as the richest treasure that belongs to their posterity , and would do everything in our power to establish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first or the greatest man that ever handled a pen in the United States . Vixdre fortes ante . /lgamemnona . Our pilgrim fathers were accomplished scholars and powerful writers , according to the taste and learning of the times . One of their immediate successors , the pride and ornament in his day of a highly respectable college , is justly placed on an equality with the most profound and acute metaphysicians of Europe . The state papers of the revolution have been pronounced , by the first orator and statesmen of the mother country , to equal or surpass the noblest efforts of antiquity of the same description . In the exact sciences we have contributed as much or more than our share to the common stock of discovery and improvement , from the time of the first settlement of the colonies up to the present day . But our success in the department of polite literature and poetry ( which are essentially one and the same thing ) had not , until a very recent period , corresponded with our progress in most others . After all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkinsons , the Dwights , the Barlows* the Humphreyses ,  --  Arcadians all ,  --  all animated with a fine spirit and by no means laboring without effect , but yet rather as amateurs than as artists ; - after all that had been done by these and various others of equal or hardly inferior merit , we still wanted the sacred poet . ' We had no name distinguished by repeated triumphs on the field of polite learr*ing , too brilliant to be overlooked , too generally acknowledged abroad and at home to be gainsaid or controverted , which we could present to friend and foe as a proof of our capacity for these delightful pursuits ; no series of elegant and highly finished works of this class in verse or prose , to exhibit as specimens of what we could accomplish . The reasons of this deficiency are too obvious in themselves , and have been too often published in good and ill nature , to be now questionable . It was not owing to want of genius . That divine gift has been as liberally imparted in the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever flourished on the face of the earth ; and the English race , to which we belong , has always been pre*imiiinntly distinguished in both the great branches , Saxon and Norman , that combine to form its mingled stock , by the favor of the Muses . Nor yet did the difficulty lie m want of patronage , the presence or absence of which has liftie or nothing to do with the developement of genuine excellence . The real cause , as has been very generally felt by judicious observers , was the condition of the country , which created an urgent and continual demand for talent in the various walks of active life . A vast continent was to be subdued and cultivated ; all the branches of mechanical industry ( as far as the mother country would permit us  --  to exercise them ) to be commenced . Here was business enough for the mass of the people . For minds of an elevated stamp , the liberal professions , education , public and private , and the high functions of government , opened fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter . The desk , the bench , the professor 's chair , the principal political and military offices , were not with us the patrimony of particular families , but the acknowledged property of merit and talent , which , as soon as they showed themselves , were summoned , by the loud and unanimous acclaim of the public , to enter in and take possession . Had our fathers been insensible to this high vocation , they would have shown that they were unworthy of it , and in* // capable of excellence in anything . Our Ovids and Martials were therefore lost in Franklins , Adamses , and Jeffersons , as were those of England in Murrays and Pulteneys ; and the loss , we may well add , was exceeding gain . It was not then the absence of talent or poetical inspiration , but the more imperious and urgent ,  --  let us not be unjust to our ancestors ,  --  the nobler and loftier nature of the call for active labor in the moral and political service of the public , that checked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Virgil , who was compelled to abandon at once his country and his favorite amusements , beheld with admiration , if not with envy , his comrade playing on his rustic pipe , under the shade of the accustomed beech tree . Our fathers , if they felt any emotions of regret , at quitting their literary and poetical pursuits , could at least console themselves with the reflection , that they made the sacrifice , not to quit but to serve their country ; and in obedience to her sacred voice , sprang with alacrity and pleasure into the walks of active life . We had men enough among us , who were smit with the love of sacred song ' ; who in earlier life exhibited splendid proofs that their love was by no means an unrequited passion ; and who , had they devoted themselves exclusively to letters , would have carried off the most brilliant honors in any department which they might have selected . Such were the persoi*s , whose names we mentioned above honoris causd ; but they too fell under the general rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one way or another , in the public service , that wrought with irresistible force upon every generous souL They were all , as is well known , employed in the highest , the gravest , the most absorbing political , moral , or military affairs ; and we possess in their literary effusions either the unripe fruits of their youth , or the hasty and casual recreations , that amused the few leisure hours of their maturer years . Mr Barlow , for example , was originally a poet of great promise . His Vision of Columbus , ' written at a very early age , and which has not been improved by his subsequent labors upon it , exhibited a talent , which , if properly cultivated by persevering study and assiduous exercise , would have produced works of a very high , if not of the highest order ; but he was hurried away , like the rest , by the animating movement of every thing about him , and swept at once into active life , where the serious affairs in which he was engaged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diminished his capacity to excel in them ; so that when he came back to them at a later period , for the purpose of publishing a corrected edition of his poem , he had lost a part of his power , and his verse had not quite the same freshness and vigor , that distinguished it before . It is pleasing , however , to see in these productions , though of somewhat inferior poetical merit , how fondly his thoughts reverted , from anidst the busy scenes in which he was engaged , to the happy period of his youth , and dwelt , in fond recollection , on the rocky hills of New England , and the beautiful valley of the Connecticut , in which he had his birth . Thus we find him , while accompanying the French army as a representative of the Convention on the first invasion of Piedmont , so strongly excited by the view of the maize which grows in abundance in that country , though little cultivated in most parts of Europe , that he wrote , upon the spur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his prettiest and most lively poems . Mr Barlow 's case was that of all the rest . General Humphreys was a military officer of high rank , and a foreign minister . He wrote most of his poems in the tent of the commander in chief , which , in the nature of things , could not well in this case have been pitched on the summits of Pindus , or in the classic valley of Aonian Aganippe . Considering the circumstances under which they were written , his poems are far from wanting merit , and are equal to the similar productions of the most celebrated geniuses of Europe . They are quite as good , for instance , as the poems of Frederic the Great , most of which were also written in the camp , and some of them on the eve of the most critical and dangerous battles . The works of both belong to the class of amateur productions , which , as such , can never reach the highest degree of excellence ; for this can only be attained , in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion of a whole mind , for a whole life . Dr Dwight , in like manner , who possessed a naturally powerful and highly poetical intellect , with a fund of activity and industry , which would have carried him to the first rank in any profession , as it did in that which he pursued , after offering his youthful vows at the shrine of the Muses in Greenfield Hill ' and the Conquest of Canaan , ' gave up his riper years to the serious labors of his sacred calling , and of public instruction ; in which he shone beyond comparison the brightest name of his day ; while he published writings analo // gous to these occupations , that are justly esteemed as among the most valuable of their class . Active life , in short , absorbed the whole talent of the country . It is of little importance to the general truth of these remarks , whether there be or be not one or two names , in the course of the two centuries to which our history extends , that can fairly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who bore them were isolated beings , who belonged to another world and a future age . They formed no school , they left no intellectual progeny to perpetuate their fame ; the public taste was not prepared to feel and appreciate their merit , and they lived and died almost unknown to their contemporaries . If the Muses did in fact carve the name of Philenia upon every laurel in the grove of fame , as one of her admirers assures us , this same grove was at that tune so little frequented as a public walk , that the circumstance passed almost without notice . Dr Franklin is entitled to the praise of a first-rate writer ; but he has no pretensions to the poetical garland , which he voluntarily relinquished , like the other persons we have mentioned , for the purpose of devoting himself to the public service and the cultivation of science . Charles Brockden Brown has perhaps the best claim to r*tnk as an exception from the general rule , and to assert the character of a really powerful and original writer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon the public attention , and have rather risen than declined in reputation since his death . And his case singularly exemplifies the observations made above , in regard to the few persons who might be viewed as exceptions to our remarks . He lived , as it were , unknown to the public . His works were widely circulated and read ; but , as we are told , generally received as of foreign origin . Finally when he had at last fought his way into some degree of notoriety at home , and begun of course to partake the feelings of the world around him , he seems like the rest to have been swept away from his original bias towards letters and poetry , into the large stream of active life . The last of his productions was a political journal entitled The American Register , ' and had his days been prolonged , he probably would have devoted the rest of them to the party controversies of the time . Dennie , another natural poet , published , under the name of a literary journal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our townsman Paine , singularly gifted // as he was with all the elements necessary to the constitution of a real poet , generally devoted the few intervals , which he could spare from his pleasures for labor of any kind , to the establishment of a new newspaper . Such , up to the close of the last century , was the all-absorbing influence of the attractions of active life upon the whole mass of mind existing among us . The period when the three last writers lived , approached , however , so nearly to the present , that had any one of them possessed the vigorous moral constitution , which is indispensable to the full activity and effect of literary talent under any circumstances , and especially when a new course is to be struck out , he would probably have seized the palm that was reserved for another brow , and marked the opening of our Western school of polite literature . But these three gifted spirits , all of celestial mould , were like the falcon in Shakspeare , hawked at and killed , while towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensual indulgence , and thus failed of accomplishing their high vocation . *Their immature and unfinished productions , though glowing at times with life and energy , can only be viewed as the first faint streaks of light , that preceded and announced the approach of day . Finally however , in the rapid progress of our population , wealth , and literary advantages , the period arrived , when the calls of business no longer absorbed all the cultivated intellect existing in the country ; when , after these were fully satisfied , there remained a portion of taste , zeal , and talent to be employed in purely literary and scientific pursuits ; when the public mind was prepared to acknowledge and appreciate any really superior merit , that might present itself , in those departments ; when in fact the nation , having been somewhat galled by the continual sneers of a set of heartless and senseless foreigners upon our want of literary talent , was rather anxious to possess some positive facts , which could be offered as evidence to the contrary , and was prepared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , - with a kind of patriotic enthusiasm ; when finally , for all these reasons , the first example of success , that should he given in this way , would naturally be followed by an extensive developement of the same sort of activity , throughout the country , in the persons of a host of literary aspirants , sometimes directly imitating their prototype , and always inspired and encouraged by his good fortune , who would make up together the front rank of what is com-. // inonly called a school of polite literature . To set this example was the brilliant part reserved , in the course of our literary history , for Mr Washington Irving . His universal popularity among readers of all classes , on both sides of the Atlantic , resting exclusively on the purely literary merit of his productions , *wholly independent of extraneous or interested motives , attested by repeated successes , in various forms of composition , and stamped by the concurrence and approbation of the most acute , judicious , and unsparing critics , justifies , beyond a shadow of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was called , in the order of destiny , to break the spell , which appeared , at least to our good natured European brethren , to be thrown over us in this respect ; to achieve the great and hitherto unaccomplished adventure of establishing a purely American literary reputation of the first order ; and demonstrate the capacity of his countrymen to excel in the elegant , as they had before done in all the useful and solid branches of learning . To have done this is a singular title of honor , and will always remain such , whatever laurels of a different kind may hereafter be won by other pretenders . Thoroughly labored and highly finished as they all are , Mr Irving 's works will hardly be surpassed in their way . Other writers may no doubt arise , in the course of time , who will exhibit in verse or prose a more commanding talent , and soar a still loftier flight in the empyrean sky of glory . Some western Homer , Shakspeare , Milton , Corneille , or Calderon , may irradiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shall throw all other greatness into the shade . This or something like it may or may not happen ; but even if it should , it can never be disputed that the mild and beautiful genius of Mr Irving was the Morning-Star , that led up the march of our heavenly host ; and that he ego in patriam . To have done this , we repeat , is a singular triumph , far higher than that of merely adding another name to a long list of illustrious predecessors , who flourished in the same country . it implies not merely taste and talent , but originality , the quality which forms the real distinction , if there be one , between what we call genius and every other degree of intellectual power ; the quality , in comparison with which , as Sir Walter Scott justly observes , all other literary accomplishments are as dust in the balance . It implies moreover the possession of high and honorable moral // qualities ; the bold and daring resolution , that plans with vigor and decision ; the unyielding firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of execution . These qualities , which are obviously necessary to such success as that of Mr Irving , have also , as exemplified in his writings , been carefully kept within bounds , and have not only been prevented from running into their kindred excesses , but , on the contrary , have been judiciously and gracefully veiled from the public eye , by the outward forms that rather belong to a character of an op .. posite cast ; a modesty , that has never deserted him under all his popularity , and a scrupulous regard for decorum and pro* priety as well as the higher principles of morals , from which the dazzling success , that has unfortunately attended a different line of conduct in some contemporary writers , has never for a moment induced him to deviate* This combination of estimable and in some respects almost contradictory moral qualities , with a high intellectual power and fine taste , tends to render the influence of Mr Irving 's example not less favorable to the country , in a moral point of view , than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has produced , in this latter respect , is sufficiently evident already , in the number of good writers , in various forms of elegant literature , who have sprung up among us within the few years which have elapsed since the appearance of Mr Irving , and who justify our preceding remark , that he may fairly he considered as the founder of a school . We have already a novelist of extraordinary power and facility , decidedly original , although in form an imitator ; and second only in popularity , among contemporary writers of his class , to his celebrated model . We have a second novelist of gentler mien , as beseems her sex , whose rapid and constantly progres sive improvement seems to indicate , that she is destined one day to approach , if not to equal or surpass , the merit of her amiable sister of the Emerald Isle . We have several youthful poets , who have already earned , by the best and purest arts , an early reputation , which the labors of their riper age will no doubt extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long list of other aspirants of various , in some instances perhaps , not inferior degrees of excellence ; and when we take into view , at the same time , the remarkable developement of literary taste , the increased demand for books and journals , the improvements in the modes and means of education , and the augmented attention which is given , in every // way , to science and letters , we have a full right to assume that a decided change has taken place , in this respect , in the state of the country within the last fifteen or twenty years . We mean not of course to say , that this change is entirely owing to the example and success of Mr Irving . We have on the contrary already explained , in sufficient detail , that his appearance was in itself one of the results of the same general causes , that produced the other effects to which we have alluded . We only intend to intimate , that he has the peculiar merit and fortune of having taken the lead , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he could not hut he followed and sustained by numerous successors , who would of necessity he more or less affected by the form and character of his productions . The fact that several of the more distinguished writers , who have since appeared , are from his own state ,  --  while it is partly accounted for by the vast extent , population , wealth , and generally thriving situation of that empire in embryo , ' New York ; circumstances which all tend very strongly to stimulate every form of intellectual activity ,  --  must nevertheless he regarded in part , as a proof of the direct operation of the success of Mr Irving . Having thus noticed the circumstances , that attended the appearance of this writer in the literary career , we shall now offer a few observations on the character and value of his works . We trust that , in treating this subject somewhat fully , we shall not be considered , by our readers , as giving it a disproportionate importance . Independently of the fact , that discussions of a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for readers of various descriptions , and are perhaps ( as far as respects the topic ) not less acceptable to many than the essays on the graver themes that generally occupy our pages , we may add that their real importance is not to be measured by the extent of their influence on passing events . Science and letters touch the secret springs , that regulate the whole complicated movement of the political machine ; while the business of administr'ation , with all its bustle and parade , and in all its different departments of war-making , peace-making , speech-making , tax laying and gathering , office seeking and holding , and so forth , can only terminate at best in winding up the said machine , and keeping it in action . Hence it is , that in civilized periods , the literature of one age determines in a great degree the history of the next . Voltaire , said his // friend Condorcet at the hottest epoch of the French revolution , n'a pas vu tout ce qu'il afait , mais ii a fttit tout ce que nous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one generation on the form and spirit of society in the next , depends very much on the manner , in which they are received as merely literary productions by contemporaries . Literary and critical discussions are not therefore , as some suppose , merely valuable as the elegant recreations of opulent leisure , but are essentially connected with interests of deep and lasting importance . if we examine the works of Mr Irving , with reference to the usual division of manner and substance , we may remark , in the first place , that his style is undoubtedly one of the most finished and agreeable forms , in which the English language has ever been presented . Lord Byron has somewhere spoken of him , as the second prose writer of the day , considering Sir Walter Scott as the first ; but with due deference to his lordship 's judgment , which was far from being infallible in*criticism or anything else , we can not but consider Mr Irving , as respects mere style , decidedly superior to Sir Walter . The latter , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , with his talent for v6i*sification , entitle him to a higher rank in the world of letters ; but viewing him merely as a prose writer , his style , when not sustained by the interest of a connected narrative , will be found to possess no particular merit , and in some of his later writings is negligent and incorrect to an extent , that places it below mediocrity . That of Mr Irving , on the contrary , is , in all his works , uniformly of the first order . Its peculiar characteristic is a continual and sustained elegance , the result of the union of a naturally fine taste , with conscientious and unwearied industry . His language is not remarkable for energy , nor have we often noticed in it any extraordinary happiness or brilliancy of mere expression . Though generally pure and correct , it is not uniformly so ; and , there are one or two unauthorized forms , which will be found by a nice obser*re r to recur pretty often . Its attraction lies , as we have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses . The most harmonious and poetical words are carefully selected . Every period is measured and harmonized with nice precision . The length of the sentences is judiciously varied ; and the tout ensemble produces on the ear an effect very little , if at all , inferior to that of the finest versification . Indeed such prose , // while it is from the nature of the topics substantially poetry , does not appear to us , when viewed merely as a form of language , to differ essentially from verse . The distinction between verse and prose evidently %loes not lie in rhyme , taking the word in its modern sense , or in any particular species of rhythm , as it was understood by the ancients . Rhyme , however pleasing to accustomed ears ( and we own the soft impeachment ' of relishing it as much as others ) , is , we fear , but too cividently a remnant of the false taste of a bar-. barous age ; and of rhythm there are a thousand varieties in the poetry of every cultivated language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious arrangements of words . If then we mean by rhythm or verse merely the form of poetry , and not any particular measure or set o* measures to which we are accustomed , it seems to imply nothing but such a disposition of words and sentences , as shall strike the ear with a regular melodious flow ; and elegant prose , like that of Mr Irving , for instance , comes clearly within the definition . Nor are we quite sure that this delicate species of rhythm ought to be regarded as inferior in beauty to the more artificial *ones . The latter , which are obvious and , as it were , coarse methods of arrangement , are perhaps natural to the ruder periods of language , and are absolutely necessary in poems intended for music ; but for every other purpose it would seem , that the most perfect melody is that , which is most completely unfettered , and in which the traces of art are best concealed . There is something more exquisitely sweet in the natural strains of the Eolian harp , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gentle breeze , on a fine moonlight evening , than in the measured flow of any artificial music . But we must leave these considerations , which would admit of some developement , and return to our author . If the elegant prose of Mr Irving be , as we think it is , but little inferior in beauty to the finest verse , and at all events one of the most finished forms of the English language , the character and the substance of his writings is also entirely and exclusively poetical . It is evident enough that divine Philosophy ' has no part nor lot in his affections . Shakspeare , though he was willing to hang up philosophy , ' out of compliment to the charming Juliet , when he chose to take it down again , could put the Seven Sages of Greece to the blush . But such is not the taste of 1*1r Irving . His aim is always to please ; and nev // er to instruct , at least by general truths . If he ever teaches , he confines himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the partiality of a true lover , who can see no beauty except in the eyes of his own mistress , he at times deals rather rudely with philosophy , and more than insinuates that she is a sort of prosing mad-cap , who babbles eternally without ever knowing what she is talking of . Now we hold this doctrine to be clearly heretical . We conceive that the universe is not less worthy of being studied as an expression of the pure and glorious ideas or images that dwell eternally in the Supreme mind , than when viewed merely as a pleasing and varied panorama , or moving picture ; and that it even acquires , in the former case , a sublimity and beauty , of which it is not susceptible in the latter , and which , in all ages , have exalted and ravished the souls of the best and greatest men , the Platos and Ciceros of the olden time , and the Miltons and Newtons of the mod. em . But though we think Mr Irving heretical on this head , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , being always pleased to see a man put his heart and soul into his business , whatever it may be , even though he may , by so doing , ( as often happens ) generate in himself a sort of hatred and contempt for every other . Within the domain of poetry , taking this word in its large sense , to which he religiously confines himself , Mr Irving 's range is somewhat extensive . He does not attempt the sublime , but he is often successful in the tender , and disports himself , at his ease , in the comic . Humor is obviously his forte , and his best touches of pathos are those , which are thrown in casually , to break the continuity of a train of melan. * choly thoughts* when they sparkle in part by the effect of contrast , like diamonds on a black mantle . But it is when employed on humorous subjects , that he puts forth the vigor iM ' a teally inventive genius , and proves himself substantially a poet . Knickerbocker , ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays , though occasionally pleasing , are mOre generally somewhat tame and spiritless . As a writer of serious biography and history he possesses the merit of plain and ele .. gant narrative , but does not aspire to the higher pftlrn of just and deep thought in the investigation of causes *. nd effects* that constitutes the distinction of the real historian , and suppos .. es the taste for philosophical teseaith , Whic* , *s we have said before , is foreign to the temper of our author . Such , as we conceive , are the general characteristics of the // style and substance of the works of Mr Irving . We notice their deficiencies and beauties with equal freedom , for such is our duty as public critics , and we have too much respect for our friend to suppose , that his appetite for fame requires to be gratified by unqualified praise . This can never , in any case , be merited , and is therefore always worthless ; while the favorable effect of just and candid criticism is heightened , by a discriminating notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in all productions . We shall now proceed to offer a few more particular observations upon the separate works , dividing them , for this purpose , into the two classes of those that were written before and after the author 's departure for Eu. rope . Although the general characteristics , which we have pointed out , . are common to both these classes , there are some differences of manner between them , that are worth attention . The ' Life of Columbus , ' again , varies materially from any of the preceding publications , and will naturally be . considered by itself , as the immediate subject of this article . The former class comprehends Salmagundi and the History of New York , besides some smaller and less important productions . These exhibit the talent of the author , in the full perfection of its power , developing itself with a freshness and freedom , that have not perhaps been surpassed , or even equalled , in any of his subsequein writings , but directed , on the other hand , by a somewhat less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inequality in Salmagundi , ' owing probably in part to a mixture of contributions by other hands ; but the better pieces are written in Mr Irving 's best manner . Take it altogether , it was certainly a production of extraordinary merit , and was instantaneously and universally recognised as such by the public . It wants of course the graver merits of the mod. em British collections of Essays ; but for spirit , effect , and actual literary ' value , we doubt whether any publication of the class since The Spectator , ' upon which it is directly modelled , can fairly be put in competition with it . We well remember the eagerness , , with which the periodical return of the merry little yellow dwarf was anticipated by all classes of readers , and the hearty good will , with which he was welcomed . Sport that wrinkled care derides , And Laughter holding both his sides , ' uniformly followed in his train . So irresistibly attractive and amusing were the quips and cranks of the odd group of mummers // that moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somewhat disputatious citizens were taken , like Silence in the play , ere they were aware ; and when the show was over , were surprised , and in some cases rather chagrined , to find that they had been diverted from their habitual meditations on the Orders in Council and the New England Platform , by the unprofitable fooleries of the Cockloft family and the Little Man in Black , the state of the Tunisian Ambassador 's wardrobe , and the tragical fate of poor Aunt Charity , who died of a Frenchman . Mr Irving appears to have had no other object in view , but that of making a sprightly book and laughing at everything laughable ; but the work necessarily assumed , to a certain extent , the shape of a satire on the abuses of popular government ; since the administration of the public affairs is the great scene of action , upon which the attention of the community is always fixe , d , and . which must be treated , in jest or earnest , by all who mean to have an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our practical statesmen , their endless prolixity in debate , their rage for the bloodless glory of heading the militia in a sham fight , their habitual waste of dollars in attempting to economize cents , are hit off in a very happy manner ; but as the satire is always general , and the malice at bottom good-natured and harmless , nobody took offence and we all laughed honestly and heartily ; each , as he supposed , at the expei*se of his neighbor . Nor are we to conclude that because Mr Irving has made the abuses of popular government , and the weaknesses incident to those who administer such a system , the objects of his satire , that he is a political heretic and a secret foe to liberty . The best human institutions are of course imperfect , and there is quite as much advantage to be derived from a just and good-humored exposition of the weak points of our own government , as from a continued fulsome and exaggerated panegyric on its merits . Mr Irving , we may add , was probably directed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantry , by the mere force of the circumstances under which he wrote , and not by any general views of the theory of government . The decided success and universal popularity of his first attempt naturally encouraged him to repeat it , and Salmagundi ' was pretty soon followed by the History of JV'ew York . This we consider as equal to the best , and in some respects perhaps superior to any other of our author 's 1 ) roductions . It is the // one , which exhibits most distinctly the stamp of real inventive power , the true test , as we have hinted , of genius . The plan , though simple enough , and when hit upon sufficiently obvious is entirely original . In most other works of the same general class of political satire , such as those of Rabelais and Swift , the object of the work is effected by presenting real events and characters of dignity and importance in low and ludicrous shapes . Knickerbocker reverses this plan , and produces effect by dressing up a mean and trifling fund of real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conception is akin , no doubt , to the general notion of the mock heroic , as exemplified , for instance , in Pope 's Rape of the Lock , ' but the particular form , in which it is applied by the learned and ingenious Diedrich , is not only unusually happy , but wholly new ; and the work possesses of course a character of complete originality , which does not belong to any of the others . The Stout Gentleman is a second application of the same principle , still more exquisitely wrought up and only inferior in the com* parative smallness of the canvass . The execution of Knick. * erbocker ' corresponds in felicity with the merit of the plan . The graphic distinctness , with which the three Dutch governors , whom nobody ever heard of before , are made to pass before us , each endowed with his appropriate intellectual , moral , and personal habits and qualities , is quite admirable ; and the political satire is conveyed with great effect , and at the same time in a very fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters of the old world . There are some ineffectual attempts at wit in particular passages , and here and there a little indelicacy , which is the more objectionable , as it is inconsistent with the plan of the mock heroic , and in place , if admitted at all , only in the travestie . There is also a some* what uncouth display of commonplace historical learning in the first book , where the author , while in the act of ridiculing pedantry , as he supposes it to be exemplified in the person of the worthy ' Diedrich , ' betrays , we fear , a slight shade of the same quality in himself . But notwithstanding these blemishes , which are indeed so trifling , that we are almost ashamed to have mentioned them , the execution of the History of New York ' is in the main completely successful . If we were called on to give a preference to any one of our author 's productions over all the rest , we should with little hesitation assign the palm to this . // These , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter , are all the works , which were published by Mr Irving before his departure for Europe , and which belong to what may be called his first manner . Soon after their appearance , he visited England , where , and in other parts of Europe , he has resided ever since ; and we heard nothing of him for several years , until at length he brought out the Sketch Book , which first made him known to the literary world abroad . In the long interval which had elapsed , since the appearance of his former productions , a change had come over the spirit of his dream . ' Advancing years had probably a little moderated the exuberant flow of his youthful spirits , and the natural effect of time had , we fear , been increased by other causes ; if it be true , as we have reason to suppose , that our amiable countryman had in the interim taken some lessons in the school of that rugged nurse of virtue , ' so beautifully celebrated by Gray , who has in all ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tuition to the votaries of polite learning . Whether under the influence of these causes , aided perhaps by the wholesome terror , which an American candidate for European favor might be expected to feel of the iron rod of the ruling critics , or for whatever other reason , certain it is , that the genius of Mr Irving appeared to be a little rebuked at this his second apparition , and spoke in a partially subdued tone . The characteristics of the Sketch Book ' are essentially the same with those of the preceding works ; hut , with somewhat more polish and elegance , it has somewhat less vivacity , freshness , and power . This difference constitutes the distinction between Mr Irving 's first and second manner , the latter of which is preserved in all his subsequent publications , excepting the one now immediately before us . Of these two manners the one or the other may perhaps be preferred by different readers* according to their different tastes . We incline ourselves to the former , conceiving that spirit and vigor are the highest qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this description is but poorly compensated by a little additional finish . The change would have been however of less importance , had it appeared only in the language , but it is also displayed in the substance of the second series of publications ; and it is here particularly , that we discover what we deem the unpropitious influence of a residence abroad on our author 's talent . Not only is his language less free and sparkling , but the r*ach of his // inventive power seems to be reduced . The Crayons and Bracebridges , including Master Simon , are Sketches indeed , and in water colors , compared with the living roaring group of Cockloft kill ; and although we find 6cdasional returns of the author 's best manner in ' The Stout Geitleman , ' Rip Van Winkle , ' ' Sleepy Hollow , ' The Money-diggers , ' and so forth , the rich material employed in these pieces is not , as before , the staple of the work , but a passing refreshment , that serves excellently well to remind us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity rather awakens than satisfies the appetite . As it is difficult or rather impossible to suppose any actual diminution of power in the author , we must take for granted , that the difference in question is owing to the change in the general character of his subject . Humor and satire are , as we said before , evidently his forte and these compose the substance of the preceding works . There is but little attempt at the pathos in ' Salmagundi , ' and none in ' Knickerbocker . ' The subjects of satire are principally the abuses of government and the follies of leading characters and classes ; and hence these works , though light in form , have an elevated object , which gives them dignity and solid value . Lookin*g at them in a literary point of view , the circumstance of writing upon subjects actually before his eyes gives his pictures the truth to nature , which is the chief element of all excellence in art . Had the author proceeded on the same plan in his latter publications , he would have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follies of leading classes and characters , as exemplified in the old countries . This again would have opened a field for the exercise of his peculiar talent , still more rich and various than the former one . Into this , however , whether from a terror of criticism , a wish to conciliate all parties alike , a natural modesty , a want of acquaintance with foreign manners and institutions , or for whatever reason , he did not choose to enter . Indeed the task of satirizing the manners and institutions of a country , in which one is at the time residing as a guest , is so ungracious , that we can neither wonder nor regret , that Mr Irving should have shrunk from it with instinctive disgust . It is nevertheless certain , that the subjects alluded to are the bess , indeea almost the only good ones , for lively and pungent satire ; * and that in voluntarily resigning them , our author was compelled to deprive himself almost wholly of the use of his favorite and most efficient instrument . He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no little skill and success , upon subjects afforded by the fund of vice and folly common to all nations , as in the story of the Lambs and the Trotters , but we think with less effect , than when following his original instinct , and laughing con amore at the peculiar foibles of his own dear countrymen . Conscious probably that the field for satire , which he felt himself at liberty to explore , was less rich and productive than he could have wished , he calls in the aid of the pathetic and sen .. timental ; in which departments , though , as we have said before , occasionally successful , he is seldom eminently so ,  --  . seldom exhibits the bright , sharp , true expression of nature , which we see in his best comic pictures . In other portions of ftiese works , such as the whole description of Bracebridge Hall , as it appears in the ' Sketch Book , ' and the work of that name , the tone wavers between the sentimental and the comic , and we hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners he describes ; which , however , are in either case evi. * dently manners of his own creation , having no prototype in this or any other period of English history . Bracebridge Hall with its Christmas sports and its Rookery , its antiquarian Squire , and its Master Simon , is as much a castle of fairy land , as the one in which the Fata Morgana held entranced for six hundred years the redoubtable champion of Denmark . The British country squire is now , as he ever was , and probably ever will be , either a fox-hunter or a politician . Western and Allworthy are the only two varieties of the species ; and the squire of Mr Irving , with his indifference to politics , and his taste for black-letter lore , is as completely a fancy-piece , as the Centaurs and Harpies of the ancient poets . These castles in Spain occupy a considerable portion of the second series of works ; and we really can not but wonder how Mr Irving , generally so just and acute an observer of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural life in England , or why , if he saw it as it is , he should have given us an unreal mockery of it instead of a correct picture . It is refreshing and delightful to find how , un*ler all the disadvantages of writing on domestic subjects in a foreign land , he recovers his wonted power , and disports himself with his pristine grace and sprightliness , the moment that he lays the scene of his fable at home . No sooner does he catch a glimpse of the venerable Kaatskill , lifting his shaggy head over his white ruff of ambient clouds , and frowning on the glorious Hudson as it rolls // below ; no sooner do the antique gable-roofed domes of the Manhattoes , and Albany , and the classic shades of Communipaw rise upon his fancy , than his foot is on his native heath and his name is M'Gregor . ' When we think of this , although we rejoice that Mr Irving has been able , as he might not otherwise have been , to levy a large and liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being , as it were , a spoiling of the Egyptians , we sometimes regret , for hi* own fame , that he ever left America . There was a fund of truth , as well as ill nature , in the remark of one of the paltry* scandal-mon g ering novelists of the day , that Mr Irving would have done 1*tter to stay at home , and pass his life among the beavers . We have stated above , that the sentiment , which probably induced Mr Irving to refrain from exercising his satirical talent upon the institutions and public characters of Great Britain , was a natural and highly laudable one ; but we can not conscientiously speak with the same approbation of his apparent disposition to represent the British aristocracy under a favorable point of view , as compared with the other classes of the people . If this representation were true , we should not object to it , although the sort of complacency , with which it is put forward , would still , in a foreigner and a republican , he somewhat ungraceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obviously and notoriously the reverse of the truth . Let us take as an example the account given in the Sketch Book ' of the author 's attendance on public worship at a village church , where he met with the family of a nobleman and that of a wealthy merchant . The former , especially the young men and women , were all attention , candor , simplicity , and true moral dignity ; the latter all bad taste , affectation , and vulgarity . Now every one , who has seen anything of Europe , knows perfectly well , and Mr Irving certainly by this time , whatever he may have done when he wrote the ' Sketch Book , ' better than any body , that- if there be a class of persons in that part of the world , who as a class may be said to be more *leflcient than any other in simplicity , candor , and a correct notion of true moral dignity , it is precisely this very British aristocracy , especially in its younger branches , to which our author attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred from that portion of the popular literature of the day in England , which illustrates the manners and morals of fashionable life , did we assert , that , // if there be , in the known world , an animal , who by the general consent of all who are acquainted with his habits , realizes the idea of complete puppyism and is in the strict sense of the term insupportable , it is the young Englishman of rank and fortune . His candor , simplicity , and notion of moral dignity are exhibited in a drawling , affected pronunciation ; a foppish dress ; manners at once awkward and impertinent ; the habitual use of the grossest and most profane language ; an ignorant and contemptuous disregard for religion and morality , for the noble pursuits of philosophy , literature , science , and the elegant arts , even for politics , the regular occupation of his order ; and an exclusive devotion to coarse and rude sports , gaming , and licentious indulgence of the lowest and foulest kind , for he has not even elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are honorable exceptions to this remark . Such was the late amiable and excellent Earl of Guildford , the founder of the University of Corfu . Such were the four young gentlemen , members of parliament , who lately honored this country with their presence . Such have been and are several others of those , who have visited this country on official errands , being naturally gentlemen selected for their talent , industry , and capacity for business . But such as we have stated , is the character of the class . It was lately held up , in bold relief , to the horror and disgust of the world , by Lord Byron , who combined a genius of his own with some of the moral qualities of his order . Such is the generation which Mr Irving represents as models of simplicity , candor , and moral dignity . On the other hand , the wealthy merchants of England and other parts of Europe , with their families , afford perhaps on the whole the most favorable specimen that could be selected from the educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author compliments the aristocracy at their expense . They are distinguished by intelligence , information , activity , application to business , and as a natural consequence , correct and decorous habits ; and if not a deep sense of the importance of religion and morality , an external regard at least for their practical injunctions . These valuable qualities are often united with alove for polite literature and the fine arts , as in the case of Mr Roscoe , or a successful cultivation of the more solid branches of science , as in the honorable example of the late Mr Ricardo . The vulgar , purse-proud , ignorant merchant of Mr Irving , is an exception or a fancy-piece , probably in him a reminis // cence of the false tone , on this subject , that pervaded the polite literature of England a century or two ago ; and his candid young nobleman is merely a little Sir Charles Grandison in a blue frock and white pantaloons , at whose formal manners , and patriarchal ignorance of the world , the real dandy of the present day would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt , itnd a perfect conviction of own superiority . While we have felt it a duty to point out this error in the tone and spirit of Mr Irving 's later works , we must add , that we do not , as some have done , attribute it to any hankering in him after the aristocratic institutions and habits of Europe . We acquit him entirely , as we have said before , of political heresy ; and without supposing him to be deeply versed in the theory of government , we have no doubt that he is strongly and sincerely attached to the republican institutions and forms established in his country . Neither do we believe , that he was influenced in making this representation , by an interested wish to conciliate the British aristocracy , for the purpose of obtaining their patronage as a writer , or admission into their circles as a gentleman . We have too high an opinion of Mr Irving 's independence , delicacy , and elevation of mind , to suspect him for a moment of such baseness . We think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we now allude , under the influence of an illusion , resulting naturally from his former situation and literary habits . Without having studied the subject of government very deeply in the abstract , or possessing probably any very precise general notions respecting it , he was led by the original bent of his mind and his local and social position , to employ himself , for several years , in ridiculing the abuses of popular institutions , and the peculiar follies and weaknesses of republican statesmen . Thus far he kept himself within the line of truth and nature ; for popular governments , however valuable , certainly have their defects , and republican statesmen , like all other mortals , their besetting sins and characteristic foibles . Now , although it does by no means follow from this , that monarchy is a perfect system , or an established aristocracy ex officio a corps of Lord Orvilles and Sir Charles Grandisons , it was perhaps not unnatural , that Mr Irving , habitually gathering his impressions more from impi*lse and feeling than argument , should , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be led to take up a too flattering idea // of the other . Some such mental operation as this appears to have been the source of the illusion under which , as we conceive , he was at one time laboring ; and when he wrote the Sketch Book , ' where the error in question is most apparent , he probably had not had much opportunity to bring his ideal picture to the test of comparison with real life , for it was not , we believe , until he had acquired a high reputation in England , by the publication of this work , that - h* frequented very intimately the circles of the British aristocracy . We have reason to suppose that he has since reformed his thc*ry on this subject , and we mention the fact with pleasure , as a proof that the opportunities he has had for actual observation , have not been lost upon his naturally acute and sagacious , as well as sensitive mind . Having thus cleared our consciences ( we trust without doing injustice to our author ) by pointing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to his American one , we return with pleasure to the remark we made before , that the former has somewhat more of elegance and polish than the latter ; that the characteristics of both are ( with the deductions we have specified ) substantially the same ; that all his productions are among the most agreeable and attractive , as they certainly have been among the most popular of the time ; that they do the highest honor to himself and through him to his country ; and that he has already secured and will permanently maintain , in our literary annals , the brilliant position of the harbinger and founder of the American school of polite learning . We come now to the History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus , ' which has furnished the immediate subject and occnsion of the present article . This work differs essentially in manner , as we have already said , from any of the preceding . It exemplifies on a larger scale , and in a more complete and finished way , the plan of the short biographical sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , principally of contemporary officers of the navy . We shall first endeavor to ascertain the class of historical writing to which it belongs , and then make a few remarks upon the merit of the execution and the general value of the work . The great division of this department of literature , is into the two classes of philosophical and purely narrative history . They are not , it is true , separated by a very strict line , but on // the contrary run into each other , each possessing to a certain extent the peculiar characteristics of both ; but the distinction is nevertheless real , and whenever a writer has talent enough to give his work a marked character , it is evident at once , to which of the two classes it belongs . The object of philosophical I ) istory is to set forth , by a record of real events , the general principles , which regulate the march of political affairs ; that of purely narrative history , to give a correct and lively picture of the same events , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no reference to their causes or effects . It is obvious , that these two sorts of history are not only essentially different , but that they belong respectively to two very different and in some respects opposite departments of literature . The distinction between them is the same as that between Laplace 's Exposition of the System of the Universe , ' and a description in words of the various constellations and planets that are laid down in the charts of the celestial sphere , as they appear in the blue vault of heaven to the ordinary observer . The same facts undoubtedly form the groundwork of both , but the- object , the mode of execution , the peculiar capacity and disposition respectively supposed in the authors of each , and the pleasure afforded by each , when the plan is executed with talent and success , are very different ; and that to such a degree , that the two works appertain to the adverse domains of philosophy and poetry . History , therefore , which Lord Bacon describes as a third department of learning , entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact a divided empire , situated between the others , and acknowledging , in the part bordering upon each , the jurisdiction of its more independant neighbor . Philosophical history is properly a branch of philosophy , since its purpose is to teach general truths in the form of narrative ; while purely narrative history , which merely offers a picture of the outside of passing or past events , is , when properly written , substantially poetry . To inquire which of these two sorts of history has the superior rank , would be in one respect to compare things which admit of no comparison . Who can pretend to say whether a brilliant thought is more beautiful than a bright eye , or whether Newton 's Principia'is a greater work than the Iliad ? Nevertheless , as history occupies a middle region between the two great adverse realms of learning , and partakes , in some degree , of the characters of both , we may , in this instance , institute such a comparison with less // impropriety , and the palm would perhaps be assigned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative historian for the poet , by restricting himself within the limits of real facts , loses for the time the use of his highest attribute , and that which properly gives him his name , original creation or invention , and thus voluntarily places himself on a secondary line , in the scale of his own art ; while philosophy , when teaching by example , ' without abandoning any of her peculiar advantages , borrows , for the occasion , the airs and graces of her more attractive sister , since the facts which she relates , with whatever purpose of instruction , may and must be told with elegance and spirit . In other words , a first-rate philosophical history can only be Written by a person , who combines most of the essential talents and accomplishments of the philosopher and the poet ; while a purely narrative history of corresponding merit in its way , might be produced by a poet of a secondary order who had no tincture of philosophy . The former , taken in the abstract , must therefore he considered , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Irving 's present work , if technically classed according to the general principles just stated , belongs to the lower speciea of history , and is so described by himself in his preface . in the execution of this work , ' he remarks , I have avoided indulging in mere speculations or general reflections , excepting such as naturally arose out of the subject , preferring to give a Iflinute and circumstantial narrative , omitting no particular that appeared characteristic of the persons , the events , or the times ; and endeavoring to place every fact under such a point of view , that the reader might perceive its merits , and draw his own maxims and conclusions . ' The omission of all general speculation is indeed a good deal more complete than this preliminary declaration would have necessarily led us to suppose it , since the exception of such reflections as naturally arise out of the subjects would admit almost any degree of latitude in this respect . In point of fact , there is no political speculation whatever , the very few reflections that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving this color to his work , Mr Irving doubtless followed instinctively the natural bent of his genius , which does not incline him , as we have repeatedly observed , to philosophical researches ; but he has thereby produced a much more valua // ble literary monument , than with his peculiar taste and talent , he could have done in a different way . In estimating the positive worth of particular works , we must take into view the merit of the execution , as well as the dignity of the class to which they belong ; and if the latter be , in the present instance , of a secondary order ( though still secondary only as compared with the very highest and most glorious exercises of intellect ) , yet such have been the good taste and felicity of our author , in the selection of his subject ; such his diligence , research , and perseverance in collecting and employing his materials ; and such his care in giving the highest finish and perfection to the style ; that he has been able to bring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories of any age or nation , which will take a permanent place in the classical literature of the language , which is , in fact , one of the most agreeable , instruc tive , and really valuable productions to be met with any where , and one that , as We remarked above , does , on the whole , more honor to the learning of our country , than any previous work written on this side of the Atlantic . For the particular kind of historical writing , in which Mr Irving is fitted to labor and to excel , the Life of Columbus ' is undoubtedly one of the best , perhaps we might say without the fear of mistake , the very best subject afforded by the annals of the world . While his discoveries possess the importtince belonging to political events of the first magnitude , the gene .. rous elevation of his mind , the various fortunes that chequered his course , and the singularity , the uniquity rather , if we may he allowed to coin a word , of his achievements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures , and render him of all others the fittest hero for a work of this de .. scription , which , as we have shown above , is essentially a po .. em . The only objection , that could possibly be made to the choice of the subject , would be , that it was before exhausted ; and this has in fact been said , by some of the newspaper critics of the mother country . The assertion is however quite groundless . Before the publication of the work before us , there was no satisfactory account of Columbus in any language . The one given by his son is , as is well known , merely a brief and imperfect sketch ; and the portion of Robertson 's Amen .. ca ' which is devoted to him , though as large as it could be with propriety , considering the author 's plan , did not allow a detailed and accurate investigation of the events of his life . Into this // and other general histories , Columbus enters partially as one of the leading personages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ; but the singular splendor and prodigious permanent importance of his actions , as well as the moral grandeur and sublimity of his character , entitled him fully to the honor of a separate and detailed biography . flow much finer and loftier a subject is he , than his contemporary Charles the Fifth , who has yet furnished a theme for one of the best histories in the language ! The materials , printed and manuscript , were am. ple , but not accessible in their full extent , excepting to a person resident , for the time , in the capital of Spain . We consider it therefore as a singularly fortunate circumstance , that Mr Irving shoMd have been led , in the course of his pilgrimage abroad , to visit this , on some accounts , unattractive part of Europe . Thus favorably situated , and possessed of all the talent and in** industry necessary for the purpose , he has at length filled up the void , that before existed , in this respect , in the literature of the world , and produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supersede the necessity of any future labors in the same field . While we venture to predict that the aifrenh*res of Columbus will hereafter he read only in the work of Mr Irving , we can not but think it a beautiful coincidence , that the task of duly celebrating the achievements of the discoverer of our continent , should have been reserved for one of its inhabitants ; and that the earliest professed author of first-rate talent , who appeared among us , should have devoted one of his most important and finished works to this pious purpose . Such honors Ilion to her hero paid , And peaceful slept the mighty Hector 's shade . ' In treating this happy and splendid sttbj*ct , Mr Irving ha* brought out the full force of his genius as far as a just rcgard for the principles of historical writing would admit . This kind of history , although it belongs essentially to the department of poetry , does not of course afford any room for the display of the creative power in the invention of facts or characters ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpass in brilliancy any possible creation of mere fancy , and in the other requisites of fine poetry , a judicious selection and disposition of the materials , a correct , striking , and discriminating picture of the different personages , a just and elevated tone of moral feeling , and above all , the charm of an elegant , perspicuous , and flowing style , Mr Irving leaves us nothing to desire , and with all , who // can look beyond mere forms and names into the substance of things , sustains his right , which he had before established , to the fame of a real poet . To say that this work is superior to any professed poem , that has yet been published , on the life of Co .. lumbus , would be giving it but poor praise ; since the subject , although attempted by bards of no slight pretensions , has not yet been treated in verse with eminent success . We would go farther than this , and express the opinion , that Mr Irving 's production may be justly ranked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A polished and civilized age may well be supposed to prefer , especially in a long composition , the delicate melody of flowing prose , setting forth a spirited and elegant picture of actual life , to the specious wonders ' of Olympus or fairy land , expressed in artificial measures , strains and subjects that seem more naturally adapted to a yet unformed , than to a mature and perfect taste . Hence a fine history and a fine novel may perhaps with propriety be viewed as the greater and lesser epic ( to use the technical terms ) of a cultivated period , when verse is better reserved for short poems accompanied by music . But however this may be , and with whatever class of compositions we may rank the work before us , its execution entirely corresponds , as we have said before , with the beauty of the subject , and leaves of course but little room for the labor of the critic . The interest of the narrative is completely sustained from the beginning to the conclusion , and is equal throughout , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . instinctively pursuing the bent of his genius , the author has everywhere brought out into full relief the most poetical features of the story . He dwells , for instance , with peculiar pleasure on the golden age of innocence and happiness , that reigned among the natives of Haiti before the arrival of the Spaniards . The careless and luxurious indulgence , in which they passed their peaceful hours beneath the odorous shade of their boundless forests , ' under the amiable sway of a beautiful Queen , who is represented as charming their leisure with her own sweet poetry , seems to realize the notion of an earthly elysium ; and if there be , as there probably is , some little exaggeration in the coloring of the picture , it must be viewed as a natural effect of the just indignation and horror , with which we contemplate the devilish malice which afterwards carried death and destruction through these bowers of simple bliss . The two leading personages are happily contrasted , // not by labored parallels , but indirectly by the mere progress of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral ; the sagacity , activity , and dauntless courage of the Adelantado ; the faithful and tender attachment with which they stood by each other , through a long life of labor , danger , and suffering ; these are moral traits , that furnish out another picture , not less beautiful and even more edifying , than that of the Indian Paradise . We are grateful to Mr Irving , for bringing particularly into view the high religious feeling , which uniformly governed the mind of Columbus , which led him to consider himself as an agent , expressly selected by Providence for the accomplishment of great and glorious objects ,  --  and how , but by a poor quibble upon words , can we refuse him that character ? - which induced him finally to look forward to the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre , as the last labor of his life , to be undertaken after the complete ac-. complishment of all his projects in the New World . If there be any error in the passages , which treat of this particular , it consists in underrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be viewed by Mr Irving as the effect of an amiable , but somewhat visionary and mistaken enthusiasm . The plan was no doubt , as entertaine* by Columbus , the result of a high religious enthusiasm , and so was that of his grand discovery ; but this feeling acted , in both cases , under the direction of an extraordinarily sound and acute judgment , and with the aid of all the learning of the age . The recovery of Palestine was a project not only dear to every Christian heart as such , but re-. commended by the strongest motives of state policy , at a time when the Ottoman Power was developing itself in the pleni-. tude of life and vigor ; already overshadowing Christian Eu-. rope , and from year to-year menacing its whole commonwealth of nations , with complete subjugation . Let it be remembered , that it was not till half a century after the death of Columbus , that the sea-fight of Lepanto broke the naval power of the Turks ; that as lately as the year 1688 , their armies invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road open to Paris , had not the siege been raised by the timely arrival of the king of Poland ; let these facts , we say , be remembered , and we shall not probably consider the scheme of the Admiral so visionary , as it might be thought upon a merely superficial view of the present state of the world . The religious enthusiasm , which has more or less inspired the Europe .. // ans in their wars against the Turks , has in fact , from the com* mencement of these wars up to the present day , coincided with the suggestions , not so much of good policy , as of strict self-defence . The Mahometans have been throughout the ag .. gressors . They subdued the whole of Christian Asia and Africa ( which they still retain in brutal oppression and debasement ) , subdued some of the fairest portions of Christian Eu* rope , such as Spain , Greece , and parts of Italy , and had pushed their arms into the very heart of France , when they received the first check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these aggressions on the Christians were entirely unprovoked . When the tide of invasion was once checked , the only skilful and scientific plan of conducting the war was , of course , to carry it back into the enotny 's territory , in which Palestine , from its central position , was the proper point of attack . Such was the principle of the long series of wars denominated Cru* sades , which occupy two or three centuries of the history of Europe ; nor , although the danger of any farther progress on the part of the Turks has for some time past disappeared , will they ever cease to be regarded as public and permanent enemies , until the present or some future generation shall have completely recovered from them the lost domains of Christendom , and planted the standard of our religion on every fortress from the Indus to the Senegal . It would give us pleasure to expatiate at greater length upon the merit of the beautiful and valuable work before us ; hut we perceive that we have reached the proper limit of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not however refrain from expressing our satisfaction , at the very favorable mannet ' with which Mr Irving 's Life of Columbus* compares with one or two works of a similar kind , that were published about the same time by the best writers of the mother country . The Life of Napoleon ' by Sir Walter Scott , and the Life of Sher .. idan ' by Moore , particularly the former , resemble it so nearly in plan and form , that , coming out , as they all did , about the same time , they exhibit in a manner a trial of skill between three of the n*ost elegant writers of the day . We feel a good deal of pride as Americans in adding , that our countryman appears to have retired from this dangerous contest with a very decided advantage , we think we might say a complete victory , over both his competitors* We mean not to deprive these illustrious transatlantic bards of any fame , to which they may be justly entitled , // by the productions in question ; nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present superior or equal to theirs . We simply state the fact as it is , considering it to be one highly honorable to our countryman and our country . We shall even , go farther , being in a patriotic vein , and while we freely admit that Mr Irving 's fame is and ought to he at present inferior to that of the two British poets abovementioned , we shall take the liberty of adding , that we are not quite sure whether it will always remain so . Moore and Scott have already done their best , and from the character of their productions for some years past , as compared with those of earlier date , it is evident that they will not hereafter excel or perhaps equal their past efforts . Mr Irving 's talent seems to us , on the contrary , to be in a state of progress ; for although his second manner be , as we think , inferior , on the whole , to his first , the difference is not , as we have already expressly stated , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of scene and subject ; and in this first specimen of a third series of puhlications , we recognise , though under a somewhat graver form , a developement of power superior to that which is displayed by any of the preceding ones , even should the History of New York ' as a bold original creation , be considered as be-. longing to a higher class of writings . We also recognise in the selection of the subject , the persevering industry with which the work has been executed , and the high tone of moral feeling that runs through the whole of it , the symptoms of a noble spirit , on which the intoxicating cup of public applause acts as a stimulant rather than an opiate . Mr irving is still in the vigor of life and health ; and when we see him advancing in his course in this way , with renovated courage and redoubled talent at an age when too many hearts begin to wax prematurely faint , we are induced to anticipate the happiest results from his future labors ; and are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may not in the end eclipse the most illustrious of his present contemporaries and rivals . We rejoice to find , from the selection of the subject of the work now before us , that though long a wanderer , his thoughts are still bent on the land of his birth . Although we wish not to hasten his return before the period when he shall himself deem it expedient , we indulge the hope that he will sooner or later fix his residence among us , and can assure him that whenever he may think proper to do so , he will be welcomed by his countrymen as a well deserving // citizen and a public benefactor . When he shall be seated again upon his native soil , among his beavers , if Mr D'Israeli pleases , when he shall again apply to those subjects of strictly native origin , in which his genius seems to take most delight , the force of his mature talent , and the lights of his long and varied experience , we think we may expect with reason a fourth series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , including even that , which he has now so honorably opened with the work before us.
