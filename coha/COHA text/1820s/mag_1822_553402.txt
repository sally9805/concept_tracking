txt ART . XV. - .1 pedestrian tour of two thousand three hundred miles in North . /Jmerica , to the Lakes , the Canadas , and the New England States . Performed in the autumn of 1821 . Embellished with views , by P. Stansbury . New York , 1822 . OUR readers may possibly recollect the account given in one of the earlier numbers of our journal , by an ingenious correspondent , of a pedestrian tour of thirteen hundred miles , of which nine hundred and more were performed in the stage coach . In Mr Estwic Evans ' tour , which however was only pedestrious , ( by which we are probably to understand merely inclining to a foot journey , ) that portion of it , which extended from New Orleans to the north , was performed in a vessel . Fairly to give his readers an understanding of what sort of a journey they were to expect , Mr Stanshury , in his highly glowing preface , informs us that it is one of the greatest privileges of the pedestrian , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or continue his journey by water carriage . ' If it is thus the peculiar privilege of a pedestrian to travel in a carriage or a steam boat , we presume it is the distinctive convenience of the stage coach , that the passengers , when it breaks down , may avail themselves of a balloon , if any happen to be passing ; and if they are travelling in regions not covered by the patent for flying , which Mr Bennet has solicited of the senate of the United States . Mr Stausbury , in the same animated introduction to his tour , informs us that having adopted this sort of pedestrian travelling , he has been enabled to make numerous excursions , and go through many interesting scenes , which he could not possibly have done by any other mode of travelling . ' We shall immediately give our readers the proof of this , and satisfy them that Mr Stansbury has so diligently employed his ped*s // trian advantages , as to see and hear various important things , which we are well convinced have escaped the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till his mode of making discoveries is universally adopted , will , we fear , continue to remain unnoticed . As our readers will of course take the greatest interest in such of the scenes as are nearest home , we shall mention a few of Mr Stansbury 's discoveries on the road from Canada to Boston . Before crossing the American boundary , he met with a sight , which we venture to say no other traveller , unless it be Mr Evans , has ever encountered besides himself . We progressed* forward , upon the road side , with as much care and almost as slow as those men , who walk slack rope or wire , when we met a drove of two hundred oxen for the market of Montreal , slowly advancing . * genrieman in rich attire , the owner of the drove , who had given his horse to one of his men , and was picking his course along the opposite side , exclaimed over to us in a very piteous tone , " Gentlemen , I am sorry for you . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we may judge from this gentleman drovier 's salutation . The next proof of pedestrian advantages is the observation made of the general appearance of the American frontier at Vermont , contrasted with the Canadian . In the latter , habitations , enclosures , the people themselves , and all their performances , low and humble ; here mansions , walls , gigantic citizens , and mighty projects , rivalling the glory of the most enlightened ages and nations ! After a pathetic description of the resounding sides of the , Camel 's Rump , ' we are condu*ted by our adventurous touristto IlVlontpelier , the capital of Vermont . Here he had the good fortune to witness an extraordinary spectacle , viz that of the shops all in commotion . ' In what way the convulsion was produced , and what were its consequences to thepersonswho might have been in the shops at the moment , we are not informed . Nor was this the only remarkable phenomenon that fell within his notice , for he found four superb hotels in Montpelier , excessively crowded ; and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we are persuaded is without a parallel in any other legislative body in America , not excepting the congress of the United States . The members , he avers to be men of large limbs , tall , genteel , and notwithstanding some little peculiari * We begin to regret having taken up the cudgels in a former number in favor of'this ungainly word . M* Stausbury here uscs progressing forward , in distinction from progressirt* backward . // ty of dialect , which must be ascribed to their secluded situation among the mountains , very well versed in the art of oratory . ' That this art , however , is not closely connected with that of prophecy , is apparent from what our author adds , that he learned from a venerable member , that the bill respecting the judicial regulations of the community was under consideration , and that he guessed it would be passed by a large majority . ' Here the member 's gentility stood him but little in stead , and the most rustic legislator could not have come wider of the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , something like it being recorded , if we remember correctly , in the judicious miscellany of Mr Joseph Miller . We refer to the well known person , who had the good fortune to be able to exhibit a horse , with his tail where his head ought to be . Mr Stanshury encountered in his pedestrian journey in Vermont , a district where droves , not only of fine fat cattle , but of horses also , are continually streaming down the hills . ' If this should prove on further enquiry to he accurate , it may safely be said of the pastures of Vermont , where the horses and oxen are streaming down hill , that the cattle are where the brooks ought to be . Our author mentions another circumstance highly peculiar to these regions , that he felt an evident change of temperature in mounting alternately to the tops of these ridges , and returning again to the level of the bottoms of the valleys . ' He adds of the place he is describing , that the plain upon which it stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt not , a striking contrast with the surrounding hills . Our author 's general impressions of the Vermontese character are highly favorable . He says , we are under no small obligations for the respectability of the American character to the assistance of the Green Mountain boys ; ' and most of the tavern floors , in his way through the country , were occupied by venerable citizens , discussing , at these convenient meeting places , the affairs of governors , states , and nations : a practice which must essentially aid these venerable boys , in their husbandry and households . Our author makes brief mention of the college at Dartmouth , which he tells us occupies a perspicuous station . ' If it were as easy for others to realize , as our pedestrian author to make , his discoveries , we doubt not our brethren at Hanover would imitate the English universities , and set up a number of travelling // fellowships at once . For he tells us that the funds of this institution are excellent , consisting in the awards of nearly two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the northern part of this and the neighbouring state . ' What these awards may be , we do not pretend to say ; never having enjoyed the means of information furnished by travelling on foot . But if lands in the northern parts of New Hampshire and Vermont are excellent funds , ' we desire to get a leaf out of the Dartmouth college book . We had imagined a property of this kind to he like the proposal which was made by one of the country parishes of New Hampshire , to raise their pastor 's salary from $250 to $300 per annum . Spare me , my christian friends , ' replied the worthy man ; it is a weary burden to collect the $250 : I should be worn to death by trying to scramble together the three hundred . ' Unless awards are ex* ceeding poor stock , we should prefer them to the northernmost* lands of New Hampshire or Vermont . Few single circumstances show the advantages of travelling on foot , more than our au* thor 's discoveries in the White Mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conveyance but horses and chaises , made them short of 7000 feet high . But Horace observes , with singular justice , to the disparagement of all but pedestrians that in vain navibus atque quadrigis petimus bene vivere ; and Mr Stansbury on foot confirms the remark , by his experience on these hills . The white mountains , which lay in the north of New Hampshire , rise to the height of 10,000 feet perpendicular . ' We almost wonder here that Mr S. should have failed in his grammar in the word lay . We scarce ever saw an instance where the correct reading would have been more appropriate . Our author on his way to Boston , having been belated on the road , and unable to reach an inn , accepts the friendly offer of a person of whom he inquired his way , and entered a very large country mansion . ' - ' It was the abode of a plain hardworking farmer ; ' but by an effort of the same kind , which enabled a distinguished traveller in Spain to see wondrous things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares of the house of this plain hard working New Hampshire farmer , that wealth smiled on its exterior , while the apartments within gave tokens of superior magnificence . ' Mr Stausbury , however , is only managing , a pretty surprise for his readers ; and this plain hard-working farmer is , in fact , a retired sea captain . // Captain or farmer , he got the blind side of our author , who declares with enthusiasm that the evening fled in the most interesting manner ; the jests went round ; the mug of cider circulated , and the rosy apple brightened each laughing lip . ' This cider , however , had an efl'ecton the worthy captain himself , at which our author only hints . Always jocular , the old gentleman became exceedingly so , and even permitted one of his men , who was standing , to sit down upon a wash basin instead of the chair , which he had silently removed . ' The man was unquestionably highly pleased with the permission . The worthy captain seems to have taken the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or was perhaps living his youth over again , and thought he was letting a green hand into a tub , on crossing the equator ; a mistake the less to be murmured at , as the mug of cider had circulated , and the ancient navigator appears to have been half seas over . Our author , who , to all appearance , is a bit of a wag himself , declares , that he left this house with regret . ' His agreeable entertainment in it was but an unfaithful augury of his company in the stage coach to Boston . Among them were two persons , whom he pronounces to have been , in the mild signification of the term , Boston sharpers , and who commenced business by a boisterous colloquy about such smart men of their town , such and such sharp fellows of their neighborhood , and made many shrewd remarks concerning horse dealing , swapping , purchasing molasses , and vending clocks , wooden bowls , and pumpkin-pie dishes to the southward . ' We think we see the wicked smile of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put themselves off for ; and a high treat they must have had to see worthy Mr Stanshury entering them in his note-book , first as horse jockies , then West India supercargoes , then travelling pedlars , or rather all at once , without the good man 's dreaming of the hoax . The Boston folks are sharp indeed ; rather too much so to blow themselves thus to Mr Stanshury . We have no doubt he expected every moment to see the dogs pull out a bag of wooden nutmegs . Approaching nearer the ocean from Connecticut river , our author had the good fortune to find the land grow more fertile ; whence it is plain that the luck of making discoveries , which attends him on foot , does not desert him in the coach . His vehicle rolled speedily , he tells us , through Bedford , . TVashford , and Tungsborough , each a splendid place , without one // small or ill looking house about it . This is travelling with a witness ; and a very valuable annotation informs us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we are sorry to argue , that we have lived all our days with a set of sharpers , who have put the odd eight pence in their pockets , for every dollar they have exchanged for us . But the glorious things which it was reserved for our author to disclose , crowd fast upon us . We passed , ' saith he , through Dunstable , Chelmsford , Billerica , Burlington , and Woburn , without stopping more than ten minutes in each place . Bur .. lington has become famous for its extensive theological insti* tutions , which are brick buildings of extraordinary elegance as well as simplicity . ' This discovery of Mr Stansbury 's at Burlington strikingly confirms a remark often made , that travellers will find out more of a place in a few moments , than inhabitants and neighbors in a long life . Struck with shame on reading this part of Mr Stausbury 's valuable work , we immediately set off on foot to do penance with a fifteen miles walk , and make a pedestrian trip to Burlington . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purpose of taking a walk , to betray us into a too literal accomplishment of that plan . Availing ourselves of one of those advantages , which Mr Stanbury declares to be peculiar to pedestrians , that ofjumping into the first vehicle which we encountered , we craved a seat in the one horse chaise of our former academical associate and esteemed friend , the reverend Mr Sewall , of Burlington , not doubting that if there were a theological institution in his parish , he would certainly know the fact , and peradventure belong to the establishment . Our friend was not less surprised at the strain of our remarks , than we had been in reading the paragraph of Mr Stanshury 's work . Too mild , however , to express a disparaging judgment , he half whispered with a significant smile , fuit hand ignobilis Argis , ' and bid us good morning . Mr Stansbury put up at the Rising Sun in Boston , the only sign we are sure at all appropriate to the happy day , when he entered our walls . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of walking probably conferred , he contrives to bring his observations on Boston , Charlestown , and Cambridge , within the compas of one day , and starts off the next morning for Newport . His conscience having smitten him for his intemperate indulgence in a seat in the Concord stage , he determined once more to adopt what he learnedly // calls the yejpatetic mode ; which appears , however in the sequel , to mean getting on board a fast sailing packet at Providence . ' But before leaving this part of the country , our author gives the following very judicious and impartial summary of the character of its various regions . Amongst ourselves , we call the former New Englanders Yankies ; but foreigners have dubbed us all with that title . The latter of the south according to their respective states , are denominated Virginiens , Kentuckians , Georgians . The New Englanders , considered as one body , represented in an individual , are a sanctimonious , sober , good-looking , and withal , an enterprising neighbor , full of excellent thoughts and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , are a hospitable , complaisant , as well as a profane , slave-driving , and swarthy looking personage , who however keeps a sharp eye to his own aggrandisement , and that of his country . The middle states , among which New York stands prominent , hold that just medium , which can not fail to produce respect and veneWith these reflections , our venerable traveller draws near to New York , and approaches the Wallabout , with throbbing exultation . Landing at Crane-wharf , he finds , as he observes , a new subject of congratulation , in perceiving the rising columns of a new market , and treads the hallowed spot with an imagination glowing , no doubt , at the sirloins and haunches , that are to be . The concluding remarks evince a na*vet* so amiable , that we can not forbear to quote them . Our remarks are now more than sufficiently protracted . With " a simple tale , " qu. the author of this striking quotation we have made an effort for the honor of the nation , and not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to unfold some of the natural beauties , and artificial magnificence of North American scenery , and until that voice , which bids the lover to clamber down the precipice to pluck for his mistress a flower , or the patriot to behold unmoved the shafts of hatred and malice aimed at his heart , again speaks , we will throw down the pen . ' ft would indeed be a piece of most gratuitous malice , for any one to whisper that our author has written for his own advantage . We profess not to understand the meaning of the last sentence , but we suspect Messrs Myers and Smith hope by this time , that the said voice which is to lead Mr Stausbury to give tlhm another book to print , will not very soon speak again . // The truth is , for it is time to speak seriously , this book is too bad . There is a great deal of stuff daily issuing from the press , and as most of it comes with its own corrective of dullness , it seems unkind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doom . One circumstance only has determined us to notice the work before us . Large numbers of the inhabitants of our cities resort annually to that scene of glory and beauty , presented to them in a part of the tour , which this book pretends to describe . All ought to do it , who can possibly spare time and money for the journey . JV'iagaram vidi ought almost to be the American 's pass word . Now in the hurry of packing up for the lakes , and in that want of some sort of guide-book , which most feel on such an occasion , it may , by some evil chance , befall a traveller of weak nerves to see Mr Stanshury 's tour to the lakes and the Canadas , in a shop window , to buy it , and reserving the perusal till he arrives at the spot , to put it unopened in his trunk . It is plain that no dependence could be placed on the continued sanity of a man , who , under these circumstances , should arrive at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falls , chance on the following passage : Down drop the brimful oceans , crash upon crash , loud peal the hollow rattling thunders . As a thousand crags rifted at once by lightning from the top of a lofty mountain , dart headlono crumbling to the distant valley , and reiterating with deafening%udness , stupify the dismayed ( ? ) inhabitant , over whose head they rebounded , so flies Niagara over us desperately swift ; and madly bellowing as it recoils high above the trembling earth , astounds the a-frighted senses of the presumptuous mortals who thus dare to break into this worse than Tartarean dungeon An awful plunge ! Dreadful uproar echos round the deep abyss , whilst the never ceasing war of jarring elements break , quiver , burst , and roll around , As if the phrenzi 'd demons of the air , Loosed from their chains of adamant , had met In fierce encounter . Mingling yells and groans of horror appear to unite with the class of sparkling armor , and the angry spirits of the torrent from their watery caverns seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumnions , and hurrying precipitately away , rejoin a more secure and comfortable station .
