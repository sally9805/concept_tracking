txt ART . X .. - Essays Descriptive and Moral on Scenes in Italy , Switzerland , and France . By AN AMERICAN . Edinburgh . A. Constable &amp; Co. 1 vol. 8vo. 1823 . THIs small and unpretending volume of Essays , which appeared a few months ago at Edinburgh , is not a book of travels ; but the result and reflections of some passages in its author 's residence on the continent of Europe . It has been his object , therefore , to give a deep moral and religious interest and coloring to a few separate scenes and circumstances , that chiefly arrested his attention , without attempting to mark the course of his journeys , or to give a minute description even of the portions on which he has chosen to dwell . In general , he has succeeded . The grave tone of his thoughts and feelings harmonizes well with the scenes and subjects he has selected , belonging , as they do chiefly , to the antiquities of Italy and of the Catholic faith . Occasionally , indeed , he turns aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same strain of thought and feeling , almost always solemn and sometimes sad , showing an original imagination easily excited , and sustaining itself long ; but which has evidently been // 1824 .

It struck my imagination much , ' says he , while standing on the last field fought by Bonaparte , that the battle of Waterloo should have been fought upon a Sunday . What a different scene for the Scotch Greys and English infantry , from that which at that very hour was exhibited by their relatives ; when over England and Scotland each church bell had drawn together its worshippers ! While many a mother 's heart was sending upward a prayer for her son 's preservation , perhaps that son was gasping in agony . Yet even at such a period , the lessons of his early days might give him consolation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal anguish . It is religion alone which is of universal application , both as stimulant and lenitive , as it is the varied heritage of man to labor or endure . But we know that many thousands rushed into this fight , even of those who had been instructed in our own religious principles , without leisure for one serious thought ; and that some officers were killed in their balldresses . They made the leap into the gulf which divides two worlds , the present from the immutable state , without one parting prayer or one note of preparation ! As I looked over this field , now green with growing corn , I. could mark with my eye spots where the most desperate carnage had been marked out by the verdure of the wheat . The bodies had been heaped together , and scarcely more than covered . And so enriched is the soil , that in these spots the grain never ripens ; it grows rank and green to the end of the harvest . This touching memorial , which endures when the thousand groans have expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground , still seems to cry to Heaven that there is awful guilt somewhere , and a terrific reckoning for those who had caused destruction which the earth would not conceal . These hillocks of superabundant vegetation , as the wind rustled through the corn , seemed the most affecting monuments which nature could devise , and gave a melancholy animation to this plain of death . When we attempt to measure the mass of suffering which was here inflicted , and to number the individuals that have fallen , considering that each who suffered was our fellow man , we are overxvhelmed with the agonizing calculation , and retire from the field which has been the scene of our reflections , with the simple concentrated feeling ; - these armies once lived , breathed , and felt like us , and the time is at hand when we shall be like them .

Few places combine within such narrow limits so rich a train of various meditation , for persons of whatever disposition or habit , as this city upon the Gulf of Salerno . At a point , removed from the sight of civilized life , surrounded with the relics of men who lived in the highest stage of luxury , he who can only admire the skill which raised an architrave , and he who has fancy enough to picture the living scene of a Grecian city while sitting on its tomb , will find no other interruption than the rapid movement , now and then , of a beautiful lizard , which he has startled from basking in the sunshine .

It was from Pwstum that I was to turn my face homeward .

A journey in Italy may be compared not unaptly with the course of human life . The plains of Lombardy , and the vale of Arno , are rich , and smooth , and beautiful as youth ; we come to Rome for the sights , and experience , and reflections , which suit manhood ; we return after the bustle of life to the comforts congenial to age , and which are provided in sunshine , and air , and the bounties of nature , as we find them at Naples ; and we at last behold Pa*stum , as the soberest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends our toil .

As a general remark upon this somewhat singular and original work , it may be observed , that the author is more at home in the South of Italy , than anywhere else ; for , as might well be foreseen , his feelings and fancy are both more appropriately and more earnestly excited amidst the solemn // ruins , and the ecclesiastical magnificence of modern Rome , than by the manners and scenery of the countries of the north . In one point of view , indeed , few subjects can be more interesting than the present state of Rome ; - Rome , we mean , considered as a diminished and decaying city , annually consumed by the increasing pestilence of the Mal'aria , whose ruins are destined at some period , and , perhaps , at no very remote one , to be left as desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inevitable has long been admitted with more or less distinctness ; but never shown by any connected notices of the past progress of this mysterious pestilence , compared with its present extent ; for the Romans have seemed to be unwilling to meet the subject in all its alarming magnitude ; and strangers have rarely examined it with interest and thoroughness . The Mal'aria , or bad air , as it is called , is a state of the atmosphere , or of the soil , or of both , in different parts of Italy ; producing in the warm season , and especially in the months of August and September , a fever , * more or less violent according to the nature of the exposure ; but generally fatal , where the exposure has been long continued , or the place among the more dangerous . It is found in very different situations-situations , indeed , so different , that we can hardly he justified in believing it always to proceed from the same cause . We hear of it in the rice grounds of Lombardy , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Radicofani , and round the Gulf of Salerno . But it is nowhere so formidable as at Rome , for it nowhere else prevails over a tract of country so extensive , or is followed by consequences indicating so fatal a degree of activity in the cause . The infected district , of which Rome is almost the centre , extends on the coast from Leghorn to Terracina , and from the sea back to the Appenines , nearly two hundred miles in length and sometimes above thirty in breadth . How many perish annually from the peculiar disease contracted within these limits , it is not possible to determine ; because the persons employed here in cultivating the soil do not live on it permanently , and // as soon as they find themselves infected endeavor to seek a place in some of the towns , or return home to be restored or to die . The number , however , is very great . Above four thousand perished by it in the hospitals of Rome alone in 1801 , and the yearly list seldom falls below thirteen hundred. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human life can not be supported where the Mal'aria prevails with a considerable degree of intensity ; and those who have survived one season of exposure to it , under such circumstances , are generally its victims , if their poverty forces them a second year within its influence . A century ago , and indeed much later , it was generally believed that the Mal'aria was a dense exhalation chiefly from the Pontine marshes , brought to Rome in the latter part of the summer by the south westerly winds , which then prevail nearly the whole time . In consequence of this , the small number of houses built beyond the capitol , in modern times , have generally been constructed with few or no windows towards the south west , lest the infection should gain access by them . But it has since been found to enter gradually at the northern side of the city , and at the same season , notwithstanding the prevalence of opposing winds , and , therefore , this doctrine , which was always obliged to contend with the fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to have little left for its support . That the Pontine marshes are unhealthy from the decay of vegetable matter , there can be no doubt ; and it is probable they always were so . Pliny , indeed , speaks of a large number of cities that filled them with population and life , before all record of Roman history ; but , the tradition he followed is probably fabulous , and the first authentic information we get concerning them is , that they were drained in the year of Rome 442 by Appius Claudius , when he built his famous Appian Way through the midst of them . But in time his * The number of patients received into the Sante Spirito Hospital at Rome in 1818 , of the disease produced by the ***aria , was 8137 , and the number of deaths was 363 .

Horace , indeed , passed through it on his merry journey to Brundusium , and saw cvidently more than one village on its borders ; but Julius Ca*sar had already found the whole relapsing , and formed a magnificent project for a perpetual drain and purification of the whole extent of the marshes , by carrying through their centre the bed of the Tyber , and discharging its waters at Terracina , above thirty miles from its natural outlet . He was however , prevented from undertaking it by his sudden death . They were , probably , drained again by Trajan , and certainly , in the year 500 , by Theodorick ; but from this time , as everywhere else in Italy , the works of antiquity , here , too , went to decay . About the year 1300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three centuries later , the restless spirit of Sixtus V made an experiment of an enormous canal ; but both failed . The road was still obliged to go round by the declivity of the Appenines , and the immense surface of the marshes was still left , as Statius saw it , one vast bog . At last , between 1778 and 1788 , Pius VI , acting under the persuasion , that the pestilence of the Mal'aria came to Rome from the Pontine marshes , undertook to reduce them , at once , to a state fit for cultivation . An immense number of lives was consumed in the enterprise ; but he succeeded so far as to build through the midst of this watery waste a magnificent road twenty four miles long accompanied , like the Appian way , by an awple canal , which , when the French were masters of Rome , was enlarged and furnished with subsidiary sluices , that have remained ever since in efficient operation . Still , however , the Pontine marshes can not be said to be reclaimed . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are composed , not above twenty have been reduced to a state of cultivation ; and of the remainder a large proportion is still under water . The whole is as much subject as ever to exhalations , that produce fatal fevers during the summer montlms* and it remains , therefore , as dreary a waste now , as it was when Appius Claudius built the solid causeway , that has disappeared forever in its bosom . Human habitations , there are none , except those supported by the government ; and the very postillions , that are obliged to convey those travellers whom necessity brings there at the dangerous season , are convicts , for whom this service is only a commutation of punish* // ment . Wherever the eye turns , the view is , at last , closed up by a rank and impenetrable growth of saplings and bushes , that , on such a soil , can never gain the height of trees ; and in the intervals , where these are not found , thou*. sands of horses and buffaloes are wandering about in herds nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched herdsman , broken down with squalid infirmities , and as rude and untamed as themselves . That the exhalations from such a vast extent of country as this , so long the seat of fatal disease , may , as the vulgar have believed from the time of Pliny to our own days , produce some effect on the atmosphere in the city of Rome , when the wind has long blown from the south west , is very possible . It is not , however , credible , that they are the entire or even principal cause of the Mal'aria there ; for this pestilence prevails in other parts of Italy remote from all marshy grounds ; it prevails near Rome over a dry surface vastly greater , than the whole surface of the Pontine marshes ; the city itself is forty miles distant from them ; and , for the last twenty years , the Mal'aria has been entering from the north against the current of the winds , as fast as it has from the south , where it is supposed to be favored by them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very soil it lays waste ; or , in other words , in the territory which passes under the name of the Campagna di Roma , whose centre is Rome itself . This territory is entirely of volcanic formation ; is broken into gentle undulations ; is raised considerably above the level of the sea ; and is quite dry . It is , therefore , in all respects , different from the Pontine marshes , and yet is no less the seat of disease , and no less deserted and waste . How long it has been unhealthy , from the causes that have now depopulated above a thousand square miles of fruitful territory , it is not easy to determine . The neighborhood of Rome , according to Livy 's account , was not in good reputa. * tion above three centuries before the Christian a*ra . Strab* speaks of Lanuvium and Antium ; and Seneca of Ardea , as unhealthy ; and that the city itself was partially so , we may fairly infer from the beautiful descriptions in Horace , and the constant allusions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scattered from the hills of Tivoli to Baja and Qapr*a , where the luxurious patricians , and their more // rious emperors resorted for a purer air than they could find at home . But this is all ; and such intimations xviii hardly distinguish the case of ancient Rome from that of other large southern cities . Certainly there is nothing in them , that indicates the peculiar curse of an annual pestilence laying waste a vast territory , then quite as thickly crowded with population as the neighborhood of London or Paris is now . Nor are its traces to be found even at a much later date . In the times of the empire there is no doubt , from many passages in the Epitomes , in Ammianus Marcellinus , and in Procopius , that the Campagna was still as full of population , as the state of the city might lead us to expect . Christian churches were opened or erected in the suburbs , in the time of Constantine and his immediate successors . The splendid tomb of St Helena , which would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an unbroken waste . Indeed , as late as the year 400 , when Honorious made his progress through Italy , the whole road from Ocriculum , a distance of fifty-miles , on twenty five of which there are now but two human dwellings , and those supported by the government ; - this whole road was so completely lined with splendid houses , villas , temples , and triumphal arches , or , as Claudian happily expresses it , quicquid tauta3 premittitur urbi , that the Emperor imagined himself every moment approaching the gates of the capital . Under the papal power in the middle ages , everything , of course , declined , and the Campagna suffered in the common decay . But still , there are proofs , that it was not desolated by the Mal'aria . In the ninth century the Popes employed themselves , repeatedly , in enlarging and fortifying the city of Ostium , then of great consequence , but now entirely deserted . In the eleventh , twelfth , and thirteenth centuries , the Sciarras , the Sforzas , and the other independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , held throughout the Campagna those massive castles , whose ruins bear constant witness to a degree of salubrity that is now unknown ; while the remains of several forsaken monasteries , and two papal villas , which were chosen resorts and residences about the year 1300 , prove , at least , that any inherent difficulty in the soil or atmosphere was a thing not yet apprehended . // The darkest and most disastrous period , however , that Rome has ever passed through , is that between 1305 and 1376 , when the papal throne was established at Avignon . The city was then given up to the most desperate and bloody factions , under the conduct of what , in the language of the time , were well called the famiglie prepotenti , the Colonne , the Orsini , the Frangipani , and other domestic princes and military chiefs ; traces of whose residence and strength are still to be found where human habitation has long been impracticable . Nothing , perhaps , can exceed the misery they produced by their desperate quarrels . Faction succeeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphed over another ; and one demagogue displaced and other , in such rapid succession , that it seemed as if the universal misery were fast approaching an inevitable conclusion . When , therefore , Gregory XI returned in 1377 , he found the country about Rome laid waste ; he found that the suburbs had disappeared ; that the walls were in many places broken down and destroyed ; and that the whole of the discouraged and failing population was reduced to seventeen thousand souls ; so near was the eternal city to its final fall . From this time , and , perhaps , partly in consequence of this melancholy desolation , we begin to find notices of what is now called the Mal'aria . In 1406 , when Gregory XII was elected , we are expressly told by a contemporary , that he did not establish himself at the Lateran , where his predecessors had resided , while the air was not unhealthy-dum aer non ir*fectus ; so that it must have been something recent . The villa Magliana , a favorite residence of Leo X , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness of which he died in 1521 , has been considered an infected spot ever since his time . The Vatican has been accounted posi* tively unsafe since the conclave of 1623 ; and at every protracted election of a pope , which has happened during the past two centuries in the months of August and September , there has been a remarkable mortality among the cardinals and their attendants . Since 1710 , the Palatine , the Circus Maximus , the Forum , the Baths of Dioclesian , the Colosceum , and , indeed , the whole of those portions of the city , where ancient Rome chiefly stood , have been quite abandoned to the // Mal'aria . Very few buildings remain there , and none have been erected , so that from the Viminal round by the Lateran , and by the Baths of Antoninus to the A.ventine , the whole must soon become an absolute desert . At the same time , however , that the site of ancient Rome has been thus silently given up , the heart of the modern city and its very best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ripetta , and the Quirinal began to be dangerous above a hundred years ago , and the last has since become absolutely unsafe during the hottest months , so , that , even for a century , the coming doom of Rome may be considered as having been inscribed on its walls , distinctly enough to have been understood by those , who well regarded the signs of the times . But within the last fifty years , when observation ha* been more accurate , this doom has been more apparent . The annual pestilence , which had so long reigned unmolested in the southern portions of the city has , within that time , intruded from the north . The Villa Borghese , the most ample and magnificent of the Roman country houses , which was built in the seventeenth century , just outside the Porta del Popolo , and which , during the greater part of the eighteenth , was the scene of more luxury and splendor , than almost any spot in Italy , has , for above forty years , been considered infected , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Corso , and the Piazza di Spagna , to which strangers resort , and always have resorted in modern times , as the healthiest parts of the city , have not been entirely safe since the beginning of the present century , and are thought annually to grow worse . The public walk , which the French constructed hardly twenty years ago on the site , or nearly on the site , of the luxurious gardens of Sailust and Lucullus , must already be avoided during the evenings of the months of August and September . The beautiful Villa Ludovisi , in the same quarter , has been no more safe during the last thirty years , but the French Academy of Painting , though separated from it only by a public way , was never invaded till the summer of 1817 , and has been condemned as dangerous , only since the death of several of the pupils in 1818 . Thus the last of the Roman hills , and the portion of the city , which , through a succession of ages , has been the chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mal'aria ; // so that from the Vatican to the Lateran , and from the Villa Borghese to the gate of St Paul , there is no longer any considerable space from which those , who are able , do not escape during the hot months , and only very small portions , where , from some unexplained cause , this mysterious pestilence has not yet intruded . Outside of the walls , or in the deserted parts within them , no person will do more than pass rapidly on during the dangerous season , who can possibly avoid it . On the final result of such a state of things , it is , of course , impossible to shut our eyes . The Mal'aria has been for four centuries constantly extending its ravages . It is a contest that has been for ages every year renewed , and every year followed by a signal defeat . The whole Campagna has been laid waste by it ; three fourths of the space within the walls of the city have teen given*4. to its desolation ; and even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cathedrals elsewhere , and with palaces such as transalpine kings do not dwell in , the unseen pestilence still goes forth unmolested . It is not , indeed , for human foresight to fix the dates of empires and cities ; but it is more in the spirit of history than of prophecy to say , that Rome must one day become what P*estum and Volterra are now . How soon this solemn consummation must take place , we could perhaps almost determine , if we knew what is the cause of the Mal'aria . But this has been reserved among the darkest of nature 's secrets . Whether it be , as some have supposed , an exhalation from waters hidden far under the surface , and therefore to be avoided , as one of the cardinals has wisely suggested , by literally paving the whole of the countless acres of the Campagna ; or whether it be from the volcanic materials of the soil , which , after decaying for thousands of years , have at last reached the point , when , under the influences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , a noxious gas is developed ; or whether it be from any other of the many causes that have been suggested , or from all put together , we have , notwithstanding the discussions that have been carried on , no means to determine . Chemistry detects no difference between the air that , during the months of August and September , destroys life in the Campagna , and the air which elsewhere is life 's support and nourishment . // All we know , therefore , of the Mal'aria is from its effects ; and no*hing can be more solemn than the exhibition the Campagna gives us of its long continued power . The eye wanders over its boundless waste without finding any other horizon , than that formed by the gentle undulations , which everywhere break without relieving its melancholy monotony . Frequently not a house , nor a tree , nor a sign of human habitation or life is to be seen for many miles . And yet here once lived the hardy and warlike tribes of the Fidenates and the Coriolani . Here was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the times of the Republic . Here was no small portion of the splendor of the Empire . And , finally , here resided the strength of a proud barbarism in the middle ages , when the contest between the Orsini , the Sciarras , the Savelli , and other rude chieftains in their castles without the city , and the ecclesiastical usurpations within , remained so long undecided . Ha*c tunc nomina erant , nunc sunt sine nomine terr*e . And yet , there is little in the Campagna to recall the deserts , which nature has elsewhere left or created in her works , since these melancholy wastes owe their power over the feelings and the imagination less to their present condition , than to the recollections and associations they awaken . For the heavens above them are of the most undisturbed and transparent blue . The sun shines with the purest and whitest light . The wind blows with the softest and most exhilarating freshness . The very vegetation is so rich and abundant , so wantonly luxuriant , that it seems as if nature were wooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very chosen spots of all the earth for human habitation and happiness . But the mind refuses to rest on all this . The past and the future prevail over the present . It is impossible not to recollect , that this serene sky and brilliant sun , which should inspire such confidence , serve only to develope the noxious qualities of the soil ; that the air which breathes so gently is as fatal as it is balmy ; and that this abundant vegetation is composed only of gross and lazy weeds , such as may be fitly nourished by exhalations so deadly . Or if it were possible , for a moment , to drive away thoughts like these , the few intimations of human life ard power that are visible , would recall others even more // sad . The remains of an ancient aqueduct stretching its numberless arches through the waste , would recall the multitudes that once found health in its waters . The occasional fragments of the rude architecture of the middle ages , would give token how long an interval has elasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desert it . Or a gibbet , still bearing the shrunk and blackened remains of some miserable wretch , whom this very desolation has tempted to guilt , or a few half savage shepherds , decrepit in youth , pale , haggard and livid , who , indeed , may have survived the poison of one season , but have hardly courage enough left to ask strength from heaven to drag their weary existence beyond another , would still announce the whole waste as the peculiar abode of desolation and death . These are the feelings and impressions , which prevail over all others in the deserts of the Campagna . Rome , indeed , . with the cupola of St Peter 's , and the tomb of Adrian , may rise gradually in the horizon , like a glorious apparition . ' But Rome , too , is already within the influence of that mysterious agent , which is spread everywhere around the remains of its temples and tombs , as an invisible enemy , whose approach no intimation announces , and no power can resist . That this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit us to doubt , Rome herself already stands in widowed greatness amidst the desolation of the Campagna ; and its soil , which for so many centuries teemed with splen* dor and power , seems now to be emancipating itself by its own secret energies , and demanding to lie fallow of glory as many ages as it bore its burden , @
