txt ART . III. -. i1 Statistical , Political , and Historical account of the United States of JV'orth dmerica ; from the period of their first colonization to the present day . By D. B. Warden , late Consul for the United States at Paris , 4cc. *Vc. 3 vols. 8vo . Edinburgh , 1819 . THE title of this book ought to serve it as a letter of introduction to us . It promises to tell us more about our country , than was ever before brought together in any one work , and it may be inferred from the time it has remained unnoticed , that we either do not care to know these things , or do not choose to learn them from Mr Warden . We have had a vast deal to read about ourselves within a few years , it is true , and we have not been neglectful of such writers as made their accounts of us pleasant and piquant , by a good seasoning of abuse ; and we doubt not , if our author had told as many amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have received the same flattering attentions we showed to them . But we do not appear to take much interest in sober historical relation , and matter of fact information . This arises perhaps from knowing so much about our past and present condition , as we must necessarily know from the very nature of our political institutions , and from the frequent exercise of our civil rights . The principal facts of our history are early and easily learned ; our origin is involved in no obscurity and uncertainty ; the story of the first hundred and fifty years of our national existence is told in a few pages , and we have either been actors in the events of the last half century , or received our accounts of them from those who were . Besides , we have opportunities for learning our history , in a great degree , peculiar to ourselves ; the birth day of our political independence is made to tell its own story , and while we remember and duly commemmorate that day and the deeds which grew out of it , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , // that relates to us . Other nations , it is true , have feasts and festivals in commemoration of great events in their history , but they are events , which chiefly affected their sovereigns and princes . Our great anniversary , on the contrary , is truly a na-. tional one ; a commemoration of blessings , extended equally to every individual of the land . Nor is this the only occasion afforded to the people of our country , of calling up the great events of their history . They hear of them at every political and municipal meeting , on the fast and feast days appointed by the civil government , and at the public academic and other literary exercises , which are so frequent among us ; so that little as they may learn of them by reading of treatises , they can not yet be ignorant of them . We would not , however , be understood to say , that this is all the knowledge of our history , which we are bound to cultivate . The remarks were made only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical is a small part only of the work under consideration ; its main object is statistics . This is a science of recent origin , for though it embraces most of the subjects assigned both in England and in this country to geography , they are in fact entirely distinct , when the latter is kept within its proper limits . Geography treats the earth in relation only to its mathematical figure , its physical characters , and its political divisions ; statistics is a philosophical account of whatever has an influence on a state , as such . The former , therefore , must confine its descriptions to territory , but the latter includes both people and territory . The earliest work we have of a statistical nature , is the Del governo e amministrazione di div*rsi regni e republiche ' of Francisco Sansovino , published at Venice in 1567 , and which was compiled from materials , collected by the ministers of the Venetian republic at the several courts of Europe , by order of the senate . The collection commonly called Republica* ELzeviriana* , first published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the principal compilers , is also statistical ; but there was no systematic work of this description , before the time of Achenwall , who was professor at Gottingen in Hannover , in the middle of the last century . He was the father of the science , and first made it a subject of lectures in the Universities ; and it is now taught in this way throughout the continent of Europe . In // ken , ' which has already passed through seven editions , and serv- ' ed as a model for all later works on the same subject . The divisions and subdivisions laid down by him have been adopt-. ed for the most part by our author , and *where departed from , it is in consequence of the pec*Aiar political character of our republic . In an introduction of fifty pages , Mr Warden pre- . sents us with a summary and admirable view of the history , progress , and present condition of the United States . We have never seen more information condensed into so small a compass , nor ever looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is elegant , the style forcible , the reasoning sound , and the descriptions beautiful and eloquent . In all these respects it is so unlike the body of the work , that if some professed preface-writer , like Dr Johnson , had been near the author , we should have been unjust enough to think he had transferred his pen to another hand . The circumstances under which our country was settled , and which have served to determine our character , are thus pointed out by him . It was a favorable circumstance for the United States , that the country wa* colonized chiefly by population drawn from the most enlightened nations of the old world , and ut a period , whe*n a variety of happy changes had disabused the human mind of *ome of its worst prejudices . What would have been its situation , *if peopled by some of the other nations of Europe , is apparent from the stitte of the Spanish colonies . The English , who forme4 the leading part of the colonists , had been emancipated from supersti-. tion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas than other nations in politics , and had made*greater progress in arts and industry . The first settlers , no doubt , considered their removal to this country a painful sacrifice , but after they had acquired strength to maintain themselves against the Indians , the advantages of their situation began to appear . It was an unoccupied world , of the richest soil , and most favored climate , spread out before a small number of men , who possessed the skill and industry of a mature society . In the ancient world , the arts necessary to draw forth the riches of the earth were not acquired till its surface was in general appropriated ; and the progress of society was checked , first by ig'norance , and afterwards by vicious arrange* ents. ' p. xviii . Most of the old colonies were planted when the prevalence of military habits , and of a dark superstition , with a host of errors and prejudices , checked the march of industry and improvement . // July , The North American colonists on the other hand , left Europe when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the effects of industry , the true source of national wealth , had begun to develop themselves ; when civil liberty began to be understood and valued ; when religion was stripped of many of its corruptions ; when knowledge was advancing , and society had begun to settle on its right basis . The colonists , placed in the new settlements , had on y to avail themselves of the advantages ef their situation . Their society , held together by common wants , and moulded by their circumstances , was disencurabered of many of those corruptions and abuses , which time and accident accumu-* late in all old communities . A fortunate combination of circum , * stances , by bringing them all under one government , left them free from the destructions of war ; and a no powerful neighbour , jealous of their prosperity , to compel them to load themselves with a great military establishment . They were placed at too great a distance from Europe , to be 4ften embroiled in its quarrels and yet near enough to share the benefits of its commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches upon our extent of territory , the ratio of population , the height of our mountains , the length of our rivers , the character of our soil and the nature of its products , the rapid increase of inhabitants , the agriculture , . commerce and manufactures , the government , religion and manners of the country , on all which subjects the author 's remarks are very striking* If our limits would allow , we should be glad to extract more copiously from this part of the work , but we can only give the concluding paragraph . Doubtless the government of the United States is not exempt from the errors and imperfections , that adhere to all human institutions . But compare its public conduct with that of the old governments of Europe . How calm and reasonable is its language ; always addressing itself to the understanding and the solid inter . ests of the people , never to their passions or prejudices . It seeks no aid from supem*stition , supports no gainful impostures , and uses none of that disgusting cant , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . It is a stranger to state craft and mystery . All its acts are done in the face of day . It prizinotes knowledge , religion and learning , without the preference of particular sects , and without debasino ' them by falsehoods beneficial to the ruling powers . It is the only government in the world that dares to put arms freely into the hands of all its citizens . From Maine to Mississippi it commands a prompt and ready obedience , without any other weapon than a constable 's // staff . Jn*a word , it secures property , satisfies opinion , promotes the development of industry and talent , with a rapidity hitherto unexampled ; and , with the smallest sacrifice of individual rights and property on the part of the people , it accomplishes all that the most expensive and powerful governments pretend to . ' p. lxiv . When an author puts such an introduction to his work , he brings upon himself this evil , that most readers are satisfied with what they learn from it , and do not take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in the present case , but we are sure that those , who go through the three volumes , will agree with us in thinking , that the sixty pages of the introduction are worth as much at least as the other sixteen or seventeen hundred . There is a difficulty in collecting materials for a work on the statistics of this country , which does not exist in regard to the states of Europe . No official returns are made and no account is taken in America of many of the objects , which enter into a statistical view of a country . Taxation does not haunt our dwellings , or wait at our sides when we gather in our harvests , or stand at the door of the workshops of our artisans , or put its stamp upon the hales and parcels , which come from our manufactories . The commerce of the interior , in which the transportation of the commodities exchanged is made by land , renders no account of its operations . Hence we find great inaccuracies in those parts of the statistical accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for a guide . IBristed 's book on the resources of America is full of them , and Warden*s is by no means free ; but Pitkin and Seybert , by going no further than they were warranted by official documents , have given to their works the authority of the documents themselves . Another difficulty for our author was the imperium in in*perio of our confederation , which must necessarily produce confusion in an account of it , when the character and powers of the confederation and of the members composing it as political states are not clearly and distinctly defined . There are few men that have not seen the practical operation of our government , who are able to understand our general and state sovereignties , and we doubt much if Mr Warden would aid one in obtaining a better knowledge of the subject , owing to the bad arrangement he has adopted . To make the justice of this objection apparent , we must give the divisions of his work , which are as follows : // 1st . Of the physical features , climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Description of the several states and territories comprehended in the Union , with an appendix describing Florida . 3d . Of the federal government and public establishments connected with it , and of the population , agriculture , trade , revenue and resources of the United States . 4th . Of the Indians . Now we see no reason , why the description of the several states should have been introduced between his first and third parts , especially as it fills two volumes , and thus widely sepa* .. rates the several portions of the account of the country as a ' single state . The received statistical method does not authorize it , for although political divisions make a subdivision of the first general head of statistics , territory , this subdivision refers merely to local partition . Moreover , did the received method authorize Mr Warden 's divisions , it should not have been followed in this instance , on account of the confusion and repetition it brings with it . The states of our confederation are not political divisions , like the counties of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and great confusion must obviously arise , if they are viewed at the same time as such and as independent sovereignties . The way 61 ' avoiding this is easy ; consider the United States as to territory and all its physical characters as one , and as to its government as a confederation , describing only the federal rights and powers of the members , which compose it . The individual states may then be described as minutely as may be wished . A farther examination of the work will show us other objec* tions to its system of arrangement . We have , for example , in the description of the individual states a constant repetition of what we had learned in the description of the United States . How can it be otherwise , when as to their physical properties , they are but parts of one whole ? The general aspect of the country and the nature of the soil , the lakes and rivers , the climate , the products of the fields and forests , the animals , the diseases , in a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the same character , whether state or federal. - Moreover it is a dangerous thing for an ' author to expose himself in this way to the charge of contradictions ; numerous instances of which , we are sorry to say , are to be fQund in the work before us . Compare volume i. pages 27 and 373 , a to // the height of the White mountains ; 291 and $75 , as tothe course of Connecticut river on the border of New Hampshire ; page 144 of vol. i. with 4Q1 of vol. ii . as to the distance of Augusta in Georgia from the sea ; vol i. page 116 with page 506 of vol. ii . as to the annual rise of the Mississippi ; and vol. i. page 329 , 2d paragraph with the third , as to the product of rye from an acre of ground . These are but a very few of the many cases of careless inaccuracies , which occur in the progress of the work . It would be impossible , within any reasonable limits , to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not pretend therefore to enter into a minute examination of the single facts it contains , but confine ourselves to a few general remarks upon some of its most important chapters . The first chapter treats the boundaries of the United States . It is but a little more than two years since this book was published , and our country already stretches beyond the limits which are here assigned to it . Our acquired territory on this side the Rocky mountains was then greater than that which belonged originally to the rest of the United States , and Florida considerably increases it . It may be made a question of political duty , whether our patriotism must expand with the extension of our territory , and require of us to look upon our . French and Spanish brothers by purchase , to be as truly our fellow citizens , as the fathers who defended our soil , and the sons who have since tilled it . We are far from thinking that narrow local feelings should be cherished , but we can not but concur in the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in sending out our patriotic affections . beyond the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains . The natural tendency of an increasing empire to separation was counterbalanced in the new states we have formed , by their being peopled wholly from the older ones , and a community of language , manners , interests and ties , thereby preservech This is not the case with part of Louisiana and with Florida , and on that account some apprehensions in regard to the influence they will have on the permanence of the union may be reasonably entertained . But this is not a pleasant subject of contemplation , and we pass from it to the second and third chapters , which treat of the general aspect of the country , its extent , the nature of the soil , and the lakes and rivers . ' The moat striking feature in the face of our country is its uniformity . // Where else on the surface of the earth can a chain of mountains be found like the Apalachian , or endless , as the name implies , stretching out above 900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance do the Alps present in their course from the frontiers of France and Piedmont , to the eastern confines of Styria . Round Top , and the Peaks of Otter would dwindle into mole-hills by the side of Mont Blanc , Monte Rosa , the Finsteraarhorn , and the Ortelspitze . We are informed also by the geologists , who have examined different parts of the chain , that a like uniformity exists in the materials of which they are formed ; and that rocks of the same kind are found throughout the whole extent , at equal distances from the shores of the Atlantic . But the facts now collected can not be sufficient to warrant so broad an inference . There must , however , have been some mighty causes , which produced so singular a character as that which is impressed upon the whole of this continent , more partici*-larly upon the part of it which we occupy . The long chain of immense lakes and the limestone basin of such extraordinary extent to the south-west of them , washed by the waters of the Mississippi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsion , and Invite to a nearer and more detailed investigation , the result of which would , no doubt , afford a vast many facts of the highest importance , in the natural history of the earth . But interesting as that portion of the country may be to an inquirer into nature , in a moral and political view it is still more so . Occupying the central part of the temperate zone , its climate must be mild and salubrious , when cultivation shall be extended , and population increased . Having a great variety of temperature and an unexampled fertility of soil , it may be made to yield almost all the various products of the earth ; and watered by rivers , which give it above fifty thousand miles of internal navigation , it seems destined by Providence to become the great empire of the West . And there is nothing disparaging and discouraging to the inhabitants of the Atlantic states , in this view of the advantages belonging to our western brethren . What though we have not their rich bottom lands and their boundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a most productive field , when rightly cultivated , and we have but to exercise that industry , ingenuity , and enterprise , which belong to our situation , to draw out from ' our moral resources all the riches and nowers , which their physical confer upon them . // The fourth chapter is devoted to an account of our climate . No satisfactory reason has yet been assigned for the great difference in temperature between a given parallel of latitude in our hemisphere , and the eastern . A few facts and circumstances may be mentioned , partially explanatory of this phenomenon . We have no cold weather in winter , except during the prevalence of northerly and westerly winds , and so powerful is their influence , that we often see the thermometer changed thirty and even forty degrees by them . These winds blow very frequently during the winter , and hence our mean temperature at that season is low . It is unnecessary to remark , that the mountains , which intersect our continent , and . the immense forests that cover them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which blow from them . Again , our atmosphere is much drier than the atmosphere of the temperate regions of Europe , consequently evaporation is greater and more rapid here than there , whereby the temperature is sensibly diminished . This circumstance adds to the coldness of the north-west winds , and accounts for the chillness of our summer mornings and evenings ; the cold commencing with . the evaporation of the collected dew . This is well illustrated by the process of forming ice in the East Indies , where the thermometer never falls to 320 . We are aided also in the solution of this difficulty by the fact , that the eastern side of all continents is colder than the western , and this , we have every reason to believe , is as true of ours as of others . Lewis and Clark found the winter near the mouth of Columbk* river in 460 north , very mild , but rainy , which confirms the accounts before given by Capt . Cook and others in regard to it . Our annual plants show us that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ripen perfectly here , can never be brought to maturity in the more temperate climate&amp; of Europe , while they , on the other hand , can cultivate many perennials , which we can not , another proof that the diffe* rence in the climates arises from local and partial causes . If we inquire into the geographical distribution of the vine , it will present us with as great anomalies in the climates of Europe , as we have in our own . It denies its blessings , for example , to the northern provinces of France , the south part of Bavaria , to many portions of Styria , Carinthia , and the Carniole , and grants them very liberally to higher parallels in Germany and Hungary . Our mean temperature , deduced // from that of deep wells and springs is but very imperfeetly known ; the following results are given by our author . At Rutland in Vermont , at the depth of 45 feet 440 of Fab . Different places of Massachusetts - 49 Philadelphia 53 Virginia 57 Charleston , S. C. 63 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two others from those of Mr Jefferson and Dr Ramsay . Mr Jefferson , in his notes on Virginia , supposes a great difference to exist between the climate of the Atlantic coast , and that of the valley of the Mississippi in favor of the mildness of the latter , which the observations of Dr Drake do not confirm ; but Dr Drake 's opinion is founded wholly on the mean temperature as shown by the thermometer , which is a more uncertain guide than vegetation , upon which Mr Jefferson founds his . One other circumstance in regard to our climate deserves to be mentioned . We have more rain and fewer rainy days than in Europe . The mean there of rainy days for twenty years in twenty different cities was 122 , and but 88 in Cambridge , ( Mass. ) and 95 in Salem for the same time . But the mean annual quantity of rain is greater here than there , owing to our rains being so much heavier . The smallest quantity in Europe given by Mr Warden is at Petersburg , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44* inches . Our smallest is at Philadelphia , but 30 inches according to Dr Rush , and the greatest is at Charleston , S. C. 71. * according to Dr Ramsay . The fifth and sixth chapters of the work are devoted exclusively to an enumeration of our forest trees and quadrupeds , which would have come with rather more propriety into a natural history , than into a statistical account of the country ; but they afford us valuable information on these subjects , and it is hardly reasonable to complain of an author for doing more than he promised . The chapter on the forest trees is taken from Michaux 's North American Sylva . That on the quadrupeds is very long , and contains many curious facts ; we have room only for a single extract . Among the American hunters and travellers it has been long a general opinion , that the young of the bear were produced in a shapeless state , and licked by the tongue of the mother into form and life ; and Lawson , enthusiastically fond of natural history , remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had ever killed // a she bear with young , " but since his time , Mr Brigham of Salis .. bury , in Connecticut , in December 1797 , killed the female in her den , where he found three young ones , of regular shape , and as large as a kitten of two months old . In February 1818 , the American black bear of the Menagerie of the Garden of Plants at Paris , brought forth a young one , about the size of a rat and of a grey color . ' vol. i. p. 197 . A chapter on diseases concludes the first part , in which the author attempts to refute the prevalent opinion in Europe , that life is short in this country , and gives a summary view of the different medical doctrines , concerning the origin and propagation of the yellow fever , with an extract from the report made in 1817 , by the Faculty of Medicine at Paris to the Minister of the Interior , respecting the contagious nature 9f the disease ; the substance of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contagious . This document is to be found in the Journal of Medicine for July 1817 . We must pass over the second part , which describes the individual states and territories , occupying the remainder of the first volume , the whole of the second and first half of the third . It is a sort of particular geography , not so well executed , however , as Ebeling 's , not so careful in the choice of authorities , and consequently not so correct as to facts . We would recommend to the author an alteration of the following passages . In the account of Massachusetts , page 287 , some-. times the sea is frozen to a considerable distance from the coast ; ' page 315 , six per cent . is the annual tax paid on the actual value of all ratable estate both real and personal , except wild and uncleared lands , on which the rate is two per cent . ' In the account of Maine , he would do well to revise his enumeration of rivers ; and in that of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature , and change the number of senators in their state legislature from 13 to 12 , and that of their slaves from few to none , and reduce the civil jurisdiction of their justices of the peace , and put a note explaining how the fishing schooners which are sometimes built at the distance of two or three miles from the sea are taken to pieces and carried thither . ' If he had inquired about Vermont of any person , who has been there since Castiglioni , he would have found that their roads are not in such a state , that the usual progress of a man on foot or on horseback is not more than two miles an hour ; ' or if he had // 58 July , looked on the map of Connecticut he would have seen that New Haven is not near the mouth of the Thames . But we are not bound to make a table of errata for our author . We leave the rest , therefore , for his own revision , assuring him , that they are many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , on which some error is not to be found either his own or his printer 's . Those of his own might be classed into such as proceed from renent incorrect information , from following ancient descriptions of parts of the country , which change every day , and from disregarding the alterations made in the state constitutions and laws by the constitution of the United States . It is certainly matter of surprise , that a book , written by a citizen of the United States , should inform us , that the authors of literary works are secured in the exclusive right thereof in Virginia for twenty one years , and that the delegates to Congress from North Carolina are chosen annually by ballot of the General Assembly , as is stated volume ii . pages 207 and 382 . In the third Part the author returns to his view of the United States collectively . Many of the chapters in this part treat the subjects , upon which Mr Seybert , in his excellent Statistical Annals , has given the most particular details , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of them , in the remarks upon that work , that we do not think it necessary now to take them up again . The forty-eighth and fortyninth chapters , which treat of the state of education , knowledge , manners , the arts , and the state of religion are entitled to more particular attention . We search through these chapters in vain for the account , which we might expect to find of the system of education and of the state of intellectual culture in our country . It is true , unfortunate as it may be for the country , that education is not a subject of national legislation , but it is none the less a national concern , and we shall discover , perhaps , at some future day , that no real national feeling and character can exist without its influence . Mr Warden should have given us a view of our primary and higher schools , and of our colleges , universities , and all other establishments of education , whether elementary or professional , and told us of the number of instructers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not enough , that he has done this , or // partly done it , as the fact is , in the description of the individual states ; we wanted a general and national view of the subject . The reason he assigns for not doing it is , that it would have been a repetition , but he has been less scrupulous on this point in respect to most other subjects . Let us now see what is the amount of the information we obtain from him . The education of youth , which is so essential to the well being of society , has always been a primary object in the United States . Since the year 1802 , especially , great additions have been made to the number of schools and academical institutions ; to the funds for supporting them , and to all the means for providing instruction , and disseminating information . In 1809 , the number of colleges had increased to twenty-five , that of academies to seventy - four . These institutions are incorporated by the legislature of each state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of boards of trustees . ' vol. iii . p. 453 . We are left equally ignorant of the state of literary and scientific knowledge in the country . On this subject the most we learn is , that there are some societies established for the advancement of learning and science , that the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia has published six volumes , and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences of Boston one , neither of which statements is correct ; that there are academies at New York and Philadelphia for the cultivation of the fine arts , and that a liberal spirit fosters these establishments , which is perhaps not more correct ; that we republish English works at less than a quarter of the original price , which we may well afford to do , as we have nothing to pay for the copy right , and print on such miserable paper . He mentions , however , two facts , which we were glad to observe , that Knickerbocker 's New York brought 3000 dollars , and Judge Marshall 's Life of Washington 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such rewards for literary labors , and our presses would have employment enough in printing original productions , and our own authors soon occupy a respectable portion of our libraries . We are not wanting in patronage to one sort of literary publication , to judge from Mr Warden 's account of our newspapers ; for of them he says there were five hundred in May 1817 , and 250,000 printed weekly . Nor are we wanting in talent for dramatic composition , if the number of our dramatic productions be a proof to the cQn // trary , of which a long list ( of most of which we never heard before ) is given in the work before us . As to manners , habits , and national character , we ought to be obliged to Mr Warden for the favorable representation he makes of us , and as we are so unaccustomed to see any thing of the kind , we can not but treat our readers with an extract . The people of the United States have not that uniform character , which belongs to ancient nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprinted a particular and individual character . ' The general physiognomy is as varied as its origin is different . Enolish , Irish , German , Scotch , French and Swiss , all retain something of the first stamp , which belongs to their andent country . A marked distinction , however , exists between the inhabitants of the maritime and commercial towns and those of the country . The former resemble the citizens of the great towns of Europe . They have all the luxury and vice of an advanced civilization2* Those of the country , who lead an agricultural life , enjoy all that happiness which is preserved from the exercise of the social virtues in their primitive purity . Their affections are constant ; felicity crowns the conjugal union ; respect for paternal authority is sacred ; infidelity on the part of the wife is almost unknown ; crime is rare ; mendicity and theft uncommon . ' vol. iii , p. 476 . Another description is given in the Introduction , which is more discriminating and philosophical , from which we extract a few passages . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without stopping to inquire in what this consists , we may observe , that according to the testimony of travellers , the aspect of society in the United States is distinguished by many striking particulars from that of Europe . Though the number of learned *and scientific characters is much smaller than in France and Britain , the mass of the population are better informed , than in either of the countries . They are not merely better educated , but they derive from their habits more practical sagacity and good sense . *2Placed often in situations where they have to work their way , and supply their wants without assistance from others , they are inventive , persevering , full of resources , not easily deterred by difficulties . The prejudices of birth and rank , which fetter industry in Europe , have little existence in America ; men change their profession as often as it suits their interest , and never deem any honcst occupation disreputable . Enjoying abundance and depending // on no man 's patrmage , they are free , open-hearted , mires erved and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own arm , they are manly , brave , high spirited , and enterprising . ' p. lxii . To show that our author has an agreeable variety in his style of writing and to present one more of the pictures he has drawn of our manners and customs , we shall conclude our extracts with his account of the metropolis . The inhabitants of the district of Columbia are social and hospitable . At Washington , respectable s*angers , after the slightest introduction , are invited to tea , balls , and evening parties . Tea parties have become very expensive , as not only tea , but coffee , negus , cakes , sweetmeats , iced creams , wines and liqours are often presented , and in a sultry summer evening , are found too palatable to be refused . In winter there is a succession of family balls , where *l this species of luxury is exhibited . Both sexes , whether on horseback , or on foot , wear an umbrella in all seasons ; in summer to keep off the sunbeams ; in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring and autumn , to intercept the dews of the evening . Persons of all ranks canter their horses , which movement fatigues the animal and has an ungraceful appearance . At dinner , and at tea parties the ladies sit together , and seldom mix with the gentlemen , whose conversation naturally turns upon political subjects . In almost all houses toddy is offered to guests a few minutes before dinner . Gentlemen wear the hat in a carriage with a lady as in England . Any particular attention to a lady is readily construed into an intention of marriage ! Boarders in boarding houses , or in taverns , sometimes throw off the coat during the heat of summer ; and in winter the shoes for the purpose of warming the feet at the fire ; customs , which the climate only can excuse . In summer , invitation to tea parties is made verbally by a servant , the same day the party is given ; in winter the invitation is more ceremonious . The barber arrives on horseback to perform the operation of shaving , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news and scandal . ' vol. iii , p , 218 . We can not say but these things may have been so when Mr Warden was at Washington , nor in what particular circle . he may have observed the practice of sitting without coat and shoes . A summary of the political and military history of the United States , since the year 1802 , and an account of the Indians residing within our territory conclude the work . We are not willing to leave it without a few remarks on its general character , lest our opinion of it should be misunderstood . // The author certainly deserves the thanks of every American for the diligence and fidelity with which he has collected ma-* terials for presenting a complete statistical view of the country . The distance , however , at which he was , when he made use of these materials , has occasioned many imperfections and errors , which would have been avoided if the book had been published here . It also presents itself under the disadvantage of having been printed in one country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the want of some person , acquainted with the subject to superintend the press , innumerable typographical errors are left uncorrected . It is also defective and confused in its system and arrangement , and awkward in the disposition of the subjects , many being brought into the same paragraph which have no connexion together ; and the style is neither dignified nor elegant , nor always English . With all these defects , however , it contains more information about the United States of America , than is to be found in any other work , and is very deserving of our attention . We think it might serve for the ground work of an excellent book on our country , leaving out the two volumes which describe the individual states , and bringing down the information it contains to the present time . The new census will furnish the necessary materials for a part of this work , and we hope some person will be found dis posed and able to perform it .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
