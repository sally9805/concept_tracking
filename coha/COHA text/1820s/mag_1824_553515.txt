txt ART . XI. -* Treatise on the Practice in the Supreme Court of A " ew York in Civil . iletions , together with the Proceeclings in Error . 2 vols . Svo. pp. 1231 . New York , 1821 , 1823 . THE first volume of this work has been some time in the hands of the professional public , and we now avail ourselves of the occasion furnished by the publication of the second volume , to bring it to the notice of our readers . // The object of the book is sufficiently explained by the title . As the practice of the state of New York in civil procedure is founded mainly on that of the English Court of Cofnmon law , Mr Dunlap has adopted the treatise of Mr Tidd on the Practice of the Court of King 's Bench and Vommon Pleas , so far as the subject matter of that work extends , as the basis of his own work ; has adapted it to the peculiar mode of proceeding in this country ; and engrafted upon it the materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions of that state , for the use of whose prac .. titioners it was principally intended . But he has , at the same time , resorted to the original authorities from which preceding compilers have drawn ; and , in respect to the important subject of real and mixed actions , has written an entire new treatise . It would be a gross mistake to suppose , that the work is confined to the subject of Practice , strictly so called . Many other heads of the law connected with this main subject have ' been touched upon ; and some of them thoroughly examined , and developed with an accuracy , precision , and extent of learning , which does great credit to the talents and attainments of the author . Even in those states of the Union , where the rules of English practice have been more widely departed from , than in the state of New York , it will be found extremely useful , as containing a great body of well digested information on the law of actions , and pleadings , and several analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of a more theoretical character , may not indeed convey any novel instruction to the experienced lawyer and practitioner ; though even this class of persons may find it convenient , as a methodical and well arranged compilation , containing all , or very nearly all , the authorities bearing on the particular title , and especially the decisions of our American tribunals ; saving them the labor of much research and investigation , and refreshing the memory oppressed with the grievous burden df dry technical rules , connected with each other only by slight analogies , and containing nothing similar to those original principles of justice and equity , on which the legal mind delights to fasten , and to trace through all their ramifications . But students , and young practitioners , may obtain from thesez parts of the work elementary knowledge of a very important // nature , and conveyed in a manner better accommodated to their use , than in any other work , which has appeared in England or in this country . By such , the whole book should be diligently studied . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we now more particularly refer , besides the merit of their execution , are expressly adapted to our own legal institutions ; and are not , like the English works on these branches of law , filled with matter wholly useless to th' American reader . in order to illustrate what we have said , respecting the general and diffusive utility of the work before us , it is necessary to make the following short analysis of its principal contents , passing over such parts as contain only the mere rules of practice , with their applications to the various incidents in the progress of a suit . The work commences with the theory and practice of personal actions , and pursues that subject exclusively , to the termination of the suit by judgment and execution . Thus , the First Chnpter treats Of the several personal dctions , and of the Time limited for the Commencement of them . It is divided into three sections . 1 . Personal Actions . 2 . Of the Parties to Personal Actions . These two sections may be regarded as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporating the leading decisions of our own Courts under their appropriate heads . 3 . On the Limitation of Actions , and contains a summary of the principal points on the interpretation of the statute of limitations , and on the analogous doctrine of the presumption of payment . The following chapters on the declaration , pleas , replication , and subsequent pleadings , and demurrer , embrace the main principles of the law of pleading , and leave little to be sought for from other sources of information . The chapter on the Trial and its Incidents contains also the leading points respecting bills of exceptions , dernurrers to evidence , nonsuits , verdicts , and special cases . The two chapters on Judgment and on Executia* contain , also , much useful elementary learning relative to fraudulent transfers of property , and the lien and priority of judgments and executions ; gaol liberties and escapes ; of discharges under the local insolvent laws , and the questions which have arisen respecting their validity under the constitution of the United States . Then follows a chapter on the // action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which , rendered it proper to treat of it distinct from other personal actions , ) in which the author has evidently been much assisted by a late English work , viz. . flrcltbold on the Practice of the Court of King 's Bench . This is succeeded by three chapters on the only species of Real . /lctions , which are still preserved in use in the state of New York . 1 . The Writ of Right . 2 . Dower . 3 . Partition . The two first of these chapters appear to be compiled principally from Serjeant Williams ' notes on Saunders ' Reports . The Reports of New York throw little light on those obscure subjects . But the practice under them is familiar in the Courts of this Commonwealth , in the western states , and in those of the Union whose practice is modelled on the local laws of the states , where these forms of action have been adopted and continued in use . These two chapters are concise , but they contain nearly everything , that can be material in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned author had gone further than he has attempted to proceed , he would perhaps have involved himself in speculations , which , though they might have been instructive and interesting to the general lawyer , might possibly have tended to mislead the student by confounding theory with practice . While speaking on the subject of Real Actions , we can not refrain from suggesting to the enlightened legislators of those states , which think proper still to retain them in use , the expediency of placing them on a more convenient and rational footing . Although the rude product of a comparatively barbarous age , and partaking very much oC the pecu* liarities of the feudal law , there are several species of those actions , whose extreme simplicity and precision admirably adapt them for the trial of cases involving the title to real property . Let the legislature of New York emulate the example set them by that of Massachusetts , and abolish some of the absurd and embarrassing proceedings in the writ of right , by substituting a trial by a common jury , for the ludicrous attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery of Electors , who were to be four lauful knights of your county , girt with swords , ' but for whom the legislature of New York has already had the // laudable courage to insert four good and lawful men of your county . ' Let them go on boldly in the plain path of sensible innovation , and establish a set of specific remedies , whether droitural or possessory actions , simple in their process and pleadings , telling the honest truth of the demandant 's case in language intelligible to all men , and proceeding directly to determine and adjudge conclusively the right of the parties to the possession or proprietary interest of the thing in controversy . That excrescence , the action of ejeetment , which has covered the whole law of real property with its parasitic growth , would then be restricted and confined to its original and appropriate office , the recovery of a term of years ; and . as the writ and declaration in all real actions must state the demandant 's title , the tenant or defendant would in every instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good pleading , in which , we are told , the symmetry of the common law consists , would he cherished and preserved . We may remark , also , that perhaps that part of the statute of New York for regulating trials upon writs of right , which requires the four good and lawful men , ' ( who were to represent the four good and lawful knights girt with swords , ' and who were to elect the grand assize , ) to be such as are duly qualified to vote for senators according to the constitution of this state , ' may have been rendered nugatory by the new constitution of 1821 , which abolishes the freehold qualification for electors of the Senate . This however we refer , together with the rest of the matter , to the able jurists of that state , humbly craving their pardon for having meddled with a subject , which may seem to be beyond the limits of our critical jurisdiction . To return to Mr Dunlap 's work . The chapter on the proceedings for compelling partition of lands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulating those proceedings . We are told , that the Supreme Court of the state has never carried into effect the intention of the law makers , which was to guard with a vigilant eye the interests of the parties , but has in part suffered the most material provisions of the statute to sleep , by allowing rules to be taken in partition without examination , and of course . The Court was bound to see , that every proceeding in the cause was regular , // in the first instance , and not to leave it open for discussion at a subsequent stage of the proceedings , or in a future action of ejectment . However , it would seem , that the statutory action of partition is in a great measure superseded by the more simple and expeditious remedy of a bill in equity , which applies , in every case , where the legal title does not come into discussion . There is a full chapter on the action of ejeetment , which is principally taken from the very valuable treatise of Adams , a writer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence necessary and pertinent to support the claims of the respective parties . It is obvious , that a work purporting to be a book of practice could not go very extensively into discussions of that nature ; still it contains many things , which the student will find extremely useful , especially as it refers to the most important American decisions . As writs of scire facias and error are applicable to actions of every description , they are reserved for the conclusion of the - work . Very full and complete Addenda and Corrigenda are given , containing the local statutes passed , and cases adjudged , whilst the work was going through the press , and such other matters as had been overlooked in its progress . We have spoken of drcItbold*s Practice . This is doubtless a very excellent work , and Mr Dunlap appears to have derived considerable assistance from it ; but as regards the state for whose use his work was designed , it has almost entirely superseded all other treatises on English practice . As to the sources from which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those we have already mentioned , they are principally the different constituent parts of the practice of New York . These are 1 . The statutes of the state , as the statutes of jeofails , for the amendment of the law , &amp;c. most of which are transcribed from the English statutes ; the text of which has generally been preserved , on account of its having received a settled judicial construction ; though it sometimes has been changed , perhaps not always for the better . // rules , which constitute a very essential part of the local system , and fix its form in a number of the most important particulars . The author has generally , and very properly , introduced the statutes and rules of court verbatim . / 3 . The decisions of the Court , as ascertained in the volu- ' minous Reports of Mr Johnson and others , which have reflected such a lustre on the jurisprudence of the state . It seems that a decision of the Supreme Court , whether in conformity or in opposition to the English practice , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities are wholly unnoticed in such cases . 4 . The practice of the Court of King 's Bench , as contained in its Reports , or in elementary treatises and compilations of established reputation . The Supreme Court of New York , as well as that of the United States , has said that it will follow the practice of the King 's Bench in all cases not provided for by statutes , or by its own rules . Of the English Reports , the most valuable and authoritative , on this subject , are those of the latter half of the last century . The author has , however , noticed the decisions of the King 's Bench down to the third volume of Barnwall and Alderson inclusive . 5 . The usage of the Court , as ascertained from observation and the information of skilful practitioners . This usage may have been founded on , or sanctioned by express decisions of the Court , at some period since it was first established in 1691 , but its present authority rests merely in tradition and universal acceptation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice those parts of the English practice , which have been altered or retrenched in the system of which he treats . Although we , who are accustomed to a more concise , direct , and simple course of proceedings , may think it still too complicated and unwieldy ; yet those who are familiarly acquainted with the English forms can not but be struck with the comparative brevity , neatness , and facility of those of New York and the other states , which have adopted a similar system ; advantages which have been obtained almost without any sacrifice of those great leading principles , which constitute the foundation of the common law practice and pleading . // The author has executed his laborious task with an accuracy and extent of learning , which support his well earned reputation as a lawyer , and we are well pleased to learn , that the work has been received in the most flattering manner by the bar for whose use it was principally intended . Nor , as we have before hinted , is its utility confined to that sphere . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will derive from it much valuable instruction , delivered with a luminous method , and in a clear and perspicuous style . We have been disappointed in not being able to obtain for insertion in our present number , a review of Mr Phillips 's work on the Law of Insurance . We regret this the more , as we understand the work is highly approved by the best judges , and is one with whose merits the professional public ought to be extensively acquainted . Hereafter we hope to render it suitable justice . A review of a Residence in Chili ' is necessarily postponed till the next number .
