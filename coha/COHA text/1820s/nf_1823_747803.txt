txt historical events have been of such interest to the world , as the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans , about forty years after the asronsion of our blessed Lord . This remark is true , if the event be contemplated simply as a piece of history . But when it is admitted that the event was a striking ful filment of denunciations of wrath uttered by Christ on his persecutors , and by ancient prophets on the same people ; also that it furnished a most brilliant type of the final destruction of Antichrist in the last d:iys ; it becomes far more interesting . This inter est must be felt at this period , when the great events of the last days connected with the restoration of the Hebrews , are in a train of incipient fulfilment . The signs of the times are important on this genera tion . For upwards of thirty years they have been assuming an aspect , with which the Christian world ought to feel deeply impressed ; and which will is sue in the battle of that great day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . The restoration of God 's ancient people is to be as " life from the dead " to the Gentile world . Sor.ie have queried whether they are literally to be res tored to Palestine . It hence becomes important to examine the prophetic scriptures upon this subject . This the writer has attempted to do ; and will exhi bit the result of his enquiries , in the following pges. /z/ To ascertain the present state of the Hebrews , must be a matter of interest : and especially the state of the ten tribes of Israel . This , in the following work is attempted . Also an explanation is given of an address from the prophet Isaiah to some Chris tian people , relative to the restoration of the ancient people of God ; and probably this people is Ameri ca . If it is ascertained that the ten tribes are to be restored with the Jews , in the last days ; they must be now in existence , and they must come to the knowledge of the Christian world about this time : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is believed they are coming to light with ample evidence . This musCdeeply interest the Christian part of the world . It would be strange if so great a section of Chris tendom as our United States , could claim no appro priate address in the prophetic writings . And it is thought to be capable of being shown , with a satis factory degree of evidence , that such an address is indeed found ; and one of great interest at this oay . The writer acknowledges himself to be affected with this part of the subject ; and he would rejoice to be the humble instrument of exciting a corres ponding feeling in the minds of his Christian breth ren . The land of promise was long a land of won ders . The Hebrew nation there was , for many centuries , the cradle of the true and only church of God on earth . There glorious things were wrought for her salvation . Patriarchs had there prayed , sacrificed and praised . There Prophets had prophesied ; find the Almighty had often made bare his holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been expelled from their Canaan ; and again mercifully restor ed . There the ten tribes of Israel had renounced the house of David , and their God ; and were hence banished to some unknown region of the world , to the present day ; while the Jews were still retained in the covenant of their God . Tlxve God , manifest in the flesh , made his appearar.ee on earth ; performed his public ministry ; atoned for the sins of the world ; and ascended to glory . There the first heralds of the ; dispensation commenced their ministry ; and thence the wonderful scheme of grace was prod through the nations . /z/ Jerusalem was the capital of this earthly Ca naan . Glorious things were spoken of this cjty of our God . " Beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , was this Mount Zion on the sides of the north , the city of the Great King . ' 7 This , for many centuries , might he called God 's Capital on earth . God said , alluding primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zion to be an habitation for himself . Here will I dwell , for I have desired it . " Here great things were done in divine faithfulness : which led the psalm ist to say ; " God is known in her palaces for a refuge . For lo , the Kings were assembled ; they passed by together . They saw it , and so they marvelled ; they were troubled , and so they hast ed away . " " The Lord of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge . " " In Salem stood his tabernacle ; and his dwelling place in Zion . There brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield and the sword of the battle . " This city ofjod long answered well to its name , Jeru , they shall see ; Salem , peace . Long did the church , while they walked with God , there see and enjoy peace . But alas , we find recorded of this city , temple , and nation of the Jews , a fatal reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled ; " The Lord is with you while ye be with Mm ; but if ye forsake him , he will cast you oiF . The Jews became carnal ; crucified the Lord f glory ; and they fell under the denunciations , and the full execution of his wrath . Their law giver Moses , and their prophets had long thunder ed against them , that when they should become of the character they finally assumed , the most tremendous judgments of God should cut them off . And the Messiah uttered against them , in consequence of their rejecting him , a new edition of these fatal denunciations , which we find in Matt. xxiv . Mark xiii . Luke xix. 41 44. chap , xxi. and xxiji. 27 30 ; to which the reader is re ferred . These were to have a primary fulfil ment in the desolation of Jerusalem , and of the Jewish commonwealth . This primary fulfil ment Christ assured should take place on that ge neration . And the denunciation was fulfilled . This fulfilment , inasmuch as it demonstrated the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of Antichrist , and of the wicked at the end of the world ; and shows the danger of rejecting the Son of God ; ought to be duly noted in the church , and frequently con templated . It is a subject too much neglected , and forgotten in the present Christian world . I design then , to give a concise description of the event , in which Jesus Christ came in awful judg ment upon the infidel Jews , and vindicated his cause against his persecutors and murderers . But some preliminary remarks will first be made . This noted city was built on two mountains ; and contained two parts , called the upper , and the lower city . The former was built on Mount Sion ; the latter on Mount Acra . The city is supposed to have been founded by Melchisedeck , and then called Salem , or Solyma . The war like Jebusites possessed it , when Israel entered Canaan . In the higher city they long defended them selves against%e Hebrews . Here they remain ed , till David subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . Herod the Great , when he repaired ( or rather rebuilded ) the temple , added vast strength arid embellishments to this city ; which accounts for /z/ its superb state and strength , when it was deMost of this city was surrounded with three wrpHs . In some places , where it was deemed in accessible , it b ' . ' lie . The wall , first built , was adorned and str-e ulhcned with sixty lowers . Fourteen tower- ; rested o'i the middle wall . The outside one ( most remarkable for its workman ship ) was secured with ninety towers . The tower Psephinos , was most celebrated . It was seventy cubits high ; had eight angles ; a iid commanded a most beautiful prospect . Here the visitor might ( in a clear atmosphere ) delight himself with a view of the Mediterranean , forty miles to the west ; and of most of the Jewish do minions . Some of these towers were nearly ninety cubits in height ; and famous for their beauty , elegance and curiosities . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast marble blocks . These huge piles gave to the city , in the view of the adjacent country , a most majestic appearance . Near the most lofty of these towers stood the royal palace , of the most commanding elegance . Incredible cost had furnished its pillars , porticoes , galleries , and apartments . Its gardens , groves , fountains , aqueducts , and walks , presented - the richest and most delightful scenery . This was the beauty and elegance of the north side of Jem* salem . On the east side stood the temple , and the fort of Antonio , over against Mount Olivet . This fort was built on a rock of fifty feet in height , and of inaccessible steepness , overlaid with slabs of marble . The castle of Antonio stood in the centre of this fortress . The workmanship of this castle made it more resemble a palace , than -a castle . A tower adorned each square of this fortress ; one of which was seventy cuhits high , and commanded a full view of the temple . The temple was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heheld . Its site was part ly on a solid rock , originally steep on every side . The lower temple had a foundation of vast di mensions , said to he three hundred cuhits from its lowest base . This foundation was composed of stones sixty feet in length ; and the lower part of the superstructure was composed of stones of solid white marble , more than sixty feet long ; and seven by nine feet in bigness . Four furlongs compassed the whole pile of build ing ; which was one hundred cubits high ; with one hundred and sixty pillars , to afford both sup port and ornament . In the front were spacious , and lofty galleries , with cedar wainscot , resting on uniform rows of white marble columns . Josephus asserts that nothing could exceed the exterior part of this house of God , for exquisite workmanship and gancc . Its solid plates of gold seemed to strive to out-dazzle the rising sun . The parts of the building not covered with gold , had , at a distance , the appearance of pillars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur of the in ternal workmanship of this magnificent dome , did not fail of being fully equal to its external magnificence . Nothing superb , costly , or ele gant was spared . The different parts of the world had seemed to vie with each other , to pour their most costly treasures into this wonderful trea sury of Heaven . The lower story was decorated with the sacred furniture , the table of shew bread , altar of incense , and the candlestick of pure Veiiten old . The altar and table were overlaid /z/ with pure gold . Several doors of the sanctuary were fifty-five cubits in height , and sixteen in breadth , overlaid also with gold . The richest Babylonian tapestry , of purple , blue and scarlet , , and of exquisite workmanship , waved within these doors . Golden vines , with leaves and clusters of grapes of gold , were suspended from the ceil ing live or six feet , of curious workmanship . The temple had a huge eastern gate of pure Corin thian brass , a metal in the highest esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foldings of golden doors in the chambers ; carved works , paintings and gildings ; vessels of gold ; scarlet , violet , and purple sacerdotal vestments ; and all the incalculable piles of riches , in this temple of Jehovah . The most precious stones , spices , and perfumes ; every thing that nature , art . or riches could furnish , were stored within those stupendous and hallowed walls . Here were the e ? /q/q/ , and temple to be destroyed , for the infidelity , malice , hypocrisy , and persecution of the Lord of glory , ( in himself , and his followers , ) which cha racterized its rulers and people . Here a measure of unprecedented atrociousness , was just filled up ; which should bring down wrath upon them to the uttermost . This tremendous ruin , our Lord foretold , and fulfilled . The last noted entrance into Jerusalem of Him , who was God manifest in the flesh , took place on the Monday before the scene of his sufferings . Amidst the acclamation of multitudes he was hail ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise . The air rang again with their praises , uttered for all the mighty works they had seen . They sang , Hosanna ! Blessed be the King that cometli in the name of the Lord ! Peace in hcav- /z/ en ; and glory in the highest . Our Lord ( supe rior to all their adulation , and knowing how soon the hosannas of some of them would turn to , " Crucify him ; " and being touched with sym pathy and pity for a devoted city , now going to till up their guilty measure of iniquity ) " beheld the c ' : j. mi ' ! wept over it . " He sad ; " If thou . nvn , even thou , in this thy day , the the ' : ' : ; to thy veace ! but now they six ; ' or the : : - i ; -. hall corne when i ; ch ; - ' , u ; t thee , and ce. ee in On rvery ii.e : a.ui sl-. ; i i , . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , .. , tiiey shall not leave thee one stone ' pan another ; because thou knewcst not tht time of thy visita tion . " Tue day but one alter , Christ went kto the temple for the last time , to instruct the peo ple . While he was thus employed , the hih priest , elders , Herodians , Sadducees , and Phari sees , gathered in turn around him , with a mali cious view , to entangle him in his talk . Christ returned such answers , spake such parables , and set home such reproof and conviction to their souls , as not only to astonish and silence them ; but to give them some awful prelibation of the fi nal judgment , which awaited them at his bar . He thus , in a most free and pungent address to the disciples , administered the most dignified and keen reproofs for the cruelty , hypocrisy and pride of the Scribes and Pharisees . He foretold the malicious treatment the disciples would meet with at their hands ; and then denounced the vengeance on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating . He fore warned that this cup of divine indignation should be poured on that generation . His tender feelings /z/ of soul then melted in a most moving apos trophe : u O Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them that arc gent unto thee ! How often would I have gather ed thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings ; and ye would not ! Behold , your house is left unto you deso late . For 1 say unto you , ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , " Blessed is lie that cometh in the name of the Lord . ' ' Upon this our Saviour left the temple . The disciples took an occasion to speak to Christ of the magnificence of the sacred edifice ; how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts . ' Blaster , ( said they , ) see what manner of stones and buildings are here . " " Jesus said unto them ; See ye not all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be left here one stone upon another , tha't shall not he thrown down . " How very unlikely must such an event have seemed ! But it was indeed fulfilled upon that generation . Jesus and his disciples retired to the mount of Olives . Here the temple rose before them in all its majestic elegance . The surrounding scenery naturally suggested the conversation which fol lowed . The disciples petitioned ; " Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ? " Their minds seem to have been impressed with the preceding discourse ; and they fell most readily upon the same subject , and wished to know when such awful events should come ; and what warnings should announce their approach . Our Lord replied : " Take heed that no man de ceive you ; for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and siiall deci-lv i ; As though he had ' said : This shall be one t /z/ token of the event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the destruc tion of Jerusalem ; and to a more general and dreadful fulfilment in the destruction of Antichrist in the last days . Impostors shall abound . False revisionists shall deceive and ruin many . This was fulfilled in relation to Jerusalem . Not long after Chri. - i/s ascension , the Samaritan Dositheus appeared and declared himself the Messiah predicted by Moses . Simon Magns also declar ed himself ; ' the Great power of God . " Soon af ter , another impostor appeared from the mongrel Samaritans . The church has ever been annoy ed by such kind of Samaritans , who have ever been fruitful in vile impostors , crying " Lo , here : and lo , there . ' ' This impostor promised to ex hibit to the people sacred utensils said to be cleported by Moses in Mount Gerazim . Here a new decision must be given from heaven , to the question between the Jews and Samaritans , as to the place of worship ; a thing of which schis matics have ever been exceedingly fond ; to de rive some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though decisions already given were insufficient , Armed multitudes sallied forth to follow this Messiah , confident their Great Deliverer had at last made his appearance . But Pilate , the Ro man governor , checked their fanaticism with the sword , and put their fancied Messiah to death . Another impostor , Theudas , arose . He had the address to persuade multitudes to follow him into the wilderness , under his promise that he would cause the river Jordan to divide . The Roman procurator , Fadus , with a troop of horse , pursued them ; slew the impostor , and many oth ers ; and dispersed the faction . Deceivers. , un- /z/ der ( be government of Felix , were multiplied , leading off people into the wilderness under the promise and fanatical expectation that they should there see signs and wonders . The old Serpent often leads fanatical people into wilder nesses of error and delusion , under similar ex pectations . The vigilant age of the Roman governor rested on these impostors , and was sure to frustrate their designs , as oft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notable Egyptian im postor , named Felix . Thirty thousand followed him , under the persuasion that from mount Oli vet they should see the walls of Jerusalem fall to the ground at his command , for their easy cap ture of the Roman garrison there ; and their tak ing possession of Jerusalem . They were attack ed by the Roman governor : four hundred were slain : and the rest dispersed . The Egyptian impostor escaped for his life . In the year GO , an other pretended Messiah appeared , engaging to break the Roman yoke , if they would follow him into the wilderness ; but the deceiver and his followers soon fell a sacrifice to the vigilance of Festus , the governor . It would he loo unwieldy to mention all the vile impostors of this peri od . They were a just retribution of righteous Heaven upon the Jews , for having rejected and put to death the true Messiah : and they fulfill ed the warning of our Lord , of a host of deceiv ers at that period . How prone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , ' I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not . if another should come in his own name , him will ye receive . ' This was fulfilled : and not only then , but in every age to this day . Those who give the best evangelical evidence of their being ambassadors of Christ , many will reject ; /z/ while the confident and noisy claims of egotists are by them fully allowed . " As in water face answers to face ; so the heart of man to man . " Oar Lord proceeds : " And ye shall hear of wars , and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things shall come to pass ; but the end is not yet . For nation shall rise against nation ; and kingdom against kingdom ; and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; all these are the beginning of sorrows . " The portentous thunders of wars and rumours of wars may be said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour , to the destruc tion of Jerusalem . The historic pages , which treat of these times , are stained with blood . A war between Herod and Aretas , king of Arabia , opened the bloody scene , after a short season of peace . In Selucia the Greeks and Syrians rose against the Jews , who fled thither from the pes tilence in Babylon , and slew 50,000 of them . Five years after , the Jews in Perea , and people of Philadelphia , contended about the limits of a city ; when many of the Jews were slain . Four years after this , an insult being offered to the Jews within the precincts of the temple , by a Roman soldier ; and being violently resented ; a Roman force rushed upon them ; which so terri fied the Jews , that they fled in vast disorder ; and 1 0,000 of them lost their lives in the streets . After another four years , the Jews ravaged the country of the Samaritans , in consequence of their having murdered a Galilean , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after , a contention arose between the Jews iu Cesarea and the Syrians , relative to the govern ment of Csar@a . In the first encouuter more /z/ than 20,000 Jews were slain . This contention raged in many cities where the Jews and Syrians dwelt ; and mutual slaughter prevailed . And in live other cities the carnage among the Jews waa dreadful . At Damascus 10,000 Jews were slain in one hour . And at Scythopdis 13,000 were nlain in one night . In Alexandria the Jews rose upon the Romans ; and had 50,000 of their peo ple slain , without any regard to infancy or age . Soon after , in a contention at Totapata , 40,000 Jovr- ; ) " ri ' s 'd . These contentions rose and in creased , till ihe whole Jewish nation took up arms against the Romans , and brought on thcm. - their linal destruction . Thus the predic tion of our Saviour quoted , received in those days a striking primary fulfilment . Our Saviour added : " And great earthquakes be in divers places , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NS. ; recorded by Tacitus ; one at Rome in ii of Claudius ; another at Apamea , in Syria , where were many Jews . So destructive : : : i one at the latter place , that the tribute he Romans , was for live years remitted , terrific at Crete ; one at Smyrna ; one ai ( Chios , and one at Samos ; ' laces Jews dwelt . These are no.i ! ji ? ( ratus . Soon after , in the reign of i'acitus and Eusebius inform , that d Colosse , as well as Lacdicea , were overthrown by earthquakes* Another is noted at Rome ; one at Campania ; and others tremendous are mentioned as taking place at Je ! cm in the night , just before the commencenu.iit of the last siege of that city . Of tlux ; Jo-* sephus gives the following account : " A 1 . storm bursi on them , during the niJit /z/ winds arose , with most excessive rains , with con stant lightning , most tremendous thunders , and dreadful roarings of earthquakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been confounded for the destruction of mankind . And one mudit well conjecture that these were signs of no com mon event . " The famines predicted by Christ were like wise fulfilled . The one foretold by Agabus , no ted in the Acts of the Apostles , was dreadful , and of long continuance . It extended through Greece and Italy : but was most severely felt at Judea , and especially at Jerusalem . The con tributions noted as brought by Paul from abroad , to relieve the poor brethren there , were sent during this sore famine . Authors of that time mention two other famines in the empire , previ ous to the one occasioned by the siege of Jerusa lem . " Pestilences " too , the Saviour adds . Two in stances of this signal judgment took place before the last Jewish war . The one took place at Babylon , where many Jews resided ; the other at Rome , which swept off vast multitudes . Oth er lighter instances of this calamity occurred , in various parts of the empire ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven . " Joseplms ( who can never be suspected of wishing to favour any prediction of Christ ; and who proba bly knew not of any such prediction , when he wrote , ) gives accounts of events , iwhich strikingly answer to this premonition . Speaking of the in fatuation of his countrymen , in running after im postors , while they neglected the plainest admo nitions from heaven ; he gives account of the seven following events : /z/ 1 . He says ; " On the 8th of the month Zanthicus , ( before the feast of unleavened bread , ) at the ninth hour of the night , there shone round about the altar , and the circumjacent buildings of the temple , a light equal to the brightness of the day ; which continued for the space of half an hour . " 2 . " About the sixth hour of the night , ( says Josephus , ) the eastern gate of the temple was found to open without human assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and heavy , as to require twenty men to close it . And Jose phus says , " it was secured by iron bolts and bars , that were let down into a large threshold consisting of one entire stone . " The Jews themselves con cluded , from the miraculous nature of this event , that the security of their temple had fled . When the procurator was informed of this event , he sent a band of men to close the door ; who with great difficulty executed their orders . 3 . Again , the same celebrated Jewish author says : " At a subsequent feast of Pentecost , while the pivsts were going by night into the inner tem ple , to perform their customary ministrations , they first felt ( as they said , ) a shaking , accom panied by an indistinct murmuring ; and after wards voices as of a multitude , saying in a dis tinct and earnest manner : " Let us depart hence . " How striking was this miraculous pre monition . It commenced with a shaking ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then was heard an indistinct murmur . This would make them listen with all possible heed . Then they heard the distinct voices , as of a mul titude in great earnestness and haste ; " Let m depart hence / " And their last f'ytal war with the Romans commenced before the next season for celebrating this feast . /z/ 4i Another sign was the following . The same author says : " A meteor , resembling a sword , hung over Jerusalem , during one whole year . " Tfris could not have been a comet , for it was stationary a whole year , and seems , from the words of Josephus , to have been much near er than a comet , and appeared to be appropria ted to that city . This reminds one of the sword of the destroying angel , stretched out over Jeru salem , I. Chro. 21 , xvi . This stationary posi tion of the sword for a year , was a lively indica tion that the impending ruin was fatal . 5 . Josephus says again : " As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sacrificed , she brought forth a lamb in the midst of the tem ple . " Most striking rebuke to those infidel priests who had rejected the Lamb of God , who had shed his blood once for all , and abrogated the Levitical sacrifices ; which yet they were impiously continuing . This wonder was exhib ited in the temple , the type of the body of Christ , and at the passover , when at a preceding passover Jesus was arrested and sacrificed ; and it took place before the high priests and their at tendants ; so that they could never complain fop want of evidence of the fact . 6 . This author says : " Soon after the feast of the passover , in various farts of the country , be fore the setting of the sun , chariots and armed men were seen in the air passing round about Jerusalem . " This strange sight occurring be fore sunset , and being seen in various parts of the country , must have been a miraculous por tent ; a sign from heaven . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we may see and believe . " Now they had their signs in abunj yet they would not believe . /z/ 7 . The last and most fearful sign Josephns re ? lates ; that one Jesus , son of Ananus , a rustic of the lower class , appeared in the temple at the feast of tabernacles , and suddenly exclaimed , " A voice from the east a voice from the west a voice from the four winds a voice against Jerusalem and the temple a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides a voice against the whole peo ple / " These words he continued to exclaim through the streets of Jerusalem by day and by night , with no cessation ( unless what was needed for the support of nature ) for seven years / He commenced in the year 63 , while the city was in peace and prosperity , and terminated his excla mations only in his death , amidst the horrors of the siege in the year 70 . This strange thing , when it commenced , soon excited great atten tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman governor , who interrogated him , but could obtain no answer except the continuation of his woes . He commanded him to be scourg ed , but to no effect . During times of festivals , this cry of his was peculiarly loud and urgent . After the commencement of the siege , he ascen ded the walls , and in a voice still more tremen dous than ever , he exclaimed , " Wo , wo to this city , this , temple , and this people / " And he then added , ( for the first time for the seven years , ) " Wo , wo to myself 7 " The words were no soon er uttered , than a stone from a Roman machine without the walls , struck him dead on the spot ! Such were the signs in the heavens and in the earth , which just preceded the destruction of Je rusalem . Several of them are recorded by Taoitus as well as by Josephus . The veracity of Josephus as a historian is probably allowed by all . Scaliger affirms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Greek and Roman histori ans put together . From the conquest of Jerusalem by Pornpey , sixty years before Christ , the Jews repeatedly had exhibited a most rebellious spirit against the Romans . The Jews had basely said to Pilate , concerning Christ , " If thou let this man go , thoa art not a friend to Caesar . " But the fact was , they persecuted Christ because he would not erect a temporal throne in opposition to Csesar . Any impostor who seemed prepared to do this , they were ready to follow ; and were ready to improve every apparent occasion to evince their decided hostility to the Romans . And they hardly needed a prophet 's eye to discern that this spirit and conduct ( manifested on all occa- would soon draw against them the Roman sword . Judas , a Caulonite , and Sadduc. a Pharisee , had rallied the Jews with the idea that their pay ing tribute to the Romans would not fail to con firm them in the most abject slavery ; in conse quence ef which , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots ' ; . - creased , arid Florus , the F.oaiaii governor of Ju- dea , by his crUel exactioi amorte the Jews . Eleazei s , increased this spirit , son of the high priest , persuaded the officers of the temple to reject the offerings of foreigners , and to withhold publick prayers for them . The Roman government felt the insult ; and a basis was soon found to be laid for a Roman war ! Feuds and contentions in creased in Judea , till Cestius Callus marched an army thither from Syria to restore order . His march was iarke ' - with blood arid desolation . The city of ZebuTon , Joppa . and other villages in his way , he plundered and burned . Eiht /z/ thousand four hundred of the inhabitants of the former place , he slew . The district of Narbatene he laid waste , and slew two thousand of the Jews in Galilee ; reduced the city of Lydda to ashes , and drove the Jews , ( who made desperate sallies upon him ) till he encamped within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enter ed Jerusalem , and burned some part of the city . But through the treachery of his own officers , he made an unexpected flight . The enraged Jewt pursued him , and slew about sixty thousand of his men . Many of the rich Jews , alarmed at the Roman invasion , fled from Jerusalem , as from a foundering ship . Some suppose many of the Christians now fled to a place called Fella in the mountains of Judea . Nero being informed of the defeat of Cestius , gave the command to Vespasian to press the war a. ainil the rebellious Jews . lie and his son Titus soon collected an army of sixty thousand men . In A. D. 67 , he marched from Ptolemais to Judea , marking hi* steps with ravages and desolation . Ink r 3 tnd age fell before the fu rious soldiery . A1 the strong towns of Galilee , and many of those of Judea fell before the vic torious arms of Vespasian , who slew not les than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants . Signal vengeance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after it had been by Cestius reduced to ashes . Vespasian was enra ged at the frequent piracies of this people . The Jews of this place fleeing before him , betook themselves to their shipping . But a furious tempest overtook those who stood out to sea , who were lost . The others were dashed vessel against vessel , or against the rocks . Some in their distress laid violent hands on themselves . /z/ Such as reached the shore were slain by the en raged Romans . The sea for some distance was stained with their blood : four thousand two hun dred were strewed along their coasts , and not one- escaped to relate their catastrophe . Truly this was " distress of their nation , with the sea and the waves thereof roaring ! " Vespasian returned from Jericho to Caesarea , to prepare for a grand siege of Jerusalem . Here he received intelligence of the death of the em peror Nero . This led him to suspend for the present , the execution of his plan against the Jews . This respite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but encouraged them to deeds of greater enormity . A spirit of faction now appeared in Jerusalem . Two parties first , and afterwards three , raged there ; each contending with deadly animosity for the precedency . A part of one of these fac tions having been excluded from the city , enter ed it by force during the night ; and to such mad ness were they abandoned , that they butchered ( on that fatal night ) not less than eight thousand h 've hundred of men , women and children , whose mangled bodies appeared the next morning strewed in the streets of Jerusalem . These abandoned murderers plundered in the city ; murdered the high priests , Ananus and Jesus , and insulted their dead bodies . They slew their brethren of Jerusalem , as though they had been wild animals . The 7 scourged and imprisoned the nobles , in hopes to terrify them to become of their party ; and many who could not be thus won , they slew . In this reign of terror , twelve thou sand of the higher orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared to shed a mourning tear , lest this should bring on him a similar fate . /z/ Accusation and death became the most common events . Mciny fled , who were intercepted and slain . Piles of their carr-es Inv on publick roads ; and all pity , as v , v ! l : i. - iv ; . - ; rd i'or human or divine authority , seemed extinguished . To add to the horrid calami Lies of the times , occasioned by the bloody factions , Judea was in fested by bands of robbers and murderers , plun dering their towns and cutting in pieces such as made any resistance , whether men , women or children . Here were exhibited thi ; most horrid pictures of what fallen man is capable of perpe trating when restraints are taken olf ; that they would turn their own . towns and societies into scenes of horror , like kenncJs of mad animals . One Simon became cemmandcr of one of the/ e factions ; John of another . Simon entered Je rusalem at the head of forty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witli terrifick fury . The three factions were intoxicated with rage and desperation , who went on slaying and trampling on piles of . the dead , with an in describable fury . People coining to the temple to worship , were murdered , both natives and for eigners . Their bodies lay in piles , and a collec tion of blood defiled the sacred courts . John of Gischala. heaJ of a faction , burned a store of provisions . Sisron , at the head of an other faction , burned another . Thus the . lows were wen ' destroying themselves , u : d preparing the way for " wrath to come upon them to the uttermost . " In the midst of these most dismal events , an alarm was made that a Roman army was ap proaching the city ! Vespasian becoming empe ror , and learning the factious and horrid state of the Jews , determined to proseeule th ; * . war asa hist them , and sent his son Thus to reduce Jerusalem and Judea . The Jews , on hearing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could have no hope of peace . They had no means of flight . They had no time for counsel . They had no confidence in each other . What could he done ? Several things they possessed in abundance . They had a meas ure of iniquity filled up ; a full ripeness for des truction . All seemed wild disorder and despair . Nothing could he imagined but " the confused noise of the warrior , and garments rolled in blood . " They knew nothing was their due from the Romans , but exemplary vengeance . The ceaseless cry of combatants , and the horrors of faction , had induced some to desire the interven tion of a foreign foe , to give them deliverance from their domestick horrors . Such was the state of Jerusalem when Titus appeared before it with a besieging army . But he came not to de liver it from its excruciating tortures ; but to ex ecute upon it divine vengeance ; to fulfil the fa tal predictions of our Lord Jesus Christ , that " when ye see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Jerusa lem compassed about with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh . ' ' " Where soever the carcass is , there shall the eagles be gathered together . " Jerusalem was now the carcass to be devoured ; the Roman eagles had arrived to tear it as their prey . The day on which Titus had encompassed Jerusalem , was the feast of the passover . Here let it be remembered , that it was the time of this feast , ( en a preceding occasion ) that Christ was taken , condemned and executed . It was at the time of this feast , that the heifer in the hands of /z/ the sacrificing priests , brought forth a lamb . And just after this feast at another time , that the mirac ulous besieging armies were seen over Jerusalem , just before sunset . And now at the time of the passover , the antitype of this prodigy appears in the besieging army of Titus . Multitudes of Jews had convened at Jerusalem from surround ing nations to celebrate this feast . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the paschal lamb ; but really to their own linal slaugh ter , for rejecting " the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world ! " The Jews had imprecated the blood of the true Paschal Lamb , ( by them wantonly shed ) on themselves and on their children . God was now going in a signal manner to take them at their word . He hence providentially collected their nation , under sen tence of death , as into a great prison , for the day of execution . And as their execution of Christ was signal , low , degrading , the death of the cross ; so their execution should be signal and dreadful . The foiling city was now crowded with little short of two millions of that devoted people . The event came suddenly and unex pectedly to the Jews , as the coming of a thief , and almost like lightning . Josephus notes this ; and thus without design , shows the fulfilment of these hints of Christ , that his coming should be like a thief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole heavens . The furious contending factions of the Jews , on finding themselves environed with the Ro man armies , laid aside ( for the moment ) their party contentions , sallied out , rushed furiously on their common foe , and came near utterly de stroying the tenth legion of the Roman army . This panic among the Romans , occasioned a /z/ short suspension of hostilities . Some new confidence hence inspired , the hopes of the Jews ; arid they now determined to defend their city . But being a little released from their terrors of the Romans , their factious resentments again re kindled , and broke out in great fury . The fac tion under Eleazer was swallowed up in the oth er two , under John and Simon . Slaughter , con flagration and plunder ensued . A portion of the centre of the city was burned , and the in habitants became as prisoners to the two furious parties . The Romans here saw their own pro verb verified : " Quos Deus vult perdere priiis elemental . " " Whom God will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The invading armies knew how to profit by the madness of the Jews . They were soon found by the Jews to have possession of the two outer walls of their city : this alarm reached the heart of the factions , and once more united them against the common enemy . But they had al ready proceeded too far to retreat from the ef fects of their madness . Famine , with its ghast ly horrors , stared them in the face . It had ( as might be expected ) been making a silent ap proach ; and some of the more obscure had al ready fallen before it . But even this did not annihilate the fury of faction , which again re turned with redoubled fury , and presented new scenes of wo . As the famine increased , the suf ferers would snatch bread from each other 's mouths , and devour their grain unprepared . To discover handfuls of food , tortures wcie inflicted . Food was violently taken by husbands from wives , and wives from husbands ; and even by mothers from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famishing suckling , as our Lord denounced : " Wo to them that give j-uck in those days . " This terror produced a new scene of righteous retribution . Multitudes of the Jews were forc ed by hunger to flee to the enemy 's camp . Here instead of pitying and relieving them , the Ro mans cut off the hands of many , and sent them hack ; but most of them they crucified as fast as they could lay their hands on them ; till wood was wanting for crosses , and space on which to erect them ! Behold here thousands of those des pairing Jews suspended on crosses round the walls of Jerusalem ! Verily ' " the Lord is known by the judgments that he executeth ! " Yea , this did not suffice . Behold two thousand Jews , bad fled to the mercy of their invaders , rip ped open alive ( two thousand in one night ! ) by Arabs and S v ' aiis in the Roman armies , in hopes " " * . . * +l* ae #@# T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cv . wsnaa ortneir enemies fancied they had ) swallowed to carry off with them ! Titus being a merciful general , was touched to the heart at the miseries of the Jews ; and in person he tenderly entreated the besieged to surrender . But all the answer he obtained for u-.mierncss was base revilings . He now reoivt:d to make thorough work with this obstin ate people ; and hence surrounded the city with a. circunrvailation of 39 furlongs in length , strengthened with thirteen towers . This , by the astonishing activity of the soldiers , was effected in three days . Then was fulfilled this prediction of our blessed Lord : " Thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and keep thce in on every side . " As the city was now cut off from all possible gup plies , famine became more dreadful . Whole /z/ families fell a sacrifice to it ; and the dead bodies of women , children , and the aged , were seen covering roofs of houses , and various recesses . Youth and the middle aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in publick pla ces . The dead became too numerous to be in terred . Many died while attempting to perform this office . So great and awful became the ca lamities , that lamentation ceased ; and an awful silence of despair overwhelmed the city . But all this failed of restraining the more abandoned from most horrid deeds . They took this oppor tunity to rob the tombs ; and with loud infernal laughter , to strip the dead of their habiliments of death ; and would try the edge of their swords on dead bodies ; and on some while yet breath ing . Simon Georas now vented his rage against Matthias , the high priest , and his three sons . He caused them to be condemned , as though fa vouring the Romans . The father asked the fa vour to be first executed ; and not sec the death of his sons ; but the malicious Simon reserved him for the last execution . And as he was ex piring he put the insulting question , whether the Romans could now relieve him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ es caped to Titus , and informed him of the consum mate wretchedness of the Jews : that in less than three months one hundred and fifteen thou sand and eight hundred dead bodies of Jews had been conveyed through one gate , under his care and register ; and he assured him of the ravages of famine and death . Other deserters confirmed the account , and added , that not less than sixhundred thousand dead bodies of Jews had been carried out at different gates . The humane heart of Titus was deeply affected ; who , under /z/ those accounts , and while surveying the piles of dead bodies of Jews under the walls , and in the visible parts of the city , raised his eyes and hands to heaven in solemn protestation , that he would have prevented these dire calamities ; that the obstinate Jews had procured them upon their own heads . Josephus , the Jew , now earnestly entreated the leader John and his brethren to surrender to the Romans , and thus save the residue of the Jews . But he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de claring his firm persuasion that God would never suffer his own city , Jerusalem , to be taken by the enemy ! Alas , had he forgotten the history of his own nation , and the denunciations of " the prophets ? Micah had foretold that in this very calamity they would presumptuously " lean upon the Lord , and say , Is not the Lord among us ? No evil shall come upon us . " So blind and presumptuous are hypocrisy and self-confidence ! " The temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , are these . " The famine in the city became ( as might be expected ) still more deadly . For want of food the Jews ate their belts , sandals , skins of their shields , dried grass , and even ordure of cattle . JVbav it was that a noble Jewess , urged by the in sufferable pangs of hunger , slew and prepared for food her own infant child ! She had eaten half the horrible preparation , when the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with instant death , if she did not produce to them the food she had in possession . She being thus compelled to obey , produced the remaining half of her child ! The soldiers stood aghast , : the recital petrified the hearers with horror : /z/ and congratulations were poured on those whose eyes death had closed upon such horrid scenes . Humanity seems ready to sink at the recital of the woful events of that day . No words can reach the horrors of the situation of the female part of the community at that period . Such scenes force upon our recollection the tender pathetic address of our Saviour to the pious fe males , who followed him , going to the cross : " Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me ; but weep for yourselves and for your children ; for behold the days are coming , in which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the breasts that never gave suck . " Moses had long predicted this very scene . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , ) who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness ; her eye shall be evil towards her young one , and toward her children , which she shall bear ; for she shall eat them , for want of all things secret ly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine en emy shall distress thee in thy gates . " Probably the history of the world will not afford a paral lel to this . God prepared peculiar judgments for peculiarly horrid crimes ! " These be the days of vengeance ; that all things that are writ ten may be fullillcd . ' ' Josephus declares , that if there had not been many credible witnesses of that awful fact , he never would have recorded it ; for , said he , " such a shocking violation of nature never has been perpetrated by any Greek or barbarian . " While famine thus spread desolation , the Ro mans finally succeeded in removing part of the inner wall , and in possessing themselves of the high and commanding tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Titus with his council of war had formed a determination to save the temple , to grace his conquest , and re main an ornament to his empire . But God had not so determined . And " though there he ma ny devices in a man 's heart ; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand . " A Ro man soldier violating the general order of Titus , succeeded in hurling a brand of fire into the golden window of the temple ; and soon ( as righteous Heaven would have it ! ) the sacred edifice was in flames . The Jews perceiving this , rushed with horrid outcries to extinguish the fire . Titus too , flew to the spot in his char iot , with his chief officers and legions . With loud command , and every token of anxiety , he enforced the extinguishing of the fire ; but in vain . So great was the confusion , that no atten tion was paid to him . His soldiers , deaf to all cries , assiduously spread the flames far and wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword in hand , slaying and trampling down , or crushing them to death against the walls . Many were plunged into the flames , and perished in the bur ning of the temple . The fury of the Roman soldiers slaughtered the poor , the unarmed , and the rich , as well as men in arms . Multitudes of dead bodies were piled round about the altar , to which they had fled for protection . The way leading to the inner court was deluged with blood . Titus finding the fire had not yet reached the inner temple , entered it with his superior offi cers , and surveyed its magnificence with silent admiration . He found it to exceed all lie had heard . This view led him to renew his efforts to save this itupcridous pile of building , though so many of the out-buildings were gone . Ifc even entreated his soldiers to extinguish the flames , and appointed an officer to punish any who should disobey . But all his renewed ef forts were still in vain . The feelings of his sol diery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter had combined to render them deaf and most furious . A soldier succeed ed in firing the door posts of the inner temple , and the conflagration soon became general . One needs almost a heart of steel to contem plate the scenes which followed . The trium phant Roman soldiers were in a most ungovern able rage and fury . They were indeed instru ments prepared for their work , to execute the most signal vengeance of Heaven ; the flame of which was now reaching its height ! The Roi : : : ; : : : - : 1 " . V ' jfliro Jevs ail before them ; sparing neither age , sex or rank . They seemed deter mined to annihilate the Jewish race on the spot . Priests and common people ; those who surren dered , and those who still fought ; all were alike subjects of an indiscriminate slaughter . The fire of the temple at length completely envelop ed the stupendous pile of building . The fury of the flames exceeded description . It impressed on distant spectators an idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tu mult , Josephus pronounces , to have been such as to baffle description . The outcry of the Ro man legions was as great as they could make . And the Jews finding themselves a prey to the fury of both fire and sword , exerted themselves in the wildest accents of screaming . The peo ple in the city , and those on the hill , mutually responded to each other in groans and screeches . People who had seemed just expiring through /z/ famine , derived new strength from unprecedent ed scenes of horror and death , to deplore their wretchedness . From mountain to mountain , and from places distant , lamentations echoed to each other . As the temple was sinking under the fury of the raging element , the mount on which it stood seemed in that part of it , ( says the historian ) to impress the idea of a lake of liquid fire ! The blood of the slain ran in rivulets . The earth around became covered with the slain ; and the victorious Romans trampled over those piles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeing from the points of their swords . In a word , the roar and crackling of fire ; the shrieks of thousands in despair ; the dying groans of ili- ) isands , and the sights which met the eye wherever it was turned , were such as never be fore had any parallel on earth . They probably as much exceeded all antecedent scenes of hor ror ; as the guilt which occasioned them , in their treatment of the Lord of Glory , exceeded all guilt ever before known among men . A tragical event had transpired worthy of par ticular detail . Before the temple was wrapped in ilamos , an impostor appeared among the Jews , asserting a divine commission ; and that if the people would follow him to the temple , they would see signs , wonders and deliverance . About six : thousand ( mostly women and children ) fol lowed him , and were in the galleries of the tem ple , wailing for this promised deliverance , when fire wis set to tint building . Not one escaped . All wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes are by false prophets plunged in eternal ( ire ! /z/ The place of the temple now presented a vat pile of ruins . Here terminated the glory and existence of this stupendous building , this type of the body of Christ , and of his church ; this type of the Millenium , and of heaven . Here it reached its close , after the period of one thou sand and thirty years , from the time of its dedi cation by Solomon ; and of six hundred and thir ty-nine years , from its being rebuilt in the days of Haggai , after the seventy years captivity . It is singular , that it should be reduced to ashes not only soon after the feast of the passover t which convened so many thousands of Jews to Jerusalem to meet the ruins of their city and na tion ; but that it should be consumed on the same month , and same day of the month , on which the Babylonians had before destroyed it by fire . Josephus records another strking event , which seemed a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the Jews who survived this ruin ) " The fountains flow copiously for Titus , which to you were dried up . For before he came , you know that both Siloam , and all the springs without the city , foiled ; so that water was brought by the amphora , ( a vessel . ) But now they are so abundant to your enemies , as to suffice for themselves and their cattle . This wonder you also formerly experienced , when the king of fiabylon laid siege to your city . " The priests of the temple , after the destruc tion of their sacred edifice , betook themselves ( those who had thus far escaped the general slaughter ) to the top of one of its broken walls , where they set mourning and famishing . On the fifth day necessity compelled them to descend , tnd humbly to ask pardon of the Roman general* 3o But Titus at this late period rejected their peti tion , trying ; " As the temple , for the sake of which 1 would have q-ared you , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . " All were put to death . The obstinate leaders of the great Jewish fac tions , beholding now the desperateness of their cause , desired a conference with Titus . One would imagine they would at least now lay down their arms . Their desiring an interview with the triumphant Roman general , appeared as though they would be glad to do this . But right eous Heaven designed their still greater destruc tion . Titus after all their rnad rebellions , kind ly offered to spare the residue of the Jew. - , if they would now submit . But strange to relate , they refused to comply . The noble general then , as must have been expected , was highly exasperated ; and issued his general order , that he would grant no further pardon to the insur gents . His legions now were ordered to " rav'ind destroy , " With the light of the next ling , arose the tremendous ilame of the cas tle of Antonio , the council chamber , register 's office , and the noble palace of the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The furious legions , ( executioners of divine ven geance , Ezek. ix . 5 , 6 ) . then flew through the lower city , of which they soon became masters , slaughtering and burning in every street . The Jews themselves aided the slaughter . t the royal palace , containing vast treasures , ei-iht thousand four hundred Jews were muidercci by their seditious brethren . Great numbers of de serters from the furious leaders of faction , flock ed to the Romans : but it was too late . The general order was given , all should be slain . Such therefore fell . /z/ The Roman soldiers , however , being at length weary with butchery , and more than satisried with blood , fora short time sheathed their swords , and betook themselves to plunder . They col lected multitudes of Jews , husbands , wives , children , and servants ; formed a market ; and set them up at vendue for slaves . They sold them for any trifle ; while purchasers were but few . Their law-giver , Moses , had forewarned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be sold for bond men , and bond women ; and no man shall buy you . " Tremendous indeed must the lot of those be , who reject the Messiah , and are found fignting against the Son of God . Of ten had these Jews heard read ( but little it seerns did they understand the senseof the tremendous passage ) relativ o to the Jewish rejectors of C ! , i'ist , " He that sitteth in the Heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall have them in derision . Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure . Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion . Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter 's vessel . " " Thus saith the Lord , say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished : it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter ; ( said God by the prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword is sharpen ed , and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer .

I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their hearts may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah , it is made bright ! it is wrap ped up for the slaughter . " Such , and much /z/ more , were the divine denunciations of this very scene , which the infidel Jews would not escape , but would incur ! And even a merciful God shrunk not from the execution ! Let antichristian powers , yea let all intidels and gospel despisers , consider this and tremble ! The whole lower city , now in the possession of the Roman legions , ( after the respite noted , ) was set on lire . But the insolence of the devo ted Jews in a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperated their enemies , as though afraid the work of ven geance might not be sufficiently executed . The Romans brought their engines to operate upon the walls of this higher branch of the city , still standing ; which soon gave way before them . Before their demolition , Titus reconnoitred the city , and its fortifications ; and expressed his as tonishment that it should ever fall before his arms . He exclaimed , " Had not God himself aided our operations , and driven the Jews from their fortresses ; it would have been absolutely impossible to have taken them . For what could men and the force of engines have done against such towers as these ? " Yes , unless their Rock had sold them for their iniquities , no enemy could have prevailed against Jerusalem . Jose* phus , who was an eye witness of all the scene , says ; " All the calamities , which ever bcfel any nation , since the beginning of the world , were in ferior to the miseries of the Jews at this awful period . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman conquerors . Titus would have spared all , who had not been forward in ' ing the Romans ; and gave his orders ac- ugjy . But his soldiers , callous to ail the /z/ feelings of humanity , slaughtered the aged anft sick , as well as the mass of the people . The tall and most beautiful young men , however , were spared hy Titus to grace his triumph at Rome . Of the rest , many above the age of seventeen , were sent in chains to Egypt , to be disposed of as slaves . Some were reserved to be sacrificed on their amphitheatres , as gladiators ; to be slain in sham tights , for the sport of their conquerors . Others were distributed through the empire . All who survived , under the age of seventeen , were exposed for sale . The triumphant general commanded what re mained of the city , to be razed to its foundation , except three of the most stately towers , Mariamne , Hippocos , and Phasael . These should stand as monuments of the magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of the wall of the city at the west also , he commanded should be spared , as a rampart for his garrison . The oth er parts of the city he wished to have so effec tually erased , as never to be recognized to have been inhabited . The Talmud and Mamonides relate , that the foundations of the temple were so removed , that the site of it was ploughed by Terentius Rufus . Thus our Saviour predicted , that " there should not be left one stone upon another . " One awful occurrence is noted , as transpiring during these scenes ; that eleven thousand Jews , under the guard of one Fronto , a Roman gener al , were ( owing to their own obstinacy , and to the scarcity of provisions ) literally starved to death ! Josephus informs that eleven hundred thou sand Jews perished in this siege of Jerusalem ; that two hundred and thirty-seven thousand per- /z/ ished in that last war in other sieges and battles : besides multitudes who perished by famine and pestilence : making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thou sands , in sullen despair , laid violent hands on themselves . About ninety-seven thousand were captured , and dispersed . Relative to the two great leaders of the Jewish factions , Simon and John ; they were led to Rome , to grace the tri umph of Titus ; after which Simon was scourg ed and executed as a malefactor ; and John was committed for life to dungeon . Thus ended their violent factious contentions . The Roman army , before they left Jerusalem , not only demolished the buildings there , but even dug up their foundations . How fatal was the divine judgment on this devoted city . Five months before it was the wonder of the world ; and contained , at the commencement of the siege , more than a million and a half of Jews , natives and visiters ; now* it lay in total ruins , with not " one stone upon- another ; " as Christ had denounced , These ruins Eusebius informs us he beheld . And Eleazer is infestgluced by Josephus as exclaiming ; " Where is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabited . " The prophet Micah had predicted ; " Therefore shall Zion for your sakes be ploughed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the moun tain of the Lord 's house as the high places of the forest . " A captain of the army of Titus , did in fact plough where some part of the foundation of the temple had stood , as the Talmud records , and thus fulfilled this prediction . Jesus Christ had foretold of this destruction , that " there should be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world . " And /z/ of the event Josephus says ; " If the misfortunes of all nations from the beginning of the world , were compared with those which befel the JCWF , they would appear far less . " Again ; " No oili er city ever suffered such things ; as no other generation from the beginning of the world , was ever more fruitful in wickedness . " Other parts of Judea were still to be subdued . Macherus was attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand fugitives taken in the woods of Jardes . Titus at Caesarea celebrated in great splendour the birth day of his brother Domitian . Here a horrid scene , according to the bloody customs of those times , was presented . To grace this oc casion , more than two thousand five hundred Jews fell ; some by burning ; some by fighting with wild beasts ; and some by mutual combat with the sword . Massada was besieged . The Jewish com mander , in despair , induced the garrison first to destroy their stores , and then themselves . They ( nine hundred and sixty in number ) consented to the horrid proposal . Men , women , and chil dren took their seats upon the ground , and offer ed their necks to the sword . Ten men were selected to execute the fatal deed . The dread ful work was done . One of the ten was then chosen to execute the nine , and then himself . The nine being put to death , and fire being set to the place , the last man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , ( women and children , ) found means to conceal themselves , and escape the ruin . When the Romans approached , these seven related to them these horrid events . /z/ Most of the remaining places now , through sullca despair , gave up all opposition , and sub mitted to the conquerors . Thus Judea became as a desolate wilderness ; and the following pas sage in Isaiah had at least a primary accomplish ment : " Until the cities be wasted without in habitant ; and the houses without man ; and the land be utterly desolate ; and the Lord have re moved man far away , and there be a great for saking in the midst of the land . " A line of prophecies is found in the sacred or acles , which relate to a signal temporal destruc tion of the most notorious enemies of the king dom of Jesus Christ . Those were to have a two-fold accomplishment ; first upon the Jews ; and secondly upon the great Antichrist of the last days , typified by the infidel Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in close connexion with the Milleni um . The predictions of our Saviour , in Matt , xxiv . Mark xiii . and Luke xxi. are but a new edition of these sacred prophecies . This has been noted , as " the destruction of the city and temple foretold . " It is so indeed ; and more . It is also a denunciation of the destruction of the great Antichrist of the last days . The certainty of this will appear in the following things . New Testament writers decide it . The Thessalonians , having heard what our Lord denounced , that all those things he had predicted should take place on that generation ; were trembling with the apprehension , that the coming of Christ pre dicted , would then very soon burst upon the world . Paul writes to them , ( 2 Thes. ii. ) and beseeches them by this coming of Christ , not to be shaken in mind , or troubled with such an ap prehension . For that day , ( that predicted conr*- /z/ ing of Christ , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place on that generation . It was not to come till the Antichnstjan aposta sy come first ; that man of sin was first to be ro vealed . This long apostasy was to be accomplish ed , before the noted coming of Christ in its more important sense be fulfilled . After the Roman government , which hindered the rise of the man of sin , should be taken out of the way , Paul says , " Then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and destroy with the brightness of his comingS " * Here then is the predicted coming of Christ , in its more interesting sense , in the bat tle of that great day , which introduces the Mil lenium . Here is a full decision that these noted denunciations of Christ alluded more especially ( though not primarily ) to a coming which is still future . The same is decided by Christ himself , in Rev. xvi . After the sixth vial , in the drying up of the Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go forth to the kings of the earth , and of all the world , to gather them to the great battle . The awful account is interrupted by this notice from the mouth of Christ ; verse 15 , " Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments ; lest he walk naked , and they see his shame . " This is as though our Lord should say ; now the time is at hand , to which my predictions of coming as a thief , principally alluded . Now is the time when my people on earth shall need to watch , as I di-* rected , when predicting my coming to destroy first the type of Antiekrist , and secondly the an ? titype. /z/ The predictions in the prophets , which re ceived an incipient fulfilment in the destruction of Jerusalem , were to receive a more interesting fulfilment in Christ 's coming to destroy his antichristian foes . Hence it is that the seventh vial is called ( Rev. xvi . 14. ) " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " clearly alluding to that great day noted through the prophets . And of the same event it is said , Rev. x. 7 ; " the mysk'rr of God shall he finished , as he hath declared to his servants , the prophets . Here again the all-.ision clearly is to the many predictions in the prophets of the destruction of the enemies of Christ 's kingdom , which were to receive an in cipient fulfilment in the destruction of Jerusa lem ; and a far more interesting one . in the sweeping from the earth the last antichristian powers , to introduce the millennial kingdom of Christ . We accordingly find those predictions through the prophets clearly alluding to the last days , and the introduction of the Millenium . Viewing the destruction of Jerusalem then , as hut a type of an event now pending upon antiChristian nations , we peruse it with new inter est ; and it must be viewed in the light of a most impressive warning to this age of the world . The factions , madness , and self-ruin of the for mer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions of the latter . Three great and noted factions intrbduced the destruc tion of Jerusalem . And of the destruction of An tichrist we read ( perhaps alluding to that very circumstance ) Rev. xvi . 19 ; " And the great city was divided into three parts . " Then it fol lows ; " and the cities of the nations fell ; and great Babylon came in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierce- j /z/ ness of his wrath . " In the desolation of Gog and his bands , faction draws the sword of exter mination . " I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord God ; every man 's sword shall be against his brother . " Ezek. xxxviii. 21 . The great coalition against the Jews , in the time of Jehoshaphat , was destroyed by the sword of mutiny and faction : See 2 Chro. xx . And in allusion to this very battle which God fought for his church , the vast coalitions of Antichrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored , is said to be gathered " to the valley of Jehosha phat : " See Joel iii . The various circumstan ces of the destruction of Jerusalem , afford a live ly comment on the many denunciations of the battle of that great day of God Almighty , which awaits the antichristian world ; w r hile it is fully evident , that they more especially allude to the tremendous scenes of judgment , which shall in troduce the Millenium. /z/ THE subject of this chapter is introduced with a concise view of the expulsion of the ten tribes of Israel from the promised land . The ten tribes revolted from the house of David , early in the reign of Ilehoboam , son and successor of kins ; Solomon . They received from this young prince treatment , which was considered irnpolitick and rough ; upon which they separated them selves from that branch of the house of Ls ; @#@ L who , from that time , have been distinguished by the name of Jews . They submitted to another king , Jeroboam . And this breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perpetuate and widen th : breach , and apprehending that if the Jews and ten tribes amicably met for pubJick worship , according to the law of God , the rupture be tween them would probably soon be healed , set , olden calves , one in Dan , and one in ! ; . ' ' id ordered that the ten tribes of Is- ! : ! meet there for their publick worship . He tli us ' ' made Israel to sin . " And would to God /z/ he had been the last who has made the professed worshippers of Jehovah " to sir , , " by assigning them different places of worship , from motives not more evangelical than those of Jeroboam . The ten tribes thus weot off to idolatry . A line of kings succeeded Jeroboam ; hat none of them , to the time of the expulsion , were true worhippers of the God of Israel . By their apos tasy , folly , and idolatry , the ten tribes were pre paring themselves for a long and doleful rejec tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had denounced ; Deut. xxviii . And this God fulfilled . Tiglah-Pilnczer , king of Assyria , captured the tribes of Reuhen and Gad , and the half tribe of Man ass ah , who lay east of Jordan , and placed them in Halah , Harah , and Hahor , by the river Gozen. 1 Chro. v. 2G . About twenty years after , ( 134 years before the Babylonish captivity of the Jews , and 725 years before Christ , ) the rest of the ten tribes continuing impenitent . Shalmanezer , the succeeding king of Assyria , at tacked Samaria , took the remainder of the ten , tribes , in the reign of Hoshea , king of Israel , carried them to Assyria , and placed them with their brethren in Halah and Habor , by the river Gozen in Media 2 Kings , xvii . This filial ex pulsion of Israel from the promised land , was about 943 years after they came out of Egypt . The king of Assyria placed in their stead , in Sa maria , people from Babylon , Cuiha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monqre ! Samaritans . From this captivity the ten tribes were never recovered . And they have long seemed to have been lost from the earth . They seem to have been indeed " outcast , " from the social worid , /z/ and the knowledge of civilized man . The Jews , long after , were dispersed among the nations ; but have ever been known as Jews . But not so with Israel . They have seemed strangely to disappear from the world ; and for 2500 years to have been utterly lost . What are we to believe concerning the ten tribes ? Are they ever again to be known as the natural seed of Abraham ? Are they now in ex istence as a distinct people ? If so , where are they to be found ? All parts of the world are now so well known , that one would conceive the commonwealth of Israel can not now be found among the civilized nations . Must we look for them in a savage state ? If so , the knowledge of their descent must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionary evidence . Who , or where , then , are the people who furnish the greatest degree of this kind of evidence ? An answer , relative to their restoration , will be involved in this chapter ; and an answer to the other questions ; may be expected in the chap ter following . That the Jews are to be restored to Palestine as Jews , seems evident from a variety of consid erations . And that the ten tribes of Israel will there be united with them , seems also to be plainly predicted in the prophets . Let the following things be considered : 1 . The preservation of the Jews , as a dis tinct people , among the many nations whither they have been dispersed , now for nearly 1 800 years , affords great evidence , to say the least , that the many predictions , which seem to foretel such a restoration , are to have a literal ac complishment . This their preservation is a /z/ most signal event of Providence . Nothing like it has ever , in any other instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with the ten tribes of Israel . Other dispersed tribes of men have amalgamated with the people where they have dwelt , and have lost their distinct existence . And nothing but the special hand of God could have prevented this in the case of the Jews . The event then shows , that God has great things in store for them , as Jews . What can these things be , but the fulfilment of those many pro- Ehecies , which predict their restoration to the md of their fathers , as well as their conversion to the Christian faith ? 2 . That people have never , as yet , possessed all the land promised to them ; nor have they possessed any part of it so long as promised . Hence their restoration to that land , is essential to the complete fulfilment of those ancient pro mises . They were to possess the land to the river Euphrates , and forever ; or to the end of the world God promised to Abraham . Gen. xv . 18 " Unto thy seed have I given this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great river , the riv er Euphrates . " Exod. xxiii. 31 " And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea , even un to the sea of the Philistines , and from the desert unto the river ( Euphrates ) ; for I will de liver the inhabitants of the land into your hands and thou slialt drive them out before thee . " Deut. xi . 24 ' Every place whereon the sole of thy feet shall stand , shall be yours , from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea , shall your coast be . " Here , then , are the boun-f daries of this ancient divine grant to Abraham and his natural seed . Beginning at tho river of /z/ Egypt , ( a river not far from the north-east corner-of the Red Sea , and running into the Medi terranean . ) Thence northward , on the shore of the said sea , as far as the point due west of Mount Lebanon . Thence eastward , over said mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the south line of Syria . Thence westward , including the whole of Syria , to the first named river . The whole of this ter ritory , the natural seed of Abraham were to pos sess. " for ever . " The inhabitants " should he driven out before them . " But this people an sufficiently possessed hut a small part of this terri tory . There was indeed a kind of typical pos session of it , in the reign of Solomon ; which reign was a type of the Millennium . ( See Psalrri Ixxii . ) David , in his wars , which were typical of the wars that will introduce the Millennium , subdued and put under tribute the Syrians , Moabites , Ammonites , and most of the nations dwelling in the above named territories . And they continued in subjection in the reign of So lomon . ( See 1 Kings , iv . 21 . ) But those na tions were not then driven out ; nor was their land possessed by the children of Abraham . They afterward threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of God . They were only made tributary during a part of two reigns . But God promised Exod. xxiii. 31 " I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines , and from the desert unto the river ( Euphrates . ) For I will deli ver the inhabitants of the land into your hands , and thoit shalt drive them out before thee . " The land east of Canaan , and away to the river Euphra tes , was never possessed by Israel . Their lite- /z/ ral possession of that extent of territory , must be an event still future . The promised land was given to Israel " for an everlasting possession ; ' ' Gen. xvii. 8 . Surely this must mean a longer time than they did in ages past possess it . This promise remains then to be yet fulfilled . It must mean an undisturbed possession of it , so long as the possession of it on earth may be desirable ; or to the end of the world . We accordingly find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millennium , ex postulating with God , and pleading that ancient granf ; ; Isa . Ixiii. 17 , 18 ; " O Lord , why hast thou made us to err from thy way . and hardened our heart from thy fear ? Return , for thy ser vants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance . The people of thy holiness have possessed it ( thine inheritance ) but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary . We are thine . Thou never bearest rule over them ; they are not called by thy name . " Here is a plea , put into the mouths of the ancient people of the Lord , at the time of their restoration , not long before the battle of the great day , with a de scription of which battle this chapter begins . They expostulate , relative to the sovereignty of God , in the resting of the veil of blindness and hardness so long on their hearts , during their long infidel state . They plead that they are God 's servants , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a restoration ; - and plead that their nation had enjoyed that , their everlasting inheritance , but a little while ; but that a people not called by God 's name , nor governed by his word , had trodden down the sanctuary ; a description exactly fulfilled by the Turks . This fully implies the entering again of /z/ the Jews upon their ancient inheritance , in the last days . 3. 1 shall now adduce some of the numerous express predictions of this event . In the pro phecy of Ezekiel , the restoration of the Jews ajid of Israel to their own land , as well as their conversion in , the last days , is clearly predicted . In chapter xxxvi. we have their long dispersion , and their guilty cause of it . But God , in the last days , works for his own name 's sake , and recovers them . God says , " And I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the hea then ; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land . And I will sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean ; from all your filthiness , and from all your idols will I cleanse you . A new heart also will I give unto you , and a new spirit will I put with in you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh . And I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments and do them . And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers , and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God . Then shall ye remember your own evil ways and shall loathe yourselves . Not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord God , be it known unto you . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities , I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded . And the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all the heathen that passed by . And /z/ they shall say , This land ( hat was so desolate , is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited . Then the heathen , who are left round about you , shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places , and plant that which was desolate . I the Lord have spoken it , and I will do it . " Here is their regeneration ; having a new heart ; being cleansed from all sin . Arid beside this , we find expressly promised , their be ing reinstated in the land of their fathers , which had long lain waste . They rebuild their ancient cities . That this is in the last days , connected with the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the follow ing chapters , fully decide . Both houses of the descendants of Abraham , ( viz. Israel and Judah. ) are recovered , as will be seen . Those predic tions can not he fulfilled merely by the conver sion of that people . For over and above their express conversion , they are established in the land of their fathers . The prophet proceeds further to predict and illustrate the wonderful event , by the resurrec tion of a valley of dry bones ; chap , xxxvii. : which figure God thus explains : " Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel . Be hold , they say , our bones are dried , and our hope is lost ; we are cut off for our parts . Therefore prophecy , and say unto them ; Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Is rael . And ye shall know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O my people , and brought you tip out of your graves , and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land . Then shall ye /z/ know that I the Lord have spoken it , and per formed it , saith the Lord . " The re-union of the two branches of that peo ple follows , by the figure of the two sticks , taken by the prophet . On the one he writes ' , " for Judah , and for the children of Israel his com panions . " Upon the other ; " For Joseph , the stifk of Ephrairn , and for all the house of Israel , In ! companions . " Lest any should say , the prediction which here seems to foretel the restoration of the ten tribes , as well as that of the Jews , were accom plished in the restoration of that few of the Isra elites , who clave to the Jews under the house of David , and the ten tribes are irrecoverably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Isra- elites , their companions , were symbolized by one stick ; and Ephraim , all the house of Israel , ( the whole ten tribes , ) by the other stick . These sticks miraculously become one in the prophet 's hand ; which is thus explained . " Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I will take the children of Israel ( their general ancient name , including the twelve tribes ) from among the heathen , whither they be gone ; and I will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land . And I will make them one nation in the land , upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shll be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all . And they shall dwell in the land that I gave unto Jacob , my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt , and they shall dwell therein , even they and their children , and their children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject , whether the Jews and the ten tribes shall be re-establi*hed in Palestine ? /z/ Can such divine testimony as this be done away ? But similar testimonies to the point are numer ous in the prophets . This passage has ; ; ever yet received a primary , or p.ri.Inl fuliiirnent . The whoio of it remains to he fulfilled* Some of the predictions , which are to have an ultimate accomplishment in this final restoration , had a primary one in the restoration from the seventy years captivity in Babylon . But even this can not be said of the prophecy under consideration . Noae of those written on the second stick , in the hand of the prophet , have ever yet been recov ered . The whole passage is intimately connect ed with the battle of that great day , which intro duces the Millennium ; as appears in the two fol lowing chapters . Here the house of Israel enter again upon their everlasting possession of the land of promise , which God engaged to Abraham . A reiteration of these predictions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of Antichrist , to be collected against the Jews , after their restoration , in the two chapters succeeding . " In the latter years thou ( Gog ) halt come into the land that is brought back from the sword , and gathered out of many peox ple , against the mountains of Israel , which have been always waste , ( or have lain waste for so many centuries during the dispersion of Israel ; ) but it ( that nation ) is brought back out of the nations , and they shall dwell safely all of them . Thou sha.lt ascend and come like a storm ; thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou and all thy bands , and many people withthee . Thus saith the Lord God ; it shall also come to pass , that at the same time , shall things come into thy janind , and thou shalt think an evil thought ; and thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of unwall- /z/ ed villages , ( the state of the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them , dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ; to take a spoil , and to take a prey , to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now in habited , and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations , who have gotten cattle and goods , who dwell in the midst of the land . " " Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou and all thy bands . So will I make my ho ly name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One of Israel . Behold , it is come , it is done , saith the Lord God . This is the day whereof I have spoken . And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth , and shall set on fire and burn the weapons seven years . The whole account is thus divinely summed up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring again the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel , and will be jealous for my holy name ; after , that they have borne their shame , and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their land , and none made them afraid . When I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ; then shall they know that 1 am the Lord their God , who caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen ; but I have gathered them into their own land , and left none of them there ( among the heathen ) any more ; neither will I hide my face any more from them , for I have poured out my spirit upon the house f Israel , saith the Lord God . " It seems as /z/ though this were enough , if nothing more were quoted from the prophets to prove our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would he apt to say , nothing that inspiration can assert upon the point , could be deemed suffi cient ! But that it may appear that the prophetic writings unite to exhibit this as a great object of the Christian 's belief , I shall note some of the ether predictions of it . In Isaiah xi . the stem from the root of Jesse is promised . The Millennium follows , when the cow and the bear shall feed together , and the wolf and the lamb unite in love ; and nothing more shall hurt or offend . ' " And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again , the second time , to gather the rem nant of his people , who shall be left , from Assy ria and from Egypt , and from Pathros , and from Cush , and from Elam , and from Shinar , and from Hamah , and from the isles of the sea . " And he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judah. from the four corners of the earth . " Here just before the Millennium , the Jews and ten tribes are collected from their long dispersion , by the hand of Omni potence , set a second time for their recovery . A body of the Jews , and some of several other tribes , were recovered from ancient Babylon . God is goinf , in the last days , to make a second , and more effectual recovery from mystical Baby lon , and from the four quarters of the earth . The prophet proceeds ; # And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea ; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand overjhe river , and shall unite it in the seven streams , and /z/ make men go over dry shod . And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people , which shall he left from Assyria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt . " Mr. Scott , upon this passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ob stacles hy the same powerful interposition , that he vouchsafed in behalf of Israel , when He sep arated the tongue , or bay of the Red Sea , and destroyed that hindrance to the departure of Is rael ; and with a mighty wind he will so sepa rate the waters of the river Euphrates , in all its streams , that men may pass over dry shod . Thus an highway shall be made for Israel 's return , as there was for their ancestors to pass from Egypt into Canaan . This part of the chapter , contains a prophecy , which certainly remains yet to be accomplished . " Bishop Lowth says , the same ; and adds , as quoted by Mr. Scott , t4 This part of the chapter , foretels the glorious times of the church , which shall be ushered- in by the restora tion of the Jewish nation , when they shall em brace the gospel , and be restored to their own country . This remarkable scene of Providence is plainly foretold by most of the prophets ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of those great men in favour of a literal restoration of the Jews to their own land , being here predic ted .. And here is a drying up of a mighty river , to prepare the way for the event . A river is the symbol of a nation . When Israel were to be redeemed from Egypt , the Red Sea was to be dried before them . When they were to be redeemed from Babylon , the Euphrates was by Cyrus to be dried or turned , to accomplish the event . And in their last restoration to Pa lestine , ( ere long to be accomplished , ) another /z/ great mystical river is to be dried up . The sixth vial dries up the mystic Euphrates , that the way of the kings of the east may be prepared . This is to-be fulfilled on the Turks . Perhaps the event is now transpiring . This river is to be smitten in its seven streams $ as stated inthis prophecy of Isaiah ; perhaps indicating , that the Turks , be they ever so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfec tion , they yet shall fall by the remarkable hand of God , to accommodate the return of his ancient people . These prophetic hints give an interest to the present struggles in the south-east of Eu rope . In Jeremiah , xxiii. 6 , 8 , is the restoration of Israel . " Li his days , ( i. e. under the millennial reign of the righteous branch raised up to Da vid , ) Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely : I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries , whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds . Therefore , behold the days come , saith the Lord , that they shall no more say , The Lord liveth , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ; but , The Lord liveth , who brought up , and who led the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I have driven them , and they shall dwell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of Christ ; so it has never yet been fulfilled . It is an event of the last days ; and plants the ancient people of God in their own land . ** ' The same comparison of the same event , we find in Isaiah , xvi . 14 , 15 . After denouncing their long dispersion , for their sins ; God says , " Therefore , behold the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be said , The Lord /z/ liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ; hut the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither I had driven them ; and I will bring them into their land , that I gave unto their fathers . " In Isaiah xviii . a land shadowing with wfngs at the last days , is by the Most High addressed , and called to aid this restoration of thatpeople of God . " Go , ye swift messengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible from the begin ning hitherto ; a nation meted out , and trodden down ; whose land the rivers have spoiled . In that day shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts , of a people scattered and peeled , and from a people terrible from the beginning hitherto ; a nation meted out and trodden under foot ; whose land the rivers have spoiled , to the place of the Lord of hosts , the Mount Zion . " The people here described , ( to be brought by that land addressed , as a present to the Lord , to Mount Zion , or to Palestine , ) are evidently the descendants of Abraham , and an event of the last days . A further explanation of this chapter , is to be given in the last chapter of this work . The same thing is rioted in Isaiah Ix . The Jewish church is called upon ; " Arise , shine , for thy light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee . The gentiles shall come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ris ing . Who are these that fly as clouds , and as doves to their windows ? ' Surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sons from far . their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the Lord thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glorified thee . " Here are ships conveying /z/ the Jews to Palestine , as clouds and as doves to their windows . Chap . Ixvi. 20 : " And they shall bring of your brethren for an offering unto the Lord , out of all nations , upon horses , and in chariots , and in litters , and upon mules , and upon swift beasts , to my holy mountain Jerusalem , saith the Lord , as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel unto the house oYthe Lord . " InZephaniah , iii . 10 , ( connected with the battle of the great day , and the Millennium , ) we read ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshippers ) shall bring my offering , even the daughter of my dispersed ; " as the passage should be rendered . In Amos , ix . 14 , 15 , is a prediction of this event . " And I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land , which I have given them , saith the Lord God . " This restoration is surely future . For after the res toration from the Babylonish captivity , they were again expelled from their land , now for many centuries . But after the restoration here prom ised , God says , " They shall no more be pulled up out of their land . " This shows that the res toration here promised , is both future and liter al . Jer. xxx . 3 ; " For lo , the days come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captivity of my people , Israel and Judah , saith the Lord ; and 1 will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it . " In the restoration from Babylon , Israel was not returned . And the Jews possessed their land but a short time . Hence this prophecy remains to be fulfilled . Read the whole 31st chapter of Jeremiah , and you will find the restoration of the Jews , and the ten tribes , to the land of their fa thers , in the last days ; and their continuance in it , so long as the sun , moon , and stars endure . " If those ordinances depart iivm before me , saith the Lord , ( i. e. of the sun , moon and stars ) then the seed of Israel shall cease from being a nation before me forever . " God here promises " the city ( Jerusalem ) shall be built to the Lord ; it shall not be plucked up , nor thrown down any more forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's first born ; so he will earnest ly remember him still , and surely have mercy upon him , for his bowels are pained with his long outcast slate . That he will sow the house of Is rael and the house of Juclah with the seed of men ; and that " " like as he had watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , to throw down , and to destroy and afflict ; so he will watch over them to build and plant . That all this shall be , when the new covenant is made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah , not according to the covenant that he made with their fathers . Thus it is an event to take place under the last , the gospel dispensation ; and hence it must be now future . The prophet Joel , when foretelling the last days , and the Millennium , notes this event ; chap , iii . 1 . " For behold , in those days , and at that time , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will also gather all na tions , arid will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat . " The battle of the great day of God follows ; verse 9 17 . Upon which fol lows ( he Millennium . In this series of events , God " brings again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem . " /z/ In Zecb. iii . is the same . A new preparatory scene of judgment is predicted ; verse C , 7 . The battle of the great day follows ; verse 8 . Then the Millennium ; verse 9 . To prepare the way for this , the noted restoration is promised ; verse 10 18 . And the scene closes thus ; verse 19 , 20 . " Behold , at that time 1 will undo all that afflict thee ; and I will save her that halteth , and gather her that was driven out ; and I will get rne praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame . At that time I will bring you again , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a name and a praise among all the people of the earth , when I turn back your captivity before your eyes , saith the Lord . " The prophet Hosea most decisively predicts this event . His first son mast be called Jezrcel ; for God would soon avenge the blood of Jezrecl ; " and I will.canse to cease the house of Israel . " This house did cease ; and has been banished and lost to this day . The name of his daugh ter , Lo-rtrhamah , is explained : " Ye are not my people ; and I will not be your God . " Here is their long dispersion . But he immediately proceeds to predict their restoration . Chap . i. 10 , 11 ; " Yet the number of the children of Is rael shall be as the sand of the sea , which can not be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass that in the place , where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall it be said to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then shall the children of Israel and the chil dren of Jiidah he gathered together , and appoint themselves one head ; and they shall come up out of the land ; ( earth : ) for great shall be the dav of Jezreel . " Iiere the ten tribes were to /z/ be dispersed , and again restored , together with the Jews ; and their numbers and prosperity shall be immense . This prophet proceeds in the following chapters to predict the same event . See Hosea , 2d and 3d chapters . The account closes thus ; " For the children of Israel shall abide majiy days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without a terapliim . Afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God . and David , their king ; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness'in the latter days . " Here is a description of the present dispersed state of Israel ; and a prediction of their national restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration is a great event in the proph ets ; and we find it in the New Testament . Paul ( in his epistle to the Romans , chap , xi. ) notes their being again grafted into their own olive tree as a notable event of the last days , which shall be the " riches of the gentiles ; " yea , " life from the dead " to them . See also Isaiah xlix . 18 23 . One passage more I w r ill adduce from the writings of Moses ; Deut. xxx . The long and doleful dispersion of this people had been predicted in the preceding chapters . Here their final restoration follows . " And it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee , and shalt return unto the Lord thy God ; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity , arid have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee . And the Lord thy God will bring thee 1'iio the land , which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it , and he will do Ihee good , and multiply thee ahfrcc Iky fathers . " This has never yet been fulfilled . For the Jews , return ed from Babylon , were very far from being mul tiplied in their land above their fathers . This remains still to be accomplished . Thus the prophetic writings do clearly decide , that both Israel and the Jews shall , in the last days , before the Millennium , be literally restor ed to their own land of Palestine ; and be con verted to the Christian faith . 4 . To give a mystical import to all these prophecies , and say they will be fulfilled only in the conversion of these ancient people of God to Christianity ; is to take a most unwarrantable liberty with the word of God . Some have made such pretence ; but far be it from me to follow them ! Why not as well apply a mystical sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle of that great day ; of the Millennium ; of the resurrection of the bodies of men ; of the final judgment ; of the conflagra tion of this world ; of heaven ; and of hell ? Why may not those as well all be fuliilled , not by a literal , but by some mystical accomplish ment ? Is not this to add and to diminish , with a witness ? Paul says , ( 2 Tim . ii . 16 . ) " But shun profane and vain babblings ; for they will in crease unto more ungodliness , and their words will eat as doth a canker ; of whom is Hymeneas and Philetus ; who concerning the truth have erred , saying , that the resurrection is past alrea dy ; and overthrow the faith of some . " What was the liberty taken by those arch heretics ? No doubt it was this ; applying to the predictions ef a resurrection of the bodies of men from the grave , a mystical resurrection of the soul from the death of sin . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous , and are not more express , than are the predictions of the restoration of the Jews and Israel to their own land . In various of the most remarkable of these predictions , we find it distinctly ascertained that the Jews shall be converted ; shall have a new heart given them ; shall have their hearts cir cumcised to ' fear the Lord . And beside this , it is said that people shall ( as a distinct nation. ) be restored to the land of their fathers , and shall dwell in temporal prosperity there through all following ages ' , and be more numerous than ever were their fathers . To say then , that all those predictions of such a restoration to Palestine , are to be accomplished only in the bringing of that people ( in their dispersed state , ) to embrace the Messiah ; is to take a most unwarrantable liber ty with the word of God ! Look at one passage ; Ezekiel , 36th , 37th , 38th , and 39th chapters . Are the new heart the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of all lands into their own land , which had so long lain waste , one and the same event ? What can such expositors do with the predictions of Gog and his bands , gathered against them , and falling upon the mountains of Israel ? Are these ( and all the predictions in Joel , Zechariah , and other proph ets , of the gathering of all nations to Jerusalem , ) to be explained away , so that no " gathering of the nations and assembling of the kingdoms , " must be expected ? It must be a dangerous expe dient to explain away the clear and express sen timents of revelation . The old and best exposi tors generally have believed in a literal restora- tion of Judah and Israel . And no material ob jections can be raised against it , which might not in its principle , operate as forcibly against all predicted future events . 5 . That the Hebrews are to have a literal res toration , appears from the fact , that the threatenings that God would cast them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from the promised land . The promises of their restora tion appear to be an exact counterpart of this ; and hence must have their effect in restoring them again to Palestine . If such promises did not design to restore them again to the land of their fathers ; why should the threatenings of their rejection of God , be designed to have their effect in expelling them literally from the land of promise ? Why should one of them receive a literal , and the other a mystical construction ? No account can be given of this . If there is no benefit in restoring them to Palestine ; why was there any calamity in expelling them from Pales tine ? Why did not God let them continue there , though he withdrew his spirit and grace from them ? But if , over and above this , they must be expelled from the land of promise ; then surely their promised restoration must ( over and above giving them the heart of flesh ) bring them back to the Canaan , which was given to them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews is so well un derstood in the Christian and literary world , that very little will here he said on this part of the subject . While a more particular attention will be paid to the present ' state of the ten tribes of Israel , . The whole present population of the Jews has boon calculated at five millions . But the prob ability is , ( as has been thought by good judges , ) that they are far more numerous . One noted character says , that in Poland and part of Tur key , there are at least three millions of this peo ple ; and that among them generally , there is an unusual spirit of enquiry relative to Christianity . Mr. Noah says , that in the States of Barbary. their number exceeds seven hundred thousand . Their population in Persia , China , Tndia , and Tartary. is stated ( in a report of the London So ciety for the conversion of the Jews. ) to be more than three hundred thousand . In Western Asia /z/ the Jews are numerous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe this remarkable people have " been singularly depressed , and in ages past made a laant , reproach , and by-word , trodden i , scattered and pealed ; one would hope quarter of the world would feel themselves obligated to be singularly active in bringing about their restoration . Considerable has been under taken to meliorate their condition , and prepare the way for their restoration . It is fourteen years since a society was formed in London to aid the Christianization of this peo ple . A chapel has been erected by this society for their benefit . The New Testament they have caused to be translated into the Hebrew language ; also many tracts written in Hebrew . These tracts and Testaments have been liberal ly distributed among tl Jews , and been read bv nrihit-raes of them with no small attention . . ' ii * have been sent among them ; schools opened , and various means used . A seminary was opened in 1322 for the instruction of the youth of ( Ills people . Four students of the seed of Abraham entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Jewish convert and rrvs. ? : : u - , la various parts of the Umt- 'd . Kingdoms , auxiliary societies have been formed ; and the amount of monies received in 1822 , was upwards of ! 0,698/. sterling , ( between 40 and $50,000 . ) In the schools of the society are be tween seventy and eighty children of the Jews . In 1322 there were distributed . 2,459 Hebrew Testaments ; 81 ) 2 Germrvi Jewi  --  h do. ; 2,597 Polish Judea do . ; 800 Hebrew Psalters ; 42.110 Ilr-ow Tracts ; 10.000 ft . for the Jews ; 13,300 Hebrew cards . The prophets are about /z/ to be printed in Hebrew , on stereotype plates , for ihc benefit of the Jews . Places of deposit of book for the Jews are established extensive ly in the four quarters of the world . Other and similar societies in favour of the Jews are becoming numerous . Only several be given in detail . One has been formed in Lciiiii under the sanction of his Prussian ma jesty . This society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pious Christians in Germany stem themselves almost excluded from the work of converting the heathen ; to whom sea-fa rii : - ra tions oi ) y have an immediate access . May they be of good cheer in turning their eyes to iLe ons of the ancient peopie of God , who live among them , or in their vicinity . There is no na tion provided with so effective means now to begin the work of their conversion , as protestant Ger many . For this country the most glorious harvest *eems to be in reserve . Let us then clear oursel ves from the blame of ieavi , to perish these mill ions , living among us , ; . tes , without having ever made any vveJi regulated attempt to lead them to that cross , upon which their fathers crucified the Messiah . This field is our own , ra.d only requires labourers . According to our best information of its state , we have no doubt but the soil will readily receive the seed of the divine word . " The informations received from Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convinced that some important change in their condition is preparing ; aud the ) seem ready to co-operate ii ! ans of such a cisu .. ; ; e . Count Von d ( r Hecke , near Westphali : been formed in Europe and America , to /z/ aid this great object . The American Meliorat ing Society , with its auxiliaries , might he noted in detail ; but they are well known . The his tory of the Palestine mission also ; the noted agency of Mr. Frey , and the mission of Mr. Wolff , the Jewish missionary to Palestine ; also the remarkable conversion of many of the Jews ; but this would exceed my designed limits ; and these things are well known to the Christian world . My present object is rather to attend to the present state of the ten tribes of Israel . This branch of the Hebrew family have long been u outcasts " out of sight ; or unknown as He brews . The questions arise , are they in exist ence , as a distinct people ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queries of great moment , at this period , when the time of their restoration is drawing near . These queries may receive an answer in the following remarks : 1 . It has been clearly ascertained in the pre ceding chapter , that the ten tribes , as the Israel of God , are in the last days to be recovered , and restored with the Jews . The valley of dry bones , and the two sticks becoming one in the prophet 's hand , have been seen clearly to ascertain this : See Ezek. xxxix. as well as the many other passages noted in that chapter . But as this fact is essential to our inquiring after the ten tribes with confidence of their existence ; I shall here note several additional predictions of the event , found in the prophets ; and note some passages , which distinguish between the dispersed state of the Jews , and the o-nL-avi si ate of the ten tribes ; which distinction wiii aiiord some light in our inquiries . /z/ When the restoration of the Hebrews is pre dicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days set up an ensign for the nations ; it is to ' ' assem ble the outcasts of Israel ; and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth . " Mark the distinction ; the Jews are " dispersed ; " scattered over the nations as Jews , as they have long been known to be ; but Israel are " outcast ; " cast out from the nations ; from society ; from the social world ; from the knowl edge of men , as being Hebrews . This distinc tion is repeatedly found in the prophets . The dispersed state of the Jews , as Jews , is a most notable idea in the prophetic scriptures . But of Israel , the following language is used ; as Isaiah Ivi. 8 ; " The Lord God who gathcreth the out casts of Israel , saith , " c . Accordingly , when Israel are recovered , and united with the Jews at last ; the Jews express their astonishment , and inquire where they had been ? They had utterly lost them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 22 . The Jews here , while " removing to and fro " through the nations , in their dispersed state , had been " left alone , " i. e. of the ten tribes . The latter being now restored to the bosom of the mother church , the Jews inquire , " Who hath brought up these ? Behold , I was left alone j these , where had they been . ? " Here we learn that the ten tribes had , during the long dispersion of the Jews , been utterly out of their sight and knowl edge , as their brethren . This implies the long outcast state of the ten tribes . Several additional passages will be noted , to show that both the branches of that ancient peo ple are to be restored . In Isaiah xi . after the promise that the dispersed Jews , and outcast Is rael shall be restored ; the prophet adds , verse /z/ 13 ; " The envy also of Ephraim shall depart ; Ephraim shall not envy Judah , and Judah shall not vex Ephraim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the house of Is rael , which before the expulsion of the ten tribes kept them in almost perpetual war , shall never again be revived ; which passage assures us of the restoration of Israel as Israel . In Jer. iii . tbose two branches arc distinguish ed by " backsliding /srr/.t7 , and her treacherous sister Judah . " Israel was already put away for her spiritual adulteries , ( having then been re ected for nearly one hundred years . ) But the same backsliding Israel is there again recovered in the last days . God calls after them ; " Return , thou backsliding Israel ; for I a/n married unto you , saith the Lord . And 1 will take , you , one of a city and two of a family ' , and will bring you to Zion . " " In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel ; and they shall come together out of the land of the north , to the land that I have given to your fathers . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its event is manifestly future . The entail of the covenant must as surely re cover the ten tribes , as the Jews . Paul shows in Romans xi . the consistency of the rejection of the Jews , with the entail of the covenant with Abraham . And he makes their final restoration in the last days , essential to this consistency . But this inspired argument as forcibly attaches itself to the ten tribes , to ensure their recovery , as to the Jews . He accordingly there says , " and so all Israel shall he saved j " ** or both branches of the Hebrews shnil be recovered . This some point is most positively decided in Jeremiah , 30th and 31st chapters , as has appeared in the preceding chapter . 2 . It inevitably follows , that the ten tribes of Israel must now have , somewhere on earth , a distinct existence in an outcast state . And we justly infer , that God would , in his holy provi dence , provide some suitable place for their safe keeping , as his outcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no avoiding this conclusion . If God will restore them at last as his Israel , and as having been " outcast " from the nations of the civilized world for 2500 years ; he surely must have provided a place for their safe keeping , as a distinct people , in some part of the world , during that long period . They must , during that period , have been unknown to the Jews as Israelites ; and consequently un known to the world as such ; or the Jews would not at least ( on their heing united to them. ) in quire , " These , where had they been ? " Isaiah xlix . 21. 3 . We have an account of the ten tribes , after their captivity , which accords with the ideas just stated . We receive not the books of the Apoc rypha as given by Inspiration ; but much credit has been given to historical facts recorded in it ; as in the wars of the Maccabees , and othci p : aces . In 2 Esdras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u Those are the ten tribes which were carried away pris oners out of their own land , in the time of Osea , the king , whom Salmanezer , the king of Assyria , led away captive ; and he carried them over the Waters , and so carne they into another laild . " Here is the planting them over the Euphrates , in Media . The writer adds ; " But they took this counsel among themselves , that they would leave the multitude of the heathen , and go forth into a /z/ further country , where never man dwelt ; that they might there keep their statutes which they never kept ( i. e. uniformly as they ought , ) in their own land . There was a great way to go , namely , of a year and a half . " The writer pro ceeds to speak of the name of the region being - called Arsareth , or Ararat . He must allude here to the region to which they directed their course to go this year and a half 's journey . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unknown by any name . But Ararat , or Arme nia lay north of the place where the ten tribes were planted . when carried from Palestine . Their journey then , was to the north , or north east . This writer says , " They entered into the Euphrates by the narrow passages of the river . " He must mean , they repassed this river in its upper regions , or small streams , away toward Georgia ; and hence must have taken their course between the Black and Caspian seas . This set them olFnorth-east of the Ararat , which he men tions . Though this chapter in Esdras be a kind of prophecy , hi which we place not confidence ; yet the allusion to facts learned by the author , . no doubt may be correct . And this seems just such an event as might be expected , had God in deed determined to separate them from the rest of the idolatrous world , and banish them by themselves , in a land where no man dwelt since the flood . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent had lately been discovered , away north-east from Media , and at the distance of " a year and a half 's journey ; " a place probably destitute of inhabitants , since the flood , till the time of the " casting out " of Israel . Suppose a people to have been lately discovered /z/ in that sequestered region , appearing as we should rationally expect the nation of Israel to appear at this period , had the account given hy the wri ter in Esdras been a fact . Suppose them to be fouad in tribes , with heads of tribes ; but desti tute of letters , and in a savage state . Suppose among their different tribes the following tradition ary fragments are by credible witnesses picked up ; some particulars among one region of them , and some amoag another ; while all appear evident ly to be of the same family . Suppose them to have - escaped the polytheism of the pagan world , and to acknowledge one , and only One God ; the Great Spirit , who created all things seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them for this Great Spirit , to be Ale , the old He brew name of God ; and Yohewah , whereas the Hebrew name for Lord was Jehovah ; also they call the Great First Cause , Yah ; the Hebrew name being Jah . Suppose you find most of them professing great reverence for this great Yohe wah ; calling him " the great beneficent supreme holy spirit , " and the only object of worship . Suppose the most intelligent of them to be elat ed with the idea that this God has ever been the head of their community ; that their fathers were once in covenant with him ; and the rest of the world were " the accursed people , " as out of covenant with God . Suppose you find them , on certain occasions , singing in religious dance , " Hallelujah , " or praise to Jah ; also singing Yohewah , Shilu Yohewah , and making use of many names and phrases evidently Hebrew . You find them counting their time as did ancient Israel , and in a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious feasts , which much resemble those kept , in ancient Is- /z/ rael . You find an evening feast among them , in which a bone of the animal must not he broken ; if the provision be more than one family can eat , a - neighbour must be called in to help eat it , and if any of it be still left , it must be burned before the next rising sun . You find them eating bit ter vegetables , to cleanse themselves from sin . You find they never eat the hollow of the thigh of any animal . They inform that their fathers practised % circumcision . Some of them have been in the habit of keeping a Jubilee . . They have their places answering to the cities of re fuge , in ancient Israel . In these no blood is ever shed by any avenger . You find them with their temples , ( such as they be , ) their holy of holies in their temple , into which it is death for a com mon person to enter . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make their yearly atonement there in a singular pontffical dress , which they fancy to be in the likeness of one worn by their predecessors in ancient times ; with their breast-plate , and various holy ornaments . The high priest , when addressing to his people what they call " the old divine speech , " calls them " the beloved and holy peo ple , " and urges them to imitate their virtuous ancestors ; and tells them of their " beloved land flowing with milk and honey . " They tell you that Yohewah once chose their nation from all the rest of mankind , to be his peculiar people . That a book which God gave , was once theirs ; and then things went well with them . But oth er people got it from them , and then they fell un der the displeasure of the Great Spirit ; but that they shall , at some time , regain it . They inform you , some of their fathers once had the spirit to foretel future events , and to work miracles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covenant , where are deposited their most sacred things ; into which it is death for any common people to look . All their males must appear at the temple at three noted feasts in a year . They inform you of the ancient flood ; of the preser vation of one family in a vessel ; of this man in the ark sending out first a great bird , and then a little one , to see if the waters were gone . That the great o:ie returned no more ; but the little one returned with a branch . They tell you of the confusion of languages , once when people were building a great high place ; and of the longevity of the ancients ' ; that - they " lived till their feet were worn out with walking , and their throats with eating . " , You find them with their traditional history that their ancient fathers once lived where peo ple were dreadfully wicked , and that nine tenths of their fathers took counsel and left that wicked place , being led by the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region where it was always winter , snow and frozen . That they came to a great water , and their way hith er was thus obstructed , till God dried up that water ; ( probably it froze between the islands in Beering 's Straits . ) Yoirfind them keeping an annual feast , at the time their ears of corn be come fit for use ; and none of their corn is eaten , till a part of it is brought to this feast , and cer tain religious ceremonies performed : . You find them keeping an annual feast , in which twelve men must cut twelve saplin poles , to make a booth . Here ( on an altar made of twelve stones , on which no tool may pass. ) they must sacrifice . You find them with the custom of washing and anointing their dead . And when /z/ in deep affliction , laying their hand on their mouth , a id tiieir mouth in the dust . Suppose you should find things like these people , without books or letters , but wholly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world lately discovered away in the direction , stated by the aforenoted writer in the Apocj pha ; and having been ever secluded from the knowl edge of the civilized world ; would you hesitate to say you had found the ten tribes of Israel ? and that God sent them to that sequestered re religion of the earth , to keep them there a distinct people , during an " outcast " state of at least 2500 years ? Weuld you not say , we have just such kind of evidence , as must at last bring that people to light among the nations ? And would you not say , here is much more evidence of this kind , of their being the people of Israel , than could rationally have been expected , after the lapse of 2500 years in a savage state ? Methinks 1 hear every person whisper his full assent , that upon the suppositions made , we have found the most essential pile of the prophet Ezekiel 's val ley of dry bones ! 5 . Those things are more than mere supposi tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as facts , with substantial evidence . Good authorities from men , who have been eye and ear witnesses , assure us that these things are facts . But you enquire , where or who are the people thus described ? They are the aborigines of our own continent ! Their place , their lan guage , their traditions , amount to all that has been hinted . These evidences are not all found among any one tribe of Indians . Nor may all the Indians in any tribe , where various of these eTidences are found , be able to exhibit them . It /z/ is enough , if what they call their beloved aged men , in one tribe , have clearly exhibited some of them ; and others exhibited others of them ; and if among their various tribes , the whole have been , by various of their beloved or wise men , exhibited . This , it is stated , has been the fact . Men have been gradually perceiving this evi dence for more than half a century ; and new light has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will appear , . The North American Reviewers , in review ing a sermon of Doct . Jarvis , on this subject , de livered before the New- York Historical Society , ( in which he attempts to adduce much evidence to show that the natives of this continent are the tribes of Israel ) remark thus ; " The history and character of the Indian tribes of North America , which have for some time been a subject of no inconsiderable curiosity and interest with the learned in Europe , have not till lately attracted much notice among ourselves . But as the Indian nations are now fast vanishing , and the in dividuals of them come less frequently under our observation ; we also , as well as our European brethren , are beginning to take a more lively in terest than ever , in the study of their character and history . " In the course of their remarks they add ; " To the testimonies here adduced by Doctor Jarvis , ( i. e. that the Indians are the ten tribes of Israel ) might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first settlement of the country . " Some they proceed to mention ; and then add , that the Rev. Messrs . Samuel Sewall , fellow of Harvard College , and Samuel Willard , vice president of the same , were , of opinion , that " the Indians are the descendants of Israel . " /z/ ' Doct . Jarvis notes this as an hypothesis , which has been a favourite topic with European writ ers ; and as a subject , to which it is hoped the Americans may be said to be waking no at last . Manasses Ben Israel , in a work , entitled " The ' Hope of Israel , " has written to show that the American Indians are the ten tribes of Israel . But as w , e have access to his authors , we may consult them for ourselves . The main pillar of has evidence is James Adair , Esq . Mr. Adair was a man of established character , as appears from good authority . He lived a trader among the Indians , in the . south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to Eng land in 1774 , and there published his " History of the American Indians ; " and his reasons for being persuaded that they are the ten tribes of Israel . Remarking on their descent and origin , he concludes thus ; " From the most accurate observations I could make , in the long time I traded among the Indian Americans , I was forc ed to believe them lineally descended from the Israelites . Had the nine tribes and a half of Is rael , tint were carried olf by Shalrnanexer , and settled in Me-lia , continued there long , it is very probable by intermarrying with the natives , and from their natural fickleness , and proneness to idolatry , and also from the force of example ; that they won 1 . ; ! have adopted and bowed before the gods of Media and Assyria ; and would have carried them along with them . But there is not a trace of this idolatry amo-ig the Indians . " Mr. Adair gives his opinion , tint the tea tribes , soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a id reached this continent from ! he north-west , probably before the carrying away of the Jews to Babylon. /z/ A summary will be given of the arguments of Mr. Adair , and of a number of other writers on this subject . As the evidence given by Mr. Adair appears in some respects the most momen. - tous and conclusive , I shall adduce a testimonial in his behalf . In the " Star in the West , " pub lished by the lion . Eaas Eoudinot , LL . D. upon this subject , that venerable man sajs ; The writer oi these sheets has made a iiee use of Mr. Adair 's history of the Indians ; wh ch renders it necessary that something further should be said of him . Sometime about the year 1774 , Mr. Adair came to Elirabethtown , ( where the writer lived. ) with his manuscript , and appli ed to Mr. Livingstone , ( afterward goenor of New- Jersey a correct scholar. ) requesting him to correct his manuscript . lie brought ampie recommendations , and gave a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tain then increasing ( " t being the year before the comn.ei. cement of the revolutionary war , ) Mr. Adair , who was on his way to Great Britain , was advised not to risk being detained from his voy age , till the work could be critically examined ; but to set oil ' as soon as possible . He according ly took his passage in the first vessel bound to England . As soon as the war was over , ( Mr. Boudinot adds of himself , ) the writer sent to London to obtain a ccpytf this work . After reading it with care , he strict ' examined a gen tleman , then a member with him in congress , and of excellent character , who had acted as our agent among the Indians to the southward , dur ing the war , relative to the points of fact stated by Mr. Adair , without letting him know the de sign , aud from him found all the leading facts men- /z/ tioncd in Mr. Adair 's history , fully confirmed from his own personal knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good men most artlessly uniting in the leading facts stated by Mr. Adair . The character of Mr. Boudmot ( who was for some time President of the American Bible Society. ) is well known . He was satisfied with - the truth of Mr. Adair 's history , and that the natives of our land are the Hebrews , the ten tribes . And he hence published his " Star in the West " on this subject ; which is most worthy of the perusal of ail men . From various authors and travellers , among the Indians , the fact that the American Indians are the ten tnbes of Israel , will be attempted to be proved by the following arguments : 1 . The American natives have one origin . 2 . Their language appears to have been He brew . 3 . They ' have had their imitation of the ark of the covenant in ancient Israel . 4 . They have been in the practice of circum cision. 5 . They have acknowledged one and only one God . 6 . Their variety of traditions , historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten tribes of Israel . 7 . The celebrated William Penn gives ac counts of the natives Pennsylvania , which go to corroborate the same point . 8 . Their having a tribe , answering in various respects , to the tribe of Levi , sheds furthers light on this subject . 9 . Several prophetic traits of character given of the Hebrews , do accurately apply to the abo rigines of Anaerica. /z/ 10 . The Indians being in tribes , with their heads arid names of tribes , affords further light upon this subject . 1 1 . Their having an imitation of the ancient city of refuge , evinces the truth of our subject ; and 12 . Other Indian rites , and various other con siderations , go to evince the . fact , that this people are the ten tribes of Israel . 1 . Tfie American , natives have one origin . Their language has a variety of dialects ; but all are believed by some good juydges to be the same radical laniae . Various noted authors aree in this . Charlevoix , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Huron langua ges , ( which he says are as really the same , as the French and old Norman are the sa ne- ) have be tween them the language of ail the savage na tions we are acquainted with . Whoever should well understand b th of these , nvght travel With out an interpreter more than fifteen hundred leagues of country , and make himself understood by an hundred diiferent natiois , who have each their peculiar tongue ; " meaning dialect . The Ai'Jm juin was the dialect of the Wolf tribe , or the Mohegan ; and most of the native tribes of New-England and of Virginia . Doctor Jonathan Edwards , son of President Edwards , lived in his youth among the Indians ; as his father was a missionary among , them , be fore he was called to Princeton College ; and he became as familiar with the Muhegan dialect , as with his mother tongue . He had also a good knowledge of the Mohawk dialect . He pro nounced the Mohegan the most extensive of all the Indian dialects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes , besides the original /z/ tribes of New-England , as agreeing with the Mohegan . Herein the doctor agrees with the testi mony of Charlevoix just noted . Here we find a cogent argument in favour of the Indians of North America , at least as heing of one origin . And arguments will be furnished that the Indians of South America are probably of the same ori ginDoctor Boudinot ( who for more than forty years was of opinion that the Indians are the ten tribes , and who sought and obtained much evi dence on this subject , assures us , that the sylla bles which compose the word Yohewah , ( Jeho vah ) and Yah , ( Jah ) are the roots of a great num ber of Indian words , through different tribes . They make great use of these words , and of the syllables which compose the names of God ; also which form the word Hallelujah , through their nations for thousands of miles ; especially in their religious songs and dances . With beating and an exact keeping of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hal , hal ; then le , le , le - , next lu , lu , lu ; and then close yah , yah , yah . ' This is their traditional song of praise to the Great Spirit . This , it is asserted , is sung fh South , as well as North America . And this au thor says ; u Two Indians , who belong to far'distant nations , may without the knowledge of each other 's language , except from the general idiom of all their tribes , converse with each other , and make contracts without an interpreter . " This shews them to have been of one origin . Du Pratz says , in his history of Louisiana , " The nations of North America derived their origin from the same country , since at bottom they all have the same manners and usages , nd the same manner of speaking and thinking .

" Mr. Adair expresses the same opinion ; and the Indians have their tradition , that in the nation from which they originally came , all were of one colour . - According to all accounts given of the Indians , there are certain things in which all agree . This appears in the journals of Mr. Giddings , of his exploring tour . The most distant and barbarous Indians agree in a variety of things with all oth er tribes . They have their Great Spirit ; their high priests ; their sacrificing , when going to , or returning from war ; their religious dance ; and their sacred little enclosure , containing their most sacred things , though it be but a sack , in stead of an ark . Messrs . Lack and Escarbotus both assert that they have often heard the In dians of South America sing " Hallelujah . " For thousands of miles the North American Indians hav been abundant in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ; " In whatever manner this part of the earth was peopled , the Indians appear to have been the most ancient , or the original men of America . They had spread over the whole con tinent , from the . fiftieth degree of north latitude , to the southern extremity of Cape Horn . And these men every where appeared to be the same race or kind of people . In every part of the continent , the Indians are marked with a similar ity of colour , features , and every circumstance of external appearance . Pedro de Cicca de Leon , one of the conquerors of Peru , and who had travelled through many provinces of Amer ica , says of the Indians ; u The people , men and women , although there are such a multitude of tribes or nations , in such diversities of climates , appear nevertheless , like the children of one fa ther and mother . " Uiloa ( rii - t. ' d hy Doct . Williams. ) had a great acquaintance with the Indians of South America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cape Breton , in the latter , he de clared them to he " the same people with the Indians in Peru . " " If we have seen one Amer ican , ( said he ) we may he said to have seen them all . " These remarks do not apply to all the people in the northern extremities of America . The Esquimaux natives appear to be a different race of men . This race are found in Labrador ; in Greenland , and round Hudson 's Bay . All these appear evidently the same with the Lap landers , Zemblans , Samoyeds and Tartars in the east . They probably migrated to this western hemisphere at periods subsequent to the migra tion of the Indians . They , or some of them , might * have come from the north of Europe ; from Norway to Iceland , then to Greenland , and thence to the coasts of Labrador , and farther west . But the consideration of those diiferent people , does not affect our subject . 2 . Their language appears clearly to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adair , and others were agreed . Doct . Edwards , after having a good acquaintance with their lan guage , gave his reasons for believing it to have been originally Hebrew . Both , he remarks , are found without prepositions , and are formed with prefixes and suffixes ; a thing probably known to no other language . And he . shows that not only /z/ the words , but the construction of phrases , in both , have been the same . Their pronouns , as well as their nouns , Doctor Edwards remarks , are manifestly from the Hebrew . Mr. Adair is confident of the fact , that their language is He brew . And their laconic , bold arid command ing figures of speech , he notes as exactly agree ing with the genius of the Hebrew language . He says , that after living forty years among them , he obtained such knowledge of the Hebrew idi om of their language , that he viewed the event of their having for more than two millenaries , and without the aid of literature , preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a miracle . Relative to the Hebraism of their figures , Mr. Adair gives the following instance , from an ad dress of a captain to his warriors , going to bat tle . " I know that your guns are burning in your hands ; your tomahawks are thirsting to drink the blood of your enemies ; your trusty arrows are impatient to be upon the wing ; and lest de lay should burn your hearts any longer , I give you the cool refreshing word ; join the holy ark ; and away to cut of the devoted enemy / " A table of words and phrases , is furnished by Doct . Boudinot , from Edwards , Adair , and oth ers , to show how clearly the Indian language is from the Hebrew . Some of these Indian words are taken from one tribe , and some from another . In a long savage state , destitute of all aid from letters , a language must roll and change . It is strange that after a lapse of 2500 years , a single word should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the hand of Providence is strik ingly seen in this , to bring that people to light . /z/ The following may afford a specimen of the evidence on this part of the subject . English .

And if they be from the Hebrew , surely these Indians must be the ten tribes of Israel . /z/ Governor Hutchinson observed , ' that " many people ( at the time of the first sctiU-snet.it of New England , ) pleased themselves with a con. ' o ; " I ; ; re , that the Indians in America , are th ! irf of the ten tribes of Israel . " Some- ' dis covered so early , which excited this - .. - timent . This lias been noted as having been the sentiment of Rev. Samuel Sewall , of vice presi dent Willard , and others . Governor I Inu liinson expresses his doubt upon the sub ' . ect , oil account of the dissimilarity of the lartuage of the natives of Massachusetts , and the Hebrew . Any lan guage in a savage state , must , in the course of 200 years , have rolled and varied exceedingly . This is shown to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words introduced among those tribes , which are acknowledged to have their language radically the same . The following facts are enough to answer eve ry objection on this ground . The Indians had no written language . Hence the English schol ar could not see the spelling or the root of an Indian word . And the gutteral pronunciation of the natives was such as to make even the He brew word , that might still be retained , appear wholly a . different word ; especially to those who were looking for no Hebrew language among them . And the following noted idiom of the Indian language was calculated to hide the fact in perfect obscurity , even had it been originally Hebrew , viz. ; the Indian language consists of a multitude of monosyllables added together . Every properly or circumstance of a thing to be mentioned by an Indian , must be noted by a new monosyllable added to its name . Hence it was that the simple word our loves , must be express ed by the following long Indian word , Noonom* ttntammoontcanunonnash . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observes , " They have few radical words . But " they compound their words without end . The words expressive of things lately come to their knowledge ( he says ) are all compounds . And sometimes one word among them includes an entire definition of the thing . " * These things considered of a language among savages , 2500 years after their expulsion from Canaan , must answer every objection aris ing from the fact , that the Indian language ap pears very different from the Hebrew . And they must render it little less than miraculous ( as Mr. Adair says it is ) that after a lapse of so long a period among savages , without a book or letters , a word or phrase properly Hebrew should still be found among them . Yet such words and phrases are found . And many more may yet be found in the compounds of Indian words . I have just now observed , in dropping my eye on a Connecticut Magazine for 1803 , a writer on the Indians in Massachusetts , in its earliest days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped was Abamocko . Here , without any perception of the fact , he furnishes a Hebrew word in compound . Ahua-mccko ; father-mocho . As a tribe of Indians in the south call God , Abba-mingo-ishio ; Father-chief-man . In the latter , we have two Hebrew words ; Abba , father , and Ish , man . Could we make proper allowance for Pagan pronunciation , and find how the syllables in their words ought to be spelled , we might probably find many more of the Hebrew ) roots in their language . See the Connecticut Magazine , Vol . HI . p. 367. /z/ S. The Indians have had their imitation of the ark of the covenant in ancient Israel . Different travellers , and from different regions unite in this . Mr. Adair is full in*his account of it . It is a small square box , made convenient to carry on the back . They never se*t it on the ground , but on logs in low ground where stones are not to be had ; and on stones where they are to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is worthy of notice , ( he says. ) that they never place the ark on the ground , nor sit n the Lare earth when they are carrying it against an enemy . On hilly ground , where sto'hes are plenty , they place it on them . But in level land , upon short logs , always resting them selves ( i. e. the carriers of the ark ) on the same materials . They have also as strong a faith of the power and holiness of their ark , as ever the Israelites retained of theirs . The Indian ark is deemed so sacred and dangerous to touch , either by their own sanctified warriors , or the spoiling enemy , that neither of them dare meddle with it on any account . It is not to be handled by any except the chieftian and his waiter , under penal ty of incurring great evil ; nor would the most inveterate enemy dare to touch it . The leader virtually acts the part of a priest of war , pro tempore , in imitation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boudinot says of this ark , " It may be called the ark of the covenant imitated . " In time of peace it is the charge of their high priests . In their wars , tney make great account of it . The leader ( acting as high priest on that occa sion , ) and his darling waiter , carry it in turns . They deposit in the ark some of their most con secrated articles . The two " carriers of this sa- /z/ symbol , before setting off with it for the war , purify themselves longer than do the rest of the warriors . The waiter bears their ark during a battle . It is strictly forbidden for any one , but the proper officer , to look into it . An enemy , if they capture it , treat it with the same reverence . Doctor Boudinot says , that a gentleman , who was at Ohio , in 1756 , informed him that while , he was there , he saw among the Indians , a stran ger , who appeared very desirous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ark was then standing on a block of wood , covered with a dressed deer skin . A centinel v , as guarding it , armed with a bow and arrow . The centinel finding the intru der pressing ' on , to look into the ark , drew his arrow at his head , and vrould have dropped him on the spot ; but the stranger perceiving his dan ger , fled . Who can doubt ojf the origin of this Indian custom ? And who can resist the evidence it furnishes , that here are the tribes of Israel ? See Num. x. 35 , 33 , and xiv . 44. 4 . The American Indians have practised cir cumcision . Doct . Beat ' , in his journal of a visit to the Indians in Ohic , between fifty and sixty years ago , says , that " an old Indian informed him , that an eld uncle of his . who died about the year 1728 , related to him several customs of for mer times among the Indians ; and among the rest , that circumcieion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men made a mock of it , and it fell into disrepute and was discontinued . " Mr. M'Kenzie informs , that in his travels among the Indians , he was led to believe the same fact , of a tribe far to the north-west ; as stated in the ' Star in the West . ' Doctor Boudinot assures that the eastern Indians inform of its having been prac- /z/ tised among them in times past ; but that latter ly , not being able to give any account of so strange a rite , their young men had opposed it , and it was discontinued . Jmmanuei de Moraez , in. his history of Brazil , says it was practised among the native Brazilians . What savage na tion could ever have conceived of such a rite , had they not descended from Israel . 5 . The native Americans have acknowledged ne , and only one God ; and thty have generally views concerning the one Great Spirit , of which no account can be given , but that they derived them from ancient revelation in Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many gods . But little short of three hundred thousand gods have existed in the bewildered imaginations of the pagan world . Every thing , almost , has been deified by the heathen . Not liking to retain God in their knowledge , and pro fessing themselves to be wise , they became fools ; and they changed the glory of the one living God , into images , and beasts , birds , reptiles , and creep ing things . There has been the most astonishing inclination in the world of mankind to do thus . But here is a new world of savages , chiefly , if not wholly , free from such wild idolatry . Doctor Boudinot ( being assured by many good witness es , ) says of the Indians who have been known in his day ; " They were never known ( whateer mercenary Spanish writers may have written to the contrary ) to pay the least adoration to ima ges or dead persons , to celestial luminaries , to evil spirits , or to any created beings whatever . " Mr. Adair says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes and nations , from Hudion 's LdV to the Mississippi , have ever been to attempt the formation of any image of /z/ God . " Du Pratz was very intimate with the chief of those Indians called " the Guardians of the Temple , " near the Mississippi . He inquir ed of them of the nature of their worship . The chief informed him that they worshipped the great and most perfect Spirit ; and said , " He is so great and powerful , that in comparison with him all others are as nothing . Fie made all things that we see , and all things that we can not see . " The chief went on to speak of God as having made little spirits , called free servants , who always stand before the Great Spirit ready to do his vyill . That " the air is filled with spirits ; some good , some bad ; and that the bad have a chief who is more wicked than the rest . " Here it seems is their traditional notion of good a ; d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . This chief being asked how God made man , replied , that " God kneaded some clay , made it into a little man , and finding it was well formed , he blew on his work , and the man had life and grew up ! " . Being asked of the creation of the wo-nan , he said , " their ancient speech made no mention of any ( inference , only that the man wjs made first . " Moses ' account of the formation of the woman , it seems , had been lost . Mr. Adair is very full in this , that the Indians have but one God , the Great Yohewah , whom they call the great , beneficent , supreme and holy Srit , who dwells above the clouds , and who dwells with good people , and is the only object of worship . " So different are they from all the idolatrous heathen upoa earth . He assures that they hold this great divine Spirit as the immedi ate head of their community ; which opinion he conceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He assures that the /z/ Indians are intoxicated with religious pride , and call all other people the accursed people ; and have time out of mind been accustomed to hold them in great contempt . Their ancestors they boast to have been under the immediate government of Yohewah , who was with them , and directed them by his prophets , while the rest of the world were outlaws , and strangers to the covenant of Yohewah . The Indians thus please themselves ( Mr. Adair assures us ) with the idea that God has chosen them from the rest of man kind as his peculiar people . This , he says , has been the occasion of their hating other people ; and of viewing themselves hated by all men . These things show that they acknowledge but one God . The Peruvians have been spoken of as pay ing adoration to the sun ; and as receiving their race of Inr-is. as children of the sun . in their saccession of twelve monarchies . The Indians have had much of ai apprehension that their one Great Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems , went so far as to embody him in the sun . Here seems a shred of mixture of the Persian idolatry , with the theocracy of Is rael . As the more ancient Israelites caught a degree of the idolatrous distemper of Egypt , , as appears in their golden calf ; so the ten tribes , the time they resided in Media , and before they set off for America , may have blended some idea of fire with their or God . But the veneration the Peruvians had ior their Incas , as children of the Most High , seems but a shred of ancient tra dition from Israel , that their kings were divinely anointed ; arid is so far from being an argument against their being of Israel , that it operates rath* er in favour of the fact . /z/ Doctor Boudinot informs of the southern IBdians of North America , that they had a name for God , which signifies , " the great , beloved , ho ly cause . " And one of their names of God , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a preacher 's being among the Indians at the south , before the American revolution , and beginning to inform them that there is a God who created all things . Upon which they indig nantly replied , " Go about your business , you fool : do not we know there is a God , as well as you ? " In their sacred dances , these authors assure us the Indians sing " Halieluyah Yohewah ; praise to Jah Jehovah . When they return victorious from their wars , they sing , Yo-he-wah ; having been by tradition taught to ascribe the praise to God . The same authors assure us , the Indians make great use of the initials of the mysterious name of God , like the tetragrammanaton of the ancient Hebrews ; or the four radical letters which form the name of Jehovah ; as the Indians pronounce thus , Y-O-He-Wah . That like the ancient Hebrews , they are cautious of mentioning these together , or at once . They sing and repeat the syllables of this name in their sacred dances thus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says ; " After this they begin again ; **27;27;TOOLONG . And fre quently the whole train strike up , hallelu-hallelu halleluyah halleJuyah . " They frequently sing the name of Shilu ( Shiloh , Christ ) with the syl*-lables of the name of God added ; thus , " Shilu **29;56;TOOLONG Shilu-vah-Shilu - wah . " Thus adding to the name of Shilu , the of Jehovah by its sacred s ) iiables . Things /z/ like these have been found among Indians of dif* ferent regions of America . Syllables and letters of the name of G3d have been so transposed in dif ferent ways ; and so strange and gutteral has been , the Indian pronunciation , that it seems it took a long time to perceive that these savages were by tradition pronouncing the names of the God of Is rael . Often have people been informed , and smil ed at the fact , that an Indian , hurt or frightened , usually cries out wah ! This is a part of his tradi tional religion ; O Jah ! or O Lord ! Doctor Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observes ; " They denominate the deity the Great Spirit ; the Great Man above ; and seein to have some general ideas of his gov ernment and providence , universal power and dominion . The immortality of the soul was ev ery where admitted among the Indian tribes . " The Rev. Ithamar Hebard , formerly minister of this place , related the following : That about fifty years ago , a number of men were sent from New-England by the government of Britain into the region of the Mississippi , to form some treaty with the Indians . That while these commission ers were there , having* tarried for some time ; an Indian chief came from the distance of what he called several moons to the westward . Having heard that white men were there , he came to in quire of them where the Great Being dwelt , who made all things . And being informed , through an interpreter , of the divine omnipresence ; he raised his eyes and hands to heaven with great awe and ecstacy.and looking round , and leaping , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The head man of these commissioners had been a profane man ; but this incident cured him , so /z/ that he was not heard to utter another profane word on this tour . This was related to Mr. Hebard by one Elijah Wood , who - was an eye wit ness of the scene , and who was afterward a preacher of the gospel . The son of Mr. Hebard , a settled minister , gives this relation . Let this fact of the Indians generally adhering to one , ai ) d only one God , be contrasted with the polytheism of the world of pagans , and heathen besides ; with the idle and ridiculous notions of heathen gods and goddesses ; and who can doubt of the true origin of the natives of our continent ? They are fatally destitute of proper views of God and religion . But they have brought down by tradition from their remote ancestors , the notion of there being bat one great and true God ; which affords a most substantial argument in favour of their being the ancient Israel . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change has been produced among the In dians . They have , in this period much degene rated as to their traditional religion . Their con nexions with the most degenerate part of the white people , trading among them ; and their knowledge and use of ardent spirit , have pro duced the most deleterious effects . They hove felt less zeal to maintain their own religion 1 , such as it was ; and to transmit their own traditions . Remarkable indeed it is , that they did so dili gently propagate and transmit them , till so com petent a number of good testimonies should be furnished to the civilized and religious world , re lative to their origin . This must have been the great object of divine Providence in causing them so remarkably to transmit their traditions through such numbers of ages . And when the /z/ carefully retained . These are instead of ic pages and religious books . Some of these Indian traditions , as furnished from good authorities , shall be given . Different writers agree that the natives have their historic traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this country , which agree with the account given in Esdras , of their leaving the laud of Media , and going to a land to the north east , to the distance of a year and a half 's jour ney . M'Kenzie gives the following account of the Chepewyan Indians , far to the north-west . He says , " They have also a tradition among them , that they originally came from another country , inhabited by very wicked people , and had traversed a great lake , which was in one place , narr.ow , shallow , and full of islands , where they had suffered great misery ; it being always winter , with ice , and deep snows . At the Cop per Mine River , where they made the first lai d , the ground was covered with copper , over which a body of earth has since been collected to the depth of a man 's height . " Doctor Boudinot speaks of this tradition among the Indians , Some of them call that obstructing water a river . and some a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others not . What a striking description is here found of the passing of the natives of this continent , over from the north east of Asia , to the north-west of America , at Beering 's Straits . These Straits , all agree , are less than forty miles wide , at this period ; and no doubt they have been continually widening . Doctor Williams , in his history of Vermont , says they are but eighteen miles wide . Probably they were not half that width 2500 years ago . And they were full of islands , the Indian tradi- /z/ t/on assures us . Many of those islands may have been washed away 5 as the Indian tradition says , the sea is eating them up ; " as in Dr. Boudinot . Oiher tribes assure us , that their remote fa thers , on their way to this country , " came to a great river which they could not pass ; when God dried up the river that they might pass over . " Here is a traditionary notion among the Indians , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their fathers in some way got over Beering 's Straits . And having a tradition of rivers being dried up before the fathers , they ap plied it to this event . Those straits , after Israel had been detained for a time there , might have been frozen over , in the narrows between the isl ands ; or they might have been passed by canoes , or some craft . The natives of this land , be they who they may , did in fact arrive in this conti nent ; and they probably must have come over those straits . And this might have been done by Israel , as well as by any other people . Relative to their tradition of coming where was abundance of copper ; it is a fact , that at , or near Beer'mg 's Straits , there is a place called Copper Island , from the vast quantities of this metal there found . In Grieve 's history we are informed that copper there covers the shore in abundance ; so that ships might easily be loaded with it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in 1770 to obtain this cop per , but that the ice even in July , was so abun dant , and other difficulties such , that the obiect was ' relinquished . Here , then , those natives made their way to this land ; and brought down the knowledge of this event in their tradition . Doctor Boudinot gives it as from good author ity , that the Indians have a tradition " that the /z/ book which the white people have , was onee theirs . That while they had this hook , things went well with them ; they prospered exceed ingly ; but that other people got it from them ; Unit the Indians lost their credit ; ofiended the Great Spirit , and suffered exceedingly from the neighboring nations ; and that the Great Spirit then took pity on them , and directed them to this country . " There can be no doubt but God did , by his special providence , direct them to some sequestered region of the world , for the reasons which have been already given. * * We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully accords with the things exhibited of them , and of the natives of our land . In Amos viii . 11 , 12 , we read " Behold the days come , saith the Lord God , that 1 will send a famine in the land- ; not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord . And they shall wander from sea to sea , arid from the north even unto the east ; they shall run to and fro , to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it . " This prophecy did relate to the ten tribes . Amos was a prophet to them : he lived not long before their expulsion , from which they have never yet returned . He in the context predicted this expulsion , as then just at hand . See v. 1.2 , 14 . The famine here predicted , was to be fulfill ed while they were in their outcast state . This is cleurly ev ident from the whole connection . The prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of God , but had Wickedly lost it ; as a man in a famine knows he has had bread or food , but now has it not . It implies , they shall feel somethmg what they have lost , and shall wander . They shall rove fn.m sea to sea ; from the north even to the east . They shall set off a north cu:ir ? R , and thence east ; or be led to wander in a north-east direction as far as they can wander- ; from the Mediterranean , whence they set out , to the extremist sea in the opposite di rection north-east ; to the Frozen Ocean ; over its straits , to the Pacific ; and to the Atlantic . They shall run to and fro , over all the vast regions , the dreary wild* , which lie between those extreme seas . They shall retain some general correct idea of God ; but shall find they have lost h ; s word . This they shall not reg-ain , till their long famine shall close in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ac- /z/ M'Kenzie adds the following accounts of- the Chepewyan nation : " They believe also that in ancient times , their ancestors lived till their feet were worn out with walking , and their throats with eating . They describe a deluge , when the waters spread over the whole earth , except the highest mountains ; on the tops of which they preserved themselves . " This tradition of the longevity of the ancients , and of the ilood , must have been from the word of God in ancient Is rael . Abbe Ciavigero assures us , that the natives of Mexico had the tradition , that u there once was a great deluge ; and Tep/i , in order to save him self from being drowned , embarked in a ship , ooai.it noted in Esdras , and with the Indian tradition , ; which meets it ; of their fathers being led into this country ! They have indeed wandered north-east , and from north to east , and oath ; from sea to sea , and from the river to tlv end ? of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famine of the word ; retaining some general view of God , and of their ancient blessings under him . Eat their famine and savage state have still continued . From their savage high priests they have sought the word of the Lord , and from their vague traditions ; but they have not f und it . Bat the following chapter in Amos , engages they shall find aga-ii the holy oracles v. 13 15. u Behold , the days come , sa.hthe Lord , that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine ; and all the hills shall melt . And I will br.ng again the captivity of my people Israel ; and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them , and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them . And I will plant them upon their land ; and they shall no more be pull ed up out of their land , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here are the rapid scene ? , the melting mis sionary events , of our day .

That as the waters abated , he sent out a bird , which remained eating dead bodies . He then seat out a little bird , which returned with a small branch . " Doctor Beattj says , that an Indian in Ohio in formed , that one of their traditions was , " Once the waters had overflowed all the land , and drowned all people then living , except a few , who made a great canoe and were saved . " This Indian added , to Doctor Beatty , that " a long time ago , the people went to build a high place ; that while they were building , they lost their language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bondinot assures us that two ministers of his acquaintance informed him , that they be ing among the Ind a-is away toward the Missis sippi , the Indians there ( who never before saw a white man. ) informed him , that one of their tra ditions was , a great while ago they had a comm ) i father , who had the other people under him . Tnat he . had twelve soas by whom he adminis tered his government ; but the sons behaving illy , they lost this government over the other people . This the two ministers conceived to be a pretty evident traditionary notion concerning Jacob and his twelve sons . Various traditions of the Indians strikingly de note their Hebrew extraction . Doctor Beatty ( mentioned by Mr. Boudinot ) informs of their feast , called the hunter 's feast ; answering , he thinks , to the Pentecost in ancient Israel . He describes it as follows : They choose twelve men , who provide twelve deer . Each of the twelve men cuts afcaplin ; with these they form a tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an altar of sacrifice . Some tribes , he observes , choose but ten men , ten poles and ten stones . Here seems an evident allusion to the twelve tribes ; and also to some idea of the ten separate tribes of Israel . Upon the stones of their altar , they suiTcrcd no tool to pass . No tool might pass upon a certain altar in Israel . The middle joint of the thigh of their game , Doctor Beatty informs , the Indians refuse to eat . Thus did ancient Israel , after the angel had touched the hollow of Jacob 's thi fc h in the sinew that shrank : Gen. xxxii. 25 , 31 , 32 . " In short , ( says Doctor Beatty , ) 1 was astonish ed to find so many of the Jewish customs pre vailing among them ; and began to conclude there was some affinity between them and the Jews . " Col. Smith , in his history of New-Jersey , says of another region of Indians , " They never cat of the hollow of the thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians still further to the north , says , he met with people who con id not help thinking that the Indians were descend ed from the Hebrews , and found in even t some affinity between them .

None who read the law of the passover , c ; n doubt the origin of this . A Christian friend of mine informs me , that he ' -o rue time since read in a book which he now c.rmot name , the account of a man taken at Queb.v , , in Montgomery 's defeat ; of his being car ried far to the north-west by Indians ; and of a feast which they kept , iu. which each had his por tion in a bowl ; that he was charged to be very careful not to injure a bone of it ; that each must cai all his bowl full , or must burn what was left on a tire , burning in the midst for this purpose . The object of the feast he knew not . Tiie Indians have their feasts of first ripe fruit ? , , or of green corn ; and will eat none of their com till a part is thus given to God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with others , unite in these testimonies . In these Indian feasts they have their sacred songs and dances ; singing Halleluyah , Yoliewah , in the syllables which compose the words . What other nation , besides the Hebrews and Indians ever , in this manner , attempted the worship of Jehovah ? The author of the " Star in the West " says ; " May we not suppose that these Indians formerly understood the psalms and divine hymns 1 Otherwise , how came it to pass , that some of all the inhabitants of the extensive regions of North and South America have , and retain , these very expressive Hebrew words , and repeat them so distinctly ; , them after the manner of the Hebrews , in their religious acclamations ? " /z/ The Indian feast of harvest , and annual expi ation of sin , is described by these writers ; and in a way which enforces the conviction that they derived them from ancient Israel . Details are given in the Star in the West . My limits will permit only to hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An Indian daily sacrifice is described . They throw a small piece of the fattest of their meat into the fire , before they eat . They draw their newly killed venison through the fire . The blood they often burn . It is with them a horrid abom ination to eat the blood of their game . This was a Hebrew law . A particular or two of their feasts shall be no ted . Doctor Beatty gives an account of what he saw among the Indians north-west of the Ohio , lie says ; " Before they make use of any of the first fruits of the ground , twelve of their old men meet ; when a deer and some of the first fruits are provided . The deer is divided into twelve parts ; and the corn beaten in a mortar , and pre pared for use by boiling or baking , under the ashes , and of course unleavened . This also is divided into twelve parts . Then these ( twelve ) men hold up the venision , and fruits and pray , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed. ) the bounty of God to them . It is then eaten . After this they freely enjoy the fruits of the earth . On the evening of the same day , ( the Doctor ' ; ; OJPV have another public feast which lool i ! . the passover . A great quantity of veniso. ded , with other things dressed in their . and distributed to all the guests ; of v* eat freely that evening . But that which * ltbrown into the fire and burned ; as /z/ must remain till sun rise the next day ; nor must a bone of the venison be broken . " Mr. Boudinot says , " It is fresh in the memory of the old traders , ( among the Indians ) as we are assured by those who have long lived among them , that formerly none of the numerous na tions of Indians would eat , or even handle any part of the new harvest , till some of it had been oilered up at the yearly festival by the beloved man ( high priest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the light harvest oi ; the past year should almost have forced them to give their women and children of the ripening fruits to sustain life . " Who that reads the laws of Moses , can doubt the origin of these Indian traditions ? The Hebrews were commanded to eat their passover with bitter herbs : Exod. xii . 8 . The Indians have a notable custom of purify ing them selves with bitter herbs and roots . Describing one of their feasts the writer says , " At the end of the notable dance , the old beloved women re turn home to hasten the feast . In the mean time every one at the temple drinks plentifully of the Cussena , and other bitter liquids , to cleanse their sinful bodies , as they suppose . " The Indians have their traditionary notion clearly alluding to the death of Abel , by the mur derous hand of Cain ; as well as one alluding to the longevity of the ancients . More full accounts are given by some of these authors , of the Archi-magus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel was in ducted into office by various ceremonies , and by anointing ; so is the Indian high priest by purifi cation , and by anointing . When the holy gar ments are put upon him , bear 's oil is poured on /z/ his head . And it is slated that the high priests have their resemblances of the various orna ments worn by the ancient high priests ; and even a resemblance of the breast-plate . . These men have been called by the white people , igno rant of Indian customs , jugglers . But they are now ascertained by good witnesses , as a manifest though corrupt succession of the high priesthood in ancient Israel . Bartram says , those , with in ferior priests and prophets , have been maintained in most if not all the tribes . The Indian high priest makes his yearly atone ment for sin . He appears at their temple , ( such as it is ) arrayed in his white deer skin garments , seeming to answer to the ancient ephod . Enter ing on his duty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close by the holi est apartment of their temple ; and puts on his white beads offered by the people . A variety of curious things are described in this dress , by Mr. Adair , as pretty evidently designed imitations of the parts of ancient pontifical dress , which it would exceed my limits to describe . This dress is left in the holy place of their temple , till the hijrh priest comes to officiate again . His breast plate is made of a white conch shell , through which two straps of otter skin pass in two perfo rations ; while white buttons of buck 's horn are superadded , as though in imitation of the pre cious stones on the ancient breast-plate , skin wreath adorns his head , instead of t cient plate of gold . And for the ancient the Archi-magus , has his tuft of white ft ; His holy fire he obtains by rubbing two sti gether ; and his golden bells and pomcgi are formed of the dried spurs of wild tnstrung so as to rattle on his line mocasins* / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high priest ) is addressing his people , and enforcing 4 * the divine speech , " that he calls them " the beloved and holy people , " according to the language concerning ancient Israel . He urges them %c to imitate their virtuous ancestors , " asid " flourishes upoa their beloved land , flowing with milk and honey . " Mr. Adair describes the Indian feasts , and speaks of them as hearing a very near resem blance of the stated feasts in ancient Israel . He gives accounts that when the Indians are about to engage in war , they have their preparatory sacrifices , purifications , and fastings . . He speaks of their daily sacrifice , their ablutions , marriages , divorces , burials , mournings for the dead , sepa rations of women , and punishment of various crimes , as being , in his opiaioa , manifestly of Hebrew origin . Their reckonings of time , Mr. Adair viewed as evidently Hebrew . They begin their year , as did Israel , at the first appearance of new moon after the vernal equinox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub-divisions of the moons . Bartram says , the Indians believe their bigfe priests have intimate communion with the world of spirits ; and that no great design is formed by the ' ' is without his counsel . Thr Wmipoils , far to the west , we learn in C'Ar- ' ' rver 's travels among the western In dia , have their high priest , who pretends to ! macy with the Great Spirit , and to be etel future events ; as is the case with 1'ioes , at the Grand Portage . Certain he thus found among different Indians , /z/ which show them to have been of the same ori gin . Within about eighty years , men inform , that these rites of the high priests have been more neglected . The Indians inform , that in 1747 , the high priest in the Natchez , was struck dead by lightning , while using his invocation for rain . They suppose the Great Spirit to have been an gry with him for some impurity ; and with the . " darting fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to renew the like at tempt . Bartram gives a description of a southern In dia : ! temple . It is a square of small buildings in the centre of their Indian town . The small buildings of one story cover perhaps half an acre , more or less , according to the strength of the In be . In one of these buildings they hold their councils . A part of this building is shut up as a holy of holies ; and it is death fr any but the high priest , to enter it . Here they deposit their most sacred things ; as the physic-pot , rattles , vts , eagle 's tail , and pipe of peace . To this temple u the males ( as in ancient Is rael ) are obliged to assemble three times a year : viz. at the feast of the first ripe fruits ; at the feast for the success of hunting , about the time of the ancient pentecost ; and the great feast for the expiation of sins , about the time of ripe corn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with out a complicated miracle , unless the Indians have descended from the tribes of Israel . Mr. Boudinot informs , that ' - when any of their beloved people die , they soften the thought ot " death by saying , " he is gone to sleep with his be loved fathers . " The ancient pious Hebrew cly- /z/ ing , " fell asleep , and was gathered to his peo ple . " The Indians , when one dies , wash and anoint the body . The Hebrews did the same . Some of the southern Indians hire mourners to bewail and magnify the merits of the dead . Thus did the Hebrews : Jer. ix . 1 7 . And the Indians , as had the Hebrews , have their solemn gongs on such occasions . A religious procession moves round the corpse , singing , Yah , ( Jah . ) Ho , is then sung by the procession . The leader then says He ; all follow . Then Wah is sung by all . Thus they sing the syllables which com pose Jah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east . Lewis and Clark , in their tour to the Pacific , inform that they found among the natives , in those remote regions , receptacles for the dead , always lying east and west ; the door of the tomb to the east , and the bodies in the tombs lying with the face to the east . The Indians , often bury with the corpse a va riety of furniture ; and their best things , if the dead be a first character . The Hebrews did the same . Josephus informs that Hyrcaims , a Maccabee , when Jerusalem was besieged by the Syr ian tyrant , and money was wanted , took from King David 's sepulchre 3000 talents , which had 1300 years before been buried with him . Another noted Hebrew custom the Indians Doctor Boudinot informs , that a worthy rnins ' : er informed him , that as he was preaching vi : ' ! irome Indians ; between the exercises , the vvere brought to an Indian woman present , tl . - ' her son was suddenly drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat oil i ground . Female friends followed* and ? * ( around her . After sitting a season in solemn Siie ice , the m urni ig mother put her hand upon her mouth , an-i then fell forward vv th her face in the dust . Tlie rest all followed the exam #@# f . The men we-it by thernselv r es , and did the same . It is well known that laying the hand on the mouth , and the mouth in the dust , is a distin guished Hebraism . See Micah vii . 16 ; Lam. iii . 29 ; Prov. xxx . 32 . Thus the reader is presented with a few of the historical and religious traditions of the native Americans ; and will judge for himself whether they do not exhibit satisfactory evidence that these natives , are the very tribes of Israel ? So important an argument is furnished on fhi subject , from the Indians ' place of refuge from - tr of blood , tlrat a particular head : $hall be reserved for it , in a succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional evidence be found of their being the descendants of the ten tribes ? It is believed no other nation exhibits such evidence . Whence came the natives of our continent , if they be not the tribes of Israel / And where are ri-. ; sc rrlSji. ' s to be found ? They are to be found . UHJ come to-light , as Israelites ; and this too , about the present period . This results from the prophetic scriptures , and the signs of the times . The delants of Abraham are now soon to be recovL Where shall this branch of them be found as having been providentially preserved , now for 2,500 years , if not in this sequestered land ? Tiutribes of Israel might have found their way hith er , as well as any other people . Some people did find their way hither , and have brought down ail these Hebraisms and traditions , which it seems /z/ as though could be furnished from no other quar ter , than from the comrnomveaith of isn ; t ' .. 7 . The celebratyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to cor roborate the same point . Mr. Perm saw the In dians of Pennsylvania , before they had been af fected with the rude treatment of the white peo ple . And in a letter to a friend in England , he thus writes of those natives ; u 1 found them with like countenances with the Hebrew race ; and their children of so lively a resemblance to them , that a man would think himself in Duke 's piace , or Barry - street , in London , when he sees them . " Here , without the least previous idea of those natives being Israelites , that shrewd man was struck with their perfect resemblance of them ; and with other things which will be no ted . He speaks of their dress and trinkets , as notable , like those of ardent Israel ; their ear3 , nose jewels , bracelets on their aims and Jes , rings ( such as they were ) on their lingers , necklaces , made of polished shells fouid in their rivers , and on their coasts ; bands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of femaies , and various strings of beads adorning several pans of the body . Mr. Peim adds to his friend , that " he consid ered this people as under a dark night ; yet they believed in God and immortality , without the help of metaphysics . For he says , they in formed him that there was a great king , who made them that the souls of the good shall go to Siim . " He adds ; u Their worship consists in two parts , sacriiice and cantieo , ( songs . ) The first is with their first fruits ; and the first buck * Quoted by Dr. Boudiiiot. ft* they kill goes to the fire . " Mr. Perm proceeds to describe their spjcndid feast oi urn ripe iruits , one of which he had attended . He informs ; Ci Ail that go to this feast must take a piece of , money , which is made of the bone of a fi ? li . " " None shall appear before me empty . " He speaks of the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds ; " They reckon by moons ; they oiler their first ripe fruits ; they have a kind of feast of tabernacles ; they are said to lay their altars with twelve stones ; they mourn a year ; they have their separations of women ; with many other things that do not now occur . " Here is a most artless testimony , given by that notable man drawn from his own obser vations , and accounts given by him ; while the thought of this people 's being actually Hebrew , probably was most distant from his mind . 8 . Their having a tribe , answering in - carious respects , to the tribe of Lcvi , sheds further light on this subject . The thought naturally occurs , that if these are the ten tribes , and they have preserved so many of their religious traditions ; should we not be likely to find among them some tradition of a tribe answering to the tribe of Levi f l If we should find something of this , the evi dence of their being the tribes of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nished . The Mohawk tribe were held by the other tribes in great reverence ; and the other tr ? bcs round about them had been accustomed to pay them an annual tribute . Mr. Boudiuot gives the following account of them . " Mr. Golden says , he had bee.i told by old men ( Indians ) in New-England , that when their Indians were ; : t war formerly with the Mohawks , as soon as one ( a Mohawk ) appeared , the Indians would raise a /z/ cry , from hill to hill , a Mohawk ! a Mohawk ! up on which all would flee as sheep before a wolf , without attempting to make the least resistance . And that all the nations around them have for many years , entirely submitted to their advice , and paid them a yearly tribute . And the tribu tary nations dared not to make war or peace , with out the consent of the Mohawks . " Mr. Coidea goes on to state an instance of their speech to the governor of Virginia , in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other tribes . Now , could any thing be found in their name , which might have an allusion to the superiority of the tribe of Levi ; we should think the evi dence very considerable , that here are indeed the descendants of the- part of that tribe which clave to the house of Israel . And here too evi dence seems not wholly wanting . The Hebrew word Mkhokkek , signifies an interpreter of the law , superior . We have , then , a new view of the possible origin of the Mohawks ! 9 . Several prophetic traits of character given of the Hebrews , do accurately apply to the aborigines of America . Intemperance may be first noted . Isaiah , writing about the time of the expulsion of Israel from Canaan , and about to predict their restoration , says ; Isai. xxviii. 1 " Wo to the crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim ; ( Ephraim was a noted name of the ten tribes of Israel . ) The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit and filthiaess ; so that there is no place clean . " In the course of the descriptions of their drun kenness , that of their rejection and restoration ig ibiended ; that the Lord by a mighty one would /z/ cast them down to the earth ; and their glorious beauty should be like that of a rich flower in a fer tile valley , which droops , withers and dies . But in time God would revive it . " In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of this people . " None who know the character of the Indians in relation to intemperance , need to be informed that this picture does most singularly apply to them . Doctor Williams in his history of Vermont , on this trait of Indian character , says ; " No sooner had the Indians tasted of the spirituous liquors brought by the Europeans , than they contracted a new appetite , which they were wholly unable to govern . The old and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , whenever they can obtain liquors , indulge themselves without mode ration and without decency , till universal drunk enness takes place . All the tribes appear to be under the dominion of this appetite , and unable to govern it . " A writer in the Connecticut Magazine assures us of the Indians in Massachusetts , when our fa thers first arrived there ; " As soon as they had a taste of ardent spirits , they discovered a strong appetite for them ; and their thirst soon became insatiable . " Another trait of Hebrew character which sin gularly applies to the Indians , is found in Isai. iii . ' " The bravery of their iir.kiing oniair.cnts , about their feet ; their cauls , and round tines like the moon ; their chains , bracelets , mufflers , bonnets , ornaments of the legs ; head-bands , tablets , car. ; , and nose-jewels ; the mantles , the &s; and the crisping pins . " Ore would ine the prophet was here indeed describing /z/ other people on earth probably bear a resem blance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ex pulsion of Israel . And nothing would be more likely than that their taste for these fleshy orna ments should descend to posterity . For these make the earliest and deepest impressions on the rising generation . 1 0 . The Indians being in tribes , with their heads find names of tribes , affords further light upon this subject . The Hebrews not only had their tribes , and heads of tribes , as have the Indians ; but they had their animal emblems of their tribes . Dan 's emblem was a serpent ; Issachar 's an ass ; Benjamin 's a wolf ; and Judah 's a lion . And this trait of character is not wanting among the na tives of this land . They have their wolf tribe ; their tiger tribe ; panther tribe ; buffalo tribe ; bear tribe ; deer tribe ; raccoon tribe ; eagle tribe , and many others . What other nation on earth bears any resemblance to this ? Here , no doubt , is Hebrew tradition . Various of the emblems given in Jacob 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dan shall be a serpent by the way ; an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that the rider shall fall back wards . Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf ; in the morning he shall devour the prey ; and at night he shall divide the spoil . " Had the prophetic eye rested on the American aborigines , it seems as though no picture could have been more ac curate . 1 1 . Their having an imitation of the ancient city of refuge , evinces the truth of our subject . Their city of refuge has been hinted from rr r . Adair . But as this is so convincing an argument , ( no nation on earth having any thing of the kind , but the ancient Hebrews and the Indians ; ) the reader shall be more particularly instructed on this article . Of one of these places of refuse , Mr. Boudinot says ; " The town of . refuge called Choate , is on a large stream of the Mississippi , five miles above where Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brave English man was protected , after killing an Indian war rior in defence of his property . He told Mr. Ad-air that after some Eioriths slay in this place of refuge , he intended to return to his house in the neighborhood ; but the chiefs told him it would prove fatal to him . So that he was obliged to continue there , till he pacified the friends of the deceased , by presents to their satisfaction . " In the upper country of Muskagee , ( says Doctor Boudinot ) was an old beloved town , called Koosah which is a place of safety for those who kill unclesignedly. " u l ; i almost every Indian nation ( he adds ) there arc several peaceable towns , which are called old beloved , holy , or white towns . It is not within the memory of the oldest people , that blood was ever frhed in them ; although'they often force persons from them , a ad put them elsewhere to death . " " Who can read this , and not be satisfied of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indian character , that thev will pursue one who has killed any of their friends , ever so far , and ever so long , as an aven ger of the blood shed , thus lies clearly open to view . It originated in the permission given to an avenger of blood in the commonwealth of Is rael ; and is found in such a degree , probably , in r nation . /z/ 12 . Other Indian rites , and various other cvn , - siderations , go to evince the fact , that this people are the ten tribes of Israel . Further details are given , and might be enlarged upon : as , religious separations of Indian females , almost exactly an swering to the law in ancient Israel ; their beginn ing their year as did bra el , with the new moon after the vernal equinox ; their special attention paid to new moons , as was paid in Israel ; their greencorn moon , the most lovely of all , even as Israel had their beloved month Abib , which signifies an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed by some of the natives : " Melvenda and Acasta both affirm , that the na tives keep a Jubilee according to the usage in Israel . " The testimony of Edwards , in his " West Indies , " that the striking uniformity of the prejudices and customs of the Caribbee In dians , to the practices of the Jews , has not esca ped the notice of historians , as Gumella , Du Tertre , and others ; " and the various predictions of the final restoration of Israel , bringing them from the ends of the earth , from the west , and ( as one translates it ) " from the going down of the sun . " These things open fruitful sources of evidence . But I have more than equalled my designed limits . It is again asked , is it possible to find an other people on earth exhibiting an equal degree of evidence of their being the ten tribes of Is rael ? Can another people on earth be found ex hibiting one sixth part of the evidence adduced in favour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor miracles wrought , to iniurm who are the ten tribes of Israel . Here is just such evidence as we should rationally look for ; but six times as much of it , as we should /z/ dare to hare expected , after a lapse of 2500 years , with a people without letters . Our abo rigines are essentially distinguished from all oth er pagans on earth , in the uniform belief of most of them of one God ; and their freedom from false gods ; as well as in many other striking things , which appear in their history . How prone have been mankind , in all ages , to idolatry . Hundreds of thousands of false gods , of every foolish description , have existed in the bewildered imaginations of men destitute of rev elation . But the knowledge of the true God was renounced . " As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them up " to almost every description of idolatry . How early did the world ( in several centuries after the flood ) go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patriarchs , and so soon after the terrible admonition of the flood ! The natives of one of the greatest islands of the eastern ocean , are so depraved , that it has not been known that they had the least idea of any Supreme Being . How prone were the Jews and Israel , in ancient times , even under all their rich advantages , to unite in the idolatries of their heathen neigh bours ! But the 70 years captivity of the Jews in Ba bylon , cured them utterly of idolatry , from that day to this . While they have been dispersed , and been infidels relative to Jesus Christ ; they have been firm believers in the Old Testament , and in the one God of Abraham . It is analogous with this to expect , that the ten tribes ( wherever they are ) would be cured , as well as the Jews , of their gross idolatry , and would be kept during their long outcast state , in a situation somewhat resembling that of the Jews , in their speculation /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives of this continent , at least to as great a degree as could be without a bible or letters ; and such has been the case with no other people on earth ! Nothing but the very special power and mercy of God , could have kept these natives in this traditional habit of acknowledging the one only living and true God , as they have done . While they have been dead to the life of religion , as a valley of dry bones ; yet they have strangely been kept from acknowledging any other God but Jehovah , the Great Spirit , who made them and all things . And light , in these last days of wonders , ( when the time for the restoration of Israel and Judah is drawing near ) has been breaking out and accu mulating on this subject , to exhibit this origin of the American natives . It is ascertained in the " Star in the West , " that Spaniards , Portuguese , French , English , Jews , and Christians , men of learning , and the illiterate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements of facts , which go to indicate that these Indians are the descendants of Israel ! Mr. M'Kenzie has travelled from the Atlantic very far to the north-west ; and some of his statements of facts go to the same point . Vari ous of the European visitants to this continent , early after it was known to the civilized world , ex pressed their surprise on finding among the natives things which bore such a resemblance to the his tory of ancient Israel . What account can be given of all this , out that here are Ihe very ten tribes ? These tribes must be somewhere on earth . Where are they ? How can they be known ? Whence came our native Americans ? W T hat other account can be given of their tradi tions , their language , Hebrew words and phrases , /z/ ( the radical language of their tribes ) and ' the broken fragments of the ancient economy of Is rael running through so many of them ? It would be far wilder and more difficult to account for these things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is satisfactory , of having found at last , the very valley of the dry bones of the house of Israel ! The facts stated of them , must on every other principle , appear most unac countable , not to say miraculous . Before any degree of confidence is admitted against the evidences adduced , as though other and more conclusive evidence must point out at ' last , the ten tribes ; let it be recollected , that the divine mode of affording evidence is not always such as human wisdom would dictate . The Jewi had their strong objections against the evidences of the divinity , the resurrection and ascension of Christ . These were not such as they would have chosen . In the midst of such evidences as God saw fit to afford , the Jews required more . " What sign showest thou ? " " How long dost thou make us to doubt ? " " Let him descend from the cross , that we may see and believe . " Naaman had formed his expectations how his cure would be effected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and lay his hand on the sore , and call upon his God and heal him . " And for the mor tifying reverse of this , he turned to go away in a rage . Many things may be very probably fancied concerning the kinds or degrees of evidence , which must at last exhibit the ten tribes to the world . But Providence may adopt a different method . The methods divinely adopted in eve ry point , have usually been such as to stain the . pride of all human glory . The Afghans in Per- /z/ sia may prove to be a small part of the ten tribes . But it is doubted whether their evidence is by any means so full as that of the American na tives . The latter have , to say the least , very considerable of just such kind of evidence , as it would naturally be supposed must bring to light the ten tribes after remaining for millenaries in a savage state . May the subject be duly exam ined , and a correct decision in due time be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th chapter of Isaiah to some people of the last days ; calling them to have a special agency in the recov ery and restoration of the ancient people of God . Many years ago , while writing my Dissertation on the Prophecies , I became much interested in this address of Isaiah ; and in that dissertation , gave a paraphrase . of it ; conceiving ' then it was an address to the people of God in Great Britain . I have since become of a different opinion ; and now apprehend it to he an address to the Chris tian people of the United States of America . To prepare the way for the contemplation of this address , let several things be considered : 1 . In the pi : rings , many addresses are made to nation  --  , or concerning them . Would it no , if no mention were found in the j.rophec ; s new western world ; which was destined by propitious Heaven to make so nguishing a figure both in the political and lous world , in the last days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought can hardly be admitted . 2 . The address in the eighteenth of Isaiah , to be contemplated , is clearly an address to some people concerning events to transpire in thej#s days ; and which are intimately connected with the " battle of that great day of God Almighty , which is still future ; and which is to introduce the Millennium . This appears in verses 5 , 6 , 7 , of the chapter , which will by and by be noted . Hence , 3 . The address can not have been to any an cient nation or people ; as some expositors have inconsiderately supposed . But it must be to a nation of the last days ; a nation now on earth ; a nation to be peculiarly instrumental in the res toration of the Hebrews in the last days . For this is the very object of the address , as will ap pear . The demand in the address is , to go and restore that ancient people of God in the last days ; or at a time intimately connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hostile wicked world , v which shall sweep antichristian nations from the earth , and pre pare the way for the millennial kingdom of Jesus Christ . This will clearly appear . 4 . The address then , is to a nation , that mayseem to have leisure for the important business assigned , when the old and eastern parts of the world are in the effervescence of revolution , and in those struggles which precede dissolution . This consideration fixes the address to a people distinct and distant from those oM lands ; and hence probably to our new world . 5 . If it be a fact , as is apprehended , that the aborigines of our co-ili o : ; i are indeed de scended from the ten tribe* of Israel our ua- /z/ lion , no doubt , must be the people addressed to restore them ; to bring them to the knowledge , of the gospel , and to do with thcnl whatever the God of Abraham designs shall he done . The great and generous Christian people , who occu py much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground of their continent , and hence are the best prepared to meliorate their condi tion , and bring them to the knowledge and order of the God of Israel , must of course be the peo ple to whom this work is assigned . This one consideration would do much toward the decis ion of our question , Who is the nation address ed ? 6 . Various things are found in the predictions of the restoration of God 's ancient people , which strikingly accord with the idea of a great branch of them being recovered from this land , and by the agency of the people of our States . A few of these shall be noted . In the thirtieth and thirty-first chapters of Jer emiah , the prophet treats of the united restora tion of Judah and Israel . These chapters were written about one hundred and twenty years af ter the expulsion of the ten tribes . And in rela tion to the ten tribes , they have never yet had even a primary accomplishment , or any degree of fulfilment . The restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " chap . xxx . 24 : and at the time near the battle of the great day ; see verse 6 8 , 23 , 24 . Much of the substance of these chapters is appropriated to the ten tribes of Israel ; though Judah is expressly to be res tored with them . Of the former , ( having then been outcast for an hundred and twenty years , ) God says ; chap . xxxi. 20 ; " Is Ephraim my dear son ? Is he a pleasant child ? For since I /z/ spake against him , ( or expelled him from Ca naan , ) 1 do earnestly remember him still ; there fore my bowels are troubled for him ; I will sure ly have mercy upon him , sailh the Lord . " The next verse invites and predicts his final restora tion . These yearnings of the divine compas sion for Ephraim ( one noted name of the ten tribes ) are the immediate precursor of his resto ration . " 1 will surely have mercy upon him , saith the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set thine heart toward the high way turn again , O vicgin of Israel ; turn again to these thy cities . " " J will again be the God of all the families of Israel ; and they shall be my people . " " For lo , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Juda'h ; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it . " " Fear thou not , O my servant Jacob , saith the Lord ; neither be dismayed , O Israel ; for lo , I will save thee from ftfar . " " Behold I will bring them from the ' north country , and gather them from ( he coasts of the earth . " In this country " afar " off , these ki coasts of the earth , " they had been in an out cast state . " Because they called thee an outcast saying ; " This is Zion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2000 years none sought af ter the ten tribes . ) These ideas strikingly ac cord with their having been outcasts from the known world , in America . This might with sin gular propriety be called the land afar off , and the coasts of the earth . In the same connexion , when God promises to gather them " from the coasts of the earth , " and says , " they shall come with weeping and with supplication j for I am a father to Israel , and /z/ Ephraim is my first born ; " he adds ; " Hear the word of the Lord , O ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar oif , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him as the shep herd doth his flock . " " Isles afar off ! " Isles in the Hebrew language , signify any lands , ever so extensive , away over great waters . Where can these " isles afar off , " ( these " coasts of the earth " here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lils outcast yet beloved Ephraim , ) where can they be so naturally found as in America ? In other prophets the same things are found . In Isai. xliii . God promises this same restoration of Israel . " But now , thus saith the Lord , that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , Israel ; Fear not , for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine . When thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee . I have loved thee with an everlast ing love ; therefore will I give men for thee , and people for thy life . Fear not , for I am with thee . 1 will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west : I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from far , and ray daughters from the ends of Ike earth . " " Thus saith the Lord , who muketh a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mighty wa ters ; Behold I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert . " In Isai. xi . is this wonderful restora tion . Ephraim and Judah are both restored ; the one from his " dispersed , " the other from his " outcast " state ; and their mutual envies are for ever healed . And the places from which they are recovered are noted ; among which are " the i*les of th sen ; " or lands away over the sea , /z/ and " the four corners of the earth . Certainly then , from America ! This surely is one of the four cornqrs of the earth . Of such a land away over sea , it is predicted , Isai . Ix . 9 ; " Surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , ( or a power expert in navigation , ) to bring my sons from far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same event . " Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Behold I will save my people from the east country , and from the west count , -y ; and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in Jerusalem ; and they shall be my people , and I will he their God . " Here they are saved from the west country ; or as it may be rendered , from the going down of the sun . The going down of the sun from Jerusalem , would be over America . In Zech. x. 8 , 9 , is this same restoration of Ephraim by name ; meaning the ten tribes . " 1 will hiss for them , ( or Caii them , ) and gather them ; for I have re* deemed them . And they shall remember me from far countries ; and they shall live , and their chil dren , and turn again . " Such promises of the restoration of Israel from far countries , from the west , or the going down of the sun , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , from isles afar , their being brought in ships from far , , making their way in the sea , their path in the mighty waters ; these expressions certainly well accord with the ten tribes being brought from America . And such passages imply an agency by which such a resto ration shall be effected . Where shall such an agency be so naturally found , as among a great Christian people , providentially planted on the very ground occupied by the outcast tribes of Israel in their long exilement ; and who are so happily remote from the bloody scenes of Eu- /z/ rope in the last days , as to have leisure for the important business assigned ? Surely then , this business would be assigned , either tacitly or expressly , to our nation . At this conclusion we safely arrive , reasoning a priori . The circumstances of the case enforce it . And we might expect so interesting a duty , relative to an event on which the prophecies so abun dantly rest , would not be left to uncertain deduc tions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the prophetic scriptures with some good degree of confidence , that the assignment of such a task is somewhere to be found . And where so natural to be found as in the prophecy of Isaiah ? He is the most evan gelical prophet ; arid treats largely upon the res toration of his brethren . He lived to behold the expulsion of the ten tribes ; and must have been deeply affected with the event . The expulsion of the ten tribes took place 725 years before Christ . Isaiah is supposed to have begun his ministry about the year 760 before Christ ; 35 years before that expulsion ; and to have contin ued it about 27 years after that event . It is then very natural , to consider his mind as deeply af fected with this event ; with the place of the long exilement of his brethren of Israel ; and as delighted with a view of their final restoration , which he was inspired to foretel . Behold this man of God then , wrapt in the visr ions of the Almighty , casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the final restora tion of his long rejected brethren . He finds pre sented in vision , away over the Mediterranean , and the Atlantic , far in the west or going down of the sun , the continent of their long banish ment . He also beholds in vision a great nation /z/ rising there in the last days ; a land of freedom and religion . He hears the whisper of the Spir it of inspiration , directing him to address that far sequestered and happy land ; and call their at tention to the final restoration of his people , Isaiah xviii . verse 1 . " Ho , land shadowing with wings , which is beyond the rivers of Ethio pia . " Our translators render this address , fci Wo to the land . " But this is manifestly incorrect , as the best expositors agree . The Hebrew par ticle here translated Wo to , is a particle of friend ly calling , as well as of denouncing . And the connexion in any given place , must decide which rendering shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sense decide , that the word is here a friendly call , or address ; as in this pas sage ; " Ho every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters . " The land addressed , lies " beyond the rivers of Ethiopia . " It is agreed that these rivers mean the mouths of the Nile , which enter from Egypt into the south side of the Mediterranean . It is as though the prophet had said ; Thou land beheld in vision away over the mouths of the Nile . Where would such a line strike ? It would glance over the northern edge of the States of Barbary . But could the friendly address to a people of the last days , light on those barbarous Mohammedan shores ? Surely not . No land " shadowing with zcings , " or that would aid the restoration of the Hebrews , is found in those horrid regions . No : the point of compass and the address must have been designed for a new world , seen in that di rection . This address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospitable people found here . Our southern boundary is not far from the latitude of the mouths of the Nile . The /z/ prophetic eye glanced beyond all lands then , known ; and hence no land is named . It must have been a land over the Mediterranean , and the Atlantic . Thou land " shadowing with wings . " The above direction lands the prophetic vision at the point of the western continent , where the two great wings of North and South America meet , as at the body of a great Eagle . This at first might furnish the prophetic imagery of a land " shad owing with wings . " As though the inspiring Spirit had whispered ; The continent of those two great wings shall be found at last most interest ing in relation to your Hebrew brethren . And those two great wings shall prove but an emblem of a great nation then on that continent ; far sequestered from the seat of antichrist , and of tyranny and blood ; and whose asylum for equal rights , liberty , and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of arms . the pro tecting wings of a great Eagle ; which nation in yonder setting of the sun . ( when in the last days , judgments shall be thundering through the na tions of the eastern continent , ) shall be found a realm of peaceful protection to all , who fly from the abodes of despotism to its peaceful retreat ; even as an eagle protects her nest from all harm . Yea , a land that , when all other lands shall be found to have trampled on the Jews , shall be found to have protecting wings for them ; free from such cruelty , and ready to aid them . Verse 2 . " Who sendeth ambassadors by the , sea , even in vessels of bulrushes upon the face of the waters . " It is to be supposed that a great difficulty would at once present itself to the pro phet 's view , when beholding in vision this west ern continent , over the mighty waters of the /z/ Mediterranean , and the Atlantic , and about to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such mighty waters ? The difficulty at once vanishes , by the prophet 's being ascer tained of this characteristic of the people ad dressed . They would be most expert in navi gation . They could traverse the Atlantic , and Mediterranean , and be able to send missionaries to Jerusalem , or to the ends of the earth , in those last days , or convey the Hebrews from one conti nent to another , with an expedition similar to that with which the Nile ( beyond which this new world is beheld ) used to be navigated with the skiifs made of the bulrush , or the rind of the pa pyrus. * Verse 2 , concluded . " Saying , Go ye swift messengers- to a nation scattered and pealed , to a people terrible from the beginning hitherto ; a na tion meted out and trodden down , whose land the rivers have spoiled . " ' Saying ? before the com mand Go , is interpolated in our translation , and destroys the sense ; as though the nation said this to her swift messengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed , q. d . Come thou protecting nation ; I have a great business for you . Collect and restore my ancient people ; that nation whose ancient history has been so re markable and terrible ; that nation so long dis persed , robbed , and insulted in the people of the *Our ftates may claim the characteristic of expert naviga tion , equal at least to any people on earth . Consider our steam-boat navigation , and such accounts as the following ; found in Niles ' Register , of March 22 , 1823 . " Baltimore vessels . The brig Thessalian arrived at Baltimore on Satur day evening last , in 79 days from Lima , and 24 from the sight of the city of Pernambuco , in Brazil ; a distance of 12,000 miles ; averaging six and a quarter miles every hour of her passage . This vessel was , less than eight months ago , on th stocks in this city . " /z/ Jews ; and so long outcast in the ten tribes ; - 6 That people of line , line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great Bible ; ) or . whose on ly hope to find their ancient inheritance must be on the line of divine promise , or the entail of the covenant . As the land addressed is described as away over the mouths of the Nile ; so various characteristics in the address am suggested from thoughts associated with that river , and the peo ple on its banks ; ss the bulrush vessel just not ed ; and here the measuring line . The river Nile periodically overflowed its banks , and swept away the boundaries of every man 's inheritance on its interval . Every man , then , had to depend on a noted line , to measure anew and find his land . So the Hebrews , having by their sins , and expulsion from Canaan , and from the covenant of Abraham , lost all the visible boundaries of their inheritance ; h : : re no ground of hope of re gaining their standing either in Palestine , or in the covenant of grace , but the line of the mere and sovereign promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doubled , line , line ; a mere Hebraism , to form a superlative . As peace , peace , means perfect peace , Isai. xxvi. 3 ; and as goody good , means the best ; so line , line , means super latively of line , or altogether dependent on the mere promise of God . That the allusion is to the event noted is evident from what follows : " Whose land the rivers have spoiled . " Whose inheritance ( in the Holy Land ) has been torn from them , and overrun by neigbouring hostile nations , often symbolized by rivers , even as the lands by the sides of the Nile often had their boundaries swept away by the overflowings of that river . Thus the Romans first , then the Per sians , the Saracens , the Egyptians and the Turks , /z/ have overflowed and possessed the Holy Land . But the line of divine promise will restore it to the Hebrews. * Go thou protecting people ; shadow with thy wings my ancient family , as though Ihe Most High should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ly the isles shall wait for me , ( or lands away over sea from Palest ' - e. ) and the ships of Tarshish first , ( a people expert in navigation ; ) to bring my sons from far . " A far distant land over sea thai ! be engaged in this work . Verse 3 . " All ue. inhulita-it. cf the world and dwellers on the earth , sec ye when he liflclh up the ensign on the mount &ins,; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear yr . " After the land shadowing with wings is under way in fulfilment of the di vine requirement ; an apostrophe is made by the Most High to all nations , to stand and behold the banoer of salvation now erected for his ancient people ; and to hear the great gospel trumpet , the blessed Jubilee , now to be blown for their collection and their freedom . The ancient sil ver trumpets in Israel , collected their solemn as semblies . And the same trumpets , with joyful and peculiar blasts , ushered in the Jubilee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the antitype of the event shall now be ac complished . This standard of salvation at that period , is a notable event in the prophets . See Isai. xi . 12 , where God sets his hand a second time to gather his Hebrew family from all nations and regions * Much perplexity had rested on the pa a ? agf , a nation nf lintel i at ; till the above solution occurred to mind . With thi ' - I am fully satisfied . It is natural , us is Ihe bulrush urivigai ; on . It agrees with facts , and is confirmed by the clause following : " whose laud the river 8 have spoiled . " /z/ beyond sea ; doubtless from America , as well as other nations ; and it is promised , ' ' " He shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dis persed of Judah from the four corners of the earth . " If from the four corners of the earth ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations from which the two great branches of the Hebrews are recovered : Judah from being dispersed among the nations , and Israel from being outcast from the nations ; thrown out of sight of the social world , precisely as they have been in the wilds of America for more than two thousand years . Verse 4 . " For so t/ie Lord said unto me , I will take my rest , and I will consider my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs , and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest . " The event and the figures in this passage are best explained by those found in synchrouical passages , or prophe cies alluding to the same event . And according to them , it is as though the Most High should say . I am now about to renew my ancient dwelling place . I will again have a fued habitation in Canaan ; as Zech. i. 16 : " Thus saith the Lord , I am again returned to Jerusalem with mercies ; my house shall be built in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tbus saith the Lord . I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem . " And the event shall be as " life from the dead " to the nations : Rom. xi . 15 . Therefore , ye gentile lands , now behold . I will now be to rny ancient heritage like the genial heat of the sun to promote vege tation after the death of winter ; as Isai. xxvi. 19 , " Thy dew is as the dew of herbs , " which in the spring shall vegetate . And I will be like the fertile , cooling cloud in the sultry heat of bar- /z/ vest . " The Hebrews shall now become " as the tender grass springing out of the earth , by the clear shining after rain ; " 2 Sarn. xxiii. 4 . Yes , " I will be as the dew unto Israel ; he shall grow as the lily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon ; His branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . The nations shall behold this fulfil rne at of divine grace to Israel , and shall find instruments raised up adequate to the work . Bat a tremendous scene to the antichristian world shall be found intimately connected . Verse 5 . " For afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with prun ing hooks , and take away and cut down the bran ches Or , near the fulfilment of this event of the last days , a vast scene is to be accomplished . Prophetic notice is ever given relative to that period , that the salvation of the friends of Zion shall be ushered in with a proportionable des truction to her enemies . The harvest and vint age of divine wrath , called " the battle of that great day of God Almighty , " must be accomplish ed ; and at the time of the restoration of the Hebrews , that tremendous event shall be at the doors . As in the natural vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which soon reaches the size of the full grapes , indicat ing that the vintage is near ; so at the time of the service here divinely demanded , wickedness shall have blossomed ; pride shall have budded in an tichristian realms . The sour grapes of their tyranny , violence , and licentiousness , will be found to be arriving at their growth ; indicating that the time for the casting of the vine of the /z/ fcarth into the wine press of the wrath of God , is jii-.t ai hand . Verse 6 . " They shall be left together unto tht fowls of the mountains , and the beasts of the earth ; and the fowls shall summer upon them , and the beasts of the earth shall winter upon /Acm . " Soon the most prominent branches of the antichristian vine of the earth , shall be col lected arid trodden upon the mountains of Israel , in the noted scene of Armageddon ; Rev. xvi . 16 . The passage noted in Ezek. xxxix. 17 20 , ( at the time of the slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an illustration of the text , ) shall then be accomplished . " nd thou son of man , thus saith the Lord God , Speak unto every feathered fowl , and to every beast of the field , Assemble yourselves , and come ; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that do sacrifice for you , even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel , that ye may eat flesh , and drink blood . Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty , and drink the blood of the princes of the earth ; of rams , of lambs , and of goats , of bullocks , all of them failings of Bashau . And ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drun ken , of my sacrifice which I sacrificed for you . Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord God . " Also the further illustration of the same , Rev. xix. 17 , 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather your selves together unto the supper of the great God ; That ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and /z/ the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great . " Verse 7 . " At that time shall the present be , brought unto the Lord of hosts of a people scatter ed and pealed , and from a people terrible from the beginning hitherto ; a nation meted out and trodden under foot , whose land the , rivers have spoiled , to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts , the Mount Zion . " Just at that period of the world , the present which I claim of you shall be brought to the Lord of hosts , of that scatter ed and outcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their enemies by the presence and power of their God with them ; that people of " /me , /me , " or depending solely on the meas uring line of promise , or the entail of the cove nant , found in the sacred oracles for their resto ration to their ancient inheritance in the church of God , arid in the promised land ; inasmuch as the boundaries of their inheritance in both these respects have long since been swept away . A present of this people must be brought by you , sequestered land shadowing with wings , unto the place of the name of the Lord of hosts , the Mount Zion . Ye friends of God in the land addressed ; can you read this prophetic direction of the ancient prophet Isaiah , without having your hearts burn within you ? Surely you can not , if you can view it as an address of the Most High to you . God here exalts you , in the last days , the age of terror and blood , as high as the standard to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the mountains . " Nor is this the only passage , in which this your exaltation is recognized . See the same honour alluded to , in Zeph. iii . 10 . There , nearly connected with the battle of the /z/ great day of God , in which he there asserts he " will gather the nations , and assemble the king doms , to pour upon them his indignation , even all his fierce anger , and all the earth shall be devour ed with the fire of his jealousy ; " and that he will then " turn to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the Lord , and serve him with one consent ; " he informs , as in the address in Isaiah ; " From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia , my suppliants ( or a people who are my worshippers , ) shall bring mine otter ing , even the daughter of my dispersed , ( as the verse should be read . ) Here is the same peo ple , away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are called God 's suppliants , and who , in those days of vengeance , are to bring their offering to God , consisting of the descend ants of his ancient people . If these views be correct , Christians in our land may well bless God that it is their happy lot to live in this land shadowing with wings ; this protecting realm , an asylum of liberty and reli religion ; a land so distant from the seat of antichrist and of the judgments to be thundered down on old corrupt establishments in the last days . And their devout gratitude to Heaven ought to rise , for the blessing of having their existence so near the period alluded to in this sublime prediction , when this land of liberty is beginning to feel her distinguishing immunities compared with the es tablishments of tyranny and corruption in the old continent . We may rejoice to have our earthly lot with a people of whom such honorable men tion is made by the prophetic spirit of old ; and to whom so noble a work is assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the meaning and fulfilment of this prophetic chap- /z/ ter , which is most rich in sentiment , and which will not fail of accomplishment . The great argument found in this sacred ad dress , to induce to a compliance with the duty demanded , is , the terrors of the days of ven geance on eastern corrupt nations ; which seems to imply some good degree of exemption in our own case , and our happy leisure for the business assigned . Heaven will show despotic nations , and old corrupt empires , the difference between them , and a land " shadowing with wings ; " a happy asylum of liberty and religion , in the west . Can a motive be wanting to induce us to main tain the character implied in this address , and to obey the injunction of Heaven here urged upon us ? Should any say , what can he done ? Let this be the reply ; be devoutly disposed and pre pared to obey ; and Heaven will , in due time , make the duty plain . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid every at tempt for the conversion of the Jews and Israel ; and God will be his own interpreter , and will make the duty plain . A leading step has already been taken in a Je rusalem mission . This may prove , in relation to a fulfilment of our text , a cloud like a man 's hand , which shall afford a sound of great rain ; and shall water the hills of ancient Zion . How great effects spring from little causes ! A purling stream from the threshold of the sanctuary , soon rises to the ankles , to the knees , to the loins , to an unfordable river , which heals the Dead sea ; Ezek. xlvii . Already has the bulrush vessel slip ped from the " land shadowing with wings , " across the mighty waters , over which the prophetic eye glanced ; over the Atlantic and the Mediterranean , by the mouths of the " rivers of Ethiopia , " and /z/ has landed her " ambassadors for a Jerusalem mission ! Bless the Lord , O children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of the going down of the sun . This may shed an incip ient lustre on the noted passage in our evangeli cal prophet . It may prove to the children of Abraham , in these days of signal phenomena , a morning rising in the west ! Let us , dear coun trymen , second this attempt with our interces sions , our contributions , and our influence . May all societies formed in behalf of the Jews , and all solicitations in their favour , meet our most fervent patronage . And God will not fail of fulfilling by us his gracious designs . The blessed business will be brought within our reach , and will be ac complished . The ten tribes , as well as the Jews , belong to the " nation scattered and pealed , and terrible from the beginning .

And all who fear God will leap for joy . that as the Jerusalem mission is already under way , so missions to these tribes of Israel are already un der way ! Let us then , in view of the evidence providen tially afforded , that we have found the long ban ished tribes of Israel , seat ourselves as at the feet of Isaiah ; hear him sighing with deep affliction at the long exilement of his brethren of Israel , and in vision beholding this land of their banish ment . Hear the Spirit of Inspiration suggesting to his anxious mind ; There is the land , the long /z/ exilement of your brethren of Israel .

Unfold to them their su perlative line of the entail of the covenant ; that * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fathers ' sakes ; " that they were for their sins excluded for this long period , until the fulness of the gentiles be come in , and so all Israel shall be saved . Go , thou nation highly distinguished in the last days ; save the remnant of my people . Bring me a present of them " to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts , the Mount Zion . " NOTE . I have lately been informed that a Dr. M'DounaM has published something on this chapter similar to what I have written . What his ideas particularly are , I know not , as I have never been favoured with a sight of the book , nor seen any one who could give any particular account of his scheme . /z/ 1 . IT becomes us to be deeply affected with the excommunication of the ancient people of God . In the temporary rejection of those two branches of the Hebrew nation , the truth is sol emnly enforced , that the God of Zion is a God of government ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executeth . The casting out of the ten tribes for their impious idolatries , is full of instruction . The wonders God had done for them , and all their privileges in the land of promise , could not save , when they rejected the stated place of his worship , and united in the abominations of the open enemies of God . They should be hurled from the promised land , and abandoned to a state of savage wretchedness , for two and a half millinaries . Their sin in those dark ages of the old dispensation was no trifle . Its consequence is held up as an awful warning to the world . It impresses the following lan guage ; " Know thou arid see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord , " To that event people under evangelical privileges ought to turn their eyes and take the solemn warning . The God of Abraham is a God of judgment ; while blessed are all they that put their trust in him . The judgments of Heaven on the Jews were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed come in a day when they looked riot for iiim , and in an hour when they were not /z/ aware ; and did cut them asunder . He came and miserably destroyed those husbandmen , and burned up their cities , as he foretold . Upon their turning him off with hypocrisy and willworship , and rejecting the Saviour , the denuncU ation , " Cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ? " was fulfilled with unprecedented de cision . Let all rejectors of Christ , behold and tremble . The Jews were confident in a fancied security , to the last . But an impious confidence can never save . It is but a dead calm before a fatal catastrophe . Such presumptuous leaning upon the Lord , and saying , " Is not the Lord among us ? no evil shall come upon us ; " was so far from saving , that it was a sure precursor of perdition , and of the coming of wrath upon them to the uttermost . Let gospel rejectors beware . " Behold , ye despisers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that thinketh he standcth , take heed lest he fall . " 2 . How evident and rich is the entail of the covenant which will recover the two branches of the house of Israel ! Truly they are u a nation of /me , line ; " ( Isai. xviii . 2 , in the Hebrew , and margin of the great Bible . ) Though they be in fidels , and rejected , and as touching the gospel are enemies for our sakes ; yet as touching the election , ( the entail of the covenant , ) they arc beloved for the fathers ' sakes ; Rom. xi . 28 . This entail ensures their ingrafting again into their own olive tree , which shall be as life from the dead to the nations . This is the infallible hold upon them , which shall finally recover them again to Palestine , and to the covenant of their God . It is upon this covenant-hold upon them , that the God of Abraham promises to take away their stony heart out of their flesh , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clean wa ter , and to make them clean ; to put his Spirit within them and cause them to walk in his stat utes , and make them keep his judgments and do them ; Ezek. xxxvi. 24 27 . It is upon this en tail , that God thus engages to bring them in un der his new covenant , or the Christian dispensa tion ; that their children shall be as aforetimes , and their congregations established before him ; and " that all who see them shall acknowledge they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed ; " " that they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them . " It will then be understood , that though blindness in part had happened to Israel , it was that the gentiles might take their place , and only till the fulness of the gentiles be come in ; and then all Israel shall be saved . The Jewish church will thence be a kind of capital and model of the Christian world ; see Isai . Ix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same tenor . The entail of the covenant may be expected thenceforth to have its proper and perfect effect in the fulfilment of such promises as the follow ing , which relate to that period ; " I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring ; and they shall spring up as among the grass , as willows by the water cours es ; Isai. xliv 3 , 4 . " As for me , this is my cov enant with them , saith the Lord . My spirit that is upon thee , and my words which I have put in thy mouth , shall not depart out of thy mouth , nor out of the mouth of thy seed , nor out of the mouth of thy seed 's seed , saith the Lord , from henceforth and forever ; " Isai. lix. 21 . This will indeed bring a season of salvation to man . /z/ 3 . On reading the prophetic scriptures rela tive to the restoration of the Hebrews , and the calls of Heaven to aid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first to be done relative to this restoration ? The first object , no doubt , must be , to christianize them , and wait the leadings of Providence relative to any fur ther event . God will in due time , be ( to all who are willing to wait on him ) his own interpreter ; and to such he will make the path of duty plain . In his own time and way , after his ancient peo ple shall be duly instructed , and taught the Chris tian religion , God will open the door for the ful filment of his designs relative to any local resto ration ; and will bring that part of them , whom he designs , to their ancient home . All the Jews did not return to Palestine from their seventy years captivity . Many chose to continue where they were planted in the east . Something of the game may be realized in the final restoration of Judah and Israel . God will take one of a fami ly , and two of a city , and bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time be of fered , to return to the land of their fathers , where they may form a kind of centre or capital to the cause of Christ on earth . Relative to many particulars of the event , the holy oracles have not expressed . They have strongly mark ed the outlines or leading facts of the ntoration ; and the unrevealcd particulars , the events of Providence must unfold . That great num bers will return , there seems not room U , doi bt . But the actual proposition to return , will doubt less be a free-will offering of those whose hearts God shall incline , The first duty : ii ' : st be to rerover them to the visible kingdom of Christ , To /z/ this our prayers , alms , and all due exertions must devoutly tend . 4 . Viewing the aborigines of America as the out cast tribes of Israel ; an interesting view is given of some prophetic passages , which appear near ly connected with their restoration . In Isai. xl . 3 , relative to this restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness ; Prepare ye the way of the Lord ; make straight in the desart a high way for our God . " This received a prima ry and typical fulfilment in the ministry of John the Baptist , in the wilderness of Judea , to intro duce Christ . Hence the passage was applied to him . But it was to receive its ultimate and most interesting fulfilment at a period connected with the commencement of the Millennium , when " the glory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; " as the subsequent text decides . It is intimately connected with the restoration of the Hebrews ; as appears in its context . u Comfort ye , comfort ye , my people , saith your God . Speak ye comfortably to Jeru salem , ( a name here put for all the Hebrew fam ily , as it was their capital in the days of David and Solomon , ) and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord 's hand double for all her sins . " Here is the final Hebrew res toration , after the time of their doubly long cor rective rejection for their sins shall have expir ed . The voice in the wilderness then follows , as the great means of this restoration . A wilderness has justly been considered as a symbol of a region of moral darkness and spirit ual death . It has been considered as a symbol of the heathen world ; and it is a . striking en /z/ Mem of it . And the emblem receives strength from the consideration , that it is in a sense liter ally true . The voice , which restores Israel , is heard in the vast wilderness of America , a literal wilderness of thousands of miles , where the dry hones of the outcasts of Israel - have for thou sands of years been scattered . The voice crying in the wilderness has a special appropriation to these Hebrews . As it had a kind of literal ful filment in the preaching of the forerunner John , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have a kind of literal fulfilment , upon a much greater scale , in the missions , which shall recover the ten tribes from the vast wilderness of America . Of the same period and event , the same evan gelical prophet says , Isai. xxxv. 1 . " The wil derness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose ; it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing . The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it , and tbe excel lency of Carmel and Sharon ; they shall see the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God . " In such passages , while the prediction is to have its mystical and full accomplishment in the conversion of the heathen world to God ; the prophetic eye evidently rested with signal pleasure , on a literal restoration of his long lost brethren , as involved in the event , and as fur nishing the ground of the figure . They will be literally* and the fulness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness of Judea in a small degree rejoiced and blossomed as the rose , when John the Baptist performed his ministry in it ; so the wilderness and solitary place of our vast conti /z/ went , containing the lost tribes of the house of Israel , will , on a most enlarged scale , rejoice and blossom as the rose , when the long lost tribes shall be found there , and shall be gathered to Zion . The event in relation to these ancient heirs of the covenant , stated in the last verse of this chapter , will then receive a signal fulfilment ; " And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy up on their heads ; they shall obtain joy and glad ness , arid sorrow and sighing shall flee away . " Upon this final restoration of his brethren , this prophet exults in lofty strains . Several of the many of these strains shall be here inserted . Isai , xlix . Listen O isles unto me ; ( or ye lands away over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make all my mountains away ; and my high way shall be exalted . Behold these shall come from /r ; and lo , these from the north , and from the west / and these from the land of Sinim . Sing , O heavens ; and be joyful , O earth ; and break forth into singing , O mountains ; for the Lord hath comforted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted . " Such texts have a special allusion to the lost tribes of the house of Israel . And their being called over mountains , arid over seas , from the west , and from afar , re ceives an emphasis from the consideration of their being gathered from the vast wilds of Amer ica . With the prophet Hosea , the rejection and re covery of the ten tribes are a great object . In chapter 2d , their rejection , and the cause of it , are stated , and also a promise of their return . God threatens to strip them naked , and make them as a wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of Baalim , wherein she burned in- cense to them ; " i. e. to her false gods . This visiting upon her her idolatries , was to be done in her subsequent outcast state , in which God there says ; " she is not ray wife , neither ami her husband . " But he says , v. 1 4 " Therefore , behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her . And I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt . " Here is Israel 's restoration ; and it is from the wilderness , where long they had been planted during the period of their outcast state . In this wilderness , God eventually speaks com fortably to them , and restores them , as he restor ed from Egypt . Here God gives them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . " The first encampment of the Hebrews in the valley of Achor , was to them a pledge of their eventual possession of the promised land , after the Lord had there turned from the fierceness of his wrath ; Josh. vii . 26 . Upon the same event God says ; Isai. xliii. 19 , 20 ; " Behold I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert . The beasts of the field shall honour me ; the dragons and the owls ; because I give water in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , to my chosen . " If such texts have a glorious , general , mystical ful filment in the conversion of pagan lands ; yet this does not preclude , but rather implies the fact , that the people whose restoration is in them particularly foretold , shall be recovered from a vast wilderness ; and their conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owls of the desert . Rivers of knowledge and grace shall in such wilds be opened for God 's chosen . It will then truly be fulfilled , that God in com forting Zion , will " make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of the Lord ; " Isai. li . 3 . Such passages will have a degree of both literal and mystical fulfilment . A signal beauty will then be discovered in such passages as the following ; Isai. xli. 14 . " Fear not , thou worm Jacob , and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , saith the Lord Gud , thy Redeem er , the Holy One of Israel . I will open rivers in the high places , and fountains in the midst of vallies : I will make the wilderness a pool of wa ter , and the dry land springs of water . I will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; and I will set in the desert the fir tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may see and know and understand together , that the hand of the Lord hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it . " The view given of the place of the long banishment of the ten tribes , gives a lustre to such predictions of their restoration. - These will have a striking fulfilment in the vast wilds of our continent , when the glad tidings of salvation shall be carried to the natives of these extensive dreary forests , and those regions of wretchedness and death shall become vocal with the high praises of God , sung by his ancient Is rael. 5 . If it be a fact that the native Americans are the tribes of Israel , new evidence is hence furnished of the divinity of our holy scriptures . A new field of evidence is here opened from a race of men , " outcast " from all civil society for /z/ a long course of centuries . Impressed on these wild tenants of the forest , tkese children of na ture , without books or letters , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found of the truth of ancient revelation . The intelligent vindicator of the word of God has never feared to meet the infidel on failground . His triumph has not been less certain than that of David against Goliah . But in the view taken of the natives of our continent , the believer will find additional arguments , in which to triumph . He will find more than " five smooth stones taken out of the brook , " ( 1 Sam . xvi . 40 , ) each one of which is sufficient to sink into the head of an impious Goliah , challenging the God of Israel . Let the unbeliever in revelations undertake lo answer the following questions . Whence have the greater part of the American natives been taught the being of one and only one God ; when all other heathen nations have lost all such knowledge , and believe in many false gods ? Whence have the Indians , or most of them , been kept from gross idolatry , which has covered the rest of the heathen world ? and to which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them been taught that the name of the one God , the Great Spirit above , is Yohewah , Ale. , Yah , ( Hebrew names of God , ) who made all things , and to whom alone wor ship is due * ? Who taught any of them that God , at first , made one man from earth ; formed him well : , and breathed him into life ? and that God made good and bad spirits ; the latter of whom have a prince over thm ? /z/ Whence was the idea among these untutored savages , that Yohewah was once the covenant God of their nation ; and the rest of the world were out of covenant with him , the accursed people ? Whence their ideas that their ancestors once had the book of God ; and then were happy ; but that they lost it ; and then became miserable ; but that they will have this book again at some time ? Whence their notion that their fathers once had the Spirit of God to work miracles , and to foretel future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple of Yohewah ; a holy of holies in it , into which no common people may enter , or look ? Who taught him a succession of high priests ? that this priest must be inducted into office by purifications , and anointing ? that he must appear in an appropriate habiliment , the form of which descended from their fathers of remote antiquity ? Whence their custom of this priest 's making a yearly atonement , in or near the holy apart ment of their temple ? Whence their three annual feasts , which well accord to the three great feasts in Israel ? Whence came their peculiar feast , in which a bone of the sacrifice may not be broken ; and all that is prepared must be eaten ; or burned before the next morning sun ? Whence a custom of their males appearing thre times annually before God at the temple ? Who taught wild savages of the desert to main tain places of refuge from the avenger of blood ; ; old , beloved , white towns / " ' Who taught them to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred things ; /z/ to be borne against their enemies by one purified by strict rites ? That no one but the sanctified keeper might look into this ark ; and the enemy feeling the same reverence for it , as the friends ? Wheace came the deep and extensive impress ion among these savage tribes , that the hollow of the thigh of no animal may be eaten ? Let the infidel inform how these savages ( so long excluded from all intercourse with the reli gious or civilized world ) came by the rite of cir cumcision ? and some of them an idea of a Ju bilee ? Whence their idea of an old divine speech ; that they mast imitate their virtuous ancestors , enforced by u flourishing upon a land flowing with milk and honey ? " Whence their notion of the ancient flood ? and of the longevity of the ancients ? also of the con fusion of the language of man at building a high place ? evidently meaning the scene at Babel . How came these wild human herds of the de sert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases as accord with no other language on earth ? See the table furnished , page 90 . Who taught them to sing , Halleluyah , Yohewah , Yah , Shilu Yohewah ; and to make the sa cred use they do of the syllables , which compose the names of God ? singing them in their reli gious dances , and in their customs ; thus ascrib ing all the praise to Yohewah ? I ask not , who taught them the spirit or holiness of such reli gious forms ? For probably they have little or no intelligent meaning . But whence have they brought down these traditional forms ? How came their reckoning of time so well to accord with that of ancient Israel ? /z/ Whence their tradition of twelve men , in prepar ing for a feast similar to the ancient feast of taber nacles ; taking twelve poles , forming their booths ; and their altar of twelve stones , on which no tool may pass ; and here offering their twelve sacri fices ? and some tribes proceeding by the number ten instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their subsequent ten , after the revolt . Whence came their tradition of purifying them selves with bitter vegetables ? also fasting , and purifying themselves , when going to war ? Who taught them that at death their beloved people sleep , and go to their fathers ? Whence their custom of washing and anoint ing their dead ; and some of them of hiring mourners to bewail them ; and of singing round the corpse ( before they bury it ) the syllables of Yah , Yohewah ? How came they " by their tradition answering to the ancient Jewish separations of women ? also a tradition of taking their shoes from their feet on solemn occasions ? Whence were some of them taught in deep mourning to lay their hand on their mouth , and their mouth in the dust ? And whence came their tradition of their an cient father with his twelve sons , ruling over others ? and the malconduct of these twelve sons , till they lost their pre-eminence ? Let it be remembered , it is not pretended that all the savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are not . But it is contended that the whole of these things have been found among their different tribes in our continent , within a hundred years . A fragment of these Hebrew traditions has been found among one tribe ; and /z/ another fragment among another ; and some of tn most striking of these traditions have been found among various and very distant tribes ; as has ap peared in the recital from various authors , tra ders and travellers . Let the unbeliever in revelation set himself to account for these events . No account can be given of them , but that they were derived from ancient revelation in Israel . And hence in the outcast state of the ten tribes of Israel , ( in their huge valley of dry bones , in this vast new world , ) we find presented a volume of new evidence of the divinity of the Old Testament ; and hence of the New ; for the latter rests on the former , as a building rests on its foundation . If the one is divine ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are assured by the chief apostle to the ger.iilcs. that the restoration of the ancient people of God in the last days , when " all Israel shall be saved , ' * ' shall be to the nations " as life from the dead ; " Rom. xi . 15 . Its new and demon strative evidence of the glorious truth of revela tion , will confound infidelity itself ; and fill the world with light and glory . These Indian tradi tions may be viewed as beginning to exhibit to the world their quota of this new evidence . The earthquake , at the time of our Savior 's giv ing up of the ghost , which rent the rocks , may be said thus to have opened many mouths ( perhaps over the face of the earth ) tacitly to proclaim the event . It may be said in figure ; " The stones cried out ! " ( Luke xix. 40 . ) In our sub ject , we find a powerful corresponding evidence of the truth of revelation , extending through a wild continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . st ti. - ive been or i.:lit dovu from 725 iKiibi'c die Christian era. /z/ The preservation of the Jews , as a distinct people , for eighteen centuries , has been justly viewed as a kind of standing miracle in support of the truth of revelation . But the arguments furnished from the preservation and traditions of the ten tribes , in the wilds of America from a much longer period , must be viewed as furnish ing , if possible , a more commanding testimony . And it is precisely such evidence as must have been expected in the long outcast tribes of Is rael , whenever they should come to light ; and just such evidence as must rationally be expected to bring them to the knowledge of the civilized world . The evidence discovered among the various tribes of Indians , of the truth of their Hebrew extraction , and of the divinity of the Old Tes tament , seems almost like finding , in the various regions of the wilds of America , various scraps of an ancient Hebrew Old Testament ; one in one wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evident Hebrew language and character , though much defaced by the lapse of ages . Surely such an event , when attended with concomitant evidence that it could be no imposition , must silence the unbeliever in ancient revelation ; and add a new and powerful item to the evidences already furnished upon so in teresting a subject . The evidence , actually fur nished in the traditions of the savages of Ame rica , suggest the suppositions just made ; , but are of a far more substantial character . It is con tended that they furnish the very evidence , long desired , of the existence , and present state of the ten tribes of Israel . /z/ THE Rev. Dr. Morse in his report of his tour among the Indians at the west , made under commission from ow gov ernment , in 1820 , to ascertain the actual state of the Indians in our country , says ; " It is matter of surprise , that the In dians , situated , as they have been for so many successive ages and generations , without hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading or writing , should have preserved their various languages in the manner they have done . Many of them are copious , capable of regular grammatical analysis , possess great strength , gracefulness , and beauty of expression , They are highly metaphorical in their character ; and in this and other respects resemble the Hebrew . This resemblance in the language , and the similarity of many of their reli gious customs , &c.; to those of the Jews , certainly give plausi bility to the ingenious theory of Dr. Boudinot , exhibited in his interesting work , entitled " The Star in the West . " A faithful and thorough examination of the various languages of the Indian tribes , wjpuld probably show that there are very few of them that are throughout radically different . The differences of these languages are mostly differences of dialect . " The various Indian tribes , visited by Dr. Morse , had their Great Spirit . Speaking of the manners and customs of the Sauks , Fox tribe , Pattowattamies , and others , he says : " Other feasts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of one of these feasts , he says ; " They seat them selves in a circle on the ground ; when one of the guests places before each person a'wooden bowl with his portion of the feast , and they commence eating . When each man 's portion is eatea ; the bones are collected and put into a wood en bowl , and thrown into the river , or burnt . The whole of the feast must be eate . If any one can not eat his part of it , he passes his dish , with a piece of tobacco to his neighbour , and he eats it ; and the guests then retire . Those who make the feast never eat any part of it themselves . They say they give their part of it to the Great Spirit . " Here seems man ifestly the same feast noted by other authors among other and different tribes in the different parts of the continent , and probably answering to the passover in ancient Israel . The /z/ different and distant tribes have their circumstantial differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a broken tradition of thepassover . Another tradition from a Hebrew rite the Doctor states , lie says : " The women of these nations are very particular to remove from their lodges to one erected for that particular purpose , at such seasons as were customarily obseivedby Jewish women , according to the law of Moses . No article of furniture ever used in this lodge , is ever used in any other ; Dot even the steel and the flint with which they strike fire . No man approaches this lodge , while a woman occupies it . " The existence of this extensive Indian rite is fully ascertain ed . And of its origin there appears but very little room to doubt . This writer says : u The belief of these Indians relative to their creation is not very unlike our own . Masco , one of the chiefs of the Sauk , informed me , that they believed that the Great Spirit in the first place , created from the dust of the earth two men ; but finding that these alone would not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made two women . " Of the descendants of these two pair , they say , " th'at they were all one nation , until they behaved so badly , that the Great Spirit came among them , and talked different languages to them ; which caused them to separate and form different nations . " Here are manifest broken frag ments of Moses ' history of creation , and of the confusion of language at Babel . " I asked ( says Dr. M. ) how they sup posed white men were made ? He replied that Indians sup posed the Great Spirit made them of the fine dust of ths earth , as they know more than Indians . " Dr. M. gives an account of their holding to a future state ; and to some kinds of reward for the good , and of punishments for the wicked . He informs from a Major Cumming* , that the Indians arc very suspicious of some evil intent , when questioned by the Americans ; and that there is no way to obtain a full know ledge of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country . This may account for the fact that their tra ditions ( which seems manifestly Hebrew ) were kept so long and to so great a degree , from the knowledge of our people . Relative t their manner of transacting their public busi ness , they informed Dr. M. " We open our council by smok ing a pipe selected for the occasion ; and we address the au dience through a speaker chosen for the purpose ; first in-oking the Great Spirit to inspire us with wisdom . We open our council in the name of the Great Spirit , and close with the same . " He informs that the Indians " before attending on treaties , great councils , or any other important national business , /z/ always sacrifice in order to obtain the good will of the G rent Spirit . And adds ; " There are no people more frequent or fervent in their acknowledgements of gratitude to God . Their belief in him is universal ; and their confidence astonishingly strong . " Speaking of their feasts , he says ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sooner or later , as the forwardness of the corn will admit . It is called the Green Corn Dance ; or more properly speaking , the ceremony of thanksgiving for the first fruits of the earth " The question continually recurs , whence came things like these among the natives of our continent , or the American savages , unless these savages are the very tribes of Israel ? No evidence is furnished thut such a variety of Hebrew rites is found among any other people on earth , except the Jews . And it seems morally impossible they should have derived them from any other source , than the ancient Hebrew reli religion . Mr. Schoolcvaft , a member of the New- York Historical Society , ( in his journals of travels among the western Indians , round and beyond the western lakes , and to the mouth of the Mississippi , in 1820. ) gives some accounts , which confirm some of the Indian traditions already exhibited . He speaks of attending a feast among the Sioux Indian ? ; a feast of the first greeu com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by the sound of Indian music which proceeded from an other large cabin at no great distance ; but we found the doors closed , and were informed that they were celebrating an annual feast , at which only certain persons in the village were allowed to be present ; and that it was not customary to admit strangers . Our curiosity being excited , we applied to the governor , Cass , to intercede for us ; and were by that means admitted . The first striking object presented was , two large kettles full of green corn , cut from the cofe and boiled . They hung over a moderate fire in the midst of the cabin ; and the Indian ? , both men and women , were seated in a large circle avound them . They were singing a doleful song in a savage manner . The utmost solemnity was depic ted upon every countenance . When the music ceased , as it frequently did for a few seconds , there was a full and myste rious pause , during which certain pantomimic signs were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commun ion with invisible spirits . Suddenly the music struck up but as we did not understand their language , it is impossible to say what they uttered , or to whom their supplications or responses were addressed . When the ceremony ceased , one of the older Indians divided out all the boiled corn into sepa rate tlishes for as many heads of families as there were pres- /z/ ent , putting an equal number of ladles full into each di.sh. - Then while the music continued , they one by one took up their dishes , and irtiring from the cabin by a back-ward step , , so that they still iuced the kettles , they separated to their res pective lod'ges ; and thus the ceremony ceased . " This writer says , " The Indians believed in the existence of a great invisible Spirit , who resides hi the regions of the clouds , and by means of inferior spirits throughout every part of the earth . " Their word for spirit , he says , is manito , which he ob serves , " signifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansaw to the source ? ot the Mississippi ; and according to M'Kenzie , throughout the arctic regions . " This word , Mr. S. remarks , with many others , strengthens the opin ion " of which ( he says ) there appears ample grounds , that the erratic tribes of the north-western region , and of the vallies of the Mississippi , are all descended from one stock , which is presumed to have progressed from the north toward the south , scattering into different tribes , and falling from the pu rity of a language , which may originally have been rich and copious . " Here is good testimony to some of the points , ad duced in this work , viz. that all the Indians are from one or igin ; all originally of one language ; all from the north-west , the straits of Beering , leading from the north-east of Asia to the north-west of America . These Indians , Mr. S. informs , " have their good and bad minitoes , " or spirits . The Old Testament informs of holy and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors allowing that great , corruptions have crept into the Indian language ; and that the remarks of some upon the supposed poverty of the lan guage of these Americans , are very incorrect . He speaks of some of the Indians as looking to the people of our states for aid , and says , a council which he attended with the Sandy Lake Indians , thus closed ; " The Americans ( meaning the United States ) are a great people . Can it be possible they will allow us to suffer f " The Rev. Lemuel Haynes informs , that about 60 years ago , he was living in Granville , Mass . A minister by the name of Ashley , called on an old deacon , with whom he was living , being on his way from a mission among the Indians iu the west , where he had been a considerable time . Mr. Ash ley stated his confident belief that the Indians were the Is raelites ; for he said there were many things in their manners and customs , which were like those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Haynes being then a boy , does not now recollect them . But the people he mentions as be ing impressed with the accounts ; and the good old deacon long spake of them with much interest . /z/ A brother minister informs meihat his father was a lieu tenant in the revolutionary war , and was long among the In dians ; and that he became a firm believer that the Indians were the ten tribes of Israel from their traditions and rites ; various of which he used to state ; but which the minister does not now remember . The most important evidence in relation to the Indians being the descendants of Israel , the reader will perceive , is James Adair , Esqr . Recollect he had lived among them as an intelligent trader , 40 years . That his character was well established ; and his accounts well authenticated by colla teral evidence , by a gentleman member of congress , who had resided a number of years as an agent of our government among those Indians where Mr. Adair resided . Dr. Boutlinot assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him know his design ; and that from him he found all the leading facts mentioned in Mr. Adair 's history fully con firmed from his own personal knowledge . See page 83d of this book . I think it therefore desirable , that the reader should see more fully Mr. Adair 's arguments , as found in his book ; and a few additional extracts from his work in support of them . He states his sentiment on the subject thus : " From the most exact observation that I could make in the long time I traded among the Indian Americans , I was forced to believe fhem lineally descended from the Israelites . " He argues that those of the ten tribes from whom the American Indians descended , must soon have removed from that part of Assyria , where they were lodged , and probably reached this continent previous to the Babylonish captivity of the Jews . His arguments that the natives of this continent are of the ten tribes are as follows . 1 . Their division into tribes . 2 . Their worship of Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their belief in the ministration of angels . 5 . Their language and dialects . 6 . Their manner of counting time . 7 . Their prophets and high priests . 8 . Their festivals , fasts , and reli gious rites . 9 . Their daily sacrifice . 10 . Their ablutions and anointings. 11 . Their laws of uncleanness. 12 , Their abstinence from unclean things . 13 . Their marriages , di vorces , and punishments of adultery . 14 . Their several ' pun ishments. 15 . Their cities of refuge . 16 . Their purifications and preparatory ceremonies . 17 . Their ornaments . 18 . Their manner of curing the sick . 19 . Their burial of their dead . .20 . Their mourning for th ir dead . 21 . Their raising seed to a deceased brother ; 22 . Their change of names adapted to their circumstances and times . 23 . Their own traditions ; the accounts of English writers ; and the testimonies given by Spanish and other writers of the primitive inhabitants of Mexico and Peru , /z/ Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own words . Under the 1st argument . " As the nation hath its particular symbol , so each tribe , the badge from which it is denominated . The sachem of each tribe is a necessary party in conveyances , and treaties , to which he affixes the mark of his tribe . If we go from nation to nation among them , we shall not find one , who doth not lineally dis tinguish himself by his respective family . The genealogical names , which they assume , are derived either from the name of those animals , whereof the cherubims are said in revelation to be compounded , or from such creatures as are most familiar to them . The Indians , however , bear no religious respect to the animals from whence they derive their names . On the contrary , they kill them when opportunity serves . " When we consider that these savages have been above twenty cen turies without the use of letters to carry down their traditions , it can not reasonably be expected that they should still retain the identical names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the Israelites , sufficiently clears the subject . Besides , as hath been hinted , they call some of their tribes by the names of cherubinical figures that were carried on the four principal standards of Israel . His illustrations of the second argument , blended with those of many others , have been sufficiently given in the third chapter of this work . Under the 3d argument , he says : " Agreeably to the theoe-acy or divine government of Israel , the Indians think the Deity to be the immediate head of their state . All the na tions of Indians are exceedingly intoxicated with religious pride , and have an inexpressible contempt of the white people. * They used to call us in their war orations , the actursed people . But they flatter themselves with the name of the beloved people ; because their supposed ancestors , as they affirm , were under the immediate government of the Deity , who was present with them in a very peculiar manner , and directed them by prophets , while the rest of the world were aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any one of their magi , is persuading the people at any one of their religious solemnities to a strict observance of the old beloved or divine speech , he always calls them the beloved or holy people , agreeably to the Hebrew epithet , Ammi ( my people ) during the theocracy of Israel . It is their opinion of the theocracy , that God chose them out of all the rest of man kind as his peculiar and beloved people ; which alike animates both the white Jew , and the red American with that steady /z/ hatred against all the world except themselves ; and renders them ( in their opinion ) hated and despised by all . " His illustrations of the 4th and 5th arguments have been given with those of other authors . Under the 6th argument he says : " They count time after the manner of the Hebrews . They divide the year into spring , summer , autumn , and winter . They number their year from any of those four periods , for they have no name for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by lunar months , like the Israelites , who counted by moons . The number and regular periods of the Indians ' religious feasts is a good historical proof ( Mr. Adair adds ) that they counted time by , and observed , a weekly Sabbath long after their ar rival on the American continent . They begin a year at the first appearance of the first new moon of the vernal equinox , according to the ecclesiastical year of Moses . Till the 70 years captivity , the Israelites had only numeral names for the solar and lunar months , except Abib and Elhamin ; the former signifying a green ear of corn ; and the latter robust or valiant . And by the first of these , the Indians ( as an ex plicative ) term their passover , which the trading people call the green corn dance . " Mr. Adair then proceeds to show more fully the similarity between the ancient Israelites and the Indians in their counting time , as has been noted . Under the 7th argument he says : " In conformity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Americans have their prophets , high priests , and others of a religious order . As the Jews had a sanctum sanctorum , ( holy of holies ) so have all the Indian nations . There they deposit their con secrated vessels ; none of the laity daring to approach that sacred place . ' The Indian tradition says , that their forefathers were possessed of an extraordinary divine spirit , by which they foretold things future , and controlled the common course of nature : and this they transmitted to their offspring , pro vided they obeyed the sacred laws annexed to it . Ishtoallo , ( Mr. Adair says of those Indians ) is the name of all their priestly order ; and their pontifical office descends by inherit ance to the eldest . There are some traces of agreement , though chiefly lost , in their pontifical dress . Before the In dian Archimagus officiates in making the supposed holy fire for the yearly atonement for sin , the sagan ( waiter of the high priest ) clothes him with a white ephod , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thuminim , theAmerican Archimagus wears a breast plate made of a white conch-shell with two holes bored in the middle oi it , through which he puts the ends of an otter skin strap , and fastens a buck horn white button to the outside of each , as if in imitation of the precious stones of the Urim. " /z/ In this statement Mr. Adair exhibits evidence of which he himself seem unconscious . He says the general name of all their priestly order is- Ishtoallo , And the name of the high priest 's waiter is Sagan . Mr. Fabor ( remarking upon this ) thinks the former word is a corruption of tsh-da-eloah , a man of God ; see original of 2 Kings , iv . 21 , 22 , 25 , 27 , 40 , and other places . And of the latter word he says , " Sagan is the very name by which the Hebrews called the deputy of the high priest , who supplied his office , and who performed the func tions of it in the absence of the high priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evidence to our purpose , that those Indians should call their order of priests , and the high priest 's waiter , by those ancient Hebrew names of a man of God , and a de puty of the high priest . How could these events have oc curred , had not - those natives been Hebrew , and brought clown these names by Hebrew tradition ? Under the 8th-argumcnt Mr. Adair says ; u The ceremo nies of the Indians in their religious worship are more after the Mosaic institution ? , than of pagan imitation ; which could not be , if the majority of the old nation were of heathenish descent . They are uttey strangers to all the gestures practis ed by the pagans in their religious rites . They have another appellative which with them is the mysterious essential name of God ; the tetragr - ammaton , or great four lettered name , which they never name in common speech . Of the time and place , when and where they mention- it r they are very parti cular , and always with a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews had to the four lettered divine name , so as scarcely ever to mention it , but once a year when the high priest went into the sanctuary at the expiation of sins . Might not the Indians copy from them this sacred invocation , Yo hewah ? Their method of invoking God in a solemn hymn with that reverend deportment , and spending a full breath on each of the two first syllables of the awful divine name , hath a surprising analogy to the Jewish custom , and such as no other nation or people even with the advantage of written records , have retained . It may be worthy of no tice that they never prostrate themselves , nor bow their bo dies to each other by way of salute or homage , though usual with the eastern nations ; except when they are making or renewing peace with strangers , who come in the name of Yah . " Mr. Adair proceeds to speak of the sacred adjuration of the Indiana by the great and awful name of God ; the question being asked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verence in a bowing posture of body immediately before the invocation of Yo hcwah ; this he considers to be Hebrew ? . /z/ adjuring their witnesses to give true evidence . He says , 4 It seems exactly to coincide with the conduct of the Hebrew witnesses even now on the like occasions . " Mr. Adais other illustrations under this argument , in va rious feasts , fastings , their ark , and their ever refusing to eat the hollow of the thigh of their game , have been sufficiently given , in connexion with the testimonies of others to the same points . Enough has also been exhibited under the 9th , 10th and llth arguments . Under the 12th he says ; " Eagles of every kind they es teem unclean food ; likewise ravens , crows , bats , buzzard ? , f-wallows , and every species of owl . " This he considers as pre cisely Hebrew ; as also their purifications of their priests ; and purification for having touched a dead body , or any other unclean thing . Under most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the 16th he says : * Before the Indians go to war , they have many preparatory ceremonies of purification and fasting like what is recorded of the Israelites . " Under the 21st he says ; " The surviving brother by the Mosaic law was to raise seed to a deceased brother , who left a widow childless . The Indian custom looks the same way . " Under the last argument he says ; " The Indian tradition says that their forefathers in very remote ages came from a far distant country , where all the people were of one colour ; and that in process of time they removed eastward to their present settlements . " He notes and confutes some idle fa bulous stories which he says " sprung from the innovating superstitious ignorance of the popish priests to the south west ; " and speaks of the Indian tradition as being altogether more to be depended on . He says , " They , ( the rambling tribes of northern Indians excepted , ) aver that they came over the Mississippi from the westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see verified in the western old towns they have left behind them , and by the situation of their old beloved towns or places of refuge lying about a west course from each different nation . " " Ancient history ( he adjs ) is quite silent concerning Amer ica , which indicates that it has been time immemorial , rent asunder from the eastern continent . The north-east parts of Asia were also undiscovered till of late . Many geographers have stretched Asia and America so far as to join them to gether ; and others have divided them into two quarters of the globe . But the Russsian ? , after several dangerous attempts , have clearly convinced the world that they are now divided , and yet have a rucar communication together by a /z/ strait , in which several islands are sitnatr 1 , ami through which there is an easy passage from the north-east of Asia to the north-west of America . By this passage , it was very practicable to go to this new world , and afterward to have proceeded in quest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Ameri can origin , ( he adds ) ought to inform ns how the natives came here , and by what means they found the long chain of rites and customs so similar to the usage of the Hebrew na tion , and in general dissimilar to the modes of the pagan world Their religious rites , martial customs , dress , music , dances and domestic form ? of life , ? e 3m clearly to evince also , that they came to America in early times before sects had sprung up among the Jews ; which was soon after their prophets ceased ; also before arts and sciences had arrived at any perfection . Other wise it is likely they would have retained some knowledge of them . " We learn in Dr. Robertson 's history of America , that the Mexicans had their tradition that " Their ancestors came from a remote country situated to the north-west of Mexico . The Mexicans ( he says ) point out their various stations as they advanced from this into the interior provinces ; and it is precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been emigrants from Asia . " * Mr. Adair says , that though some have supposed the Amer icans to be descendants from the Chinese ; yet neither their religion , laws or customs agree in the least with those of the Chinese , which sufficiently proves that they are not of this line . And he says the remaining traces of their religious ceremonies , and civil and martial customs , are different from those of the old Scythians . He thinks , therefore , that the old opinion that the Indians are descended from the Tartars or ancient Scythians , should be exploded as weak and with out foundation . Those who have advocated the affirmative , have not been able to produce much , if any evidence , that any of the religious rites found among the Indians , and re sembling those of ancient Israel , have ever been found among any people in the east of Asia . Such a thing can not be ex pected . Those rites were arbitrary , established only in Is rael ; and designed to distinguish them from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppose these Indian rites may be accounted for , froih an idea that the Indians may have learned them from other heathen nations . With very similar propriety might the unbeliever in divine revelation say , that the Jews and ancient Israel derived their religion , not from God , as the bible purports , but from the heathen nations , /z/ who at that time might , for aught we know , have had just such religious customs . It the aborigines derived these rites and customs from an cient Asiatic heathen ; why have not some of those heathen themselves retained some of them , and disseminated them through some other parts of the world , besides the vast wilds f North and South America . Capt . Carver is able to find that some of the people north east of Asia once presented to some of the Russians their pipe of peace . The people of Israel , as they passed by that people in ancient days , may have caught this custom from them ; as none pretend this was a . Hebrew rite . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this custom from the Indian ? over Beer ing 's Straits . But this is nothing , compared with the many Hebrew rites found among the na tives of America . Captain Carver , who travelled five thousand miles among the Indians of North America , states some customs observed by some of them in relation to marriage and divorce , which seem much like those of ancient Israel . He sas ; u When one of their young men has fixed on a young woman he ap* proves of , he discovers his passion to her parents , who give him an invitation to come and live with them in their tent . He accepts the offer , and engages to reside in it for a whole year in the character of a menial servant . This however is done only while they are young men , and for the ; r first wife ; and not repeated like Jacob 's servitude . When this period is expired , the marriage is solemnized. " 44 When from any dislike ( he adds ) a separation takes place , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends a few days notice of their intention , and some times offer reasons to justify their conduct . " Some little cer emonies follow ; and he says , " The separation is carried on without any murmurings , or ill will between , the couple or their relations . " Probably no other nation has such a resem blance in this respect to ancient Israel . Capt . Carver says of the Indians " wholly unadulterated with the superstitions of the church of Rome ; " " It is cer tain they acknowledge one Supreme Being , or giver of life , who presides over all things the Great Spirit ; and they look up to him as the source of good who is infinitely good . They also believe in a bad spirit , to whom they ascribe great power . They hold also , that there are good spirits of a less degree , who have their particular departments , in which thej are constantly contributing to the happiness of mortals . " " The priests of the Indians ( he adds ) who are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cure their diseases , they interpret their dreams , and satisfy their /z/ desires of searching into futurity . " But Capt . Carver unites with other authors on the subject , in speaking of the difficul ty of strangers among them obtaining much knowledge of their religious rites . He says ; " It is very difficult to attain to a perfect knowledge of the religious principles of the In dians . They endeavour to conceal them . " It is no wonder then , that Capt . Carver , passing by them on a tour of up wards of five thousand miles , discovered but few of these many rites resembling the religion of ancient Israel , stated by Mr. Adair . He says there was " w ? , e particular female custom " bearing resemblance to the rites in the Mosaic law ; alluding no daubt , to the well known Indian separation of women . Speaking of their " religious principles , " which he says are " few and simple , " he &dds,; " they ( the Indians ) have not de viated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civ ilized ones have done , into idolatrous modes of worship . " " On the appearance of the new moon they dance and sing ; but it is not evident that they pay that planet any adora tion . " Here then , according to this author , is their one God , infi nitely good , the giver of life , and of all good , presiding over all , and who is the only object of worship ; though they some times beg of the evil spirit to avert their calamities , which , in their opinion , he brings . Here are their good angels , min istering to the good ; here their priests ; and a " particular female custom " inexplicable unless by the Mosaic law . Here is their firm adherence to their " few simple doctrines , " or rites , less deviating to idolatry than other uncivilized , and even many civilized nations . These facts are far from being destitute of their favorable bearing on our subject . How should such things be true of those savages , were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in page 88 of this book , that the Esqimaux natives , and people round Hudson 's Bay appear a different race from the American Indians , and may have come from the north of Europe . Capt . Carver notes an assertion from Grotius , that " some of the Norwegians passed into America by way of Greenland . " He also notes that De Laet gives " the following passage from the history of Wales , written by David Powel , in the year 1170 . This history says , that Madoc , one of the sons of prince Owen Gwynnith , being dis gusted at the civil wars which broke out between his broth ers , fitted out several vessels , and went in quest of new lands to the westward of Ireland . " And he goes on to speak of of their planting a colony there . Here may be the origin of the people of Greenland , Iceland , and round Hudson 's Bay . B ut it gives no satisfactory account of the origin of the nuaerou3 Indian tribes of America . /z/ Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , and see if they exhibit any evidence similar to what has been adduced of the natives of North America . Don Alonzo de Ericilla , in his history of Chili , says of th natives there ; " The religious system of the Araucanians is simple . They acknowledge a Supreme Being , the author of all things , whom they call Pillan , a word derived from Pulli , or Pilli , the soul ; and signifies the Supreme Essence . They call him also , Guenu-pillan , the Spirit of Heaven ; Bulagen , the Great Being ; Thalcove , the Thunderer ; Vilvemvoe , the Omnipotent ; Mollgelu , the Eternal ; and Avnolu , the Infinite . " He adds ; " The universal government of Pil lan , ( his Supreme Essence , ) is a prototype of the Araucanian polity . He is the great Toqui of the invisible world . " He goes on to speak of his having subordinate invisible be ings under him , to whom he commits the administration of affairs of less importance . These , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may believe they are but a tra ditional notion of angels , good and bad ; such as is held by the Indians of North America . This author says of this people ; " They all agreed in the belief of the immortality of the soul . This consolatory truth is deeply rooted , and in a manner innate with them . They hold that man is composed of two substances essential ly different ; the corruptible body and the soul , incorporeal and eternal . " Of their funerals , he says ; " The bier is carried by the principal relations , and is surrounded by women who bewail the deceased in the manner of the hired mourners among the Romans . " He also says ; " They have among them a tradition of a great deluge , in which only a few persons were saved , who took refuge on a high mountain called Thegtheg , which pos sessed the property of moving upon the water . " Here then , it seems the remote natives of Chili ( a region 1260 miles south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence that they originated in the same family with the North American Indians , and hold some of their es sential traditions . Whence could arise the tradition of those natives , of one " Supreme Being , author of all things ? " That he is the " Su preme Essence ; the Spirit of Heaven ; the Thunderer ; the Omnipotent ; the Eternal ; the Infinite ? " W T hence their tradition of the flood , and of several persons being saved on a floating mountain , meaning no doubt the ark ? Whence their ideas so correct of man 's immortal soul ? This author says of those native Chilians , " Many suppose that they are indigenous to the country ; while others sup-/z/ pose they derive their origin from a foreign stock , and at one time say , that their ancestors came from the north , and at an other time , from the west . " Their better informed or wise men , it seems , retain some impressions of their original emigration from a foreign land , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to give a satisfactory account of such traditions among those native Indians of Chili , short of their having received them from the Hebrew sacred scriptures ? And if from thence , surely they must be Hebrews . In Long 's expedition to the Rocky Mountain , we learn that the Omawhaw tribe of Indians ( who inhabit the west side of the Missouri River , fifty miles above Engineer Can tonment , ) believe in one God . They call him Wahconda ; and believe him " to be the greatest and best of beings ; the Creator and Preserver of till things ; the Fountain of mystic medicine . Omniscience , omnipresence , and vast power are attributed to him . And he is supposed to afflict them with sickness , poverty , or misfortune , for their evil deeds . In con versation he is frequently appealed to as an evidence of the truth of their asseverations " Wahconda hears what Isay " These Indians have many wild pagan notions of this one God . But they have brought down by tradition , it seem ? , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poly the istical world . Their name of God is remarkable Wahconda . It has been shown in the body of this work , that various of the In dians call God Yohewah , Ale , Yah , and Wah . doubtless from the Hebrew names Jehovah , Ale , and Jah . And it has been shown that these syllables which compose the name of God , are compounded in many Indian words , or form the roots from which they are formed . Here we find the fact ; while the author from whom the account is taken , it is presumed , had no perception of any such thing . Wah-conda ; the last syllable of the Indian Yohewah , compounded with conda . Or Jah , Wah , their monosyllable name of God thus com pounded . Here is evidence among those children of the des ert , both as to the nature and the name of their one God , corresponding with what has been exhibited of other tribes ; and very unaccountable , if they are not of the tribes of Is rael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to corrobor ate the opinion that th j ; se people are of Israel . He relates that from the age of between five and ten years , their little sons are obliged o ascend a hill tasting , once or twice a week during the months of ? laich and April , to pray aloud to Wahronda . When this season of the year arrl ' -c ? , the moth er iaionua the little son , that the " ice is breaking up in the
