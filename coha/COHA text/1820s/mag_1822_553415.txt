txt ART . II. - Views of Society and Manners in . /Imerica ; in *z series of letters from that country to a friend in England , during the years 1818 , 1819 and 1820 . By an Englishwoman . From the first London edition , with additions and corrections by the author . 8vo , pp. 387 . New York , 1821 . THIS work has been so extensively read in America , that a review of it , at the present time , may seem unnecessary . As it forms , however , in many respects a contrast with other works of the same class , and is distinguished for its flattering tone toward our country , it might seem a failure in respect to so courteous a foreigner , to allow her work to pass unnoticed . We can not , at the same time , hut feel ourselves under much embarrassment in speaking of it . Like all human productions , it has , of course , its imperfections ; but as American critics , it would seem a piece of rudeness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages in which our character , manners , and institutions are so advantageously portrayed . On the other hand , our country , not to say our own poor labours , is so handsomely eulogized by this polite stranger , that we should be thought perhaps to speak under prepossession , if we were very forward in maintaining the merits of her book . We know not , in fact , a less enviable task than that of the traveller , who undertakes to publish an account of a short visit to a foreign country , and feels at all concerned for the reception his hook may meet with in that country . It is impossible in a short visit , or even in a long visit , to become so thoroughly acquainted with a country , considerably different in character from your own , as not to be constantly exposed to mistakes in detailed statements of its peculiarities . Then the traveller , who is well received , falls into some circle , which has its local or political party ; he becomes imbued with their feelings , and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in*-formed than himself , of what relates to their own country . In doing this , however , he xviii often go to great excess , and fall into much falser judgments , than even the most embittered party at home bears of its rival . He has none of that feeling of brotherhood to correct his politi*il or sectarian creed , which unconsciously operates on the mind of those , who live in the same town , perhaps the same street , are associated in the same institutions , and worship in the same church ; and who , though they call each other , in their speeches and essays , incendiaries , traitors , and hirelings , know , after all in their souls , that their neighbours are about as good people as themselves . But the foreigner is not in the way of making such allowance . He lands among us , falls into some circle , good or bad , as the case may be , hears them speak in strong terms of their party adversaries , is able to make none of that secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each other amidst all their railings , and so is often led away to be-rate honest people , who are far from deserving it , especially at his hands . It is in this way , that we are led to account for the peculiar ferocity , which party politics have assumed in the hands of those active foreigners , who have from time to time found a welcome on our shores , and who have espoused our controversies with a more than native zeal . It is in this way also , that we account for the extraordinary warmth , with which the amiable author of this work speaks of a certain class of our own citizens , of whom she could know no harm , but by reports likely to be exaggerated , whose capital was not favoured with a visit from her , and who , we doubt not , contribute a fair proportion toward that class of persons , whom she would herself regard as constituting the enlightened and respectable part of the American community . We allude to passages like these : There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentable deficiency of patriotism . I'he conduct of some of the New England states at the opening of the contest is not very easy to explain . That Massachusetts , who thirty years before had led the van in the army of patriots , whose cause too it was that her sister states so generously advocated , that she should suddenly so forget her former self , as to stand by , a sullen spectator of a conflict which involved the honour and national existence of the great republic , of which till now she had formed so distinguished a member , seems at once the most // extraordinary and lamentable dereliction of principle to be found in the annals of nations ! She appears to have been made the dupe of a party , whose name , until this time , had been respected even by the nation from whom it stood aloof , and then to have been angry because others saw this , and laughed at her cullibility . Among the first Federals , there i*re men no less respectable for their virtues than their talents ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle themselves with the bulk of the nation , leaving only the old tories and some disappointed politicians , to disgrace a title which patriots had worn , and under its specious mask to attempt the ruin of their country . In this , fortunately they failed ; but may the lesson prove a warning not to Massa6husetts only , but to each and all of these confederated states ! I have already had occasion to observe upon the change wrought by the last war in the condition of the republic ; it not only settled its place among the nations , but cemented its internal union ; even those who from party ill humour had refused their concurrence with the measures of government , and their sympathy in the feelings of their fellow-citizens , were gradually warmed by the enthusiasm that surrounded them , or by the pressure of common danger , forced to make common cause . At the close of the contest , one general feeling pervaded the whole great Union . The name of a party once respectable , but now disgraced by itself , became universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt into which they had fallen , found it advisable to declare their own conversion to the principles of popular government and federal union . ' pp. 261 , 262 . Now our fair traveller could not by any possibility know this to be true . She was not in America till three or four years after the period , at which she says the parties coalesced ; she did not visit New England ; nor did she even make herself , by reading , so familiar with our great political controversy , as to know even the names of the parties ; else she would not have used the word Federals , the vulgarism for Federalists , and which is in about as good company in America , as oppositioners would be in England . These things being so , she could have no idea of the policy and patriotism of the Federal party , but from what she was informed by her friends here . We have no doubt they told her what they honestly believed to he true . But let us just reverse the case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing her journal for the press , and wishing to give a sketch of the political parties , should apply to some leading ministerial member , to know // what he thought , on the whole , of the opposition party , and the expediency of forming a new cabinet , with Mr Tierney at the head . We are content to leave the case with this parallel to our fair visitant 's candour , and feel quite sure , that though she and her friends may deny the jus*ce of our argument , they will not call in question the good nature , with which we state it . We are aware how difficult it is to find a way of obtaining correct general views of the political relations of foreign countries ; but we know that it is not the way , to take a zealous side with either of the parties in those controversies , where both are sure to be more or less in the wrong ;  --  or equally in the right . Another passage in this lady 's work will illustrate the difficulty to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deliberate correction of another , there is no security from committing as great an error as you rectify . Having observed that she must here refute a strange assertion , which she has seen in many foreign journals , namely , that the United States ' government is chargeable with the diffusion of black slavery , ' she adds the following note : One of the most extravagant blunders of this kind I lately found in M'Kensie 's History of America ; a work comprising much valuable topographical and statistical information upon the subject of the United States ; but containing a compilation of the most contradictory and positively ludicrous portraits of their moral charac .. ter ( to those at least who have any personal acquaintance with it ) that has yet come under my eye . The passage I allude to is the following : " Negro slavery has spread its baleful effects over a great part of the Union . Some writers , particularly Englishmen , who would wish to represent the states as a second Arcadia , have offered an apology for this detestable practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the colonial system ; but this excuse does not apply to the new states ; for the congress has resigned the inhabitants of these vast regions to its demoralizing effects . " Now were this all that stood between the United States and a secoil ( l Arcadia , they would be much nearer a terrestrial paradise than I had imagined . . *ot a single one of the new states that has grown up under the jurisdiction of the congress , but has been positively and absolutely saved by its laws fm'om slavery in any shape or form whatsoeve Ix it would save some mistakes , if authors u'ould read the laws of foreign countries , before they write about them . ' p. 288. // to which this lady alludes , and of the fate of which she was aware , how could she have read even one of the formal speeches made in the House of Representatives , while this question was pending , without becoming acquainted with many examples , in direct contradiction to her assertion ; an assertion which , as every American knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory north-west of the Ohio . But we have swerved from our purpose , even in this allusion , which is intended to be any thing but unkind , towards some of the little blemishes in our fair champion 's work ; and we commend a number of little errors in names , persons , and facts , to that grateful indulgence , which so friendly a spirit ought to awaken in the American reader . The work is in fact an eulogium on our country and its character ; a panegyric of the warmest cast . The discreet citizen will place it before him as the model , toward which he should strive to bring his country , rather than as a tablet of actual perfections , of which in every case he has now a right to boast . Though many of the observations of this lady take a wide range , her actual travels in the country were not extensive , having been bounded , if we have rightly remarked , by Washington on the south , and New York on the east ; including a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the return to that city , by the way of Lake Champlain . The tour to Niagara is one of the best portions of the book , and we can not but think the following extracts will afford great pleasure to those few of our readers , who have not already possessed themselves of the entire work . After some glowing remarks on the approach to the fall , our eloquent tourist continues as follows : It is but an inconsiderable portion of this imprisoned sea which flows on the American side ; but even this were sufficient to fix the eye in admiration . Descending the ladder ( now easy steps ) and approaching to the foot of this lesser Fall , we were driven away blinded , breathless , and smarting , the wind being high and blowing right against us . A young gentleman , who incautiously ventured a few steps farther , was thrown upon his back , and 1 had some apprehension , from the nature of the ground upon which he fell , was seriously hurt ; he escaped , however , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight bruises . Turning a corner of the rock ( where , descending less precipitously , it is wooded to the bottom ) to recover our breath , and wring the water from our hair and clothes , we saw , on lifting our eyes , a corner of the summit of this graceful division of the cataract hanging // above the projecting mass of trees , as it were in mid air , like the snowy top of a mountain . Above , the dazzling white of the shivered water was thrown into contrast with the deep blue of the unspotted heavens ; below , with the living green of the summer foliage , fresh and sparkling in the eternal shower of the rising an&amp;falling spray . The wind , *. hich for the space of an hour , blew with some fury , rushing down with the river , flung showers of spray from the crest of the fall . The sun 's rays , glancing on these big drops , and sometimes on feathery streams thrown fantastically from the main body of the water , transformed them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful rainbow , now arching over our heads , and now circling in the vapour at our feet , still flew before us as we moved . The greater division of the cataract was here concealed from our sight by the dense volumes of vapour which the wind drove with fury across the immense basin directly towards us ; sometimes indeed a veering gust parted for a moment the thick clouds , and partially revealed the heavy columns , that seemed more like fixed pillars of moving emerald , than living sheets of water . Here , seating ourselves at the brink of this troubled ocean , beneath the gaze of the sun , we had the full advantage of a vapour bath ; the fervid rays drying our garments one moment , and a blast from the basin drenching them the next . The wind at length having somewhat abated , and the ferryman being willing to attempt the passage , we here crossed in a little boat to the Canada side . The nervous arm of a single rower stemmed this heavy current , just below the basin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; the stormy north-west at this moment chafing the waters yet more . Blinded as we were by the columns of vapour which were driven upon us , we lost the panoramic view of the cataract , which , in calmer hours , or with other winds , may be seen in this passage . The angry waters , and the angry winds together , drove us farther down the channel than , was quite agreeable , seeing that a few rods more , and our shallop must have been whirled into breakers , from which ten such arms as those of its skilful conductor could not have redeemed it . Being landed two-thirds of a mile below the cataract , a scramble , at first very intricate , through , and over , and under huge masses of rock , which occasionally seemed to deny all passage , and among which our guide often disappeared from our wandering eyes , placed us at the foot of the ladder by which the traveller descends on the Canada side . From hence a rough walk along a shelving ledge of loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ledge over which the water rolls , and which is known by the name . of the Table Rock . The gloom of this vast cavern , the whirlwind that ever plays // in it , the deafening roar , the vast abyss of convulsed waters beneath you , the falling columns i ; hat hang over your head , all strike , not upon the ears and eyes only , but upon the heart . For the first few moments , the sublime is wrought to the terrible . This position , indisputably the finest , is no longer one of safety . A part of the Table Roe k fell last year , and in that still remaining , the eye traces an alarming fissure , from the very summit of the projecting ledge over which the water rolls ; so that the ceiling of this dark cavern seems rent from the precipice , and whatever be its hold , it is evidently fast yielding to the pressure of the water . You can not look up to this crevice , and down upon the enormous masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring inhabitants for that of an earthquake , without shrinking at the dreadful possibility which might crush you beneath ruins , yet more enormous than those which lie at your feet . The cavern formed by the projection of this rock , extends some feet behind the water , and , could you breathe , to stand behind the edge of the sheet were perfectly easy . I have seen those who have told me they have done so : for myself , when I descended within a few paces of this dark recess , I was obliged to hury back some yards to draw breath . Mine to be sure are not the best of lungs , but theirs must be little short of miraculous , that can play in the wind and foam that gush from the hidden depths of this watery cave . It is probable , however , that the late fracture of the rock has considerably narrowed this recess ; and thus increased the force of the blast that meets the intruder . From this spot , ( beneath the Table Rock , ) you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cataract , and the weight of its waters . It seems a tumbling ocean ; and you yourself , what a helpless atom amid these vast and eternal workings of gigantic nature ! The wind had now abated , and what was better , we were now under the lee , and could admire its sport with the vapour , instead of being blinded by it . From the enormous basin , into which the waters precipitate themselves in a clear leap of one hundred and forty feet , the clouds of smoke rose in white volumes , like the round-headed clouds you have sometimes seen in the evening horizon of a summer sky , and then shot up in pointed pinnacles , like the ice of mountain * , Caught by the wind , it was now borne down the channel , then , re-collecting its strength , the tremulous vapour again sought the upper air , till , broken and dispersed in the blue serene , it spread against it the only silvery veil which spotted the pure azure . In the centre of the Fall , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unbroken mass of the deepest green , and in many places reaches the bottom in crystal columns of the same hue , till they meet the snow-white foam that heaves and rolls convulsedly in the enor // Jan. mous basin . But for the deafening roar , the darkness and the stormy whirlwind in which we stood , I could have fancied these inassy volumes the walls of some fairy palace-living emeralds chased in silver . Never surely did nature throw together so fantastically so much beauty with such terrific grandeur . Nor let me pass without notice the lovely r*nbow , that , at this moment , hung over the opposing division of the cataract as parted by the island , embracing the whole breadth in its span . Midway of this silvery screen of shivered water , stretched a broad belt of blazing gold and crimson , into which the rainbow dropped its hues , and seemed to have based its arch . Different from all other scenes of nature that have come under my observation , the cataract of Niagara is seen to most advantage under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vapour are then by far the most varied and brilliant ; and of the beauty of these hues I can give you no idea . The gloom of the cavern ( for 1 speak always as if under the Table Rock ) needs no assistance from the shade of evening ; and the terrible grandeur of the whole is not felt the less for being distinctly seen . We now ascended the precipice on the Canada side , and , having taken a long gaze from the Table Rock , sought dry clothes and refreshment at a neighbouring inn . We have again visited this wonder of nature in our return from lake Erie ; and have now gazed upon it in all lights , and at all hours , *under the rising meridian , and setting sun , and under the pale moon , when " Riding in her highest noon . " The edge of the Table Rock is not approached without terror at the latter hour . The fairy hues are now all gone ; excepting , indeed , the rainbow , which , the ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rays of the sweet planet but feebly ierce the chill dense vapour that clogs the atmosphere ; they only n kiss , and coldly kiss , the waters at the brink , and faintly show the upper half of the columns1 now black as ebony , plunging into a storm-tossed sea of murky clouds , whose depth and boundaries are alike unseen . It is the storm of the elements in chaos . The shivering mortal stands on the brink , like the startled fiend " On the bare outside of this world , Uncertain which , in ocean or in air . " " La buja campagna Trem6 si forte , che dello spavento La mente di sudore ancor ml bagna . " The description of the destruction of the steam boat Phornix , on lake Champlain , is also done with the pen of a powerful mistress : // One of the finest steam-boats ever built in the United States lately ran upon this inland sea , and was destroyed , ten days since , by fire , in a manner truly terrible . The captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his son , a young man just turned of one-and-twenty . Making for St John 's with upwards of forty passengers , they encountere*the equinoctial gale , which blew with violence right ahead . The fine vessel , however , encountered it bravely , and dashed onwards through the storm , until , an hour after midnight , she had gained the broadest part of the lake . Some careless mortal , who had been to seek his supper in the pantry , left a candle burning on a shelf , which , after some time , caught another which was ranged above . The passengers were asleep , or at least quiet in their births , when a man at the engine perceived , in some dark recess of the vessel , an unusual light . Approaching the spot , he heard the crackling of fire , and found the door of the pantry a glowing and tremulous wall of embers . He had scarcely time to turn himself , ere he was enveloped in flames ; rushing past them , he attempted to burst into the ladies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vessel it was locked on the inside , and the noise of the storm seemed to drown all his cries and blows . Hurrying upon the deck , he gave the alarm to the captain , and flew to the women 's cabin . Ere he leaped down the stairs , the flames had burst through the inner door , and had already seized upon the curtains of the bed next to it . You may conceive the scene which followed . In the mean time the young captain roused his crew and his male passengers , warning the pilot to make for the nearest island . Summoning his men around him , and stating to them that all the lives on board could not be saved in the boats , he asked their consent to save the passengers , and to take death with him . All acquiesced unanimously ; and hastened to let down the boats . While thus engaged , the flames burst through the decks , and shrouded the pilot , the mast , and the chimney , in a column of flames . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his limbs were scorched and his clothes half consumed upon his back . The unusual heat round the boiler gave a redoubled impetus to the engine . The vessel dashed madly through the waters , until she was within a few roods of land . The boats were down , and the captain and his men held the shrieking women and children in their arms , when the helm gave way , and the vessel , turning from the wind flew backwards , whirling round and round from the shore . None could approach to stop the engine ; its fury , however , soon spent itself , and left the flaming wreck to the mercy only of the winds and waves . With dreadful struggles the naked passengers got into the boats , and received the women and children // from the hands of the captain and the crew , who , while the flames whirled over their heads , refused the solicitations to enter the overburdened barks , and pushed them off from the fire which had nearly caught their sides . It was now discovered that one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the windward of the flames , the. *routh was bound to a plank , and a skilful swimmer of the crew leapt with him into the lake . The captain , holding the frantic woman in his arms , stood upon the edge of the scorching and crackling wreck , until he saw the last of his companions provided with a spar , and committed to the waters ; then , throwing from him with one arm a table which he had before secured for the purpose , and with the other grasping his charge , he sprang into the waves . The poor woman , mad with terror , seized his throat as he placed and held her upon the table ; forced to disengage himself , she was borne away by the waves ; he tried to follow , and saw her for the last time clinging to a burning mass of the vessel . One last shriek , and the poor creature was whelmed in flood and fire . Swimming round the blazing hulk , and calling aloud to such of his corn p anions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watched or the falling of a spar . He seized one while yet on fire , and , quenching it , continued to float round the wreck , deeming that the light might be a signal , should the boats be able to return ; but these had to row , heavily laden , six miles through a mountainous sea . It was long before they could make the land , and that , leaving their helpless freight naked on the shore of a desert island , in the dark and tempestuous night , they turned to seek the drowning heroes . The day broke while they were labouring against the roaring elements , seeking in vain the extinguished beacon that was to guide their search ; at length a blackened atom appeared upon the top of a wave ; stretched upon it was a human figure . It was , I rejoice to say , the young captain-. - senseless , but the generous soul not quite departed . He is alive and doing well . One other of these devoted men was picked up late in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours swimming and floating on the water . Seven perished . The citizens of Burlington hastened with clothing and provisions to the sufferers on the island ; took them to their homes ; and nursed them with affectionate solicitude . The blackened wreck of the Phmnix is now lying , in the midst of the lake , upon a reef of rocks , to which it was drifted by the storm . ' pp. 216-219 . We hope by this time we have furnished all our readers with the means of forming an adequate idea of the nature of this work . We shall therefore venture upon only one more // extract , describing a scene which we can vouch to be truly American , as we have ourselves witnessed it , in all its essentials , within six miles of Boston : The mode in which the contents of the post-bag are usually distributed through the less populus districts had often before amused me . I remember , when taking a cross cut in a queer sort of a caravan , bound for some settlement on the southern shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operations of our charioteer ; a paper flung to the right hand , and anon a paper flung to the left , where no sight or sound bespoke the presence of human beings . I asked if the bears were curiogs of news ; upon which I was informed , that there was a settler in the neighbourhood , who ought to have been on the lookout , or some of his children for him . " But when I do n't find them ready , I throw the paper under a tree ; and I warrant you they 'll look sharp enough to find it ; they 're always curious of news in these wild parts ; " and curious enough they seemed , for not a cabin did we pass , that a newspaper was not flung from the hand of this enlightener of the wilderness . Occasionally making a halt at some solitary dwelling , the post-bag and its guardian descended together , when , if the assistance of the farmer , who here acted as postmaster , could be obtained , the whole contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes being put in requisition , such letters as might be addressed to the surrounding district , were scrambled out from the heap ; which , being then again scrambled together , was once more shaken into the leathern receptacle , and thrown into the wagon ; but it sometimes happened , that the settler was from home . On one occasion , I remember , neither man , woman , nor child , was to be found ; the stage-driver whistled and halloned , walked into the dwelling , and through the dwelling , sprang the fence , traversed the field of maize , and shouted into the wood ; but all to no purpose . Having resumed his station , and set his horses in motion , I inquired how the letters were to find their destination , seeing that we were carrying them along with us , heaven knew where ? " Oh ! they 'll keep in the country any how ; it is likely indeed , they may go down the Ohio , and make a short tour of the states ; this has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington at last ; and then they 'll commence a straight course anew , and be safe here again this day twelvemouth may be , or two years at farthest . " At Carthage we found the postmaster very naturally fast asleep ; after much clatter against his door and wooden walls , he made his appearance with a candle , and , according to custom , the whole contents of the mail were discharged upon the floor . // The poor Carthaginian rubbed his eyes , as he took up one letter after another from the heap before him ; but his dreams seemed still upon him . " Not a letter can I see , " he exclaimed , as he again rubbed his eyes , and snuffed his candle . " Friend , lend me your eyes , or you may just take the whole load away with you. ** " I am none of the best at decipherir* handwriting , " replied the driver . " Why then I must call my wife , for she is as sharp as a needle . " The wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon made her appearance ; the candle and the papers placed in the middle , wife , husband , and driver set about deciphering the hieroglyphics ; but that the wife had the character of being as sharp as a needle , I should have augured ill of the labours of this triuinvi .. rate . Whether right or wrong , however , the selection was soon made , and the budget once again committed to the wagon . ' pp. 167 , 168.
