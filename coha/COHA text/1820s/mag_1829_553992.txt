ALMOST as many qualifications may be demanded for a perfect historian , indeed the Abb6 Mably has enumerated as many , as Cicero stipulates for a l ) erfect orator . He must be strictly impartial ; a lover of truth under all circumstances , and ready to declare it at all hazards ; he must be deeply conversant with whatever may bring into relief the character of the people he is depicting ,  --  not merely with their laws , constitution , general resources , and all the other more visible parts of the machinery of government , but with the nicer moral and social relations , the informing spim*it , which gives life to the whole , but escapes the eye of a vulgar observer . If he has to do with other ages and nations , he must transport himself into them , expatriating himself , as it were , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressure of the times he is delineating . He must be conscientious in his attention to geography , chronology , &amp;c. , an inaccuracy in which has been fatal to more than one good philosophical history ; and mixed up with all these drier details , he must display the various powers of a novelist or dramatist , throwing his characters into suitable lights and shades , disposing his scenes so as to awaken and maintain an unflagging interest , and diffusing over the whole that finished style , without which his work will only become a magazine of materials for the more // elegant edifices of subsequent writers . He must be-in short , there is no end to what a perfect historian must be and do . It is hardly necessary to add , that such a monster never did and never xviii exist . But , although we can not attain to perfect excellence in this , or any other science in this world , considerable approaches have been made to it , and different individuals have arisen at different periods , possessed , in an eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to make up the aggregate of the character we have been describing . The peculiar character of these qualities will generally be determined in the writer , by that of the age in which he lives . Thus the earlier historians of Greece and Rome sought less to instruct than to amuse . They filled their pictures with dazzling and seductive images . In their researches into antiquity , they were not startled by the marvellous , like the more prudish critics of our day , but welcomed it as likely to stir the imaginations of their readers . They seldom interrupted the story by impertinent reflection . They bestowed infinite pains on the costume , the style of their history , and , in fine , made everything subordinate to the main purpose of conveying an elegant and interesting narrative . Such was Herodotus , such Livy , and such too , the earlier Chroniclers of modern Europe , whose pages glow with the picturesque and hri ! liant pageants of an age of chivalry . These last , as well as Herodotus , may he said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination is more wil* lingly addressed than the understanding . Livy , who wrote in a riper age , lived nevertheless in a court and a period , where tranquillity and opulence disposed the minds of men to elegant recreation , rather than to severe discipline and exertion . As , however , the nation advanced in years , or became oppressed with calamity , history also assumed a graver complexion . Fancy gave way to reflection . The mind , no longer invited to rove abroad in quest of elegant and alluring pictures , was driven back upon itself , speculated more deeply , and sought for support under the external evils of life , in moral and philosophical truth . Description was abandoned for the study of character ; men took the place of events ; and the romance was converted into a drama . Thus it was with Tacitus , wlic lived under those imperial monsters , who turned Rome into a charnel-house ; and his compact narratives are filled witn // moral and political axioms sufficiently numerous to make a volume ; and , indeed , Brotier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian . The same philosophical spirit animates the page of Thucydides , himself one of the principal actors in the long , disastrous struggle , that terminated in the ruin of his nation . But , notwithstanding the deeper and more comprehensive thought of these later writers , there was still a wide difference between the complexion given to history under their hands , and that which it has assumed in our time . We would not he understood as determining , hut simply as discriminating their relative merits . The Greeks and Romans lived when the world , at least when the mind , was in its comparative infancy ; when fancy and feeling were most easily , and loved most to be excited . They possessed a finer sense of beauty than the moderns . They were infinitely more solicitous about the external dress , the finish , and all that makes up the poetry of a composition . Poetry , indeed , mingled in their daily pursuits , as well as pleasures ; it determined their gravest deliberations . The command of their armies was given , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent orator . Poetry entered into their religion , and created those beautiful monuments of architecture and sculpture , which the breath of time has not tarnished . It entered into their philosophy ,  --  and no one confessed its influence more deeply , than he who would have banished it from his Republic . It informed the souls of their orators , and prompted those magnificent rhapsodies , which fall lifeless enough from the stammering tongue of the schoolboy , but which once awak 'd to extacy the living ' populace of Athens . It entered deeply even into their latest history . It was first exhibited in the national chronicles of Homer . It lost little of its coloring , though it conformed to the general laws of prosaic composition , under Herodotus . And it shed a pleasing grace over the sober pages of Thucydides and Xeaophon . The Muse , indeed , was stript of her wings . She no longer made her airy excursions into the fairy regions of romance . But as she moved along the earth , the sweetest wild-flowers seemed to spring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as implying that Grecian history was ambitious of *Ioud or meretricious ornament . Nothing indeed , could be moic simple than its general plan and execution ; far too simple , we fear , for imitation in our day . Thus Thucydides , // for example , distributes his events most inartificially , according to the regular revolutions of the seasons ; and the rear of every section is brought up with the same eternal repetition of *TO4* U. ) TrOhfL&amp; ) *T*iVTa TW*E , *v Oovxv*Mrj* *vv*y*aq* . But in the fictitious speeches , with which he has illumined his narrative , he has left the choicest specimens of Attic eloquence ; and he elaborated his general diction into so high a finish that Demosthenes , as is well known , in the hope of catching some of his rhetorical graces , thought him worthy of being thrice transcribed with his own hand . Far different has been the general conception , as well as execution , of history by the moderns . In this , however , it was accommodated to the exigencies of their situation , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age . If the Greeks lived in the infancy of civilization , the contemporaries of our day may be said to have reached its prime . The same revolution has taken place as in the growth of an individual . The vivacity of the imagination has been blunted , but reason is matured . The credulity of youth has given way to habits of cautious inquiry , and sometimes to a phlegmatic scepticism . The productions , indeed , which first appeared in the doubtful twilight of morning , exhibited the love of the marve , llous , the light and fanciful spirit of a green and tender age . But a new order of things commenced , as the stores of classical learning were unrolled to the eye of the scholar . The mind seemed at once to enter upon the rich inheritance , which the sages of antiquity had been ages in accumulating , and to start , as it were , from the very point where they had terminated their career . Thus raised by learning and experience , it was enabled to take a wider view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest good , and to discern the surest method of arriving at it . The Christian doctrine , too , inculcated that the end of being was best answered by a life of active usefulness , and not by one of abstract contemplation , or selfish indulgence , or passive fortitude , as variously taught by the various sects of antiquity . Hence a new standard of moral excellence was formed . Pursuits were estimated by their practical results ; and the useful was preferred to the ornamental . Poetry , confined to her own sphere , was no longer permitted to mingle in the councils of philosophy . Intellectual and physical science , ip*tead of floating on vague speculation as with the ancients , was established on careful induction and experiment . The orator , // instead of adorning himself with the pomp and garniture ' of verse , sought only to acquire greater dexterity in the management of the true weapons of debate . The passions were less frequently assailed , the reason more . A wider field was opened to the historian . He was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retnote period , from the superficial rumors of oral tradition . Libraries were to be ransacked ; medals and monuments to he studied ; obsolete manuscripts to be decyphered . Every assertion was to be fortified by an authority . And the opinions of others , instead of being admitted on easy faith , were to be carefully collated , and the balance of probability struck between them . XVith these qualifications of antiquarian and critic the modern historian was to combine that of the philosopher ; deducing from his mass of facts general theorems , and giving to them their most extended application . By all this process poetry lost much , but philosophy gained more . The elegant arts sensibly declined ; but the most important and recondite secrets of nature were laid open . All those sciences , which have for their object the happiness and improvement of the species , the science of government , of political economy , of education ,  --  natural and experimental science were carried far beyond the boundaries , which they could possibly have reached under the ancient systems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moderns , were not fully developed until the last century . It may be well enough to notice the intermediate shape which it assumed , before it reached this l ) eriod , in Spain and Italy , but especially this latter country , in the sixteenth century . The Italian historians of that age seemed to have combined the genei*alizing and reflecting spirit characteristic of the moderns , with the simple and graceful forms of composition , which have descended to us from the ancients . Machiavelli , in particular , may remind us of some recent statue , which exhibits all the lincaments and proportions of a contemporary , but to which the sculptor has given a sort of antique dignity by enveloping it in the folds of the Roman toga . No one of the Spanish historians is to be named with him . Mariana , who enjoys among them the greatest celebrity , has , indeed , given to his styl* , both in the Latin and Castihian , the elegant transparency of an ancient classic , but the mass of detail is not quickened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // was a monk ; one of a community , who have formed the most copious , but in many respects the most incompetent chroniclers in the world ; cut off , as they are , from all sympathy with any portion of the species , save their own order ,  --  and predisposed by education to admit as truth the grossest forgeries of fanaticism . What can their narratives be worth , distorted thus by prejudice and credulity ? The Aragonese writers , and Zurita , in particular , though far inferior as to the literary execution of their works , exhibit a pregnant thought and a manly independence of expression far superior to the Jesuit Mariana . The Italian historians of the sixteenth century , moreover , had the good fortune not only to have been eye-witnesses , but to have played prominent parts in the events which they commemorated . And this gives a vitality to their touches , which is in vain to be expected from those of a closet politician . This rare union of public and private excellence is delicately intimated in the inscription on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriosius incertum . ' The personage , by whom the present laws of historic composition may be said to have been first arranged into a regular system , was Vohaire . This extraordinary genius , whose works have been productive of so much mingled good and evil , discovers in them many traces of a humane and beneficent disposition . Nowhere is his invective more keenly directed , than against acts of cruelty and oppression , above all , of religious oppression . He lived in an age of crying abuses both in church and government . Unfortunately he employed a weapon against them , whose influence is not to be controlled by the most expert hand . The envenomed shaft of irony , not only wounds the member at which it is aimed , but diffuses its poison to the healthiest and remotest regions of the body . The free and volatile temper of Voltaire forms a singular contrast with his resolute pertinacity of purpose . Bard , philosopher , historian , this litei'ary Proteus animated every shape with the same mischievous spirit of philosophy . It never deserted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seasons his Romances , equally with his gravest pieces in the Encyclop*dia ,  --  his familiar letters and niost licentious doggerei , no less than his Histories . The leading object of this ph* losophy may be defined by the single cant phrase , the abolition of prejudices . ' But in Voltaire , prejudices were too often confounded with principles . // In his Histories , he seems ever intent on exhibiting , in the most glaring colors , the manifold inconsistencies of the human race ; in showing the contradiction between profession and practice ; in contrasting the magnificence of the apparatus , with the impotence of the results . The enormous abuses of Christianity are brought into juxtaposition with the most meritorious features in other religions ; and thus all are reduced to nearly the same level . The credulity of one half of mankind is set in opposition to the cunning of the other . The most momentous events are traced to the most insignificant causes ; and the ripest schemes of wisdom are shown to have been baffled by the intervention of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regulated by chance ; the springs of human action are resolved into selfishness ; and religion , of whatever denomination , is only a different form of superstition . It is true that his satire is directed not so much against any particular system , as the vices of that system . But the result left upon the mind is not a whit less pernicious . His philosophical romance of Candide , ' affords a good exemplification of his manner . The thesis of perfect optimism in this world , at which he levels this jeu d'esprit , is manifestly indefensible . But then he supports his position with such an array of gross and hyperbolical atrocities , without the intervention of a single palliative circumstance , and withal in such a tone of keen derision , that if any serious impression be left on the mind , it can be no other than that of a baleful , withering scepticism . The historian rarely so far forgets his philosophy as to kindle into high and generous emotion , the glow of patriotism , or moral and religious enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful , and often seasoned with the sallies of a piquant wit , never rises into eloquence or sublimity . Voltaire has been frequently reproached for want of historical accuracy . But if we make due allowance for the sweeping tenor of his reflections , and for the ' lnfi*ite varieiy of his topics , we shall be slow in giving credit to this charge. * He was , indeed , oftentimes misled by his inveterate Pyrrhonism ; a defect , when carried to the excess in which he indulged it , al * Indeed Hallam and Warton , the one as diligent a laborer in the field of civil history , as the other has been in literary , both bear testimony to his general veracity . 4 // most equally fatal to the historian , with credulity or superstition . His researches frequently led him into dark , untravelled regions ; but the aliment , which he imported thence , served only , too often , to minister to his pernicious philosophy . He resembled the allegorical agents of Milton , paving a way across the gulf of Chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the earth . Voltaire effected a no less sensihle revolution in the structure than in the spirit of history . Thus , instead of following the natural consecutive order of events , the work was distributed , on the principle of a Catalogue raisonn6 , into sections arranged according to their subjects , and copious dissertations were introduced into the body of the narrative . Thus , in his Essai sur les Aia3urs , &amp;c. , one chapter is devoted to letters , another to religion , a third to manners , and so on . And in the same way , in his Age of Louis the Fourteenth , ' he has thrown his various illustrations of the policy of government , and of the social habits of the court , into a detached portion at the close of the book . This , indeed , would seem to be deviating from the natural course of things , as they occur in the world ; where the multifarious pursuits of 1 ) leasure and business , the lights and shadows , as it were , of life , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , however artificial this division , it enabled the reader to arrive more expeditiously at the results , for which alone history is valuable , while , at the same time , it put it in the power of the writer to convey with more certainty and facility his own impressions . This system was suhsequently so much refined upon , that Montesquieu , in his Grandeur et D&amp;adence des Romains , ' laid no further stress on historical facts , than as they furnished him with illustrations of his particular theorems . Indeed , so little did his work rest upon the veracity of such facts , that although the industry of Niehuhr , or rather of Beaufort , has knocked away almost all the foundations of early Rome , Montesquieu's* treatise remains as essentially unimpaired in credit as before Thus the materials , which anciently formed the body of history , now served only as ingredients from which its spirit was to be extracted . But this was not always the spirit of truth . And the arbitrary selection , as well as disposition of incidents , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to receive from the author , made it easy to pervert them to the construction of the wildest hypotheses . // The progress of philosophical history is particularly observable in Great Britain , where it seems to have been admirably suited to the grave , reflecting temper of the people . In the graces of narrahve , they have ever been unequal to their French neighbors . Their ancient Chronicles are inferior in spirit and execution , to those either of France or Spain . And their more elaborate histories , down to the middle of the eighteenth century , could not in any way compete with the illustrious models of Italy . But soon after this period , several writers appeared , exhibiting a combination of qualities , erudition , critical penetration , powers of generalization , and a political sagacity , unrivalled in any other age or conntry . The influence of the new forms of historical composition , however , was here , as elsewhere , made too frequently subservient to party and sectarian prejudices . Tory histories , and Whig histories , Protestant and Catholic histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most venerable traditions were exploded , as nursery tales . The statues decreed by antiquity were cast down ; and the characters of miscreants , whom the general suffrage of mankind had damned to infamy , of a Dionysius , a Borgia , or a Richard the Third , were now retraced by what Jovius distinguishes as the golden pen ' of the historian , until the reader , bewildered in the maze of uncertainty , is almost ready to join in the exclamation of Lord Orford to his son , Oh quote me not history , for that I know to be false ! It is remarkable , indeed , that the last mentioned monarch , Richard the Third , whose name has become a by-word of atrocity , the burden of the ballad , and the moral of the drama , should have been the subject of elaborate vindication by two eminent writers of the most opposite characters ,  --  the pragmatical Horace Walpole , and the circumspect and conscientious Sharon Turner . The apology of the latter exhibits a technical precision , a severe scrutiny into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t*timony , that give it all the air of a legal investigation . Thus history seems to be conducted on the principles of a judicial process , in which the writer , assuming the functions of an advocate , studiously suppresses whatever may make against his own side , supports himself by the strongest array of evidence which he can muster ; discredits , as far as possible ; that of the opposite party , and by dexterous interpreVOL. xxlx. - No. 65. 39 // tation and ingenious inference , makes out the most plausible argument for his client that the case will admit . But these , after all , are only the abuses of philosophical history ; and the unseasonable length of remark , into which we have been unwarily led in respect to them , may give us the appearance of laying on them greater emphasis than they actually deserve . There are few writers in any country , whose judgment has not been sometimes warped by personal prejudices . But it is to the credit of the principal British historians , that however they may have been occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted their researches , in the main , with equal integrity and impartiality . And while they have enriched their writings with the stores of a various erudition , they have digested from these details , results of the most enlarged and practical application . Thus history in their hands , although it may have lost much of the simplicity and graphic vivacity , which it maintained with the ancients , has gained much more in the amount of useful knowledge , and the lessons of sound philosophy , which it inculcates . There is no writer , who in his productions exhibits more distinctly the full developement of the principles of modern history , with all its virtues and defects , than Gibbon . His learnin0 was fully equal to his vast subject . This , commencing with expiring civilization in ancient Rome , continues on until the period of its final and perfect resurrection in italy , in the fifteenth century ; and thus may be said to furnish the lights which are to guide us through the long interval of darkness , which divides the old from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to its duration . Goths , Iluns , Tartars , and all the rude tribes of the north , are brought upon the stage , along with the more cultivated natives of the south , the Greeks , Italians , and the intellectual Arab ; and as the scene shifts from one country to another , we behold its population depicted with that peculiarity of physiognomy , and studied propriety of costume , which belong to dramatic exhibition . For Gibbon was a more vivacious draughtsman , than most writers of his school . He was moreover deeply versed in geography , chronology , the study of antiquities , verbal criticism , in short , in all the sciences in any way subsidiary to his art . The extent of his subject permitted him to indulge in those elaborate disquisitions , so congenial to the spirit of modern history , on the most momen // tous and interesting topics . While his early studies enabled him to embellish the drier details of his narrative , with the charms of a liberal and elegant scholarship . What then was wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely of the class , of which we have before been speaking , and his most elaborate efforts exhibit too often the perversion of learning and ingenuity to the vindication of preconceived hypotheses . He can not , indeed , be convicted of ignorance , or literal inaccuracy , as he has triumpbantly proved in his discomfiture of the unfortunate Davis . But his disingenuous mode of conducting the argument , leads precisely to tbe same unfair result . Thus , in his celebrated chapters on the Progress of Christianity , ' which he tells us were reduced by three successive revisals , from a bulky volume to their present size , ' he has often slurred over in the text such particulars as might reflect most credit on the character of the religion , or shuffled them into a note at the bottom of the page ; while all that admits of a doubtful complexion in it early propagation , is ostentatiously blazoned , and set in opposition with the most amiable features of Paganism . While by a style of innuendo , that conveys more than meets the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe a taint of suspicion on the purity , which he dares not openly assail . It would be easy to furnish examples of all this , were this the place for it . But the charges have no novelty , and have been abundantly substantiated by others . It is a consequence of this scepticism in Gibbon , as with Voltaire , that his writings are nowhere warmed with a generous moral sentiment . The most sublime of all spectacles , that of the martyr , who suffers for conscience ' sake , and this equally whother his creed be founded in truth or error , is contemplated by the historian with the smile , or rather sneer , of philosophic indifference . This is not only bad taste , as he is addressing a Christian audience , but he thus voluntarily relinquishes one of the most powerful engines for the mo'vement of human passion ; which is never so easily excited as by deeds of suffering , selfdevoted heroism . But although Gibbon was wholly defective in moral enthusiasm , his style is vivified by a certain exhilarating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his reader . This may , perhaps , be traced to his egotism , or , to speak more liberally to an ardent attachment to his professional pursuits , //  --  and to his inextinguishable l3ve of letters . This enthusiasm appears in almost every page of his great work , and enabled him to triumph over all its difficulties . It is particularly conspicuous whenever he touches upon Rome , the Alma Mater of science , and whose adopted son he may be said to have been from his earliest boyhood . Whenever he contemplates her fallen fortunes , he mourns over her with the fond solicitude that might become an ancient Roman . And when he depicts her pristine glories , dimly seen by us through the mist of so many centuries , he does it with such vivid accuracy of conception , that the reader , like the traveller who wanders through the excavations of Pompeii , seems to be gazing on the original forms and brilliant colors of antiquity . To Gibbon 's egotism ,  --  in its most literal sense ,  --  to his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his style is conspicuous . The Historian of the Decline and Fall , ' too rarely forgets his own importance in that of his subject . The consequence , which he attaches to his personal labors , is shown in a bloated dignity of expression , and an ostentation of ornament , that contrast whimsically enough with the trifling topics and commonplace thoughts , on which , in the course of his long work , they are occasionally employed . He nowhere moves along with the easy freedom of nature , but seems to leap , as it were , from triad to triad , by a succession of strained , convulsive efforts . He affected , as he tells us , the light festive raillery of Voltaire . But his cumbrous imitation of the mercurial Frenchman may remind one , to make use of a homely simile , of the ass in IEsop 's fable , who frisked upon his master in imitation of the sportive gambols of the spaniel . The two first octavo volumes of Gibbon 's History were written in a comparatively modest and unaffected manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , indced , his style was exceedingly commended by the most competent critics of that day , as Hume , Joseph Warton , and others , as is abundantly shown in their correspondence . But when he had tasted the sweets of popular applause , and had been crowned as the historian of the day , his increased consequence becomes at once visible in the assumed stateliness and magnificence of his bearing . But even after this period , whenever the subject is suited to this style , and when his phlegmatic temper is warmed by those generous emotions , of which , as we have said , it was sometimes susceptible , he exhibits his ideas in the most splendid and imposing forms , of which the English language is capable . // The most eminent illustrations of the system of historical writing , which we have been discussing , that have appeared in England , in the present century , are the works of Mr Hallam ; in which the author , discarding most of the circumstances that go to make up mere narrative , endeavors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of constitutional polity , employing his wide range of materials in strict subordination to this purpose . But while history has thus been conducted en nearly the same principles in England for the last century , a new path has been struck out in France , or rather an attempt has lately been made there to retrace the old one . M. Barante , still better known as an elegant literary critic , than as an historian , in the preliminary remarks to his Histoire des Dues de Bourgogne , ' considers the draughts of modern compilers as altogether wanting in the vivacity and freshness of their originals . They tell the reader how lie should feel , instead of making h im do so . They give him their own results , instead of enabling him by a fair delineation of incidents to form his own . And while the early chroniclers , in spite of their unformed and obsolete idiom , are still read with delight , the narratives of the former are too often dry , languid , and uninteresting . He proposes , therefore , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , the spirit of their works , without any affectation , however , of their antiquated phraseology ; and to exhibit as vivid and veracious a portraiture , as possible , of the times he is delineating , unbroken by any discussions or reflections of his own . The result has been a work in eleven octavo volumes , which , notwithstanding its bulk , has already passed into four editions . The two last productions of our countryman , Mr Irving , undoubtedly fall within the class of narrative history . To this , indeed , he seems peculiarly suited by his genius , his fine perception of moral and natural beauty , his power of discriniinating the most delicate shades of character , and of unfolding a series of events , so as to maintain a lively interest in the reader ; and a lactea ubertas of expression which can impart a living eloquence even to the most commonplace sentiments . Had the Life of Columbus ' been written by an historian of the other school of which we have been speaking , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Isabella for the administration of their colonies , and for the regulation of trade ; nor would he have neglected to // descant on a topic , worn somewhat threadbare it must be owned , so momentous as the moral and political consequences of the discovery of America ; neither would such a writer , in an account of the conquest of Granada , have omitted to collect such particulars as might throw light on the genius , social institutions , and civil polity of the Spanish Arabs . But all these particulars , however pertinent to a philosophical history , would have been entirely out of keeping in Mr Irving 's , and might have produceti a disagreeable discordance in the general harmony of his plan . Mr Irving has seldom selected a subject better suited to his peculiar powers , than the conquest of Granada . Indeed , it would hardly have heen possible for one of his warm sensibilities to have lingered so long among the remains of Moorish magnificence , with which Spain is covered , without being interested in the fortunes of a people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once preserved the sacred flame , ' when it had become extinct in every corner of Christendom , and whose influence is still visible on the intellectual culture of Modern Europe . It has been found no easy matter , however , to compile a satisfactory and authenticated account of the Arabians , notwithstanding that the number of their historians , cited by D'Herbelot and Casiri , would appear to exceed tb*t of any European nation . The despotic governments of the East have never been found propitious to that independence of opinion so essential to historical composition ; ubi sentire qu* velis , et qu* sentias dicere licet . ' And their copious compilations , prolific in frivolous and barren detail , are too often wholly destitute of the sap and vitality of history . The social and moral institutions of Arabian Spain experienced a considerable modification from her long intercourse with the Europeans ; and she offers a nobler field of research for the chronicler , than is to be found in any other country of the Moslem . Notwithstanding this , the Castilian scholars , until within late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Saracen brethren ; and our most copious notices of their political history , until the late posthumous publication of Conde , have been drawn from the extracts which M. Cardonne translated from the Arabic Manuscripts ir the Royal Library at Paris . The most interesting periods of the Saracen dominicmn ' in Spain , are that embraced by the Empire of the Omeyades of // Cordova , between the years 755 and 1030 ,  --  and that of the Kingdom of Granada , extending from the middle of the thirteenth to the close of the fifteenth century . The intervening period of their existence in the Peninsula offers only a spectacle of inextricable anarchy . The first of these periods was that in which the Arabs attained their meridian of opulence and power , and in which their general illumination affords a striking contrast with the deep barbarism of the rest of Europe . But it was that , too , in which their character , having been but little affected by contact with the Spaniards , retained most of its original Asiatic peculiarities . This has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of greatest interest in their history , nor has it ever , so far as we are aware , been selected for the purposes of romantic fiction . But when their territories became reduced within the limits of Granada , the Moors had insensibly submitted to the superior influences of their Christian neighbors . Their story , at this time , abounds in passages of uncommon beauty and interest . Their wars were marked by feats of personal prowess and romantic adventure , while the intervals of peace were abandoned to all the license of luxurious revelry . Their character , therefore , blendii*g the various peculiarities of Oriental and European civilization , offers a rich study for the poet and the novelist . As such , it has been liberally employed by the Spaniards , and has not been altogether neglected by the writers of other nations . Thus Flonan , whose sentiments , as well as his style , seem to be always floundering midway betwixt the regions of prose and poetry , has made out of the story of this people his popular romance of Gonsalvo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of an Italian Epic in Tirahosehi , entitled 11 Conquista di Granata , ' though we have never seen the original . The ground , however , before the appearance of Mr Irving , had not been occupied by any writer of eminence , in the English language , for the purposes either of romance or history . The conquest of Granada , to which 1*r Irving has confined *himsel4 so disastrous to the Moors , was one of the most brilliant achievements in the most brilliant period of Spanish history . Nothing is more usual than overweening commendations of antiquity ; the good old times , ' whose harsher features , like those of a ru 0ged landscape , lose all their asperity in the distance . But the period of which we are speaking , embracing the reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella at the close of the fifteenth and begin- I t *4 - . // ning of the sixteenth centuries , was undoubtedly that , in which the Spanish nation displayed the fulness of its moral and physical energies , when , escaping from the license of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full prime of manhood , and the perfect developemeut of those faculties , whose overstrained exertions were soon to be followed by exhaustion and premature decrepitude . The remnant of Spaniards , who , retreating to the mountains of the north , escaped the overwhelming inundation of the Saracens at the beginning of the eighth century , continued to cherish the free institutions of their Gothic ancestors . The Fuero Juzgo , ' the ancient Visi-Gothic code , was still retained by the people of Castile and Leon , and may be said , indeed , to form the basis of all their subsequent legislation . While in Aragon the dissolution of the primitive monarchy opened the way for even more liberal and equitable forms of government . The independence of character , thus fostered by the peculiar constitutions of these petty states , was still further promoted by the circumstances of their situation . Their uninterrupted wars with the infidel ,  --  the necessity of winning back from him inch by inch , as it were , the conquered soil , required the active codperation of every class of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intrepidity , a personal consequence , and an extent of immunities , such as were not enjoyed by them in any other country of Europe . The free cities acquired considerable tracts of the reconquered territory with rights of jurisdiction over them , and Lent their representatives to Cortes , near a century before a similar privilege was conceded to them in England . Even the peasantry , so degraded , at this period , throughout the rest of Europe , assumed under this state of things a conscious dignity and importance , which are visible in their manners at this day ;  --  and it was in this class during the late French invasions , that the fire of ancient patriotism revived with greatest force , when it seemed almost extinct in the breasts of the degenerate nobles. . - The religious feeling , which mingled in their wars with the infidels , gave to their character a tinge of lofty enthusiasm . And the irregular nature of this warfare suggested abundant topics for that popular minstrelsy , which acts so powerfully on the passions of a people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Sanchez , before the middle of the twelfth century , contributed in no slight degree , by calling up the most inspiring // national recollections , to keep alive the generous glow of patriotism . This influence is not imaginary . Heeren pronounces the poems of Homer to have been the principal bond which united the Grecian States . ' And every one knows the influence exercised over the Scottish peasantry by the Border mmstrelsy. 1*1any anecdotes might be quoted to show the veneration universally entertained by the Spaniards , broken , as they were , into as many discordant states as ever swarmed over Greece , for their favorite hero of romance and history . Among others , Mariana relates one of a king of Navarre , who , making an incursion into Castile about a century after the warrior 's death , was carrying off a rich booty , when he was met by an Abbot of a neighboring convent , with his monks , bearing aloft the standard of the Cid , who implored him to restore the plunder to the inhabitants from whom he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the sacred relic , after complying with his request , escorted back the banner in solemn procession with his whole army to the place of its deposit . But while all these circumstances conspired to give an uncommon elevation to the character of the ancient Spanard , even of the humblest rank , and while the prerogative of the monarch was more precisely as well as narrowly defined , than in most of the other nations of Christendom , the aristocracy of the country was insensibly extending its privileges , and laying the foundation of a power that eventually overshadowed the throne and well nigh subverted the liberties of the state . In addition to the usual enormous immunities claimed by this order in feudal governments ( although there is no reason to believe that the system of feudal tenure obtained in Castile , as it certainly did in Aragon ) , they enjoyed a constitutional privilege of withdrawing their allegiance from their sovereign on sending him a formal notice of such renunciation , and the sovereign , on his part , was obliged to provide for the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might choose to continue in such overt rebellion . These anarchical provi*ion*in *heji constitution did not remain a dead letter , and repeated examples of their pernicious application are enumerated both by the historians of Aragon and Castile . The long minorities , with which the latter country was afflicted , moreover , contributed still further to swell the overgrown power of the privileged orders ; and the violent revolution , which , in 136S , placed the house of Trastamarre upon the throne , by impairing the revenues , and consequently // the authority of the crown , opened the way for the wild uproar , which reigned throughout the kingdom during the succeeding century . Alonso de Palencia , a contempory chronicler , dwells with melancholy minuteness on the calamities of this unhappy period ; when the whole country was split into factions of the nobles , the monarch openly contemned , the commons trodden in the dust , the court become a brothel , the treasury bankrupt , public faith a jest , and private morals too loose and audacious to court even the veil of hypocrisy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved the state in this hour of peril . It effected , indeed , a change on the face of things as magical as that produced by the wand of an enchanter in some Eastern tale . Their reign it is true , wears a more glorious aspect from its contrast with the turbulent period which preceded it , as the landscape glows with redoubled brilliancy when the sunshine has scattered the tempest . We shall briefly notice some of the features of the policy , by which they effected this change . They obtained from the Cortes an act for the resumption of the improvident grants made by their predecessor . By which means an immense accession of revenue , which had been squandered upon unworthy favorites , was brought back to the royal treasury . They compelled many of the nobility to resign , in favor of the crown , such of its possessions , as they had acquired by force , fraud , or intrigue , during the late season of anarchy . The son of that gallant Marquis Duke of Cadiz , for instance , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle , was stripped of his patrimony of Cadiz , and compelled to exchange it for the humbler territory of Arcos , from which the family henceforth derived their title . By all these expedients the revenues of the state , at the demise of Isabella , were increased twelve fold beyond what they had been at the time of her accession . They reorganized the ancient institution of the Hermandad , '  --  a very different association under their hands fror the Holy Brotherhood , ' which we meet with in Gil Blas . Every hundred householders w*re obliged to equip and maintain a horseman at their joint expense ; and this corps furnished a vigilant police in civil emergencies , and an effectual aid in time of war . It was found , moreover , of especial service in suppressing the insurrections and disorders of the nobility . They were particularly solicitous to abolish the right and usage of private war , claimed by this haughty order , com // pelling them , on all occasions , to refer their disputes to the constituted tribunals of justice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic sovereigns to counterbalance the authority of the aristocracy , by exalting , as far as prudent , that of the coinmons . In the various convocations of the national legislature , or Cortes , in this reign , no instance occurs of any city having lost its prescriptive right of furnishing representatives , as had frequently hap pened under preceding monarchs , who , from negligence or policy , had omitted to summon them . But it would be tedious to go into all the details of the system , employed by Ferdinand and Isabella , for the regeneration of the decayed fabric of government ; - of their wholesome regulations for the encouragement of industry ; of their organization of a national militia , and an efficient marine ; of the severe decorum , which they introduced within the corrupt precincts of the court ; of the temperate economy , by which they controlled the public expenditures ; and of the munificent patronage , which they , or rather their almoner on this occasion , that most enlightened of bigots , Cardinal Ximenes , dispensed to science and letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of former abuses , but were intended to call forth all the latent energies of the Spanish character , and with these excellent materials , to erect a constitution of government which should secure to the nation tranquillity at home , and enable it to go forward in its ambitious career of discovery and conquest . The results were certainly equal to the wisdom of the preparatioi ) s . The first of the series of brilliant enterprises was the conquest of the Moorish kingdom of Granada ; - those rich and lovely regions of the Peninsula , the last retreat of the infidel , and of which he had continued in possession for nearly eight centuries . This together wi di the subsequent occupation of Navarre by the crafty Ferdinand , consolidated the various principalities of Spain into one monarchy , and , by extending its boundaries in the Peninsula to their present dimensions , raised it from a subordinate situation to the first class of E**iropean powers . The Italian wars , under the conduct of the Great Captain , ' secured to Spain the more specious , but less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enabled Charles the Fifth to dictate laws to Europe for nearly half a century . And , lastly , as if the old world could not afford a theatre sufficiently vast for their ambition , Columbus gave a new world to Cas .. tile and Leon . // Such was the attitude assumed by the nation under the Catholic Kings , as they were called ; it was the *eason of hope and youthful enterprise , when the nation seemed to be renewing its ancient energies , and to prepare like a giant to run its course . The modern Spaniard , who casts his eye over the long interval that has since elapsed , during the first half of which , the nation seemed to waste itself on schemes of mad ambition , or fierce fanaticism , and in the latter half to sink into a state of paralytic torpor ,  --  the Spaniard , we say , who casts a melancholy glance over this dreary interval , will turn with satisfaction to the close of the sixteenth century , as the most glorious epoch in the annals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr Irving has introduced us in his late work . And if his portraiture of the Castilian of that day wears somewhat of a romantic and , indeed , incredible aspect to those who contrast it with the present , they must remember that he is only reviving the tints which had faded on the canvass of history . But it is time that we should return from this long digression , into which we have been led by the desire of exhibiting in stronger relief some peculiarities in the situation and spirit of the nation , at the period from which Mr Irving has selected the materials of his last , indeed , his two last publications . Our author , in his Chronicle of Granada , ' has been but slightly indebted to Arabic authorities . Neither Conde nor Cardonne has expended more than fifty or sixty pages on this humiliating topic . But ample amends have been offered in the copious prolixity of the Castilian writers . The Spaniards can boast a succession of Chronicles from the period of the great Saracen invasion . Those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently meagre and unsatisfactory . But from the middle of the thirteenth century , the stream of history runs full and clear ; and their Chronicles , composed in the vernacular , exhibit a richness and picturesque variety of incident , that give them inestimable value as a body of genuine historical documents . The reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella were particularly fruitful in these sources of information . History then , like most of the other departments of literature , seemed to be in a state of transition ,  --  when the fashions of its more antiquated costume began to mingle insensibly with the peculiarities of the modern ; when , in short , the garrulous graces of narration were beginning to be tempered by the tone of grave and philosophical reflection . // We will briefly notice a few of the eminent sources from which Mr Irving has drawn his account of the Conquest of Granada . ' The first of these is the Epistles of Peter Martyr , an Italian savant , who , having passed over with the Spanish ambassador into Spain , and being introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some important embassies . He was personally present at several campaigns of this war . In his Letters , ' he occasionally smiles at the caprice which had led him to exchange the pen for the sword ; while his specuJations on the events passing before him , being those of a scholar , rather than of a soldier , afford in their moral complexion a pleasing contrast to the dreary datails of blood and battle . Another authority is the Chronicle of Bernaldez , a worthy ecclesiastic of that period , whose bulky manuscript , like that of many a better writer , lies still ingulphed in the dust of some Spanish library , having never been admitted to the honors of the press . Copies of it , however , are freely enough circulated . It is one of those good-natured , gossipping memorials of an antique age , abounding equally in enrions and commonplace incident , told in a way sufficiently prolix , but not without considerable interest . The testimony of this writer is of particular value , moreover , on this occasion , from the proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were the seat of the war . His style overflows with that religious loyalty , with which Mr Irving has liberally seasoned the effusions of Fray Antonio Agapida . Hernando del Pulgar , another contemporary historian , was the Secretary and Counsellor of their Catholic majesties , and appointed by them to the post of national Chronicler ; an office familiar both to the courts of Castile and Aragon , in which latter country , especially , it has been occupied by some of its most distinguished historians . Pulgar 's long residence at court , his practical acquaintance with affairs , and above all , the access which he obtained , by means of his official station , to the best sources of information , have enabled him to make his work a rich repository of facts relating to the general resources of government , the policy of its administration , and , more particularly , the conduct of the military operations in the closing war of Granada , of which he was himself an eye-witness . In addition to these writers , this period has been illumined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aragon , iVlariana and Zurita ; both of whom conclude their narratives with it ; the last expanding the biography of Ferdinand alone into two // volumes folio . Besides these , Mr Irving has derived collateral lights from many sources of inferior celebrity , but not less unsuspicious credit. * So that , in conclusion , notwithstanding a certain dramatic coloring which Fray Agapida 's Chronicle ' occasionally wears , and notwithstanding the romantic forms of a style , which , to borrow the language of Cicero , seems to flow , as it were , from the very lips of the Muses , ' we may honestly recommend it as substantially an authentic record of one of the most interesting , and , as far as English scholars are concerned , one of the most untravelled portions of Spanish history . * Neither of Mr Irving 's late writings could have been compiled from materials existing in any or all of the public libraries in this country ; and this independently of the manuscript authorities used hy him , which may be supposed not easily met with out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the historical works , which daily appear in France , Germany , and England . One cause of our deficiency in such original documents , and , indeed , in all but the more obvious and classical productions of literature , has been the difficulty of meeting with an intelligent agent in Europe , competent to the selection and purchase of such works . Whatever impediment , however , has been occasioned by this circumstance is now removed . Mr. 0 . Rich , the late American Consul at Madrid , whose valuable library furnished Mr Irving with some of the most important materials for his Life of Columbus , ' has transferred his residence to London ; where he devotes himself to the execution of such commissions for the purchase of books as he may be entrusted with by his countrymen . He has been employed in making extensive purchases for Harvard College Libr*try and the Boston Athena*um , as well as several smaller ones for individuals of this city ; and he has uniformly executed his orders with promptness , sagacity , and great economy . His accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal cities of the continent , afford such facilities for literary acquisitions , as we hope will be improved by public institutions and private individuals . We feel that we are doing a service to the cause of letters in recommending this gentleman , whose useful labors have well entitled him to this public testimony . Mr Rich 's address in London is 12 Red Lion Square .
