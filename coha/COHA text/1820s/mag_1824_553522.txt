txt ART . XVI. - Third dnnual Report of the Superintendent of Common Schools in the State of New York . Submitted to the Assembly at Albany , Jan. 8 , 1824 . ON a former occasion the attention of our readers was called to a statement of the School Funds in New York , and the liberal donations of that state for the * of education and literature. * We have now before us a very interesting document , which was presented to the Assembly during its session the present year . This document consists of sixty eight folio printed pages , containing the Report of the Superintendent of Schools , an abstract of the returns of the several towns in the state for 1823 , and other papers relating to the subject . The nature and value of these returns may be understood , when it is known that they contain the number of // school districts in each town ; the average number of months a school has been kept during the year ; the amount of public money received ; the number of children taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ages of 5 and 15 years . This minuteness in the returns necessarily makes them voluminous , but at the same time it affords the only accurate means of knowing the wants of the people , and effecting a judicious distribution of the funds . The following summary is found in the superintendent 's Report , and informs us , *l. * all the counties , fifty four in number , and all the towns , being six hundred and eigkty four in number , including wards in cities , have , with the exception of ten old , and seventeen new towns , presented their reports for the preceding year . 2 . That there are in this state 7382 school districts , and consequently , as many common schools . That from 6705 of those districts , returns have been received at this department . 3 . That within the last year , 331 new school districts were formed and organized . 4 . That 377,034 children were instructed in the districts stated in the abstract for the space of eight months , during the preceding year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed for the like time , in the non reporting districts not stated in the abstract , making a grand total of 400,534. 5 . That 25,861 more children were educated in our common schools , during the year 1823 , than during the year 1822. 6 . That the number of children reported to be between the ages of 5 and i5 years , is 373,008 , and exceeds the number reported the year before , by 15,979. 7 . That in 29 counties , more children were educated the year 1823 , than the number reported to reside therein between the ages before mentioned ; and that 4026 more children , throughout the state , were educated in 1823 , than are reported to reside therein , between the ages above mentioned . 8 . That in 45 counties , a greater number of children were instructed in common schools , in the year 1823 , than in the preceding year . 9 . That 182,802 dollars , 25 cents , of public monies , ( being the whole amount drawn last year from the treasury , raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were expended for the support of common schools during that year , and it is estimated that , in addition to this amount , more than 850,000 dollars from the private funds of individuals were appropriated , in like manner , // during the same period , ( exclusive of public and private appropriations and benefactions for the support of colleges and academies , ) making a grand total of more than a million of dollars . ' p. 2 . The above statements refer exclusively to common schools , in addition to which there are in the state of New York 36 incorporated academies , containing 2683 students . At the three colleges , Columbia , Hamilton , and Union , are 464 students ; and at the two Medical Colleges 291 . In three counties the average expense of educating each scholar , taught in the common schools during the year 1823 , was more than one dollar ; in 16 counties it was less than a dollar and more than fifty cents ; in 34 counties it was between fifty and twenty five cents ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference arises chiefly , we suppose , from the circumstance of there being a school for a less number of months in some counties than others ; and also in some degree from the difference in the expense of teaching . It is asserted in the Report , that in no state in the Union are the advantages of a common school education enjoyed by so large a proportion of the population as in New York ; and that even the most enlightened part of the old world can not produce a parallel . ' As a proof of these facts it is said , that England , three years ago , had only 18,449 endowed and unendowed schools , in which were instructed 644,282 children ; and in Scotland the whole number of schools was at the same time only 3556 , containing 176,303 pupils ,  --  and while in Connecticut not more than one sixth , in England one fifteenth , and in Scotland one tenth . of their respective populations every year attend their schools , it will be found that in this state more than one fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common schools alone . ' These statements are novel and curious ; they are perhaps correct , although in regard to Connecticut and Scotland we have slight misgivings . In Massachusetts , too , we are prepared to believe , that if the same accurate returns were made as in New York , the proportion of children attending common schools would be found quite as large . We say this , however , only in reference to the facts of the case , without the least disposition to detract from the meritorious exertions of New York in promoting an object the most important , which can engage the attention of a liberal and enlightened legisla // ture , especially in a country whose happy lot it is to have a government , which depends for its strength and prosperity on the intelligence of the people . It is not in the way of comparison that we desire to speak . Such a parallel would be invidious , when so many of the states have made , and are still making generous provisions for the advancement of education . The enlarged plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent vote of that state , in favor of its new university , is an additional evidence of th' earnestness and magnanimity with which the original designs are carried into execution . The school funds of the state of New York are derived from such sources , as to ensure them a gradual increase for many years . There are two separate and permanent funds set apart by the legislature , which already amount to about a million and a quarter of dollars . The whole amount of the general and local school fund is given in the Report at $1,637,003 . Two lots of six hundred and forty acres each are also reserved , in all the military bounty lands , for the support of the gospel and of schools . In several townships some of these lands have become productive , and the money arising from their sales or lease is called the local school funJ , by reason of its being appropriated for the benefit of the towns in which the lands are situated . The proceeds of all the military lands , which shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school fund . The lands still unsold , which are reserved for the purposes of education , amount to nearly a million of acres . When , we consider the rapidity with which the new parts of this state are becoming settled , and the consequent increasing value of the lands , and when w* take into view the generous spirit , which has prompted s* noble a scheme for the benefit of schools , and the thorough and admirable plan which has been adopted for carrying it into effect , we have a right to look for results , which have not been surpassed , and probably not equalled , in any state or community . We are presented with an example not more honorable to the feelings , and creditable to the wisdom of the people of New York , than deserving the imitation of our legislatures in other parts of the union .
