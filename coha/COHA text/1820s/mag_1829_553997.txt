txt ART . VI. - The . Imerican Jurist . No . I. Boston . January . 1829 . THE history of the law in this country may be properly divided into three several epochs . The first , from the settlement until the charter of 1692 . The second , from that period to the time of the Revolution ; and the third , from the year 1780 to the present time . During the first of these periods , the government , both executive and judicial , was what might truly be called primitive . No trace can he found of law as a science or profession . The judges left the ploughed field for the hench , when occasion called , and found reason and common sense a very sufficient substitute for the Pandects or Year Books . In the piety of their hearts they adopted the law of Moses for their criminal code , and in civil litigation the common law of England was made , as far as their slender means of information would permit , the rule of their decision . Frequently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exercised ; but even then a judge of modern date would have been shocked at the encroachments of a jury upon the province of the law , and perhaps amused to see a juryman exercise the right , then conferred upon him by legislative enactment , of consulting with any bystander . The clergy possessed , as in England , much of the legal knowledge of the community , and therefore we early find , that difficult legal points were referred to their decision , much as the le islatures refer such questions to the judiciary under the provIsions of the state constitutions . We have reason not only to be thankful that the clergy of that day did not make an improper use of the power thus necessarily put into their hands , but also that there is no necessity of trying the experiment at the present day . Perhaps no incident more forcibly proves the correct principles of our forefathers than the fact , that , when the outrageous conduct of Sir Edmund Andros had roused the people from their natural peacefulness , when the royal authority was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , in fact , all law had ceased to exist , then it was found that no law was wanted , and in the midst of revolution and violence we discover no symptoms of riot or outrage . The second epoch of our law commenced with the reception // of the charter , which followed the seizure of Sir Edmund Andros . It was received in 1692 . Although the revolutionary spirit displayed by the colonists was in strict accordance with the proceedings of the mother country at the same period , still it was by no means desirable , that the same power should be again exercised . The charter , therefore , now received , while it pretended to make full provision for the preservation of justice , at once reduced the colony to the condition of a subjected province , and thus , while it assumed the air of protecting the rights of each individual , in fact aimed a blow at the civil rights of all . By this charter , the governor , as representative of the royal prerogative , had the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws made in the colonial assembly were to be sent to England for approval , and all civil causes , above three hundred pounds , were to be carried to England by appeal for adjudication . Seven years after , in 1699 , an act was passed , which received the royal approbation , and which established a Supreme Judicial Court with five judges , a Court of Common Pleas for civil actions , and a Court of General Sessions of the Peace , with another Court of concurrent jurisdiction for criminal matters . It is worthy of remark , that with all the various modifications and revolutions through which this country has passed since that period , the general outline of a judicial establishment here presented , has been in a great measure still preserved . That the judges retained their offices only during the pleasure of the king or his deputy , was the most prominent feature of servitude , and one which is now , happily for us , totally abolished . No principle can be more sure , than that by the independence of the judge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise man , the late President Jefferson , once thought differently , and in his zeal to uphold the rights of the people , would have put it in their power to prostrate the majesty of justice . Now that party spirit on this subject has long since subsided , and the excellencc of a permanent bench , removable only by impeachment , has been proved , we believe tl1at even the most zealous partisans of that doctrine will subscribe to the opposite opinion . To render this office perfectly independent , it should not only be held during good behavior , but also the salary should be fixed and permanent . The want of such a provision in // the state of Kentucky , enabled the legislature ( which could find no good ground for impeachment when they wished for a removal ) to fix the salary at twenty-five cents , and thus compel the incumbent to resign . Even at this late period , in the year 1699 , at the very time when judicial authority seemed hy legislative enactment to have been settled on a firm basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the clergy in matters not considered at the present day within their control or supervision . In May , 1699 , the question of the legality of lotteries was referred to the opinion of the clergy , and in Mather 's Magnalia we have preserved to us a copy of their judgment . Previous to the conflicts of the pen , which led to the subsequent conflicts of the Revolution , no name stands forth distinguished in the halls of justice but thai of Reed ; and even he , though no doubt possessing naturally a mind of rare strength , seems to glimmer unknown like an unseen star . ' To the period of the revolution , the highest recommendation was vir ins ' *ga*s pieudc , and all the talent of the young colony was devoted exclusively to the pulpit The political struggle with the mother country was wanted to call forth the latent energies of the lawyer and the statesman . The last period in the judicial history of New England includes its darkest and brightest hours . The disgraceful scenes of Shay 's insurrection , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the natural result of the late struggle and exertions of our countrymen , at the same time exhibited the wisdom and strength of our legal and political institutions . Nothing , perhaps , but the firmness of the Senate of the state preserved our whole system of law and government from being trampled under foot by the unprincipled Jack-Cades of that day . It is with a justifiable pride that we contemplate the progress of the science from that time to the present . The United States , freed from the restrictions of colonial subjection , almost immediately sprang up into the full maturity of a commercial nation . With commerce came a host of contracts , maritime and domestic ; an increase of the value of land gave rise to greater nicety in the examination of titles , and all tended to produce important questions , frequently involving intricate points of legal science . Above all , the wisdom of the people was shown in that liberal provision for the support of the // bench , which was sure to command talents requisite to give dignity and weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , until 1804 , that a regular and systematic series of Reports was commenced in Massachusetts ; and although previous to that time many points were mooted and opinions delivered , which would have been well worth preserving , still the minutes of them were so few and loose , that no great reliance can be placed upon any hut those few which have been added , in the Supplements , to the regular Reports . This series of Reports , commenced in 1804 , has been continued by private enterprise and legislative patronage to the present day ; and the cases therein stated have been seldom surpassed , either in the wisdom of their decisions and the soundness of their reasoning , on the fidelity xv ith which the reporter 's duty has been ( liseharged . As an omen of much good promise in the progress of the law , we hail with l ) leasure the appearance of The Jurist . ' The reasons which led to its establishment are set forth in a short and luminous preface ; and did the work thus far possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world the Address , ' which forms the first article , it must be allowed to have accomplished a valuable end . In the first number are contained , besides the Address delivered before the Members of the Suffolk Bar , in 1821 , by Mr Justice Story , an able ( discussion of the advantages that would result from a national bankrupt law , and of the causes which have hitherto l ) I'e*ente ( l its establishment ; a comprehensive review of the law of real pioperty , pointing out some of the peculiarities which exist in the various states upon this very intricate branch of legal erudition ; a few interesting questions of insurance discussed and settled , with an exhibition of profound knowledge and research in commercial law ; a short sketch of the character and writings of Sir William Blackstone ; a review of Livermore 's Dissertations upon International Law ; some remarks upon the admissibility of the testimon of Quakers ; a memoir of Judge Ti'imble ; a short review y of the laws upon literary property , and the questions arising thereon ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for // Justice Story 's Address briefly is to offer some general considerations touching the past and present state of the common law , and to suggest some hints as to its future prospects in our own country . ' In doing this the learned judge is led to speak upon one or two topics of a peculiarly interesting nature . The first has somewhat of an appalling aspect . There are now twenty-four states in the union , ' says he , in all of which , except Louisiana , the common law is the acknowledged basis of their jurisprudence . Yet this jurisprudence , partly by statute , partly by judicial interpretations , and partly by local usages and peculiarities , is perpetually receding further and furthor from the common standard . While the states retain their independent sovereignties , as they must continue to do under our federative system , it is hopeless to expect that any greater uniformity will exist in the future than in the past . Nor do I know , that so far as domestic happiness and political convenience are concerned , a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , of administering justice in the state as well as national courts , from the new and peculiar relations of our system , must be very laborious and perplexing ; and the conflict of opinion upon general questions of law in the rival jurisdictions of the different states , will not be less distressing to the philosophical jurist than to the practical lawyer . ' p. 13 . The inconveniences arising from these diversities would seem to be of a nature not only to trouble the laxvyer and the court , hut to render the commercial and trading part of the community liable to perpetual mistakes , losses , and vexations . As the means of internal communication with other states daily increase , a host of contracts , debts , liabilities , and transfers spring up . The means of securing debts , transferring real and personal property , and enforcing agreements in one state , become interesting to the inhabitants of other states who may transact business there . A few instances will show the diversities , and illustrate the uncertainties , to which we allude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in England . In Vermont , Indiana , Illinois , and Louisiana , they never had any existence . In New York , Ohio , Connecticut , New Jersey , Virginia , North Carohna , Missouri , Tennessee , Kentucky , Mississippi , and Alabama , they have either been converted into fee simple or absolutely abolished by statute ; though in New Jersey , Connecticut , Alabama , and Mississippi , an estate tail can exist during the lives of donees then existing . In Maine , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , // Delaware , and Maryland , they may be barred by a regularly acknowledged deed ; and also in the last four , by a nearly obsolete form of fine and common recovery . So much for the diversities of title to land simply in regard to one species of tenure ; sufficient , however , to render the transfer very unsafe to a person not perfectly conversant with the law of the state , or the situation of the title to the property . Nothing can be imagined more various and diversified than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of representation , and the process of transfer . Thus , in the simple matter of recording , observe the differences , altogether arbitrary in themselves , and puzzling to the citizens of other states . In Tennessee , recording is necessary to make a deed valid even between the original parties . It is void , as it respects subsequent 1 ) urchasers , for a good consideration and without notice , in Indiana , Illinois , Georgia , and Tennessee , unless it is recorded within twelve months from date ; in Virginia and Kentucky , unless within eight months ; in Pennsylvania , Ohio , und South Carolina , unless recorded within six months ; in Missouri , Alabama , and Mississippi , unless within three months ; and in New Jersey , fifteen days . These few instances , selected at random , are sufficient to show that the evil is by no means an imaginary one , and , what is of still farther moment , it is growing . Each particular state government , proud of its independence , legislates entirely for itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in other states . And so far from having uniformity in view , we have even heard it gravely argued by a member of one of the state legislatures , that it was no reason why they should make a law because Nexv York had ; ' and this wise remark went far , we suppose , to convince the Solomons in legislation , that variety in law-making was a proof of independence . In many points , we acknowledge , that to attempt arriving at absolute uniformity , would be to attempt an impossibility . Such , for instance , is the law of tenure . The peculiar manner in which many of the states were originally settled , would entirely preclude this . But even here , many slight alterations tending to the promotion of uniformity might easily be adopted . And in every instance , such as the above respecting the recording of deeds , where the diversities are purely arbitrary , great benefit might result from alterations in favor of general similarity . It would be well for us , if the members of our // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers to find new subjects of legislation , would think a little more seriously of this matter . With their best endeavors , success will be but partial . The several state judicatories , a little jealous perhaps of their independence , although they admit the decisions of other courts to be cited , as they would the Pandects , simply as the opinion of wise men , yet being bound to follow their own better judgment , decide frequently in flat contradiction to their neighbors . Thus the statute of frauds , so nearly similar in many states , and copied in many from the same great original , has still been subject to numerous constructions differing most materially in very essential points . Another important topic , and one closely connected with this last , is thus alluded to by the learned Justice . The mass of the law is , to be sure , accumulating with an almost incredible rapidity , and with the accumulation the labor of students , as well as professors , is seriously augmented . It is impossible to look without some discouragement upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the groaning shelves of our jurists . The habits of generalization , which will be acquired and perfected by the liberal studies which I have ventured to recommend , will do something to avert the fearful calamity which threatens us , of being buried alive , not in the catacombs , but in the labyrinths of the law . I know indeed but of one adequate remedy , and that is , by a gradual digest , under legislative authority , of those portions of our jurisprudence , which , under the forming hand of the judiciary , shall from time to time acquire scientific accuracy . By thus reducing to a text the exact principles of the law , we shall , in a great measure , get rid of the necessity of appealing to volumes which contain jarring and discordant opinions ; and thus we may pave the way to a general code , which will present in its positive and authoritative text , the most marerial rules to guide the lawyer , the statesman , and the private citizen . It is obvious , that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been applied to human concerns in past times ; but by revision , at distant periods , it may be made to reflect all the light which intermediate decisions may have thrown upon our jurisprudence . To attempt more than this would be a hopeless labor , if not an absurd project . We ought not to permit ourselves to indulge in the theoretical extravagances of some well meaning philosophical jurists , who believe that all human concerns for the future can be provided for in a code speaking a definite language . Sufficient for us will be the achievement to reduce the past to order and certainty ; and that this is within our reach can not be matter of doubtful speculation . ' p. 31. // Thus it appears , that the learned Justice , in accordance with many others , believes that much of this increasing evil can be remedied by comprehensive digests of the law , as already setted and decided ; and he cites , with his characteristic enthusiam , the beneficial result of the Di est of Justinian and the Code Napoldon . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much service to mankind , there can be no doubt ; but we should hesitate to say , that they had fully attained the expected end . No sooner were they published , than they became the subjects of litigation . Various constructions and differing interpretations were attempted to be put upon them ; commentaries were written upon disputed passages ; the old original laws and opinions , from which these digests had been compiled , were dragged forth to elucidate the meaning of the digested text ; and the evils of dispute , necessary research , and accumulated volumes were but little , if at all , diminished . How is such an evil ( for it is confessedly an evil ) to he remedied ? Within the last twenty-five years there have been published , * ) robably in the United States alone , upwards of two hundred volumes of Reporis ; besides treatises upon individual portions of the law , Dane 's voluminous and rather ill arranged Digest , and Chancellor Kent 's valuable elementary treatise upon the whole body of American law . Could it not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reports , perhaps to the opinions themselves ? When a case is now argued , we do not have an Opinion upon the points of law arising from the circumstances of the case , but a treatise upon the branch of law under which the case happens to fall , crowded with dicta , which sometimes the very judge who ( lelivera them would subsequently , upon further consideration , he very unwilling to support . All that is necessary to form a perfect report could frequently be comprised in about one half of the spoce usually occupied at the present day . Sir James Burrow was perhaps as fine a model for a reporter , as Lord Mansfield was for a judge . In Burrow 's Repm'ts , the facts upon which the point of law arose , were briefly stated , the positions taken by the counsel , and then the clear , brief , and satisfactory opinion of the court . Seldom has the complaint of being unsatisfactory been made against these Reports ; seldom have these opinions been overruled , or even the few dicta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have ventured thus much upon a subject of somewhat a delicate nature , being impressed with the belief , that now is the time to attempt a remedy of these evils . The period when antiquity was the refuge-shrine for every barbarous custom or hoary-headed abuse , is coining rapidly to a close . The word reform , once the watchword of sedition and anarchy , is now returning to its legitimate meaning , and breathes a spirit of improvement , not of mere innovation . It comes now , not from the lips of demagogues and factious tribunes , but from lovers of order and disinterested statesmen ; not from a Catalina studiosus rerurn novarum , but from the patriot anxious to meliorate the condition of his countrymen . Let it not be imagined , that we fail in respect to the venerable institutions of that country , which has been the mother of our free principles , the model of many of our free institutions . Few of the efforts of modern statesmen and assembled legislators have effected so much , as was achieved by many single acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the courts under Edward the First , and the trial by jury , are each and all of them fair columns erected by antiquity to support the mighty fabric of the British constitution . But we are not bound , through our respect for these institutions , to reverence their worse than useless appendages ; and thus , while we esteem the trial by jury as the bulwark of our liberties , we see no reason to perpetuate the trial by battel for its kindred 's sake . It is not , therefore , so much that we are desirous of change , for the sake of experiment , as it is that we are desirous of seeing the primitive simplicity of many things restored . We wish to see institutions , courts , laws , and customs , which time and the progress of society have rendered useless , made again beneficial . Ruins are indeed venerable for their antiquity , but if we are to dwell in them , we can hardly be blamed , if we repair the dilapidated roof . In this wide field of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirit of reform , now so general among the well informed and learned of England , as xveli as of the United States . Since writing the foregoing remarks , the second and third numbers of this work have issued from the press . We rejoice in their appearance , not merely on account of the intrinsic merit of the work , and the many useful essays and notices which it contains , but as an earnest of the zeal and determination of its conductors , and as an indication of that de // gree of patronage which is likely to insure its continuance . It is quite impossible , in this brief notice , to point out particularly , or even to enumerate the contents of these additional numbers . It is sufficient to say , in the aggregate , that they afford additional evidence of the liberal and truly national spirit , in which this work is to he conducted . This is as it should be . A periodical work , like the one under consideration , prosecuted upon any other principles , must soon come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country on earth , in which a well conducted periodical journal , devoted to jurisprudence and legislation , is more likely to he at once popular and useful . The United States may be considered now , as in the forming period of their character , in regard to the all important subject of their laws . The courts of justice and the halls of legislation are alike open to any and every change which can be satisfactorily shown to be an improvement . But judges and legislators have not now to learn , that mere change is not improvement ; and speculation and projects of reform , however specious , will receive slight encouragement from either , unless sanctioned by reason and experience , and supported by the powerful aid of enlightened public opinion . To reconcile the conflicting views , and direct to a common point the labors and experience of various minds , widely spread over an extensive country , and to bring them to any thing like a union of thought and of action , nothing can be better adapted than a well established journal , sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profound and ingenious speculations of the student , and the more mature deliberations of the cautious and experienced civilian , and at the same time sufficiently various and diffusive in its topics to excite the interest and command the attention of every part of the Union . These hopes and this character , we confidently anticipate , the American Jurist will realize and sustain , if it shall continue to he conducted with the learning , judgment , and ability , which it has thus far displayed . We think it well suited to diffuse useful information , to excite the favorable interest and regard of these states to the subjects to which it is devoted ; and we therefore earnestly hope , that it will be extensively read , as well as cordially welcomed , by all the friends of American Ju .. risprudence.
