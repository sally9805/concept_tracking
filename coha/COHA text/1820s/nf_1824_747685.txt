txt /q/pened , is it not the triumph of European culture in other than the countries of Europe ? From whence proceeds this superiority , this universal sovereignty of so small a region as Europe ? Here /z/ an important truth presents itself at once . Not undisciplined strength , not the mere physical force of the collective body , it was intelligence which produced it ; and if the skill of the Europeans in the art of war laid the foundations of their sovereignty , it was their superior political science , which maintained it for them . But the question which employs us , remains still unanswered : for we desire to know the causes of this intellectual superiority of the Europeans ; and why the faculties of human nature were unfolded among them so much more extensively , and so much more beautifully ? To such a question no perfectly satisfactory answer can be given . The phenomenon is in itself much too rich , much too great for that . It will be readily conceded , that it could only be the consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately enumerated ; and therefore may afford some explanation of it . But to enumerate them all , to show this influence singly and when united , this ' could only be done by a master spirit , to whom it should be granted , from a higher point of view than any to which a mortal can attain , to contemplate the whole web of the history of our race , the course and the tangles of the various threads . And here one important circumstance excites attention ; and yet a circumstance , of which the cautious inquirer hardly ventures to fix the value . Whilst we see the surface of the other continents covered with nations of different , and almost always of dark colour , ( and , in so far as this determines the race , of different races ) ; the inhabitants of Europe belong only to one race . It has not now , and it never had , any other native inhabitants /q/ than the white nations. * Is the white man distinguished by greater natural talents ? Has he by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , which physiology can not answer , and to which history must reply with timidity . Who will directly deny , that the difference of organization , which we so variously observe to attend on the difference in colour , can have an influence on the more rapid or more tardy unfolding of the mind ? But who can , on the other hand , demonstrate this influence , without first raising that secret veil , which conceals from us the reciprocal connexion between body and mind ? And yet we must esteem it probable ; and how much does this probability increase in strength , if we make inquiries of history ? The great superiority , which the white nations in all ages and countries have possessed , is a matter of fact , which can not be denied . It may be said , this was the consequence of external circumstances , which favoured them more . But has this always been so ? And why has it been so ? And further , why did those darker nations , which rose above the savage state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a degree , which was passed neither by the Egyptian nor by the Mongolian , neither by the Chinese nor the Hindoo ? And among them , why did the black remain behind the brown and the yellow ? If these observations can not but make us inclined to attribute a greater or smaller capacity to the several branches of our race , they do not on that account prove an absolute want of capacity in our darker fellow-ihen , nor must they be /z/ urged as the sole cause . Thus much only is intended , that experience thus far seems to prove , that a greater facility for developing the powers of mind belongs to the nations of a clear colour ; but we will welcome the age , which shall contradict experience in this point , and which shall exhibit to us cultivated nations of negroes . But however high or low this natural precedency of the Europeans may be estimated , no one can fail of observing , that the physical qualities of this continent offer peculiar advantages , which may serve not a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern , temperate zone . Its most important lands lie between the fortieth and sixtieth degree of north latitude . Farther to the north nature gradually dies . Thus our continent has in no part the luxuriant fruitfulness of tropic regions ; but also no such ungrateful climate , as to make the care for the mere preservation of life swallow up the whole strength of its inhabitants . Europe , except where local causes put obstacles in the way , is throughout susceptible of agriculture . It invites men to till it , or rather it in some measure compels them ; for it is as little adapted to the chase as to pasturing . Although its inhabitants have at various periods changed their places of abode , they were never wandering tribes . They emigrated to conquer ; to make other establishments where booty or superior fertility attracted them . No European nation ever lived in tents ; the well wooded plains offered in abundance the materials for constructing those huts , which the inclement skies required . Its soil and climate were peculiarly fitted to accustom men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all pros , perity . If Europe could boast of but few distinguished productions ; perhaps of no one which was exclusively its own ; and if it was necessary to transplant its choicest products from distant regions , this produced again the necessity of cherishing or nursing them . Thus art became united to nature , and this union is the mother of the gradual improvement of our race . Without exertion the circle of human ideas can never be enlarged ; but at the same time the mere preservation of man must not lay claim to the exercise of all his faculties . A degree of fruitfulness , sufficient to reward the pains of culture , is spread almost equally over Europe ; there are no vast tracts of perfect barrenness ; no deserts like those of Arabia and Africa ; and the extensive level lands , which are besides richly supplied with water , begin only in the eastern districts . Mountains of a moderate elevation usually interrupt the plains ; in every direction there is an agreeable interchange of hill and valley ; and if nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her awakening in spring compensates for this by charms which do not belong to the splendid uniformity of tropic climes . It is true , that a similar climate is shared by a large portion of middle Asia ; and it may be asked , why , instead of the same , opposite appearances should be there exhibited , where the shepherd nations of Tartary and Mongolia seem to have made no advancement , so long as they remained in their own countries without stationary settlements ? But by the character of its soil , by the succession of mountains and valleys , the number of its navigable rivers , and above /z/ all , by its coasts on the Mediterranean , Europe distinguishes itself from those regions in so remarkable a manner , that this similar temperature of the air , ( which is moreover not perfectly equal under equal degrees of latitude , since Asia is colder , ) can afford no foundation for a comparison . But can we derive from this physical difference , those moral advantages , which were produced by the better regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the first culture of our continent ; tradition has not forgotten to inform us , that Cecrops , when he founded his colony among the savage inhabitants of Attica , instituted at the same time regular marriages ; and who has not learned of Tacitus the holy custom of our German ancestors ? Is it merely the character of the climate , which causes both sexes to ripen more gradually , and at the same time more nearly simultaneously , and a cooler blood to flow in the veins of man ; or is a more delicate sentiment impressed upon the European , a higher moral nobility , which determines the relation of the two sexes ? Be this as it may , who does not perceive the decisive importance of the fact ? Does not the wall of division which separates the inhabitants of the East from those of the West , repose chiefly on this basis ? And can it be doubted , that this better domestic institution was essential to the progress of our political institutions ? For we make with confidence the remark ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and well ordered constitution . Whether these causes alone , or whether others beside them ( for who will deny that there may have been /q/ others ? ) procured for the Europeans their superiority ; thus much is certain , that all Europe may now boast of this superiority . If the nations of the South preceded those of the North ; if these were still wandering in their forests when those had already obtained their ripeness , they finally made up for their dilatoriness . Their time also came ; the time when they could look down on their southern brethren with a just consciousness of superiority . This leads us to the important differences , which are peculiar to the North and the South of this continent . A chain of mountains , which , though many arms extend to the North and South , runs in its chief direction from West to East , the chain of the Alps , connected in the west with the Pyrenees by the mountains of Sevennes , extending to the Carpathian and the Balkan towards the east as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two very unequal parts , the Southern and the Northern . It separates the three peninsulas which run to the south , those of the Pyrenees , Italy ? and Greece , together with the southern coast of France and Germany , from the great content of Europe , which extends to the north beyond the polar circle . This last , which is by far the larger half , contains almost all the chief streams of this continent ; the Ebro , the Rhone , and the Po , are alone important for navigation , of all that empty themselves into the Mediterranean sea . No other chain of mountains of our earth has had such an influence on the history of our race , as the chain of the Alps . During a long succession of ages , it parted , as it were , two worlds from each other ; the fairest buds of civilization had already opened under the /z/ Grecian and Hesperian skies , whilst scattered tribes of barbarians were yet wandering in the forests of the North . How different would have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps , instead of being near the Mediterranean , been removed to the shores of the North sea ? This boundary , it is true , seems of less moment in our time ; when the enterprising spirit of the European has built a road across the Alps , just as it has found a path over the ocean ; but it was of decisive importance for the age of which we are speaking , for antiquity . * The North and South were then physically , morally , and politically divided ; that chain long remained the protecting bulwark of the one against the other ; and if Caesar , finally breaking over these boundaries , removed in some measure the political landmarks , the distinction still continues apparent between the Roman part of Europe , and that which never yielded to the Romans . It is therefore only the southern part of our hemisphere , which can employ us in our present inquiries . Its limited extent , which seemed to afford no room for powerful nations , was amply compensated by its climate and situation . What traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps without being excited by the view of the novel scenery that surrounded him ? The more beautiful blue of the Italian and Grecian sky , the milder air , the more graceful forms of the mountains , the pomp of the rocky shores and the islands , the dark tints of the forests glittering with golden fruits do these exist merely in the songs of the poets ? Although the tropic climes are still distant , a foretaste of them /q/ is enjoyed even here . The aloe grows wild in Lower Italy ; the sugar-cane thrives in Sicily ; from the top of jEtna , the eye can discern the rocks of Malta , where the fruit of the palm-tree ripens , and in the azure distance , even the coasts of neighbouring Africa. * Here nature never partakes of the uniformity , which so long repressed the spirit of the natives that inhabited the forests and plains of the North . In all these countries there is a constant interchange of moderately elevated mountains with pleasant valleys and level lands , over which Pomona has scattered her choicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large navigable rivers ; but what an indemnification for this is found in its seacoasts , so extensive , and so rich in bays . The Mediterranean sea belongs to the South of Europe ; and it was by means of that sea , that the nations of the West first assumed the rank , which they did . Let an extensive heath occupy its place , and like the nomades of middle Asia , we should yet be wandering Tartars and Mongolians . Of the nations of the South , only three can engage our attention ; the Greeks , Macedonians , and Romans , the masters of Italy and then of the world . We have named them in the order in which history presents them to us as distinguished nations , although distinguished in different ways . We shall follow the same order in treating of them . /z/ WERE any one , who is entirely unacquainted with the history of the Greeks , to examine the map with attention , he could hardly remain in doubt that their country , in point of situation , is favoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most southern of that continent . The promontory of Taenarium , iu which it terminates , lies under almost the same degree of latitude with the celebrated rock of Calpe ; and its northern boundary falls somewhat to the south of Madrid . In this manner it extends from that promontory to Olympus and the Cambuniah mountains , which divide it from Macedonia , about two hundred and twenty-five miles from south to north. * Its eastern point is the promontory of Sunium in Attica ; from thence its greatest breadth , to the promontory of Leucas in the west , is about one hundred and sixty miles . The greatness of the nation and the variety of its achievements easily lead to the error of believing the country an extensive one . But even if we add all the islands , its square contents are a third less than /z/ those of Portugal . But what advantages of situatioa does it not possess over the Iberian peninsula . If this , according to the ideas of the ancients , was the western extremity of the world , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the centre of the most cultivated countries of three continents . A short passage by sea divided it from Italy ; and the voyage to Egypt , Asia Minor , and Phoenicia , though somewhat longer , seemed hardly more dangerous . Nature herself , in this land of such moderate extent , established the geographical divisions , by separating the peninsula of the Peloponnesus from the main land ; and by dividing the latter into nearly equal parts , northern and southern , by the chain of ( Eta , which traverses it obliquely . In every direction hills are interchanged with valleys and fruitful plains ; and if in its narrow compass no large rivers are found ( the Peneus and Achelous are the only considerable ones ) , its extensive coasts , abundantly provided with bays , landing-places , and natural harbours , afford more than an equivalent . The peninsula of Pelops , so called in honour of Pelops , who , according to the tradition , introduced , not war , but the gifts of peace from Ar , in Minor , is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district . It consists in its centre of a high ridge of hills , which sends out several branches , and some as far as the sea ; but between these branches there are fruitful plains well watered by an abundance of streams , which pour from the mountains in every direction . This high inland district , which no where borders on the sea , is the far-famed Arcadia of poetical tradition . Its highest peak , the mountain Cyllene , /q/ rises , according to Strabo , from fifteen to twenty stadia above the sea. * Nature has destined this country for herdsmen . " The pastures and meadows in summer are always green and unscorched ; for the shade and moisture preserve them . The country has an appearance similar to that of Switzerland , and the Arcadians in some measure resemble the inhabitants of the Alps . They possessed a love of freedom and a love of money ; for wherever there was money , you might see Arcadian hirelings . But it is chiefly the western part of Arcadia ( where Pan invented the shepherd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Innumerable brooks , one more delightful than the other , sometimes rushing impetuously and sometimes gently murmuring , pour themselves down the mountains . Vegetation is rich and magnificent ; every where freshness and coolness are found . One flock of sheep here succeeds another , till the banks of the wild Taygetus are approached ; where numerous herds of goats are seen also . " f The inhabitants of Arcadia , devoted to the pastoral life , preferred therefore for a long time to dwell in the open country rather than in cities ; and when some of these , particularly Tegea and Mantinea , became considerable , the contests between them destroyed the peace and liberties of the people . The shepherd life among the Greeks , although much ornamented by the poets , betrays its origin in this ; that it arose among a people , who did not wander like the Nomades , but were in possession of stationary dwellings . * Strabo , 1 . viii . p. 267. ed . Casaub . The indefinite nature of the account shows how uncertain it is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 239-241. /z/ Round Arcadia seven districts were situated , almost all of which were well watered by streams , that descended from its highlands . In the south lay the land of heroes , Laconia , rough and mountainous , but thickly settled ; so that it is said to have contained nearly a hundred towns or villages. * It was watered by the Eurotas , the clearest and purest of all the Grecian rivers , f which had its rise in Arcadia , and was increased by several smaller streams . Sparta was built upon its banks , the mistress of the country ? without walls , without gates ; defended only by its citizens . It was one of the larger cities of Greece ; but , notwithstanding the market-place , the theatre , and the various temples which Pausanias enumerates , J it was not one of the most splendid . The monuments of fallen heroes constituted the principal ornament of the banks of the Eurotas , which were then and still are covered with the laurel . But all these monuments have perished ; there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated . It was formerly thought to be the modern Misitra ; this opinion has been given up ; a more recent traveller believes , that about six miles from thence he has discovered , in the ruins of Mogula , the traces of the ancient theatre and some of the temples . At the distance of four miles lay Amyclae , celebrated for the oracle of Apollo , * Manso has enumerated siity-seven : Sparta , i. 2. p. 15. t Bartboldy . BruchstQcke , fcc. p. 228 . J Pausan . Hi . p. 240. ed . Kuhn . See the long list of them in Pausanias , p. 240 , 243 , kc . Pouqueville . Voyage i. p. 189. f See Chateaubriand . Itineraire de Paris a Jerusalem , i. p. 26 . This traveller was but one hour in going from Misitra to Mogula , by way of Palaiochoros , but it was done on horseback and in a gallop . Those discoveries belong to M. Chateaubriand ; he remarks , however , that others before him had supposed Palaiochoros to be the site of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now visible ; and a road ' of twelve miles led from Sparta to Gythium , its harbour in that period of its history , where , mistaking its true policy , it built a fleet . On the west and north , Laconia was surrounded by the Taygetus , which separated it from the fruitful plains of Messenia . This country was soon overpowered by Sparta , * which , having thus doubled its territory , easily became the largest of all the Grecian cities . But though it remained for a long time in the quiet possession of Messenia , the day of retribution came , when Epaminondas , its restorer , crushed the power of humbled Sparta . A neck of land , called Argolis , from its capital city Argos , extends in a southerly direction from Arcadia fifty-four miles into the sea , where it terminates in the promontory of Scillaeum . Many and important associations of the heroic age are connected with this country . Here was Tiryns , from whence Hercules departed at the commencement of his labours ; here was Mycenae , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings ; here vds Nemea , celebrated for its games instituted in honour of Neptune . But the glory of its early history does not seem to have animated Argos . No Themistocles , no Agesilaus was ever counted among its citizens ; and , though it possessed a territory of no inconsiderable extent , it never assumed a rank among the first of the Grecian states , but was rather the passive object of foreign policy . In the west of the Peloponnesus lay Elis , the holy land . Its length from south to north , if the small /z/ southern district of Triphylia be reckoned , amounted to fifty-four miles ; its breadth in the broadest part was not more than half as much . Several rivers , which had their rise in the Arcadian mountains , watered its fruitful plains . Among them the Alpheus was the largest and the most famous ; the Olympic games were celebrated on its banks . Its fountains were not far distant from those of the Eurotas ; and as the latter , taking a southerly direction , flowed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one passed through the land of peace . For here , in the country sacred to Jove , where the nation of the Hellenes assembled in festive pomp and saluted each other as one people , no bloody feuds were suffered to profane the soil . Armies were indeed permitted to pass through the consecrated land ; but they were first deprived of their arms , which they did not again receive till they left it. * This is the glory of the Greeks , that they honoured the nobler feelings of humanity , where other nations were unmindful of them . They flourished so long as they possessed self-government enough to do this ; they fell when sacred things ceased to be sacred . The country of Elis embraced three divisions . The woody Triphylia was in the south , and contained that Pylus , which , according to the judgment of Strabo , could lay a better claim than either of the other two towns of the same name , to have been the country of Nestor , f The northern division was Elis , a plain enclosed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 247. /q/ both , branches of the Arcadian Erymanthus , and watered by the Selleis and the Elian Peneus , on the banks of which the city was built that gave a name to the whole region , over which it also exercised supreme authority ; for the district of the Elians , embracing both Pisatis and Triphylia , extended to the borders of Messenia. * The middle territory , Pisatis , so called from the city Pisa , was the most important of all , for it contained Olympia . Two roads from Elis led thither , one near the sea through the plain , another through the mountains ; the distance was from thirty to thirty-five miles . f The name Olympia designated the country round the city Pisaf ( which even in Strabo 's time was no longer in existence ) , where every five years those games were celebrated , which the Elians established after the subjugation of the Pisans , and at which they presided . If this privilege gave to them , as it were , all their importance in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre ; if it was the first in Greece with respect to works of art and perhaps to wealth ; if their safety , their prosperity , their fame , and in some measure their existence as an independent state , were connected with the temple of Jupiter Olympius and its festivals ; need we be astonished , if no sacrifice seemed to them too great , by which the glory of Olympia was to be increased ? Here on the banks of the Alpheus stood the sacred grove , called Altis , of olive and plane trees , surrounded * Strabo , viii . p. 247 , relates the manner in which it came to be extended thus far by the assistance of the Spartans in the Messenian war . t According to Strabo , 1 . c. 300 stadia . t Barthelemy is not strictly accurate , when he calls ( iv . p. 207 ) Pisa and Olympia one city . Pisa was but six stadia ( not quite a mile ) from the temple ; Schol . Find , ad 01. x. 55 . I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an enclosure ; a sanctuary of the arts , such as the world has never since beheld . For what are all our cabinets and museums , compared with this one spot ? Its centre was occupied by the national temple of the Hellenes , the temple of Olympian Jove , * in which was the colossal statue of that god , the masterpiece of Phidias . No other work of art in antiquity was so generally acknowledged to have been the first , even whilst all other inventions of Grecian genius were still uninjured ; and need we hesitate to regard it as the first of all the works of art , of which we have any knowledge ? Besides this temple , the grove contained those of Juno and Lucina , the theatre and the prytaneum ; in front of it , or perhaps within its precints , f was the stadium together with the race-ground , or hippodromus . The whole forest was filled with monuments and statues , erected in honour of gods , heroes , and conquerors . Pausanias mentions more than two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ! and these were , for the most part , works of the first artists ; for how could any * The temple of Jupiter Olympius , built by the Elians in the age of Pericles , had nearly the same dimensions as the Parthenon at Athens ; 230 feet in length , 95 in breadth , and 68 in height . The colossal statue of Jupiter , represented as seated , nearly touched the roof of the temple , as Strabo relates ; and is said to have been 60 feet high . Compare : Volkel Uber den grossen Tempel und die Statue des Jupiters in Olympia , 1794. t According to Strabo , in the Altis : Barth61emy says , in front of it . We are still much in the dark respecting the situation of ancient Olympia . What Chandler says is unimportant . The only modern traveller , who has made accurate investigations , is M. Fauvel . But I am unacquainted with his communication to the National Institute , Precis de ses voyages dans It continent de la Grece , only from the short notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found , it is there said , not only the remains of the temple of Jupiter , by also of the Hippodromus. /q/ poor production gain admittance , where even indifferent ones were despised ? Pliny estimates the whole number of these statues in his time , at three thousand. * To this must be added the treasuries ( 3- ? ray0/ ) , which the piety or the vanity of so many cities , enumerated by Pausaniasf , had established by their votive presents . It was with a just pride , that the Grecian departed from Olympia . He could say to himself with truth , that he had seen the noblest objects on earth , and that these were not the works of foreigners , but the creation and the property of his own nation . The repose , for which Elis was indebted to the protection of the gods , was secured to Achaia , the country which bounded it on the north , by the wisdom of men . Having once been inhabited by lonians , this maritime country had borne the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on the west side of Greece . But in the confusion produced by the general emigration of the Dorians , it exchanged its ancient inhabitants for Achaeans. * Achaia , watered by a multitude of mountain streams , which descended from the high ridges of Arcadia , belonged , with respect to its extent , fruitfulness , and population , to the middling countries of Greece . The character of its inhabitants corresponded with this . They never aspired after aggrandizement , or influence abroad . They were not made illustrious by great generals or great poets . But * Pliny , Hist . Nat . xxxiv. 17 . There were as many at Athens , Delphi , and Rhodes . /z/ they possessed good laws . Twelve cities , * each with a small territory , independent of each other in the management of their internal affairs , formed a confederacy , which , under the name of the Achaean league , could trace its origin to remote antiquity . A perfect equality was its fundamental principle ; no precedence of rank or power was to he usurped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Greece , if they had been able or willing to understand it ! In this manner the Achseans continued for a long time in the enjoyment of happy tranquillity , having no share in the wars of their neighbours . Their country was in no one 's way , and attracted no one ; even during the Peloponnesian war , they remained neutral . The Macedonian supremacy finally dissolved the confederacy , and favoured individual tyrants , of whom it made use as its instruments . But the time was destined to arrive , when Nemesis should exert her power . The Achaean league was renewed , and enlarged , and it became most dangerous to the Macedonian rulers . The small territory of the city Sicyon , ( which afterwards belonged to the Achaean league ) divided Achaia from that of Corinth . In point of extent , this state was one of the smallest in Greece ; but the importance of a commercial sti.te does not depend on the extent of its territory . Venice was never more flourishing or more powerful , than at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . Wealthy Corinth , more than four miles in extent , lay at the foot of a steep and elevated hill , on which *Dyme and Patraj were the most important ; Hclice was swallowed up by the sea . /q/ its citadel was built . There was hardly a stronger fortress in all Greece , and perhaps no spot afforded a more splendid prospect than Acrocorinthus. * Beneath it might be seen the busy city and its territory , with its temples , its theatres , and its aqueducts.f Its two harbours , Lechseum on the western bay , Cenchrese on the eastern , filled with ships , and the two bays themselves with the isthmus between them , were all in sight . The peaks of Helicon and of Parnassus itself , were seen at a distance ; and a strong eye could distinguish on the eastern side the Acropolis of Athens . What images and emotions are excited by this prospect ! At present barbarians possess it , who do not even allow it to be enjoyed . No foreigner is now permitted to ascend the citadel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Grecians , acquainted for a long time with no other , were accustomed to call simply the Isthmus , lay the tract of Hellas . The southern half of the same , stretching as far as the chain of ( Eta , was divided into eight , or , if Locris , of which there were two parts , be twice counted , into nine districts ; of these , the extent was but small , as their number indicates . Near the isthmus , on which the temple of Neptune , where all Greece assembled to celebrate the Isthmian games , was built in a grove of fir-trees , the small territory of MegaraJ took its beginning ; and through this , along * See Strabo , p. 261 . Of modern travellers , Spon and Wheler ascended it in 16Y6 . Chateaubriand , i. 36. says , that the prospect at the foot of the citadel is enchanting . If it is so now , what must it formerly have been ? t Corinth is famous even with the poets , for being well supplied with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerates , 1 . ii . its many temples and aqueducts. tLike that of Corinth , not more than eight miles in length and breadth . /z/ the high rocky shore , where the robber Sciron is said to have exercised his profession , the road conducted to the favourite land of the gods , to Attica . A neck of land or peninsula , opposite to that of Argolis , extends in a southeasterly direction about sixty three miles into the Egean sea , and forms this country . Where it is connected with the main land , its greatest breadth may be twenty-five miles ; but it tapers more and more to a point , till it ends in the high cape of Sunium , on the summit of which the temple of Minerva announced to the traveller , as he arrived from sea , the land which was protected by the goddess of courage and wisdom . It was not endowed with luxuriant fruitfulness ; it never produced so much corn as would supply its own inhabitants ; and for this , neither the honey of Hymettus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver mines of Laurium , could have afforded a compensation . But the culture of the olive , an industrious application to the arts , and the advantageous use made of the situation of the country for the purposes of commerce , gave to the frugal people all that they needed and something more ; for the activity of commerce was shackled by no restrictive laws . Almost the whole country is mountainous ; the mountains are indeed of a moderate height , and covered with aromatic plants ; but they are stony and without forests . Their outlines are , however , wonderfully beautiful ; the waters of the Ilissus , the Cephissus , and of other rivers , or , to speak more accurately , of other brooks , which stream from them , are clear as crystal , and dilicious to the taste ; and the almost constant purity of the air , which lends /q/ very peculiar tints to the buildings , no less than to the mountains , * opens a prospect , which distance can hardly bound . " For without doubt ( says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purest , and the mildest climate of Greece ; as Euripides$ has said , ' Our air is soft and mild ; the frost of winter is never severe , nor the beams of Phoebus oppressive ; so that for us there are no attractions in the choicest delights which are offered by the fields of Asia , or the wealth of Hellas . ' " But where the mountains open , and leave room for plains of a moderate extent , the soil is still covered by forests of olive-trees , of which the eye can perceive no termination . " More beautiful are nowhere to be seen . Those of Palermo or on the Rivera of Genoa are hardly to be compared with these , which seem as it were undying , and century after century send forth new branches and new shoots with renovated vigour . " Formerly they overshadowed the sacred road , the country of the Ceramicus , and the garden of the Academy ; and if the Goddess herself , like her scholars , has deserted the soil , she has at least left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she made to her darling nation . Whoever travelled from Corinth and Megara across the isthmus to Attica , reached the sacred city of Eleusis at the distance of about nine miles from Megara . When the inhabitants of that place submitted to Athens , they reserved for themselves nothing * See the remarks of Chateaubriand on this subject . 7/mratre It Jerutalem , i. p. 191. /z/ but their sanctuaries ; * and hence the mysterious festivals of Ceres continued to be celebrated in their temple . From this place , the sacred road of almost unvarying breadth , led to the city protected by Pallas " . Athens lay in a plain , which on the southwest extended for about four miles towards the sea and the harbours , but on the other side was enclosed by mountains . The plain itself was interrupted by several rocky hills . The largest and highest of these supported the Citadel or Acropolis , which took its name from its founder Cecrops ; round this , the city was spread out , especially in the direction of the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eight hundred feet long , and half as broad ; which seemed , as it were , prepared by nature to support those masterpieces of architecture , which announced at a great distance the splendour of Athens . The only road which led to it , conducted to the Propylaea , f with its two wings , the temple of Victory , and another temple , ornamented with the pictures of Polygnotus . That superb edifice , the most splendid monument which was erected under the administration of Pericles , the work of Mnesicles , was decorated by the admirable sculptures of Phidias.J They formed the proud entrance to the level summit of the hill , on which were the temples of the guardian deities of Athens .

But on the right , the Parthenon , the pride of Athens , rose above every thing else , possessing the colossal statue of Minerva by Phidias , next to the Olympian Jupiter , the noblest of his works . At the foot of the hill on the one side was the Odeum , and the theatre of Bacchus , where the tragic contests were celebrated on the festivals of the god , and those immortal masterpieces were represented , which , having remained to us , double our regret for those which are lost ; on the other side was the Prytaneum , where the chief magistrates and most meritorious citizens were honoured by a table , provided at the public expense . A moderate valley , Crele , was interposed between the Acropolis and the hill on which the Areopagus held its assemblies , and again between this and the hill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on the affairs of the republic . Here the spot from which Pericles and Demosthenes harangued , is still distinct ( it is imperishable , since it is hewn in the rock ) ; not long ago it was cleared from rubbish , together with the four steps which led to it. * If any desire a more copious enumeration of the temples , the halls , and the works of art , which decorated the city of Pallas , they may find it in Pausanias . Even in his time , how much , if not the larger part , yet the best , had been removed ; how much had been injured and destroyed in the ' wars ; and yet when we read what was still there , we naturally ask with respect to Athens ( as with res- /z/ pect to so many other Grecian cities ) , where could all this have found room ? The whole country round Athens , particularly the long road to the Piraeeus , was ornamented with monuments of all kinds , especially with the tombs of great poets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after death without expressions of public gratitude , which were given so much the less frequently during their lives . A double wall , called the Northern and Southern , enclosed the road , which was nearly five miles long , on both sides , and embraced the two harbours of Piraeeus and Phalereus . This wall , designed and executed by Themistocles , was one of the most important works of the Athenians . It was forty Grecian ells in height , built entirely of freestone , and so broad , that two baggage-wagons could pass each other . The Piraeeus , to which it led , formed ( as did Phalerae ) a city by itself with its own public squares , temples , market-places , and the commercial crowd which enlivened it ; and it seemed perhaps even more animated than Athens. * Its harbour , well provided with docks and magazines , was spacious enough to hold in its three divisions four hundred triremes ; whilst the Phalereus and Munychius could each accommodate only about fifty.f All three were formed naturally by the bays of the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , but also in security .

The prospect from the Acropolis and the Parthenon commanded on the east the two peaks of Hymettus ; on the north , Pentelicus with its quarries of marble ; to the northwest , the Cithseron was seen at a great distance , rising above the smaller mountains ; and Laurium , rich in silver mines , lay to the southeast almost at the end of the peninsula ; but towards the southwest , the eye could freely range over the harbours and the Saronic bay , with the islands of Salamis and Egina , as far as the elevated citadel of Corinth. * Many of the chief places of the cantons ( o ) , into which Attica was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and seventy ) might also be seen ; and the situation was distinct even of the towns , which covered the mountains . No one of these was important as a city , and yet there were few , which had not something worthy of observation , their statues , altars , and temples ; for to whatever part of his country the Athenian strayed , he needed to behold something , which might remind him that he was in Attica . There were many , of which the name alone awakened proud recollections ; and no one was so far from Athens , that more than a day needed to be spent on the road to it . It required but about five hours to reach the long but narrow plainf of Marathon , on the opposite coast of Attica . It was twenty-five miles to Sunium which lay at the southern extremity of the peninsula , and about twenty miles to the boundary of Bceotia. /z/ This country , so frequently enveloped in clouds , jay to the northwest of Attica , and exhibited , in almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the chain of Helicon , Cithaeron , Parnassus , and , towards the sea , Ptoas ; which mountains enclosed a large plain , constituting the chief part of the country . Numerous rivers , of which the Cephissus was the most important , * descending from the heights , had probably stagnated for a long time , and had formed lakes , of which Copais is the largest . This lake must have subterraneous outlets ; for while the canals , through which its waters were anciently distributed , have fallen into decay , it has so far decreased in modern times , that it is now almost dried to a swamp.f But these same rivers appear to have formed the soil of Bceotia , which is among the most fruitful in Greece . Bceotia was also perhaps the most thickly settled part of Greece ; for no other could show an equal number of important cities .

Boeotia was divided by mount Cithaeron from Attica , arid by Parnassus from Phocis . This district , of moderate size and irregular shape , extended to the south along the bay of Corinth ; and was bounded on the north by the chain of ( Eta . Here are those passes which led from Boeotia to Attica . Of these , the most important is near the city Elatea , and on that account was early occupied by Philip on his second invasion of Greece . The desolate mountain of Parnassus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traveller of our times , nothing but recollections . Delphi lay on the south side of it , overshadowed by its double peak ; and not far- above the city was the temple with the oracle of Apollo . Here the masterpieces of art were displayed in countless abundance under the protection of the god ; together with the costly and consecrated offerings of nations , cities , * and kings . Here in the Amphictyonic council , still more costly treasures , the first maxims of the laws of nations were matured for the Greeks . Hither on the festival days , when the great games of the Pythian deity recurred ( games surpassed only by those of Olympia ) , pilgrims and spectators poured in throngs ; here at the Castalian fountain , the songs of the poets resounded in solemn rivalship ; and , more exciting than all , the acclamations of the multitude .

" At Thermopylae , " says Herodotus , J f a steep and inaccessible mountain rises on the west side in the direction of ( Eta ; but on the east side of the road are the sea and marshes .

I Locri , Opuntii , and Epicucunidii. * Herod , vii . 176. /q/ The western part of Locris , on the bay of Corinth , inhabited by the Ozoli , was greater in extent , but possessed fewer remarkable objects . Yet its harbour Naupactus has preserved its importance , while so many of the most celebrated cities have become insignificant . It is now called Lepanto , and is perhaps the only town of which the modern name is more harmonious than the ancient . The western parts of Hellas , rough Etolia , and woody Acarnania , are indeed among the largest districts , but are so inferior to the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than name them . Nature was here neither less sublime nor less munificent ; both were situated on the largest of the Grecian rivers , the Achelous , which flowed between them ; both were inhabited by descendants of the Hellenes ; both were once celebrated for heroes ; and yet the JEtolians and the Acarnanians remained barbarians , after the Athenians had become the instructers of the world . How difficult it is , to comprehend the history of the culture of nations ! The chain of CEta , which farther west receives the name of Othrjs , and at last of Pindus , and , taking a northerly direction , is connected with the mountains of Macedonia , divides the central part of Greece from the northern . Thessaly , the largest of all the Grecian provinces , ( though its extent can not be given with accuracy , for its boundary on the north was never defined , ) forms the eastern , and Epirus the western part of the same . There is hardly any district in Greece , for which nature seems to have done so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , surrounded it on three sides ; while the peaks of Ossa and of /z/ Olympus , rose above them on the east along the coasts of the jEgean sea . Thessaly can with justice be called the land of the Peneus ; which , descending from Pindus , flowed through it from west to east . A multitude of tributary streams poured from the north and the south into this river . The traditions of the ancients related , * that it had stagnated for centuries , when an earthquake divided Olympus and Ossa , f and opened for it a passage to the Egean sea through the delicious vale of Tempe.J Thus the plain of Thessaly arose from the floods , possessed of a soil , which they had long been fertilizing .

The Doric tribe found in Estiaeotis its oldest dwelling-places ; and who has ever heard the name of Phthiotis , without remembering the hero of the Iliad , the great Pelides ? Thessaly was always well inhabited and rich in cities . In the interior , the most celebrated were Larissa , situated in the midst of the noble plain , and Pherse ; lolcos , from whence the Argonauts took their departure , and Magnesia , were on the seacoast . But it was perhaps the very fertility of the soil , which ruined the Thessalians . They rioted in sensual enjoyments ; they were celebrated for banquets , and not for works of genius ; and although Olympus , the mountain of the gods , was on the boundary of their land , nothing godlike was ever unfolded with its precints . Is it strange that in the midst of such gross sensuality , the love of self overpowered the love of country ; that neither heroes nor poets were created among them by the inspirations of patriotism ? Anarchy and tyranny commonly followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ripe for foreign subjugation , cowered of itself beneath the yoke of the Persians , and afterwards under that of Philip . On tte opposite side of the Peneus , the pure race and language of the Hellenes were not to be found . Other nations , probably of Illyrian descent , dwelt there ; the Pervhsebi , the Athamanes , and others ; who , as Strabo relates , sometimes claimed to belong to the Thessalians , and sometimes to the Macedonians. * The case was not different in Epirus , which lay to the west . The house of the Eacidse , a Grecian family , /z/ the descendants of Achilles , were indeed the rulers over the Molossi ; and the oracle of the Jupiter of the Hellenes was heard in the sacred grove of Dodona ; but still the larger portion of the inhabitants seems hardly to have been of the Grecian race . The main land of Hellas was surrounded by a coronet of islands , which were gradually occupied by the Hellenes , and came to be considered as parts of their country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were surmounted by rocky hills . We can hardly doubt , that we see in them the remains of an earlier world ; when the waters which covered the middle parts of Asia , and the deserts of northern Africa , retired , leaving behind them the Euxine and the Mediterranean sea as two vast reservoirs . Each of those islands commonly bore the name of the chief town , of which it formed the territory ; with the exception of the three large islands Euboea , Crete , and Cyprus , each of which contained several cities . Almost every one of them possessed its own remarkable objects and its own claims to fame . Fruitful CorcNra* boasted then , as it does now , of its harbour and its ships . Ithaca , small as it is , shares the immortality of Ulysses and Homer .

The Etesian winds blow certainly with more piercing roughness , now that the tops of the mountains are naked ; the brooks stagnate in the desolate plains ; but the change of seasons even now produces varying scenes ; and the traveller , who at one time finds the Archipelago melancholy and waste , a few months later may contemplate a smiling prospect . if In spring , these islands are covered with green turf , with anemones and flowers of all colours . But in the month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is burnt and dried up , and the parched fields produce no herbage again before autumn . " This view of Greece , though it can not claim to be considered a regular description , leads us to several remarks , which may perhaps throw some light on the history of the nation . First : Greece w r as naturally so divided and cut in pieces in a geographical point of view , that it could not have been easy for any . one district to gain the supremacy over the rest . Thessaly could not well control the lands which lay to the south of ( Eta ; and still less could Hellas sway the Peloponnesus , or the Peloponnesus , Hellas . Nature herself * Need we montion the hymns of Callimachus ? tSee Thucydiles , v. 116. /z/ had erected breastworks for those , who desired and who knew how to be free . It was easy to defend Thermopylae , or the Isthmus . We do not here take into consideration the superior power of a foreign conqueror ; but even that could have effected little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own chains . Again : If Greece was excelled by many countries in fertility , it would yet be difficult , and , at least in Europe , impossible to find a land of such limited extent , where nature had done so much to prepare for the various branches of industry . Greece was not merely an agricultural , or a commercial country , or a land fitted for pasturing ; it was all , at once ; but different parts of it had different degrees of aptitude for the one or the other . The fruitful Mtssenia was fit for the growth of corn ; Arcadia for the nurture of cattle . Attica was proud of its oil , and the honey of Hymettus ; Thessaly of its horses . Of mines , there were not many ; still they were not unknown in Laurium and Thasos . The maritime towns were suited for trade and commerce ; and the coasts , indented with bays , and the islands , invited to navigation . This variety of pursuits in active life may have been the cause of an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps laid the foundation for the farther improvement of the nation . Lastly : No other country in Europe was so favourably situated for holding commerce with the oldest cultivated nations of the western world . On the way to Asia Minor and Phoenicia , one island almost touched upon another . It was easy o cross into Italy ; and the coasts of Egypt were not far distant . Even in the times of fable , a path was discovered from the /q/ shores of Thessaly to those of Colchis ; and how much earlier , and with how much greater facility , to those countries , where no rocks , like the Symplegades , opposed the passage of the daring Argo ? /z/ THE nation of the Hellenes , as they called themselves after an ancient leader , ( for they received the name of Greeks from foreigners , ) preserved many a tradition respecting their earliest state , representing them to have been nearly on a level with the savage tribes which now wander in the forests of North America. * From these traditions , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no agriculture , but lived on the spontaneous produce of the woods ; and when even fire could not be appropriated to the service of man , till it had first been stolen from Heaven . Yet , in the meanwhile , they gradually spread over the country , which they afterwards possessed ; and all foreign tribes were either driven from the soil , or were mingled with them . Much is told of the emigration of individual tribes , from the southern districts to the northern , and from these back again into the southern : but the peculiar habits of nomades , as seen in the nations of middle Asia , belonged to the Greeks as little as to the Germanic race . The moderate extent and the hilly character of their country , which afforded no pasture for large flocks , did not admit of that kind of life . As far as we can judge from the very indefinite accounts of this early period , it seems that , especially in " . fischyl . Prom , vinct . v. 442 , etc. /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race of the Hellenes was already so far extended over Hellas , that it was every where predominant . For it appears as such even then , before the Trojan war . The nation of the Pelasgi , which , no less than that of the Hellenes , belonged to the first inhabitants of the country , and which must be considered as having had a different origin , since their language was different , * may at an early period have been the most powerful , but was constantly reduced within narrower limits , and either emigrated to Italy and other countries ; or , where it preserved its residence , as in Arcadia and Attica , was gradually mingled with the Hellenes , of whom the power was constantly increasing , until every vestige of it , as a separate race , was entirely lost . Whilst the Hellenes were thus spreading through Greece , the several chief tribes of them became more and more distinctly marked ; and this division was so lasting and so full of consequences , that the internal history of the nation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important branches , the lonians , Dorians , Eolians , and Achaeans , the two first ( for the Eolians were chiefly mingled with the Dorians ) , f and the Achseans were so eminent , that they deserve to be regarded as the chief component parts of the nation . It is important , in order to become acquainted with the people , to know in what parts of Greece these several tribes had their places of residence . But these places did not remain unchanged ; the event which had the greatest * Herod , i. 57. tEuripides , enumerating in Ion , v. 1581 , etc. the tribes ef the Helleni , makes no mention of the /Eolians. /z/ influence on them for the succeeding time , happened shortly after the termination of the Trojan war . Till then the tribe of the Achseans had been so powerful , that Homer , who , as Thucydides has already observed , * had no general name for the whole nation , commonly distinguishes that tribe from the others ; which he sometimes designates collectively by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the Peloponnesus , with the exception of the very district which afterwards was occupied by it and bore its name , but which was then still called Ionia ; and as the territories of Agamemnon and Menelaus , the most powerful of the Grecian princes , both lay in that peninsula , the first rank was clearly due to the Achseans . But soon after this war , it was the lot of that tribe to be in part subjugated and reduced to the severest bondage , J and in part to be expelled from the lands where it had resided , and confined to a small district , which from that time was called Achaia . This was a consequence of the emigration of the Dorians , under the direction of the descendants of Hercules ; of which emigration the chief object was the conquest of the Peloponnesus ; but it also occasioned a change in the places occupied by the other tribes of the Hellenes . From this time almost the whole of the Peloponnesus was occupied by the Dorians , and the kindred tribe of the jfEtolians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ij xeu ' A#*/M , as Iliad ii . 530 . The Hellenes of Homer are particularly the inhabitants of Thessaly ; but the expression Panhellenes proves that even then the name had begun to receive a general application . /q/ the district of Achaia alone became the property of the Achseans , who , being in quest of refuge , drove from it the lonians . But besides this , a large part of the rest of - Hellas was occupied by tribes , which , though not expressly called Dorians , betrayed by their dialects their Doric origin ; Boeotians , Locrians , Thessalians , and even the Macedonian Hellenes belonged to this class ; and although the inhabitants of the western maritime tracts and islands were at first called Eolians , their dialects were so similar , that they soon ceased to be distinguished from the Dorians . This powerful tribe was also extended towards the east and west by means of its colonies . Several of the islands of the Archipelago were occupied by them ; and they flourished on the coast of Asia Minor , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa at Gyrene . The Ionic branch , as far as we know , kept possession of no part of the main land of Greece , excepting Attica. * But Attica alone outweighed in glory and power all the rest of Greece . Most of the large island of Eubo3a also belonged to the lonians ; many of the small islands of the Archipelago were entirely occupied by them ; and while their colonies in Asia Minor were decidedly superior , their colonies on the coasts of Italy and Sicily were but little inferior to those of other Grecian tribes . From the earliest times , these two tribes were distinguished from each other by striking characteris- *The other lonians and even the Athenians laid aside the name ; and none formally preserved it except those of Asia Minor . Herod , i. 143 . Hence the extent of this tribe can not be accurately given ; and indeed no attempt should be made to trace every little Grecian tribe to its origin , and form a tree of descent for them all . This the Greeks themselves were never able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ tics , which were not removed by the cultivation which was becoming universal . On the Doric tribe , the character of severity is imprinted , which is observable in the full tones of its dialect , in its songs , its dances , the simplicity of its style of living , and in its constitutions . It was most strongly attached to ancient usage . From this its regulations for private and public life took their origin , which were fixed by the prescriptive rules of its lawgivers . It respected the superiority of family and age . The governments of the Doric cities were originally more or less the government of rich and noble families ; and this is one cause of the greater solidity of their political institutions . Good counsel was drawn from the experience of age ; wherever an old man appeared , the young rose from their seats . Religion among the Dorians was less a matter of luxury ; but it was more an object of which they felt the need . What important transaction did they ever begin , without first consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . When once the reverence for ancient usage was overcome , the Dorians knew no bounds ; and Tarentum exceeded all cities in luxury , just as Syracuse did in internal feuds . After this tribe had once emigrated to the Peloponnesus , not only the ereater part of that peninsula , but also of the neighbouring main land of Hellas was occupied by it . The lonians were on the contrary more distinguished for vivacity and a proneness to excitement . Ancient usage restrained them much less than it did the Dorians . They were easily induced to change , if pleasure could be gained by the change . They were bent on enjoyment , and seem to have been equally susceptible /q/ of refined gratifications of the mind and of those of the senses . They lived amidst holidays ; and nothing was pleasant to them without song and dance . Its soft dialect brings to mind the languages of the South sea ; but in both cases the remark is found to be true , that a soft language is by no means a proof of deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hereditary privileges were either rejected at once , or borne with only for a short time . The supreme authority rested with the people , and although it was limited by many institutions , the people still decided the character of the government . Any thing could be expected of these states , rather than domestic tranquillity . Nothing was so great that they did not believe they could attain it ; and for that very reason they were often actually successful . These differences in the natural character of the most important tribes , needed to be mentioned at the beginning . There are few subjects in history , which have been so little illustrated , especially with reference to their consequences , as the characters of nations and their branches . And yet it is these peculiarities , which in a certain degree form the guiding thread in the web of the history of nations . From whatever they may proceed , whether from original descent , or the earliest institutions , or from both , experience teaches , that they are almost indelible . The difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grecian history . This produced the deep-rooted hatred between Sparta and Athens , though t ) iat hatred may have been fed by other causes ; and who needs to be told , that the history of all Greece is connected with the history of those leading states . /z/ The difference of tribes and their dispositions was also one of the chief causes of the subsequent political partitions of the soil . There probably was never a land of similar extent , in which so large a number of states subsisted together . They lived , both the large and the small ones , ( if indeed we may call these large , which were only proportionally so ) , each after its own customs ; and hence Greece was saved from the torpor of large empires , and was able to preserve so much life and activity within itself . Of the earliest history of the nation , we can expect only fragments . We leave it to the historian to collect them and to judge of their value . But we must direct attention to those general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest progress of national culture , if we would form correct opinions with respect to it . Before we can describe the heroic age , we must explain the influence of religion , of early poetry , and of foreign emigrations , and show how they served to introduce that age . /q/ /z/ Religion . IT is not easy to decide , whether the culture of a nation proceeds originally from their sacred or their civil institutions . The character of the domestic relations , the proper application of the means provided for the easier and more regular support of life , agriculture , and husbandry , constitute the first foundation of national culture ; but even these can make but little progress without the assistance of religion . Without the fear of the gods , marriage loses its sanctity , and property its security . The earthly and the divine are so mingled in our natures , that nothing but a continued harmony between them both , can elevate us above the mere animal creation . But it has been wisely ordained by the Author of our being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus the character of our existence ennobled , even before a high degree of knowledge has been attained . It would be difficult , and perhaps impossible , to find a nation , which can show no vestiges of religion ; and there never yet has been , nor can there be a nation , with which the reverence for a superior being was the fruit of refined philosophy . The foundation of all religion , is the belief in higher existences ( however differently these may be represented to the mind ) , which have an influence on /z/ our destinies . The natural consequence of this belief are certain rites of worship ; invocations , sacrifices , and offerings . All this is so connected with the feelings of man , that it springs from within him , and exists independent of all research or knowledge . And this is the religion of the people . But so soon as the intelligent spirit of man was somewhat awakened , a higher principle was separated ( though in very different ways ) from this simple faith ; and that remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the initiated , of the enlightened . If the religion of the people reposed only on belief and indistinct conceptions , certain doctrines , on the contrary , belonged to those higher circles , although they were often represented by images , and exhibited to the senses by outward - ceremonies . These two kinds of religion commonly remained distinct from each other ; and the difference was the most clearly marked in such nations , as had a cast of priests . But still there were some points , in which they both were united . Even a cast of priests , with whatever secrecy they guarded their doctrines , could influence the people only by means of external forms . But the less the order of priests is separated by a nice line of division from the mass of the people , the more faint becomes the distinction between the religion of the people and the doctrines of the priests . How far the two differed from each other , and remained different , must ever be an object of learned inquiry ; to have confounded them , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the religion of the ancients . Among the Greeks there never was a distinct cast of priests , nor even , as we shall hereafter observe , a /q/ separate order of priesthood . And yet , beside the popular religion , they had a religion of the initiated ; and their mysteries were almost as ancient as the faith of the people . Each of these must be considered by itself , before we can draw any general conclusion respecting the influence of religion on their character . The popular religion of the Greeks rested on a belief in certain superhuman beings , and in the influence exercised by them over the destinies of mortals ; on the fear of offending them , resulting from this belief ; and on the custom of worshipping them . Yet according to the account of the earliest and most credible witness , these divinities were not of Grecian origin ; and the learned investigations of modern writers on the origin of them individually , establish the fact beyond a doubt. * " The Hellenes , " says Herodotus , f " have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who at first honoured their gods without giving them particular names , took the names of their divinities from the Egyptians . " This account of the historian has difficulties , which can not be entirely cleared away . If it be granted , that certain divinities and the manner in which they were worshipped came from Egypt , we may still ask , how could the names have been of Egyptian origin , since the names of the Egyptian gods are almost all known to us , and are very different from those of the Greeks . We learn of Herodotus himself , that it was common for the Egyptian priests , even in his age , to institute /z/ comparisons between their gods and those of the Greeks , and to transfer the names of the latter , to their own divinities . And this enables us , at least , to explain how the historian , who was accustomed to hear a Jupiter , a Bacchus , a Diana , mentioned in Egypt , could have thought the matter very probable . But the question is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the time of Herodotus , applied the Grecian names to their gods , how can we explain the alleged fact , that the Greeks first borrowed those names from them ? There are , however , two circumstances , which we may infer from the words of Herodotus himself , and which throw some light on the subject . The historian has not concealed the source of his information . These assertions were made to him at Dodona ; he heard then a tradition of the priests of that place . But the oracle of Dodona derived its origin from the Egyptians ; can we wonder then , that its priests should derive the gods of the Greeks from the same source ? Again : it is clear from Herodotus , that the Hellenes did not receive them directly from the Egyptians , but through the Pelasgi : that is , they received them at second hand . We shall hereafter remark , that they came chiefly by way of Crete and Samothrace . Could such circuitous routes have left them unchanged ? And is it not probable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before delivering them to the Hellenes ? Questions of this kind can not now be answered with certainty ; but , however many of the Egyptian gods may have been introduced into Greece , it is certain that not all were of thai origin . /q/ The father of history has not forgotten to remark , * that Neptune , Juno , Bacchus , and others were not of Egygtiau origin , and this has been fully substantiated by the acute investigations of the modern inquirers , whom we have just cited . But to whatever country the gods of the Hellenes may have originally belonged , they certainly did not remain , in Greece , what they had been before . We need but throw a glance on the Grecian religion to convince ourselves , that the gods of the Greeks became entirely their property , if they were not so originally ; that is , the representations which they made of them , were entirely different from the conceptions of those nations , of whom they may have borrowed them . Wherever Jupiter , Juno , Neptune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no country but Hellas adored the Olympian ruler of the world , the queen of heaven , the power which encompassed the world , the far-darting god of light . And it was the same with the rest . What the Grecian touched , became gold , though before it had been but a baser metal . But if the popular religion of the Greeks was formed by changing the character of foreign gods , in what did the change consist ? What were the characteristics of the Grecian assembly of divinities ? This question is important , not for the history of the Grecian religion alone , but for the general history of religion itself . For the problem is nothing less , than to fix on the essential difference between the religion of the ancient eastern and western world . /z/ This characteristic difference may yet be easily discovered ; and may be reduced , we think , to a single head . All inquiries relative to the divinities of the East , even though the explanations of individual ones may be various , lead to the general result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation . There may have been first corporeal objects , the sun , the moon , the stars , the earth , the river which watered the country ; or there may have been powers of nature , a creating , a preserving , a destroying power ; or , which was more usual , both these may have been combined ; and visible objects become objects of adoration , in so far as they were the expressions of a creating or destroying power . When the gods of the Egyptians , the Indians , the Persians , the Phrygians , the Phoenicians , and others , are analyzed , even in cases where the interpretation remains imperfect , it can not be doubted , that some idea of this kind lay at the bottom , and was the predominant one . They had but one signification , as far as this idea was connected with it ; and the sacred traditions and mythological tales respecting them , seem to us without meaning , because we have so often lost the key to their interpretation . " The Egyptians , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hercules once appeared before Ammon , and desired to see his face . Ammon refused , and Hercules continued his entreaties ; upon this , Ammon slew a ram , veiled himself in its skin , put on its head , and in this plight showed himself to Hercules . From that time the Thebans ceased to sacrifice rams ; only once a year , on the festival of Ammon , they kill a * Herod , ii . 42. /q/ single one , hang its skin round the picture of the god , and show at the same time the picture of Hercules . " Who understands this story and this festival from the mere relation ? * But when we learn that the ram , opening the Egyptian year , is the symbol of the approaching spring , that Hercules is the sun of that season in its full power , the story , as well as the festival , is explained as descriptive of the spring , and as a figurative representation of the season that is beginning . In this , as in similar cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human form ; for the tendency to copy that form , is too deeply fixed in our natures ; or rather it results immediately from the limitations of the same . But in all such cases in the East , where the human form was attributed to the gods , it was but a secondary affair , the indispensable means of presenting them to the senses . It was never any thing more . And this is the reason , why no hesitation was made among those nations to depart from this human form , and to disfigure it whenever it seemed , possible to give , by that means , a greater degree of distinctness to the symbolic representation ; or if any other object could thus be more successfully accomplished . This is the source of all those singular shapes , under which the gods of the East appear . The Indian makes no scruple of giving his gods twenty arms ; the Phrygian represents his Diana with as many breasts ; the Egyptian gave them the heads of beasts . Different as these disfigurations are , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a subordinate object ; the chief aim was a more distinct designation ( more distinct in the view of the East ) of the symbol . /z/ As the Grecians received most if not all of their gods from abroad , they of course received them as symbols of those natural objects and powers ; and the farther we look back in the Grecian theogony , the more clearly do their gods appear as such beings . He who reads with tolerable attention the earlier systems as contained in Hesiod , can not mistake this for a moment ; and it can not be denied , that there are traces of it in the gods of Homer . That his Jupiter designates the ether , his Juno the atmosphere , his Phoebus Apollo the sun , is obvious in many of his narrations . But it is equally obvious , that the prevailing representation with him is not the ancient symbolical one , that rather his Jupiter is already the ruler of gods and men , his Juno the queen of Olympus . This then is the essential peculiarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those symbolical representations , and not only dismissed them , but adopted something more human and more sublime in their stead . The gods of the Greeks were moral persons . When we call them moral persons , we do not mean to say , that a higher degree of moral purity was attributed to them , than humanity can attain ; ( the reverse is well enough known ; ) but rather , that the whole moral nature of man , with its defects and its excellencies , was considered as belonging to them , only with the additional notions of superior physical force , a more delicately organized system , and a more exalted , if not always a more beautiful form . But these views became the prevailing ones , the views of the people ; and thus an indestructible wall of division was placed between Grecian and foreign gods . /q/ The former were moral beings ; this was their leading character , or rather all their character ; they would have been mere names , if this had been taken from them ; but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powers of nature ; and hence neither a moral nature nor character belonged to them , although the human shape and certain actions and powers were attributed to them . Having thus illustrated the essential difference between the Grecian and foreign gods , and shown in what the transformation of the foreign gods , adopted by the Grecians , consisted , the question arises , how and by what means did that transformation take place ? By means of poetry and the arts . Poetry was the creating power ; the arts confirmed the representations which she had called into being , by conferring on them visible forms . And here we come to the deciding point , from which we must proceed in continuing our inquiry . " Whence each of the gods is descended , whether they have always existed , " says the father of history " and how they were formed , all this the Grecians have but recently known . Hesiod and Homer , whom I do not esteem more than four hundred years older than I am , are the poets , who invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epithets ; fixed their rank and occupations ; and described their forms . The poets , who are said to have lived before these men , lived , as I believe , after them . " /z/ This remarkable account deserves more careful attention . The historian expressly remarks , that this is his own presumption , not the assertion of others . He may certainly have been mistaken ; but he would hardly express himself so explicitly , unless he had believed himself warranted to do so . We must receive his opinion therefore as the result of such an investigation , as could in his age be carried on ; and can we do more than he ? He names Homer and Hesiod ; and naturally understands by them the authors of the poems , which already bore their names ; the two great epic poems of Homer , and at least the Theogony of Hesiod . The case does not become changed , even if those productions are , agreeably to a modern opinion , the works of several authors . It would only be necessary to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homer and of Hesiod , who formed the divine world of the Greeks ; and perhaps this manner of expression is at all events the more correct . For it would be difficult to doubt that the successors of those poets contributed their share . According to the assurances of Herodotus , these poets were the first to designate the forms of the gods ; that is , they attributed to them , not merely the human figure , but the human figure in a definite shape . They distinguished , moreover , their kindred , their descent , their occupations ; they also defined the personal relations of each individual ; and therefore gave them the epithets , which were borrowed from all this . But if we collect these observations into one , they signify nothing less , than that the poets were the authors of the popular religion , in so far as this was /q/ grounded on definite representations of the several divinities . This is not intended to imply , that Homer made it his object , to be the creator of a national religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous popular belief . But that poetic spirit , which left nothing indistinctly delineated in the heroes whose deeds he celebrated , bringing before our eyes their persons and their characters , effects the same with the gods . He invented his divine personages as little as he did his heroes ; but he gave their character to the one and the other . The circle of his gocls is limited to a small number . They are inhabitants of Olympus , and if they do not all belong to the same family , they yet belong to the same place ; and they usually live together , at least , when that is required by the purposes of the poet . Under such circumstances , an inferior poet might have felt the necessity of giving them individuality . And how much more a Homer ? But that he executed it in so perfect a manner , is to be ascribed to the superiority of his genius . Thus the popular notions entertained of the gods were first established by Homer , and established never to be changed . His songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how would it have been possible to efface images , which were painted with such strokes and colours ? Hesiod is , indeed , named with him ; but what are his catalogues of names compared with the living forms of Maeonides ? In this manner , by means of the epic poets , that is , almost exclusively by means of Homer , the gods of the Greeks were raised to the rank of moral beings , possessed of definite characters . As such they gain- /z/ ed life in the conceptions of the people ; and however much may have been invented respecting them in the poetry of a later age , no one was permitted to represent them under a figure , or with attributes different from those which were consistent with the popular belief . We soon perceive the various consequences , which this must have had on thfc culture and improvement of the nation . The more a nation conceives its gods to be like men , the nearer does it approach them , and the more intimately does it live with them . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wandered among them , shared in their business , requited them with good or ill , in conformity to their reception , and especially to the number of presents and sacrifices with which they were honoured . In this manner those views decided the character of religious worship , which received from them , not merely its forms , but also its life and meaning . How could this worship have received any other than a cheerful , friendly character ? The gods were gratified with the same pleasures as mortals ; their delights were the same ; the gifts which were offered them , were the same which please men ; there was a common , a correspondent enjoyment . With such conceptions , how could their holidays have been otherwise than joyous ones ? And as their joy was expressed by dance and song , both of these necessarily became constituent parts of their religious festivals . It is another question : What influence must such a religion have had on the morals of the nation ? The gods were by no means represented as pure moral beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaknesses . But at the same time the Greeks never entertained the idea , that their divinities were to be held up as models of virtue ; and hence the injury done to morality by such a religion , however warmly the philosophers afterwards spoke against it , could hardly have been so great , as we with our prepossessions should have at first imagined . If it was not declared a duty to become like the gods , no excuse for the imitation could be drawn from the faults and crimes attributed to them . Besides , these stories were esteemed , even by the vulgar , only as poetic inventions , and it was little concerned about their truth , or want of credibility . There existed , independent of those tales , the fear of the gods as higher beings , who on the whole desired excellence , and abhorred and sometimes punished crime . This punishment was inflicted in this world ; for the poets and the people of Greece for a long time adopted a belief in no punishment beyond the grave , except of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods. * The system of morals was on the whole deduced from that fear of the gods , but that fear especially produced the observance of certain duties , which were of great practical importance , as , for example , the inviolable character of suppliants ( supplices ) , who stood under the particular protection of the gods ; the sanctity of oaths , and the like ; of which the violation was also considered as a direct crime against the gods . Thus the popular religion of the Greeks was no doubt a support of morality ; but it never could become so in the same /z/ degree as with us . But that its importance was felt as a means of bridling the licentiousness of the people , is sufficiently clear from the care which the state took during its better days to preserve the popular religion , and from the punishments inflicted on those who corrupted it or denied its gods . But if the influence of the popular religion on the moral character of the nation should be differently estimated , there is less room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed entirely by the popular religion , and continued indissolubly united with it . By the transformation of the Grecian divinities into moral agents , an infinite field was opened for poetic invention . By becoming human , the gods became peculiarly beings for the poets . The muse of the moderns has attempted to represent the Supreme Being in action ; she could do so only by giving him as far as possible the attributes of men ; with what success this has been attended , is known . It was in vain to endeavour to deceive us with respect to the chasm which lay between our more sublime ideas of the Divinity , and the image under which he was represented . But the case was altogether different in ancient Greece . The poet was not only allowed but compelled to introduce the gods in a manner consistent with popular belief , if he would not fail of producing the desired effect . The great characteristics of human nature were expressed in them ; they were exhibited as so many definite archetypes . The poet might relate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alter the original characters ; whether he celebrated their own actions , or introduced them as participating in the exploits of mortals . Although /q/ themselves immortal , they always preserved the human character , and excited a corresponding interest ; with their weaknesses and faults , they stood nearer to man , than if they had been represented as possessing the perfection of moral excellence . Thus the popular religion of the Greeks was thoroughly poetical . There is no need of a long argument to show , that it also decided the character of Grecian art , by affording an inexhaustible supply of subjects . On this point a single remark only needs here be made . Among the nations of the East , the plastic art not only never created forms of ideal beauty , but was rather exercised in producing hideous ones . The monstrous figures of their gods , which we have already mentioned , are proofs of it . The Grecian artist was secure against any thing similar to this , now that their gods had become not merely physical , but human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jupiter or a Juno with ten arms ; he would have destroyed his own work , by offending the popular religious notions . Hence he was forced to remain true to the pure human figure , and was thus brought very near the step , which was to raise him still higher , and give ideal beauty to his images . That step he would probably have taken without assistance ; but the previous labours of the poets made it more natural and more easy . Phidias found in Homer the idea of his Olympian Jupiter , and the most sublime image in human shape , which time has spared us , the Apollo of the Vatican , may be traced to the same origin . /z/ Beside the popular religion , Greece possessed also a religion of the initiated , preserved in the mysteries . Whatever we may think of these institutions , and whatever idea we may form of them , no one can doubt that they were religious ones . They must then have necessarily stood in a certain relation to the religion of the people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of probability , the nature of that relation , until we trace them to their origin . We must preface this inquiry with a general remark . All the mysteries of the Greeks , as far as we are acquainted with them , were introduced from abroad ; and we can still point out the origin of most of them . Ceres had long wandered over the earth , before she was received at Eleusis , and erected there her sanctuary. * Her secret service in the Thesmophoria , according to the account of Herodotus , f was first introduced by Danaus , who brought it from Egypt to the Peloponnesus . Whether the sacred rites of Orpheus and Bacchus originally belonged to the Thracians or the Egyptians , they certainly came from abroad . Those of the Curetes and the Dactyli had their home in Crete . It has often been said , that these institutions in Greece suffered , in the progress of time , many and great alterations , that they commonly degenerated , or to speak more correctly , that the Grecians accommodated them to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks the same character , which they had among other nations . And here we are induced to ask : What were they originally ? /z/ How were they introduced and preserved in Greece ? And what relation did they bear to the popular religion ? The answer to these questions is contained in the remarks which we have already made on the transformation and appropriation of foreign gods by the Hellenes . Most of those gods , if not all of them , were received as symbolical , physical beings ; the poets made of them moral agents ; and as such they make their appearance in the religion of the people . The symbolical meaning would have been lost , if no means had been provided to ensure its preservation . The mysteries , it seems , afforded such means . Their great end therefore was , to preserve the knowledge of the peculiar attributes of those divinities , which had been incorporated into the popular religion under new forms ; what powers and objects of nature they represented ; how these , and how the universe came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those contained in the Orphic instructions . But this knowledge , though it was preserved by oral instruction , was perpetuated no less by symbolic representations and usages ; which , at least in part , consisted of those sacred traditions and fables , of which we have already made mention . " In the sanctuary of Sais , " says Herodotus , l ( representations are given by night of the adventures of the goddess ; and these are called by the Egyptians mysteries ; of which , however , I will relate no more . It was from thence , that these mysteries were introduced into Greece . " * If we find in this the chief design of the mysteries , we would by no means assert , that this was the only /z/ one . For who does not perceive how much may be connected with it ? With the progress of time a greater variety of representations may have arisen in the mysteries ; their original meaning might perhaps be gradually and entirely lost ; and another be introduced in its stead. * Those passages may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries , as has been particularly asserted of those of Eleusis , exhibited the superiority of civilized over savage life , and gave instructions respecting a future life and its nature . For what was this more than an interpretation of the sacred traditions , which were told of the goddess as the instructress in agriculture , of the forced descent of her daughter to the lower world , &c.; ? And we need not be more astonished , if in some of their sacred rites we perceive an excitement carried to a degree of enthusiastic madness , which belonged peculiarly to the East , but which the Hellenes were very willing to receive . For we must not neglect to bear in mind * The investigation respecting the mysteries is a very extensive one , and yet very little has thus far been ascertained , as may be seen from the very valuable work of St. Croix , especially in the German translation : Versuch flber die alten Mysterien , translated by Lenz , 1790 . I refer to this book for the necessary citations . It does not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he must leave it to the student of the history of religions . Yet two remarks may here be permitted . First : Homer and Hesiod say nothing of mysteries ; which may very possibly have been older than those poets , but are thus proved to have had in their time less importance than they afterwards gained . And this is immediately explained , so soon as the proper object of the mysteries is discovered , by making the difference between the popular religion , as modified by the poets , and the more ancient physical religion of the East . Secondly : The mysteries introduced from Crete , are said to have constituted the public worship of the Cretans . It was in Greece then , that they first came to be mysteries . This too can hardly be more naturally explained , than by the departure of the popular religion , as established by the poets , from the other more ancient one . /q/ that they shared the spirit of the East ; and did they not live on the very boundary line between the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west , they lost their original character . We know what the Bacchanalian rites became at Rome ; and had they been introduced north of the Alps , what form would they have there assumed ? But to those countries , it was possible to transplant the vine , not the service of the god , to whom the vine was sacred . The orgies of Bacchus suited the cold soil and inclement forests of the North , as little as the character of its inhabitants . The secret doctrines which were taught in the mysteries , may have finally degenerated into mere forms and an unmeaning ritual . And yet the mysteries exercised a great influence on the spirit of the nation , not of the initiated only , but also of the great mass of the people ; and perhaps they influenced the latter still more than the former . They preserved the reverence for sacred things ; and this gave , them their political importance . They produced that effect better than any modern secret societies have been able to do . The mysteries had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . They had , like those of Eleusis , their public festivals , processions , and pilgrimages ; in which none but the initiated took a part , but of which no one was prohibited from being a spectator . Whilst the multitude was permitted to gaze at them , it learned to believe , that there was something sublimer than any thing with which it was acquainted , revealed only to the initiated ; and while the worth of that sublimer knowledge did not consist in secrecy alone , it did not lose any of its value by being concealed . /z/ Thus the popular religion and the secret doctrines , although always distinguished from each other , united in serving to curb the people . The condition , and the influence of religion on a nation , are always closely connected with the situation of those persons , who are particularly appointed for the service of the gods , the priests . The regulations of the Greeks concerning them , deserve the more attention , since many unimportant subjects of Grecian antiquities have been treated with an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the priesthood of the nation , we are as yet left without any investigation , corresponding to the importance of the subject The very abundance of matter renders it the more difficult , for very little can be expressed in general terms ; and many changes were brought about by time . During the heroic age , we learn of Homer , that there were priests , who seem to have devoted themselves exclusively to that vocation . We readily call to mind a Calchas , a Chryses , and others . But even in that age , such priests appear but seldom ; and it does not appear , that their influence over the rest of the people was very great and important . The sacred rites in honour of the gods , were not performed by them alone ; they were not even needed at the public solemnities . The leaders and commanders themselves offer their sacrifices , * perform the prayers , and observe the signs which indicated the result of an undertaking . In a word , kings and leaders were at the same time priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of the sacrifices , which Nestor makes to Pallas . Od. iii . 430 , etc. /q/ Traces of these very ancient regulations were preserved for a long time among the Greeks . The second Archon at Athens , who presided at the public ceremonies of worship , was called the king because he had to prepare the sacred rites , which were formerly regulated by the kings . He had his assistants ; and it was necessary for his spouse to be of irreproachable character , as she also had secret religious services to perform . He was , however , like the other Archons , annually appointed , and the election was made by lot. * The priests and priestesses of the several divinities were for the most part chosen . But the priestesses could be married , and the priests seem by no means to have been excluded by their station from participating in the offices and occupations of citizens . There were some sacerdotal offices , which were hereditary in certain families . But the number of them seems to have been but inconsiderable . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierophant , or first director of the Eleusinian rites , as well as the other three , f should be taken from their family . But the place of hierophant could not be obtained except by a person of advanced years ; and those other offices were probably not occupied during life , but frequently assigned anew.J How far the same was true in other cases , is but seldom related . At Delphi , the first of the oracles of the Hellenes , the Pythian priestess was chosen from * See the important passage in Demosthenes , in Neaer . Op ii . p. 1370 , ed . Reisk. t The Daduchus , or torch-bearer ; the Hieroceryx , or sacred herald ; and the Epibomiiis , who served at the altar . /z/ among the women of the city ; * and was obliged to have no intercourse with men . It is hardly probable from the extreme exertions connected with , the delivery of oracles , that the same person could long fill the place . Here , as elsewhere , people were appointed for the service without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Euripides , belonged to the god or the temple , and were even educated within its limits . But the service within the temple was performed by the most considerable citizens of Delphi , who were chosen by lot.f The sanctuary of Dodona , where the responses of the oracle were made , as at Delphi and in other temples , by priestesses , seems to have belonged to the family of the Seili , of which Homer had heard ; J but we have no particular accounts respecting the situation of that family . The regulations respecting priests , proposed by Plato in his books on laws , show most clearly , that the ideas of the Greeks required , that the offices of priests should not long be filled by the same persons . " Let the election of the priests , " says he , " be committed to the god , by referring the appointment to lot ; those on whom the lot falls , must submit to an examination . * But each priesthood shall be filled for one year , and no longer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be less than sixty years old . The same rules shall apply to the priestesses/* ' *Enripid . Ion , v. 1320. t See the important passage in Euripid . Ion , 414 : " I , ' " says Ion , speaking to the foreigner on the service of the temple , " I have charge only of the outer part ; the interior belongs to them who sit near the tripod , the first of the Delphians , whom the lot selected . " II . xv . 235. $ Plato , de Leg . 1 . vi . Op. viii . p. 266 . Bip. /q/ We infer from all this , that , though the regulations respecting the priesthood were not the same in all parts of Greece , that office was commonly filled for a limited time only , was regarded as a place of honour , to which , as to the other mysteries , appointments were made by lot , with an examination , and was subjected to the same rotation with the rest . They to whom it was entrusted , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they again returned ; and even whilst they were priests , they were by no means withdrawn from the regular business of civil life. * The priesthood did not gain even that degree of firmness , which it had at Rome ; where the priests , though they were not separated from secular pursuits , formed separate colleges , like those of the Pontifices and Augurs ; and the members of them were chosen for life . Since the priesthood then , among the Hellenes in general , and in the several states , never formed a distinct order , it could not possess the spirit of a party , and it was quite impossible for any thing like priestcraft to prevail . Religion and public acts of worship were so far considered holy and inviolable , that they were protected by the state ; and that a degree of intolerance was produced , which led even to ' injustice and cruelty . But we do not find , that the priests were peculiarly active in such cases . It was the people which believed itself injured ; or a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object in view.f *Not even from the duties of war . The Daduchus Callias fought at the battle of Marathon in his costume as a priest . /z/ As the priests of the Greeks formed no distinct class in society , it is evident , that they could have no such secret system of instructions , as was possessed by those of Egypt . No such system can therefore be contrasted with the popular religion ; instead of it there were the mysteries ; but the initiated were not all of them priests , nor was it necessary for every priest to be initiated into the mysteries . Any could be admitted to them , whose condition in life , and behaviour , were found to deserve the distinction . These regulations led to important consequences . There was in the nation no separate class , which claimed an exclusive right to certain branches of scientific and intellectual culture ; and preserved that exclusive right by means of written characters , intelligible only to themselves . That which should be the common property and is the noblest common property of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible , to unfold with freedom the spirit of philosophy . The oldest philosophy of the Greeks , as it appeared at first in the Ionic school , may have originally stood in close union with religion , and may indeed have proceeded from it ; for who does not perceive the near connexion between speculations on the elements of things , and those ancient representations of the gods as powers or objects of nature . But religion could not long hold philosophy in chains . It could not prevent the spirit of free inquiry from awakening and gaining strength ; and hence it was party was active in that affair , it would hardly seem intelligible to us . It gives a remarkable proof of the ease , with which the passions of the Athenians might be aroused , when any attack was made on the things they deemed sacred . /q/ possible for all those sciences , which are promoted by that spirit , to assume among the Greeks a decided and peculiar character . In the intellectual culture of the East , all scientific knowledge is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks , science gained among them that independent character , which distinguishes the West , and which was communicated to the nations of whom the Greeks were the instructors . As the priests never formed a distinct order , and still less a cast , in Greece , the religion never became a religion of state to the extent in which it did in other countries . She was sometimes subservient to public policy , but never became its slave . The dry , prosaic religion of the Romans could be used or abused to such purposes ; but that of the Greeks was much too poetical . The former seems to have existed only for the sake of the state ; and the latter , even when it was useful to the state , appears to have rendered none but voluntary services . The Patricians confined the popular religion of Rome within the strict limits of a system ; but in Greece , religion preserved its freedom of character . Colonists from Abroad . The race of the Hellenes was always the prevalent one in Greece ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country invited foreign emigrations , and its situation facilitated them . Many nations of Thracian , Carian , and lllyrian origin , descended at different times from the North /z/ by land. * These colonists , at least such as remained in the country , may by degrees have been amalgamated with the Hellenes ; but , being themselves barbarians , they could not have contributed much towards softening the manners of the nation ; although the poets of Thrace were not without influence on them . The case was far different with those who came by sea . Greece , as we observed in a former chapter , f was surrounded at no great distance by the most cultivated nations of the western world , which nations were more or less devoted to commerce and the founding of colonies . This is well known to have been the character of the Phoenicians , and it is equally certain that it was so of the inhabitants of Asia Minor ; and traces of Egyptian colonies are found no less in Europe , than in Asia . If no accounts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , they would of themselves have seemed highly probable . But we are so far from being without accounts of this kind , that they have been much more accurately preserved , than the remoteness of the time and the condition of the nation would have authorized us to expect . The memory of them could not become extinct , for their consequences were too lasting ; and if events which for so long a time were preserved by nothing but tradition , are differently related and sometimes highly coloured , the critical student of history can hardly make any valid objections against their general truth .

The colony , which , as Herodotus relates , was brought by Cadmus , together with the alphabet , from Pho3nicia to Greece , f needs no farther proof , when we learn how extensive were the colonies of that nation ; we are only astonished , that we hear of but one in Greece ; since the common course of things would rather lead us to expect a continued emigration , such as took place in the islands , which became almost entirely Phoenician . Nor should we forget the establishment , made by Pelops of Lydia in the peninsula which bears his name-l That also was occasioned by the events of war . Tantalus , the father of Pelops , having been driven from Lydia by Ilus , king of Troy , sought and found in Argos a place of refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been given to the question ; what influence had the emigration of those foreign colonists on the culture of the Greeks ? And more have denied than have conceded , that such an influence was exerted . Where cultivated nations make establishments in the vicinity of barbarians , it /z/ would be wrong to infer directly the civilization of the latter , unless it be confirmed by distinct evidence . The aborigines of America have been for more than two centuries the immediate neighbours of civilized Europeans , and yet how little have they adopted of them ? And if doubts were entertained in the case of the Greeks , it was chiefly because their whole national culture was so remarkably different from that of those Eastern nations , that the former could hardly seem much indebted to the latter . Yet the testimony of the Greeks themselves proves such an influence too clearly to be doubted . Cecrops is expressly mentioned , as having first established domestic union among the inhabitants of Attica , by the introduction of regular marriages ; and as having built the citadel which afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citadel , which Cadmus built in Thebes ; and if we interpret the account of Herodotus respecting the introduction of the alphabet by him , to mean only , that the Hellenes were indebted for it to the Phoenicians ( which on the whole can hardly be doubted ) , the case would not be changed . And if Pelops not only emigrated to Argos with his treasures , but gave his name to the peninsula , the facts admit of no other interpretation than that his emigration was productive of the most important consequences . But farther . These foreigners not only became princes themselves , but made the royal power hereditary in their families . The earliest kings of Attica , Pandion , JEgeus , Theseus , were all descended from the house of Cecrops , although only by the female side . Perseus and his heroic family sprung in like /q/ manner from the family of Danaus . When we name Cadmus , we remember at the same time his descendants , the favourites of the tragic muse , Laius , ( Edipus , Eteocles , and Polynlces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atrides , excelled all the rest in fame as in misfortunes . In this manner the traditional history of the nation is principally dependent on these families from abroad ; they were not only the oldest rulers , but the memory of them continued to live in the mouths of the people from age to age ; till the tragic poets conferred on them immortality . It is impossible that such a continued dominion of those families should have had no influence on the nation . To assert it would be to assert what is inconsistent with the natural progress of things . If these emigrations seem to have been occasioned by political causes , others had their origin in religion . In modern times the savage nature of barbarians has been tamed by missions ; but although antiquity knew and could know none such , the early part of our present inquiries proves , that political and mercantile ends were none the less connected with sanctuaries and oracles . Greece received its colonies of priests ; by which we mean the establishments of sanctuaries by foreigners , who brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn to Apollo affords a remarkable proof , that such institutions were entirely in the spirit of the ancient Grecian world . When the Pythian god was establishing his oracle at Delphi , he beheld on the sea a merchant-ship from Crete ; this he directs to Crissa , and appoints the foreigners the servants of his newlyestablished sanctuary , near which they settled and /z/ abode , * When this story , which we would not affirm to be historically true , is stripped of the language of poetry , it can only mean , that a Cretan colony founded the temple and oracle of Delphi . And the account given by Herodotus of the Egyptian origin of the oracle of Dodona , ceases to surprise us , f although that oracle owes its establishment to another cause , the Phoenician slave-trade , by means of which two consecrated women were carried , the one to Ammonium in Lybia , the other to Dodona . If we knew more certainly who the Selli were , who are thought to have been a branch of the Pelasgi , and are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in possession of the oracle , we should probably be able to say more than we now can respecting its history . That it was of Egyptian origin , is acknowledged not only by the sacred traditions of Dodona , but also by those of Egypt . It was impossible for these settlements to assume in Greece the aspect , which they took in Africa . The character of the country and the spirit of the people were alike opposed to it ; for though the popular religion in Greece was not wholly unconnected with politics , the state , having never as in Egypt been founded entirely upon religion , never made a temple its central point . But those settlements continued as oracles , of which the Greek stood in need both in public and private life . Similar sacred institutions arose very early OH several of the islands round Greece , and were transplanted from them to the continent . Those of Crete and Samothrace were the most important . The first * Homer .

All that we know of the glory of Crete , belongs to the age of Homer and the preceding times. * The period in which they cleared the sea of robbers ; exercised supremacy over the islands , and a part of the country on the shore , even of Attica ; and received their laws from Minos , the familiar friend of Jove , belongs to so remote an age , that it affords less room for certainty than for conjecture . But Crete still appears in Homer so flourishing , that hardly a country on the continent could be compared with it.f The situation of this large island can alone serve to explain , how it came to precede Hellas in culture . It lay at almost equal distances from Egypt , Phoenicia , and Greece . If it was , as we are told , the country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured there , : : the obscurity which covered the oldest tradition , is at once removed .

The use of these metals must have led to various inventions . The commerce carried on with them , made the extirpation of piracy necessary . And it was very natural that these inventions , ascribed to the gods , should give rise to many a pious supersti- * See the rich compilation of Meursius : Crete , Cyprus , Rodes. 1675. t Crete awes the circling waves , a fruitful soil , And ninety cities crown the sea-born isle .

We have the authority of Strabo , that this invention was unanimously ascribed to the Cretans ; f although the traditions respecting ancient Crete were in other respects very various , traditions , which had probably afforded subjects to many poets , before they were committed to writing by the Cretan historians , to whom Diodorus refers . We are expressly told by the ancients , that the invention and manufacturing of brass stood in immediate connexion with the religious institutions in that island , when the Curetes and Dactyli on mount Ida are mentioned , and the manufacturing of brass and iron , the preparation of arms , and the war-dances are attributed to them ; all which were transplanted from thence to Phrygia , to the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace , and from thence by way of Thrace to Greece . No branch of the Grecian religious history is more entangled with others , than this of the Cretan religious institutions ; and this confusion has been increased in part by accidental causes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strabo , even in his time , found it impossible to disentangle the confused accounts respecting the Curetes , Dactyli , and Cory- * Diod. p. 333. t Strabo , x. p. 326. f See Strabo and Diodor. 1 . c. etc .

But that the whole web is woven of Egptian , Pho2nician , Pelasgic , and Phrygian threads , can be as little denied , as the emigrations of those and other nations to Crete . Should some modern Theseus venture to descend into this labyrinth , we wish he may find the thread of Ariadne in the history of the discovery and manufacturing of the baser metals and their general diffusion , on which the arts of war and peace equally depended ; not in order to cement every thing with this , and so to frame an imperfect hypothesis from but one view of the subject ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Greeks arrived at that point of culture , at which we shall see them in the following chapter . li /z/ ALTHOUGH the history of the progress of the Greek nation during the early period of its culture , is imperfect and fragmentary , the progress itself is certain . In the age which we best designate in the spirit of the nation by the name of the Heroic Age , and which extends from about the thirteenth to the eleventh century before the Christian era , we find them possessed of a far higher degree of civilization , than that of which by their own accounts they were possessed before . The poet who delineates them in that stage is never untrue to the poetic character ; and yet Homer was regarded even by the ancients as of historical authority ; and , to a certain point , deserved to be so regarded . Truth was his object in his accounts and descriptions , as far as it can be the object of a poet , and even in a greater degree than was necessary , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best source of information respecting the heroic age ; and since that source pours so copiously , there is no need of drawing from any other . When we compare the Greeks of Homer with those of later ages , we immediately perceive a remarkable difference , to which we must at once direct our attention . His Greeks , to whatever tribe they belong , are all equal in point of culture . With him , /q/ the Thessalian differs in nothing from the inhabitant of the Peloponnesus , nor the Etolian from the Boeotian and Athenian ; the sole points of difference which he marks , are merely personal ; or at most result from the greater or smaller extent of the several territories . Hence we infer , that the causes which afterwards gave the inhabitants of the eastern part of Hellas so great an advantage over those of the west , had not then begun to operate . There must rather have been some causes of general influence , to produce that early progress ; and therefore we have less reason to fear that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . Yet religion had no influence in exciting and developing that heroic spirit , which is the characteristic of the age . In those later centuries of the middle age which embrace the Christian heroic age , a devotional spirit formed a prominent feature in the character of a chevalier ; but nothing like this is to be found among the Greeks . The Grecian heroes always preserve a belief in the gods ; are intimately and directly united with them ; are sometimes persecuted and sometimes protected by them ; but they do not fight for their religion , like the Christian knights . Such an idea could never occur to them ; for their representations of their gods did not admit of it . And here we remark one great point of difference between the Grecian and Christian heroic character . A second , to which we shall return directly , results from the different condition of the other sex . But another prominent trait is common to both ; the propensity to extraordinary and bold undertakings , /z/ not only at home , but in foreign lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition had , for the most part , spread none but indistinct accounts . This propensity was first awakened by the early emigrations of the Hellenes . But the exploits of the oldest heroes among the Greeks , Meleager , Tydeus , and others , before Hercules and Jason , were performed at home ; and even those which are said to have been performed by Hercules out of Greece , are probably a later fiction , invented at the time when his name was first added to the number of the Argonauts , and the Grecian Hercules was confounded with the Phoenician . Adventures in foreign regions begin with Jason and the Argonautic expedition ; and those adventures were destined soon to end in a general union of the nation for the purpose of carrying on a war beyond the sea . As far as we can judge amidst the uncertainty of the chronology of that period , this adventurous spirit appears to , have been awakened in the century immediately preceding the Trojan war . According to all possible chronological combinations , we must refer to this period the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crete ; which events happened soon after the dominion of the sea had been gained for that island by Minos . The general condition of Greece in that period explains , in some measure , why the limits of that country began to grow too narrow , and a new theatre for the display of enterprise to be sought for . The whole of Greece previous to the Trojan war , appears to have enjoyed perfect tranquillity within its own boundaries . The limits of the small districts into which Greece was divided , /q/ seem already to have been definitively established . We hear of no contention respecting them on the part of the princes ; and Homer was able to enumerate the several possessions with precision . The war of the seven against Thebes had its origin in family discord ; and the claims of the exiled Heraclidse were not made valid till a more recent age . It was on the whole an age of internal peace , notwithstanding some interruptions . In such an age there was little opportunity for heroic exploits at home ; and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once roused , should go in quest of them abroad ? But such was the situation of the country , that this could take place only by sea . There was in the North , nothing which could invite the spirit of enterprise ; and the country in that direction was possessed by warlike nations . On the other hand , the reports which came to the Greeks respecting the land beyond the sea , were numerous ; even though they may have been brought by none but the Phoenicians . The countries and nations which were the chief objects of the voyages of that commercial people , the Cimmerians in the North , the Lotophagi , and the gardens of the Hesperides on the coast of Lybia ; Sicily with its wonders , the Cyclops , and Scylla and Charybdis ; and even Spain with the mighty Geryon and the pillars of Hercules , are dimly seen in the earliest Grecian mythology . These traditions did much towards awakening the spirit of adventure , and thus occasioned the Argonautic expedition . These early voyages , by which so much activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , were the chief means by which the circle of ideas in the nation was enlarged . This is obvious from those ancient mythological tales , which were thus introduced , and which were the fruit of the increased intercourse with foreign countries . The geography of Homer , limited as it is , not only extends far beyond the bounds of his native land ; but shows a manifest desire of discovering the farthest limits of the earth . The ocean stream which flowed round it , is mentioned ; the regions are named , in which the sun has the gates of its rising and setting ; even the entrance to the lower world is known . The obscurity in which all this was veiled , served but to excite the adventurous spirit , which was once aroused , to new undertakings . The internal political condition of Greece in the heroic age was in one respect similar to that of a later period ; and in another essentially different . It was similar in the division into small territories ; but it was altogether different in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the variety of the tribes , was in those times as great , or perhaps greater than in more recent ones . The district of Thessaly alone contained , in Homer 's time , no less than ten small states , each of which had its prince or leader . In the central part of Greece , the Bceotians had five principalities , * the Minyes , whose capital was Orchomenus , the Locrians , f the Atheni- *I1. ii . catalog , nav . 1 . &c.; where also the passages may be found , which serve as proofs of the following statements . fThe Opuntii and Epicnemidii . Homer makes no mention of the Ozote. /q/ ans , the Phocians , had each their own ruler . In the Peloponnesus , there existed , independent of each other , the kingdoms of Argos , of Mycenae , of Sparta , of Pylus , that of the Elians , divided under four heads , and Arcadia . Many of the islands also had their own princes . On the west side , the government of Ulysses embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Epirus which lies over against it . ' The flourishing island of Crete was swayed by Idomeneus ; Salamis by Ajax ; Eubcea , inhabited by the Abantes , Rhodes , and Cos had their own rulers ; jEgina and probably others of the small islands belonged to the neighbouring princes . This political division was therefore from the earliest times a peculiarity of Greece ; and it never ceased to be so . And here it is natural to ask , how it could have continued so long ? How happened it , that amidst the early civil wars , and especially the later superiority of the Doric tribe , the supremacy of an individual state was never established ? One principal cause of this is to be found in the natural geographical divisions of the country , which we have described in a former chapter ; another , no less important , seems to lie in the internal division of the several tribes . Even where those of the same tribe made their settlements , they were immediately split into separate townships . According to these , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are found in all parts of his poems , especially in the catalogue of the ships . If these townships stood under one common head , they were still united only by a feeble bond . The germ of division was deeply fixed even in those earlier times ; and as it unfolded , it was /z/ destined to mature the whole subsequent political condition of Greece . Yet though the divisions of the country were then as numerous , the forms of government in those early times were entirely different from the later ones . We meet with no governments but those of princes or kings ; there were then no republics ; and yet republicanism was eventually to decide the political character of Greece . These monarchical constitutions , if that name may be applied to them , were rather the outlines of constitutions than regular , finished forms of government . They were a consequence of the most ancient condition of the nation , when either ruling families sprung up in the several tribes ; or the leaders of foreign colonies had known how to secure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to the country . The families of Peleus , Cadmus , Pelops , and others , have already been mentioned . It was a great recommendation of the later rulers , to be able to trace their lineage to one of the ancient heroes or gods : and Alexander himself sought the confirmation of his own descent from the temple of Ammon . But though much depended on descent , we learn from observing those ancient families , that it was not only necessary that the founder of the family should be a hero , but , if its elevation was to be perserved , that many heroes like him should arise among his posterity . For this the houses of Pelops and Cadmus were the most illustrious . But only certain branches of the family of Hercules , the first of Grecian heroes , were remembered by the nation , while others passed into oblivion . The Greeks paid respect to birth , /z/ yet they never attributed every thing to birth ; and if in those republican times , the noble families were preserved distinct from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no line was drawn between them and the rest of the people , such as divided the Patricians from the Plebeians in the early period of Roman history . The correct judgment of the Greeks is observable in this , as in so many other things . The respect for their illustrious families was continued in the recollection of their actions ; but the descendants were not long permitted to live on the fame of their forefathers . The constitutions of the heroic age were the result of circumstances , and wants which were felt . Esteem for the ruling families secured to them the government ; but their power was not strictly hereditary . Princes were not much more than the first amongst their equals ; or even the latter were also denominated princes. * The son had commonly the precedence over others in the succession ; but his claim was measured by his personal qualifications for the station , f It was his first duty to lead in war ; and he could not do this , unless he was himself distinguished for courage and strength .

In addition to this he sometimes acted as judge ; * but not always ; for the administration of justice was often committed to an assembly of the elders , f Nothing was known of particular taxes paid to the king .

The preservation of his dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of assembly for persons of the upper class , who almost always sat at table with him ; to turn away strangers , who asked for shelter , or only seemed to stand in need of it , would have been an unexampled outrage. ! Greece , even in those times , was a thickly peopled and well cultivated country . What a crowd of cities is enumerated by the poet ! And we must not imagine these to have been open towns with scattered habitations . The epithets applied to them frequently prove the reverse . They are in part surrounded with walls ; have gates and regular streets . Yet the houses stand by themselves ; having in front a court , and in the rear a garden . Such at least /z/ t See e. g. ttoe representation on the shield of Achilles . II . xviii . 504. t How warmly Menelaus reproaches Eteoneus for proposing to send the strangers somewhere else .

In the middle of the city there is a public square or marketplace ; the common place of assembly for the citizens , whether on solemn occasions , or for deliberation , or courts of justice , or any other purpose . It is surrounded with seats of stone , on which the distinguished men are wont on such occasions to take their places. * No trace is to be found of any pavement in the streets . The different branches of agriculture were already well advanced . Property in lands was universal ; of which the boundaries were fixed by measurement , and often designated by stones.f The poet describes to us the various labours of farming , ploughing , whether with oxen or mules , sowing , reaping , binding the sheaves , and treading out the corn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the culture of the grape , the tilling of gardens , and the various duties of the herdsman. ! It may be doubted whether the soil was much better cultivated in the most flourishing period of Grecian history . The houses of the heroes were large and spacious , and at the same time suited to the climate . The court was surrounded by a gallery , round which the bedchambers were built . The entrance from the court to the hall was direct , which was the common place of resort . Moveable seats ( Wtw ) stood along * The city of the Phaeacians , Od. vii . gives proof of all this . til. xii.421.xxi. 405 . I need only call to mind the representations on the shield of Achilles .

Several steps conducted from thence to a higher gallery , near which were the chambers of the women , where they were employed in household labours , especially in weaving . Several outhouses for the purpose of grinding and baking , were connected with the house ; others for the common habitations of the male and female slaves 5 and also stables for the horses. * The stalls for cattle were commonly in the fields . Astonishment is excited by the abundance of metals , both of the precious and baser ones , with which the mansions were adorned , and of which the household utensils were made.f The walls glittered with them ; the seats were made of them . Water for washing was presented in golden ewers on silver salvers ; the benches , arms , utensils were ornamented with them . Even if we suppose that much , called golden , was only gilded , we still have reason to ask , whence this wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver , when he speaks of it as belonging to Alybe , in the land of the Halizones.J Most of the gold probably came from Lydia , where this metal in later times was so abundant , that the Greeks were for the most part supplied with all they used from that country . As there was no coined *Thus with Menelaus , Od. iv . 40. t Above all in the mansion of Menelaus . JII. ii . Catalog , v. 364 . Without doubt in the Caucasian chain of mountains ; even though the Halizones and the Cbalybes should not be the /q/ money , * and as the metals were in consequence used in commerce as means of exchange , the manufacturing of them seems to have been one of the chief branches of mechanic industry . Proofs of this are found in the preparation of arms and utensils . We need but call to mind the shield of Achilles , the torch-bearing statues in the house of Alcinous , f the enameled figures on the clasp of Ulysses 7 mantle , J &c.; But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Greeks , or gained by exchange from abroad . As the poet commonly describes them to be the works of Vulcan , it is at least clear , that manufactures of this kind were somewhat rare , and in part foreign . Gold was afterwards wrought in Asia Minor , especially in Lydia ; all labour in brass and iron seems , as we remarked above , to have been first brought to perfection among the Hellenes in Crete . These labours in metal appear to have limited the early progress of the plastic arts . We find no traces of painting , and none of marble statues . But those efforts in metal imply exercise in drawing ; for we hear not only of figures , but also of expression in their positions and motions . The art of weaving , the chief occupation of the women , was even then carried to a high degree of perfection . The stuffs were of wool and linen ; it is hard to decide how far cotton was in those times *This was probably one of the chief reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 100. t Od. xii . 225 , &c,; As e. g. the silver goblet received by Menelaus from the king of Sidon . Od. iv . 615 . Beside the description of the shield of Achilles , note especially Od. six . 229 , etc. /z/ manufactured in Greece. * Yet garments of foreign manufacture , those of Egypt and Sidon , were esteemed the most beautiful . f The dress was decent , but free . The female sex were by no means accustomed to conceal the countenance , but were clad in long robes ; both sexes wore an under garment , over which the broad upper garment was thrown . The internal regulations of families were simple , but not without those peculiarities , which are a natural consequence of the introduction of slavery . Polygamy was not directly authorized ; but the sanctity of marriage was not considered as violated by the intercourse of the husband with female slaves . The noble characters of Andromache and of Penelope , exhibit , each in its way , models of elevated conjugal affection . It is more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seduced and the returning Helen ; and yet if we compare Helen , the beloved of Paris in the Iliad , with Helen , the spouse of Menelaus in the Odyssey , we find truth and much internal harmony in the character which could err , but not become wholly untrue to nobleness of feeling . It is a woman , who , having become in youth the victim of sensuality , ( and never without emotions of regret , ) returned afterwards to reason ; before she was compelled to do so by age . Even after her return from Troy , she was still exceedingly beautiful ; H ( for who can think of counting her * Compare , above all , the description of Achilles ' clothing , Od. xix. 225 , &c.; The mantle ( ; X ) , rough to the touch , was without doubt of wool ; but the under garment ( r ) can hardly pass for either woollen or linen . Fine as a filmy web beneath it shone A vest , that dazzled like a cloudless sun . tAse. g . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then the two sexes stood to each other in the same relation , which continued in later times . The wife is housewife , and nothing more . Even the sublime Andromache , after that parting , which will draw tears , as long as there are eyes which can weep and hearts which can feel , is sent back to the apartments of the women , to superintend the labours of the maidservants. * Still we observe in her , conjugal love of an elevated character . In other instances love has reference , both with mortals and with immortals , to sensual enjoyment ; although in the noble and uncorrupted vestal characters , as in the amiable Nausicaa , it was united with that bashfulness , which accompanies maiden youth . But we meet with no trace of those elevated feelings , that romantic love , as it is very improperly termed , which results from a higher regard for the female sex . That love , and that regard are traits peculiar to the Germanic nations , a result of the spirit of gallantry which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we vainly look for in Greece . Yet here the Greek stands between the East and the West . Although he was never wont to revere the female sex as beings of a higher order , he did not , like the Asiatic , imprison them by troops in a haram . The progress which had been made in social life , is visible in nothing more distinctly , except the relative situation of the sexes , than in the tone of conversation among men . A solemn dignity belonged to it even in common intercourse ; the style of salutation and address is connected with certain forms ; the epithets with which the heroes honoured each other , were so II . vi.490. /z/ adopted into the language of intercourse , that they are not unfrequently applied , even where the language of reproach is used . Let it not be said , that this is merely the language of epic poetry . The poet never could have employed it , if its original , and a taste for it , had not already existed . If the tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain degree , of the moral improvement of a nation , the Greeks of the heroic age were already vastly elevated beyond their earlier savage state . To complete the picture of those times , it is necessary to speak of war and the art of war . The heroic age of the Greeks , considered from this point of view , exhibits a mixture of savageness and magnanimity , and the first outlines of the laws of nations . The enemy who has been slain , is not secure against outrage , and yet the corpse is not always abused. * The conquered party offers a ransom ; and it depends on the victor to accept or refuse it . The arms , both of attack and defence , are of iron or brass . No hero appeared , like Hercules of old , with a club and lion 's skin for spear and shield . The art of war , as far as it relates to the position and erecting of fortified camps , seems to have been first invented in the siege of Troy.f In other respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipments , together with personal courage and strength . As the great multitude was , for the most part , svithout defensive armour , and as only a few were completely accoutred , one of these last outweighed a host of the rest . But only the leaders were thus armed ; and * An example , II . vi . 417. /q/ they ? standing on their chariots of war ( for cavalry was still unknown ) , fought with each other in the space between the armies . If they were victorious , they spread panic before them ; and it became easy for them to break through the ranks . But we will pursue no farther the description of scenes , which every one prefers to read in the poet himself . As the crusades were the fruit of the revolution in the social condition of the West , the Trojan war resulted from the same causes in Greece . It was necessary , that a fondness for adventures in foreign lands should be awakened ; expeditions by sea , like that of the Argonauts , be attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in that and the march against Thebes , be first established ; before such an undertaking could become practicable . But now it resulted so naturally from the whole condition of things , that , though its object might have been a different one , it must have taken place even without a Helen . The expedition against Troy , like the crusades , was a voluntary undertaking on the part of those who joined in it ; and this circumstance had an influence on all the internal regulations . The leaders of the several bands were voluntary followers of the Atridae , and could therefore depart from the army at their own pleasure . It is more difficult to fix on the relation between the leaders and their people ; and he who should undertake to describe every thing minutely , would be most sure of making mistakes . There were certainly control and obedience . The troops follow their leaders , and leave the battle with them . But much even of this seems to have been /z/ voluntary ; and the spirit of the age allowed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a Thersites could have received the treatment of Thersites . This undertaking , begun and successfully terminated by united exertions , kindled the national spirit of the Hellenes . On the fields of Asia , the tribes had for the first time been assembled , for the first time had saluted each other as brethren . They had fought and had conquered in company . Yet something was still wanting to preserve the flame , which was just blazing up . The assistance of the muse was needed , to commemorate in words those events of which the echo will never die away . By preserving the memory of them forever , the most beautiful fruits which they bore were saved from perishing. /q/ /z/ LIKE the age of chivalry in western Europe , the heroic age of the Greeks began and ended without our being able to define either period by an exact date . Such a phenomenon is the fruit of causes which are rooted deeply and of continuing influence , and it neither suddenly ripens nor suddenly decays . The heroic age was not immediately terminated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its greatest glory. * It was closely united with the political constitution of the times ; the princes of the tribes were the first of the heroes . When the constitution of the tribes was changed , the ancient heroic world coulJ not continue . No new undertaking was begun , which was so splendidly executed and closed . Although , therefore , heroic characters may still have arisen , as in the times of Achilles and Agamemnon , no similar career of honour was opened to them ; they were not celebrated in song like the Atridse and their companions ; and though they may have gained the praise of their contemporaries , they did not live , like the latter , in the memory of succeeding generations . In the age succeeding the Trojan war , several events took place , which prepared and introduced an /z/ entire revolution in the domestic and still more in public life of the Greeks . The result of these revolutions was the origin and general prevalence of republican forms of government among them ; and this decided the whole future character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for us to show the general causes of this great change ; but when we remember that these events took place before Greece had produced a historian , and when tradition was the only authority , we give up all expectation of gaining perfect and unbroken historical accounts ; and acknowledge that we can hardly know more of them than Thucydides . The emigration of the tribes , says this historian , * was by no means at an end with the Trojan war . The continuance of the war produced many changes ; in many cities disturbances were excited , which occasioned the banished parties to found new cities . The Boeotians , driven from Arne in Thessaly , took possession of their country in the sixtieth year after the fall of Troy ; in the eightieth , the Dorians , led on by the Heraclidse , conquered the Peloponnesus . And we have already observed , what great revolutions were produced by this last event . A new tribe , till then the weaker , was extended and became the more powerful . But still greater changes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend on the east and west , far beyond the limits of their ancient country . ' When Greece , " 7 continues Thucydides , " after a long interval , at lejigth became composed , and assumed a firmer appearance , it sent out colonies ; Athens , to Ionia in Asia Minor , and to a great part of the islands * TLucvd. i. 12. /q/ of the Archipelago ; the Peloponnesians , chiefly to Italy and Sicily ; all which settlements were not made till after the Trojan times . " The views of the nation could not but be enlarged by the Trojan war . It had become acquainted with the coasts of Asia , those lands so highly favoured by nature : and the recollection of them never died away . When the new internal storms followed , and almost all the tribes of the Hellenes were driven , from their places of abode , it is not remarkable that the coasts of Asia should have attracted the emigrating parties . Since the downfall of Troy , no new kingdom had been established there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement of the foreigners . Thus , in the course of not more than a century , * the western coast of Asia Minor was occupied by a chain of Grecian cities , extending from the Hellespont to the boundary of Cilicia . Eolians , conducted by the descendants of the fallen house of the Atridse , established their residence in the vicinity of the ruins of Troy , on the coast of Mysia , in the most fruitful region known to those times , ! and on the opposite island of Lesbos ; on the continent they built twelve cities , and on Lesbos Mitylene , which now gives a name to the whole island . Smyrna , the only one which has preserved a part of its splendor , and Cyme , exceeded all the rest on the main land . jEolis was bounded on the south by Ionia , a region so called from the twelve Ionian cities , which were built by the lonians , who had been expelled from their ancient country . They /z/ also occupied the neighbouring islands Chios and Samos . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was celebrated with the Greeks as the mildest and most delightful. * Of these cities , Miletus , Ephesus , and Phocaea became flourishing commercial towns ; the mothers of many daughters , extending from the shores of the Black sea and lake Mseotis , to the coasts of Gaul and Iberia . Neither were the Dorians content with their conquest of the Peloponnesus ; troops of them thronged to Asia ; Cos , and the wealthy Rhodes , as well as the cities Halicarnassus and Cnidus , were peopled by them . In this manner , as the series of cities planted by the Grecians ascended the Macedonian and Thracian coast to Byzantium , the jEgean sea was encircled with Grecian colonies , and its islands were covered with them . But the mother country seems soon to have been filled again ; and as the east offered no more room , the emigrants wandered to the west . At a somewhat later period , but with hardly less success , the coasts of Lower Italy , which soon took the name of Magna Grsecia , and those of Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the gulf of Tarentum , not only the city of that name , but Croton and Sybaris soon rose to a degree of population anti wealth , bordering on the fabulous ; whilst the chain of towns extended by way of Rhegium and Pacstum as far as Cumse and Naples . These colonial towns were still more frequent on the coasts of Sicily , from Messana and the unrivalled Syracuse to the proud Agrigen- *Heroi ! . i. 142. /q/ turn . And in the now desolate Barca , on the coast of Lybia , Gyrene flourished with the towns of which it was the metropolis , and proved that Greeks remained true to their origin even in Africa . We reserve for another chapter the consideration of the flourishing condition and various consequences of their colonies . Bat whilst the world of the Greeks and their circle of vision were thus enlarged , it was not possible for their political condition to remain unchanged . Freedom ripens in colonies . Ancient usage can not be preserved , can not altogether be renewed , as at home . The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broken by the voyage ; the spirit felt itself to be more free in the new country ; new strength was required for the necessary exertions ; and those exertions were animated by success . Where every man lives by the labour of his hands , equality arises , even if it did not exist before . Each day is fraught with new experience ; the necessity of common defence is more felt in lands where the new settlers find ancient inhabitants desirous of being free from them . Need we wonder , then , if the authority of the founders , even where it had originally subsisted , soon gave way to liberty ? Similar phenomena are observable in the mother country . The annihilation of so many of the ruling houses in the Trojan war and its immediate consequences would have produced them even without internal storms . How then could the ancient order of things be restored , after so great revolutions and such changes in the residence of nearly all the tribes . The heroic age disappeared ; and with it the supremacy of the princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they resemble adventurers rather than the sublime figures of Homer . On the other hand , the intercourse and trade with the colonies were contmued on all sides ; for , according to the Grecian custom , the mother country and her colonies were never strangers to each other ; and the former soon had a lesson to learn of the latter . A new order things was the necessary consequence . The ancient ruling families died away of themselves , or lost their power . But this did not take place in all or most of the Grecian cities at one time , but very gradually ; and he who should speak of a general political revolution in the modern phrase , would excite altogether erroneous conceptions . As far as we can judge from the imperfect accounts which remain of the history of the individual states , more than a century elapsed before the change was complete . We can not fix the period of it in all of them ; it happened in most of them between the years 900 and 700 before Christ , in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In several , as in Athens , it was brought about by degrees . In that city , when the royal dignity was abolished at the death of Codrus , * archons , differing little from kings . were appointed from his family for life ; these were followed by archons chosen for ten years ; f and these last continued for seventy years , till the yearly election of a college of archons set the seal to democracy . The fruit of these changes was the establishment of free constitutions for the cities ; which constitutions could prosper only with the increasing prosperity of *In the year 1068 before Christ . t In the year 752 before Christ . /q/ the towns . Thucydides has described to us in an admirable manner , how this happened . " In those times , " says he , * " no important war , which could give a great ascendency to individual states , was carried on ; the wars which chanced to arise , were only with the nearest neighbours . " Though tranquillity may thus have sometimes been interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But since colonies were established beyond the sea , several of the cities began to apply themselves to navigation and commerce ; and the intercourse , kept up with them afforded mutual advantages- ! The cities , " continues Thucydides , " became more powerful and more wealthy ; but then usurpers arose in most of them , who sought only to confirm , their own power , and enrich their own families ; but performed no great exploits ; until they were overthrown , not long before the Persian wars , by the Spartans ( who , amidst all those storms , were never subjected to tyrants ) and the Athenians . " : : The essential character of the new political form assumed by Greece , consisted therefore in the circumstance , that the free states which were formed , were nothing but cities with their districts , and their constitutions were consequently only forms of city government . This point of view must never be lost sight of . The districts into which Greece was divided , did not form , as such , so many states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possessed several independent cities ; though a whole district some- * Thucyd. i. 15. f Thucyd. i. 13 . J For the counterpart to the narration of Thucydides , we need only call to mind the history of the Italian cities , towards the end of the middle age . /z/ times formed the territory of but one city , as Attica of Athens , Laconia of Sparta , etc. and in such a case formed of course but one state . But it might easily happen , that the cities of one district , especially if their inhabitants were of kindred tribes , formed alliances for mutual safety : as the twelve Achaean cities had done . But these alliances had reference only to foreign relations : and thus they formed a confederation of cities , but not one state ; for each individual city had its own internal constitution , and managed its own concerns . It might also happen , that some one of the cities , on becoming powerful , should claim the sovereignty over the rest ; as Thebes over the Boeotian cities . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended by the Greeks , not only that each state should preserve its internal liberty ; but that its submission should be voluntary ; although the claims of a supreme city occasionally led to compulsory measures . When Thebes usurped the first rank in Boeotia , Plataeae would never acknowledge its sovereignty . The consequences of it are known from history . The whole political life of the nation was thus connected with cities and their constitutions ; and no one can judge of Grecian history with accuracy , unless he comprehends the spirit of them . The strength of such cities seems to be very limited ; but the history of the world abounds in examples , which show how far beyond expectation they can rise . They are animated by public spirit , resulting from civil prosperity ; and the force of that spirit can be expressed in no statistical tables . /q/ /z/ THE heroic age was past , before the poets , who celebrated it , arose . It produced some contemporary with itself ; but their fame was eclipsed by those who came after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Demodocus and Phemius had never become immortal . With the Greeks , epic poetry had an importance , which it possessed among no other people ; it was the source of their national education in poetry and the arts . It became so by means of the Homeric poems . But boundless as was the genius of the Ionian bard , a concurrence of favourable circumstances was still needed , to prepare for his appearance , and to make it possible . Epic poetry was of itself a fruit of the heroic age ; just as the poetry of chivalry was the result of the age of chivalry . The picture drawn for us by Homer of the heroic times , leaves no room to doubt of it . The feasts of the heroes , like the banquets of the knights , where ornamented with song . But the more copious the stream is to which it swelled , the more does it deserve to be traced , as far as it is possible , to its origin . Even before the heroic age , we hear of several poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if their hymns were merely invocations and eulogies of the gods , as we must infer from the accounts which /z/ are handed down to us respecting them , * no similarity seems to have existed between them and the subsequent heroic poetry ; although a transition not only became possible , but actually took place , when the actions of the gods were made the subjects of hymns . f The heroic poetry , according to all that we know of it , preserved the character of narration ; whether those narrations contained accounts of the gods or of heroes ; J " the actions of gods and heroes , who were celebrated in song . " In the songs of Deniodocus and Phemius , the subject is taken from the one and from the other ; he celebrates the loves of Mars and Venus , no less than the adventures which took place before Troy . The latter class of subjects can not be more ancient than the heroic age , even though we should esteem the former as much older . But that age produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of the heroes . They formed a separate class in society ; but they stood on an equal footing with the heroes , and are considered as belonging to them . The gift of song came to them from the gods : it is the Muse , or Jove himself , who inspires them and teaches them what they should sing.H As this representation continually recurs , it is probable , that their poetic effusions were often extemporaneous . At least this seems in *Our present Orphic hymns have this character The more ancient ones , if there were such , were nothing else . See Pausanias is. p. 770 ; and the very ancient hymn , preserved by Stobaeus . Stob . Eclog. i. p. 40 in Heeren 's edition . t The proof of this is found in the hymns attributed to Homer . J Odyss. i. 338 . Odyss. viii . 266 , fcc . Od. viii . 483 . Demodocus himself is here called Heros . U Od. viii . 73 , i. 348. /q/ many cases hardly to admit of a doubt . Ulysses proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bard , like the modern improvisator ! , commences his strains under the influence of the sudden inspiration . We would by no means be understood to assert , that there were none but extemporaneous productions . Certain songs very naturally became favourites , and were kept alive in the mouths of the poets ; whilst an infinite number , which were but the offspring of the moment , died away at their birth . But an abundance of songs was needed ; a variety was required , and the charm of novelty even then enforced its claims . f For novel lays attract our ravished ears ; But old the mind with inattention hears . The voice was always accompanied by some instrument . The bard was provided with a harp , on which he played a prelude , : : to elevate and inspire his mind , and with which he accompanied the song when begun . His voice probably preserved a medium between singing and recitation ; the words , and not the melody , were regarded by the listeners ; hence it was necessary for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar is found , it is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind ; but whoever has had an opportunity of listening to the improvisator ! of Italy , can easily form an idea of Demodocus and Phemius . However imperfect our ideas of the earliest heroic songs may remain after all which the poet has told us , the following positions may be inferred from it . First : The singers were at the same time poets ; they sang their own works ; there is no trace of their having /z/ sung those of others . Farther : Their songs were poured forth from the inspiration of the moment ; or only reposed in their memory . In the former case , they were , in the full sense of the word , improvisatori ; and , in the latter , they must necessarily have remained in some measure improvisatori , for they lived in an age , which , even if it possessed the alphabet , seems never to have thought of committing poems to writing . The epic poetry of the Greeks did not continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very probable , that such was its origin . Lastly : Although the song was sometimes accompanied by a dance illustrative of its subject , imitative gestures are never attributed to the bard himself . There are dancers for that . Epic poetry and the ballet can thus be united ; but the union was not essential , and probably took place only in the histories concerning the gods. * This union was very natural . Under the southern skies of Europe , no proper melody is required for the imitative dance , it is only necessary that the time should be distinctly marked . When the bard did this with his lyre , the dancers , as well as himself , had all that they required . This heroic poetry , which was so closely interwoven with social life , that it could be spared at no cheering banquet , was common no doubt throughout all Hellas . We hear its strains in , the island of the Phaeacians , no less than in the dwellings " of Ulysses and Manelaus . The poet does not bring before us strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of emulation was strong , and that some believed themselves already perfect in their art , from the story * As in the story of the amour of Mars and Venus . Od. viii . HOMER . THE EPIC POETS . Ill of the Thracian Thamyris , who wished to contend with the muses , and was punished for his daring hy the loss of the light of his eyes , and the art of song. * Epic poetry emigrated with the colonies to the shores of Asia . When we remember , that those settlements were made during the heroic age , and that in part the sons and posterity of the princes , in whose halls at Argos and Mycenae its echoes had formerly been heard , were the leaders of those expeditions this will hardly seem doubtful and still less improbable . But that epic poetry should have first displayed its full glory in those regions , and should have raised itself to the sublimity and extent which it obtained ; was more than could have been expected . And yet it was so . Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lost in doubtful obscurity ; as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity , because they arose amidst darkness . The majestic stream of his song , blessing and fertilizing , flows like the Nile through many lands and nations ; like the sources of the Nile , its fountains will remain concealed . It can not be the object of these essays , to enter anew into these investigations , which probably have already been carried as far as the present state of criticism and learning will admit.J The modern inquirers can hardly be reproached with credulity , for nothing , which could be doubted , not even the existence of Homer himself , has been left unquestioned. *I1 . Cat . Nav . 102. f As Orestes and his descendants . Jit is hardly " necessary to refer to the Excursus of Heyne , on the last book of the Iliad , and the Prolegomena of Wolf . /z/ When once the rotten fabric of ancient belief was examined , no one of the pillars , on which it rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole building rested far more on the foundation of tradition , than of credible history ; but how far this foundation is secure , is a question , respecting which , the voices will hardly be able to unite . It seems of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible . If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight , we should not expect in it perfect light . The creations of genius remain always half miracles , because they are , for the most part , created far from the reach of observation . If we were in possession of all the historic testimonies , we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey ; for their origin , in all essential points , must have remained the secret of the poet . But we can , to a certain extent , explain howjimder the circu instances of those times , an epic poet could arise ; how he could elevate his mind ; and how he could become of such importance to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our inquiry should be directed . The age of Homer , according to all probability , was that in which the Ionian colonies flourished in the vigour of youth. * Their subsequent condition shows that this must have been so ; although history has not preserved for us any particular account on the subject It is easy to conceive , that in a country * The age of Homer is usually set about a century after the foundation of those colonies , about the year 950 before Christ . If it be true , that Lycurgus , whose laws were given about the year 880 , introduced his poems into Sparta , he can not be much younger . We must leave to others the prosecution of these inquiries . /q/ highly favoured by nature ; external circumstances could afford the poet many facilities , by means of the forms of social life , of which song was the companion . But the circumstances of the times afforded many greater advantages to poetic genius . The glimmerings of tradition were not yet departed . The expedition against Troy , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mature the traditions , that they offered the noblest subjects for national poems . Before that time , the heroes of the several tribes had been of importance to none but their tribe ; but those who were distinguished in the common undertaking against Troy , became heroes of the nation . Their actions and their sufferings awakened a general interest . Add to this , that these actions and adventures had already been celebrated by many of the early bards ; and that they had even then imparted to the whole of history the poetic character , which distinguished it . Time is always needed to mature tradition for the epic poet . The songs of a Phemius and aDemodocus , though the subjects of them were taken from that war , were but the first essays , which died away , as the ancient songs have done , in which the exploits of the crusaders were commemorated . It was not till three hundred years after the loss of the Holy Land , that the poet appeared who was to celebrate the glory of Godfrey , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed after Achilles and Hector fell in battle , before the Grecian poet secured to them their immortality . The language no less than the subject had been improved in this age . Although neither all its words nor its phrases were limited in their use by strict /z/ grammatical rules , it was by no means awkward or rough . It had for centuries been improved by the poets , and had now become a poetic language . It almost seemed more easy to make use of it in verse than in prose ; and the forms of the hexameter , of which alone the epic poet made use , are extrenrely simple. * The language voluntarily submitted to the poet , and there never was a tongue , in which inspiration could have poured itself forth with more readiness and ease . Under such circumstances it is intelligible , that when a sublime poetic genius arose among a people so fond of poetry and song as the lonians always were , the age was favourable to him ; although the elevated creations of his mind must continue to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times appear most remarkable and difficult of explanation ; how a poet could have first conceived the idea of so extensive a whole , as the Iliad and the Odyssey ; and how he could have composed them , how he could have executed works of such extent , and how those works could have been preserved , without the aid of writing . With regard to the first point , criticism has endeavoured to show , and has succeeded in showing , that these poems , especially the Iliad , possess by no means that perfect unity , which they were formerly believed to possess ; that rather many whole pieces have been interpolated or annexed to them ; and there hardly exists at present an inquiring scholar who can /q/ persuade himself , that we possess them both in the same state , in which they came from the hands of the poet . But notwithstanding the more or less frequent interpolations , each has but one primary action ; which , although it is interrupted by frequent episodes , could hardly have been introduced by any but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider either of these poems as a mere collection of scattered rhapsodies . It is certainly a gigantic step , to raise epic poetry to the unity of the chief action ; but the idea springs from the very nature of a narration ; and therefore it did not stand in need of a theory , which was foreign to the age ; genius was able of itself to take this step. * Herodotus did something similar in the department of history . We find it still more difficult to comprehend how works of this extent could have been planned and executed without the aid of an alphabet , and preserved , probably for a long time , till they were finally saved from perishing by being committed to writing . We will not here repeat at large , what has already been said by others ; that a class of singers , devoted * A more plausible objection is this : that even if it be conceded , that it was possible to invent and execute such large poems , they would have answered no end , as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a reply may be made to this . The Iliad and Odyssy could not be recited at a banquet . But there were public festivals and assemblies which lasted many days , and Herodotus read aloud the nine books of his history , in a succession of days at Olympia . The Iliad and Odyssey , which , when free from interpolations , were perhaps much shorter than they now are , may have been recited in the course of several days . And if we may be permitted to indulge in conjecture , why may they not have been designed for such occasions ? That the Greeks were accustomed to intellectual enjoyments , interrupted and afterwards continued , appears from the Tetralogies of the Dramatists in a later age . This is characteristic of a nation , which even in its pleasures desired something more than pastime , and always aimed at grandeur and beauty . /z/ exclusively to this business , could easily preserve in memory much more ; that the poems were recited in parts , and therefore needed to be remembered only in parts ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems had already been entrusted to writing , the rhapsodists still knew them so perfectly ( as we must infer from the Ion of Plato ) , that they could readily recite any passage which was desired . But let us be permitted to call to mind a fact , which has come to light since the modern inquiries respecting Homer , and which proves , that poems of even greater extent than the Iliad and the Odyssey can live in the memory and mouths of a nation . The Dschangariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in length , as much as it stands beneath them in merit ; * and yet it exists only in the memory of a people , which is not unacquainted with writing . But the songs of a nation are probably the last things which are committed to writing , for the very reason that they are remembered . But whatever opinions may be entertained on the origin of these poems , and whether we ascribe them to one author or to several , it will hardly be doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one age , which we call in a larger sense , the age of Homer . The * See on this subject B. Bergmann , Nomadische Streifereyen unter den Kalmycken . B. 2 , S. 213 , &c.; This Calmuck Homer flourished in ( he last century . He is said to have sung three hundred and sixty cantos ; but this number may be exaggerated . Of the singers , called Dschangartschi , it is not easy to find one , who knows more than twenty by heart . In the fourth part of his work , Mr. Bergmann has given us a translation of one of them , which is about equal in length to a rhapsody of Homer . It thus appears to be no uncommon thing for the Calmuck singers to retain in memory a poem quite as long as the Iliad or Odyssey . /q/ important fact is , that we possess them . Whatever hypothesis we may adopt on their origin and formation , their influence on the Grecian nation and on posterity remains the same . And these are the topics which claim our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek nation . No poet has ever , as a poet , exercised a similar influence over his countrymen . Prophets , lawgivers , and sages have formed the character of other nations ; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks . This is a trait in their character , which could not be wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy . When lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece , the work of the poet had already been accomplished ; and they paid homage to his superior genius . He held up before his nation the mirror , in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals , and to behold them reflected with purity and truth . His poems are founded on the first feelings of human nature ; on the love of children , spouse , and country ; on that passion which outweighs all others , the love of glory . His songs were poured forth from a breast , which sympathized with all the feelings of man ; and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which cherishes the same sympathies . If it is granted to his immortal spirit , from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth , to look down on his race , to see the nations from the fields of Asia , to the forests of Hercynia , performing pilgrimages to the fountain , which his magic wand caused to flow ; if it is permitted to him to overlook the whole harvest of grand , of elevat- /z/ ed , of glorious productions , which have been called into being by means of his songs ; wherever his immortal spirit may reside , nothing more can be required to complete his happiness . Wherever writing is known , where it is used for the purpose of preserving poems , and thus a poetic literature is formed , the muse loses her youthful freshness . Works of the greatest merit may still be produced ; but poetry exerts its full influence only so long as it is considered inseparable from song and recitation . The H omeric poems were therefore so far from having produced a less considerable effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , that the source of their strength lay in this very circumstance . They entered the memory and the soul of the nation . If we were better acquainted with the forms of social life , which were prevalent in the cities of Ionia , and with which poetry necessarily stood in the closest union , we should be able to judge more definitely of its effects . The nature of thingsseems to show , that there , as in the mother country , they must have been sung at festivals and assemblies , whether public or private . This custom was so deeply fixed in the nation , that it continued long after these poems were committed to writing , and were thus accessible to a reader , and in fact , that it was declamation , which continued to give them their full effect . We need but call to mind the remark , which Ion , the rhapsodist , makes to Socrates ; * ' * I see the hearers now weep and now rise in passion , and appear as if deprived of sensation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was divine in their art , had passed away , and /z/ when they sung only for money , could produce such effects , how great must have been their influence in the period of their greatest glory . Since the time of Homer , and chiefly through him , great changes in the relations of the class of bards necessarily took place ; and the traces of such changes are still distinct . Originally they sang only their own compositions , but now it became the custom to sing those of others , which they had committed to memory . In that part of Asia which was inhabited by Greeks , and especially at Chios , where Homer is said to have lived , * a particular school of bards was formed which , even among the ancients , were known by the name of the HomeridsB . Whether these consisted originally of the family relations of the poet , is a question of no interest ; it became the name of those rhapsodists , who sang the poems of Homer , or those attributed to him . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sang not their own works , but those of others ; and this appears to have been the first change , which was effected , though without design , by Homer . But we may find in the gradual progress of the cities , and the modes of living in them , a chief cause of a change in the rhapsodists , which could not be very advantageous for them . In these cities , there may have been houses * According to the well-known passage in the hymn to Apollo , cited by Thucydides iii . 104 . " A blind man ; he dwells on the rocky Chios ; and his songs are the first among men . " Even if this hymn be not by Homer ( the age of Thucydides esteemed it certainly his ) , it must have been composed in an age , which approached that of Homer . That Homer was an inhabitant of Chios , is an account , for the truth of which we have no guaranty but tradition .

Little confidence as we may place in the life of Homer attributed to Herodotus , and several other writings ; it is still remarkable , that all unite in describing the fortunes of the poet during his lifetime , as by no means splendid . But his songs continued to live , and , probably in the very first century after the poet , were carried by Lycurgus into the Peloponnesus ; and from the same school , other epic poets also started up , whose works have been swallowed by the stream of time.f A happy accident has preserved for us the general contents of a few of them ; J but , though these accounts are meagre , we may still infer from them , that even among the ancients , they were chiefly of interest to the professed student of literature , and that they never gained any * The . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which marked the decline of the poetry of chivalry . t The Cyclic poets , as they are called , who treated subjects of mythological tradition , or the cyclus of traditions respecting the Trojan expedition .

The contents of these poems , as here given , show , that no one of them can be compared , in point of plan , with the epopees-of Homer . But these poems also must for a long time have have been preserved by song alone ; for their authors , although some what youuger than Homer , still lived in times , when , according to all that we know , letters were but little used , or perhaps entirely unknown . /q/ claim to be called national poems . But the works of these , and so many others , of whom we know only the names , show how generally epic poetry was extended among the nation . After the epic language had once been perfected by Homer , it remained peculiar to this kind of poetry ; and when we read the works of much later poets , of Quintus , or of Nonnus , we might believe ourselves employed on authors many centuries older than they , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in which they lived . That the dialect of Homer remained the principal one for this class of poetry , had an important influence on Grecian literature . Amidst all the changes and improvements in language , it prevented the ancient from becoming antiquated , and secured it a place among the later modes of expression . This was a gain for the language and for the nation . With the dialect of Homer , his spirit continued in some measure to live among the epic poets . Language can not of itself make a poet ; but yet how much depends on language . If in those later poets we occasionally hear echoes of Homer , is it not sometimes his spirit which addresses us ? But his influence on the spirit of his countrymen was much more important , than his influence on their language . He had delineated the world of heroes in colours which can never fade . He had made it present to posterity ; and thus the artist and the tragic poet found a sphere opened for the employment of their powers of representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not have remained foreign to their countrymen . We do but touch on this subject , in order to say something on /z/ the point , which lies particularly within the circle of our inquiries ; the influence which Homer and the epic poets exercised on the political character of their countrymen . When we compare the scanty fragments which are still extant , respecting the circulation and preservation of the poems of Homer , it is remarkable that in Hellas itself , the lawgivers and rulers were the most active in making them known and in saving them from perishing . Lycurgus , we are told , was the first who introduced them into the Peloponnesus by means of the rhapsodists ; Solon esteemed the subject so important , that in his code of laws , he formed distinct regulations , in conformity to which it seems probable that the several rhapsodies were recited , not as before without method , but in their natural order by several rhapsodists , who relieved each other at intervals . All this prepared for the undertaking of Pisistratus ; who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged the poems of Homer , but gained a claim to the eternal gratitude of posterity , by committing them to writing. * This care in those illustrious men did not result from a mere admiration of poetry . That it was connected with their political views , if it needs such confirmation , appears from the circumstance , that Solon introduces it into his laws . Were we to form a judgment on this subject from the narrow views of our own times , it would seem strange , that they who founded or confirmed the government of a number , even a democracy , should have laboured to extend the * The passages in proof of this are collected and duly weighed in the Prolegomena of Wolf , p. 139 , &c.; /q/ productions of a bard , who was opposed to their principles , and declares his political creed without disguise ; * " no good comes of the government of the many ; let one be ruler , and one be king ; " and in whose works , as we have already remarked , republicanism finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their object was not to confirm , by means of the poet , their own institutions and their own laws . They desired to animate their nation with a love for excellence and sublimity . Poetry and song , indissolubly united , seemed to them the fittest means of gaining that end . These had the greatest influence on the intellectual culture of the people . And if that culture lay within the sphere of the Grecian lawgivers ( and it always did , though in different degrees ) , of what importance in their eyes must that poet have been , whose poems , above all others , were recited by the class of rhapsodists , that lent a glory to the national festivals and assemblies ? Solon , himself one of the first of moral poets , could not but perceive , how much experience and knowledge of the world are contained in those books , with which youth is begun , and to which age returns . No fear was entertained , lest the narrations respecting the gods should be injurious to morals ; although that fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher , who but for Homer , never could have become Plato . For , as we have already remarked , the gods were not held up as models for imitation . But whilst the people was enriching itself with that infinite treasure of practical wisdom , it continued at the same time to live in a world of heroes , /z/ and to preserve a taste for objects of beauty . It is impossible to estimate the consequences which resulted from this , the gain of the nation as a nation , by the encouragement of its warlike spirit , by the preservation of its love of liberty and independence . In one respect , those lawgivers were unquestionably in the right ; a nation , of which the culture rested on the Iliad and Odyssey , could not easily be reduced to a nation of slaves . /q/ /z/ THE Greeks , though divided at home , and extended widely in foreign countries , always considered themselves as forming but one nation . The character of the Hellenes was no where obliterated ; the citizen of Massilia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athenian . The name barbarian , although it was applied to all who were not Greeks , conveyed a secondary idea , which was closely interwoven with the Grecian character ; that they esteemed themselves more cultivated than the rest of the world . It was not that gross kinjl of national pride , which despises all foreigners because they are foreigners ; even where it was in itself unjust , its origin was a just one . But this higher culture could never have remained a bond of national union , the different tribes of the Hellenes possessed it in such different degrees . External marks were therefore needed . These were afforded by two things ; by language , and certain institutions sanctioned by religion . Various and different as were the dialects of the Hellenes , * and these differences existed not only among the various tribes , but even among the several neighbouring cities , they yet acknowledged in their language , that they formed but one * See what Herodotus says of the dialects of the Grecian cities in Asia ; /z/ nation , were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks , were described even by Homer , * as " men of other tongues ; " and yet Homer had no general name for the nation . But though the bond of a common language may be a natural and an indissoluble one , something more is required to make it serve as the bond of national union . The language must be not merely the instrument of communicating thoughts ; for it is that to every savage ; something must exist in it , which may be regarded as the common property of the nation , because it is precious and dear to them ; the works of poets , and next to them , of prose writers , which are admired , listened to , and read by all . It is such productions which make a language peculiarly valuable to a nation . The national spirit , and manner of thinking and feeling , are expressed in them ; the nation beholds in them its own portrait ; and sees the continuance of its spirit among future generations secured . They form not only its common property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the word , has its undisputed share ; they form its most sublime , its noblest , its least perishable property . In what a light , therefore , do Homer , and those who trod in his footsteps appear , when they are considered from this point of view . Their poems , listened to and admired by all who used the Greek language , reminded the inhabitants of Hellas , of Ionia , and of Sicily , in the liveliest manner , that they were brothers . When we consider the long series of ages , during which the poems of Homer and the Homeridse were the only common possession of the Hellenes , it may even be made a question , whether without them they H. ii . 867 , /q/ would have remained a nation . National poetry was therefore the bond , which held them together ; but this bond was strengthened by another ; by that of religion . Unlike the religions of the East , the religion of the Hellenes was supported by no sacred books , was connected with no peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former , to unite a nation by means of a common religious creed ; but it was fitted for gaining that end , in so far as the external rites of religion afforded opportunities . But as the nation had no cast of priests , nor even a united order of priesthood , it naturally followed , that though individual temples could in a certain degree become national temples , this must depend , for the most part , on accidental circumstances ; and where every thing was voluntary , nothing could be settled by established forms like those which prevailed in other countries . The temples at Olympia , Dclos , and Delphi , may justly be denominated national temples , although not in the same sense in which we call those of the Jews and the Egyptians national ; but their effects were perhaps only more considerable and more secure , because every thing connected with them was voluntary . The fruits of civilization came forth , and were matured , under the protection of these sanctuaries also ; though not in the same manner as in Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national festivals , ! their oracles , and their Amphictyonic assemblies , other ideas are connected with them , than in other countries . But while we enumerate them individually , let it not /z/ be forgotten , that all these fruits ripened on one and the same branch ; that they , therefore , closely united , could ripen only together ; that by this very means they gained a higher value in the eyes of the nation ; and that this value must be estimated by their influence , rather than by what they were in themselves . We shall hardly be mistaken , if we consider those sanctuaries the most ancient , which were celebrated for their oracles . Those of Dodona and Delphi were declared to be so by the voice of the nation ; and both of them , especially that of Delphi , were so far superior to the rest , that they are in some measure to be esteemed as the only national oracles. * We leave to others all farther investigation of these institutions ; the question which claims our attention , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union of the nation . They did not effect this by being regarded as intended only for the Hellenes . Foreigners also were permitted to consult the oracles ; and to recompense the answers which they received by consecrated presents . But this took place only in individual cases ; and was done probably by none but rulers and kings , from the time when Alyattes first made application at Delphi . f In other cases , the difference of language was alone sufficient to keep *Tbe number of Grecian oracles , constantly increasing , became , as is well known , exceedingly numerous . With the exception of that of Dodona , which was of Egj ptio-Pelasgic origin , ihe oracles of the Greeks were almost exclusively connected with the worship of Apollo . We know of more than fifty of his oracles ; ( see Bulcnger de oraculis et vatibus , in Thes . Ant . Gr. vol. vii. ) of the few others , the more celebrated owed their origin to the same god , as those of Mopsus and Trophonius to whom he had imparted the gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Hellenes depended on the religion of Apollo . There is no want 01 learned compilations on these subjects ; but a wide field seems here to be opened to the philosophic historian . t Herod , i. 19. /q/ foreigners away , as the Pythian priestess spoke always in Greek . These institutions belonged , if not exclusively , yet principally to the Hellenes ; of whom both individuals and cities could always have access to them . They formed the connecting link between politics and the popular religion . Their great political influence , especially in the states of the Doric race , is too well known from history to make it necessary for us to adduce proofs of it . That influence doubtless became less after the Persian wars . Whether this diminution of influence was injurious or advantageous can not easily be decided . When the reciprocal hatred of the Athenians and Spartans excited them to the fury of civil war , how much suffering would have been spared to Greece , if the voice of the gods had been able to avert the storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the concern of the Grecian nation ; and even after infidelity had usurped the place of the ancient superstition , the violation of the sanctuary gave the politicians a pretence , sufficient to kindle a civil war , which was destined to cost Greece its liberties . Among the numerous festivals which the several Grecian cities were accustomed to celebrate , there were some , which from causes that are no longer well known , or were perhaps quite accidental , soon became really national . At these , foreigners could be spectators ; but the Hellenes alone were permitted to contend for the prizes . The right to do so belonged to the inhabitant of the farthest colony , as well as of the mother country , and was esteemed inalienable and invaluable . Even princes were proud of the privilege , for which the Persian king himself would have sued in vain , /z/ of sending their chariots to the races of Olyinpia . Every one has learned from the hymns of Pindar , that , beside the Olympic contests , the Pythian games at Delphi , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the same class . As to the origin of these games , Homer does not make mention of them , which he would hardly have neglected to do , if they had existed or been famous in his day . Yet the foundation of them was laid in so remote a period of antiquity , that it is attributed to gods and heroes . Uncertain as are these traditions , it is remarkable , that a different origin is attributed to each one oC-them . Those of Olympia were instituted by Hercules , on his victorious return , and were designed as contests in bodily strength ; those of Delphi were in their origin nothing but musical exercises ; although others were afterwards added to them . Those of Nemea were originally funeral games ; respecting the occasion of instituting those of the Isthmus , there are different accounts. * But whatever may have been the origin of the games , they became national ones . This did not certainly take place at once ; and we should err , if we should apply the accounts given us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the earlier ages . On the contrary , from the accurate registers which were kept by the judges , we learn most distinctly , with respect to these games , that they gained their importance and character by degrees , f They have not forgotten to mention , when * All the passages on the origin and the arrangements of the games , may he found collected in Schmidtii Prolegomenis ad Pindarum ; Potter 's Archa-ologia ; and Corsini Disertiones agomslicae ; and others . t See Pausanias in EHacis , 1 . v. 9. /q/ the different kinds of contests ( for at first there were none but in racing ) , were permitted and adopted . But still these games gained importance , although it was only by degrees ; and the time came , when they merited to be celebrated by a Pindar . In this manner , therefore , these festivals and the games connected with them , received a national character . They were peculiar to the Grecians ; and on that account also were of great utility . " Those are justly praised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous assemblies , and thus made it customary for us to come together as allies , having set aside our hostilities ; to increase our friendship by recalling our relationship in our common vows and sacrifices ; to renew our ancient family friendships , and to form new ones . They have provided , that neither the unpolished nor the well educated should leave the games without profit ; but that in this assembly of the Hellenes in one place , some may display their wealth , and others observe the contests , and none be present without a purpose , but each have something of which to boast ; the one part , while they see those engaged in the contests making exertions on their account ; the other , when they consider that all this concourse of people has assembled , to be spectators of their contests. 77 The accounts which we read of the splendor of these games , especially of the Olympic , where the nation of the Hellenes appeared in its glory , give a high idea of them . And yet it was public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown of victory its value . The glory of being conqueror /z/ in them , was the highest with which the Grecian was acquainted ; it conferred honour , not only on him who won the palm , but on his family and on his native city . He was not honoured in Olympia alone ; his victory was the victory of his native place : here he was solemnly received ; new festivals were instituted on his account ; he had afterwards a right of living at the public charge in the prytanea . A victory at Olympia , says Cicero with truth , * rendered the victor illustrious , no less than his consulate the Roman consul . The tournaments of the middle age were something similar ; or might have become something similar , if the relations of society had not prevented . But as a distinct line of division was drawn between the classes , they became interesting to but one class . Birth decided who could take a part in them , and who were excluded . There was nothing of that among the Hellenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contest for the branch of the sacred olive-tree , as well as Alci blades , or even the ruler of Syracuse with all the splendor of his equipage . The influence on the political relations of the Grecian states , was perhaps not so great as Isocrates represents . A solemnity of a few days could hardly be sufficient to cool the passions and still the mutual enmities of the several tribes . History mentions no peace , which was ever negotiated , and still less which was ever concluded at Olympia . But so much the greater was the influence exercised over the culture of the nation ; and if the culture of a nation Cicero . Quawt . Tusc. ii . 17. /q/ decides its character , our plan requires of us to pause and consider it . In all their institutions , when they are considered in the light in which the Greeks regarded them , we shall commonly find proofs of the noble dispositions of the Hellenes . And these are to be observed in the games , where every thing , which was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing , wrestling , and running ; the splendor of opulence , as displayed in the equipages for the charlP ot races ; excellence in poetry , and soon also in other intellectual productions , were here rewarded with their prize . But the degree of importance assigned to the productions of mind was not every where the same . Musical contests , * in which the Greeks united poetry , song , and music , were common in those larger games , as well as in those hardly less splendid ones , which were instituted in the several cities . But there was a difference in their relative importance . At Olympia , though they were not entirely excluded , they were yet less essential ; f they formed from the beginning the primary object in the Pythian games . They held the same rank in several * The Greeks made a distinction between iyun ; yuftvixet and fitvffi*l . The former relate to the exercises of the body ; the latter to the works of genius ; that is , to poetry and whatever was connected with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks to institute prizes for competitors in the arts of design ; at least not in poetry . Pliny , however , mentions a competition of painters , xxxv. 35 . ; The cause of this may in part be , that those arts were not so soon brought to perfection as the former ones ; but I hardly doubt that the cause was rather that the Greeks conceived it proper to institute competition only in those arts , of which the results were temporary ; and not in those , of which the productions are exhibited in public , and are lasting ; for in them , as in sculpture for example , there is a constant exhibition , and therefore a constant emulation . t See the instructive Versuch von den muMcalischen Wettstreiten der Alten , which is to be found in Der neuen Bibl. der Scuonen Wissenschaften , vn. /z/ festivals of the smaller cities , in the Panathensea at Athens , in Delos , * at Epidaurus , Ephesus , and other places . But even where no actual competition took place , every one who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the productions of art . The rhapsodist and the performer on the flute , the lyric poet , the historian , and the orator , had each his place . The hymns of Pindar were chanted in honour of the victors , not in emulation of others ; Aid Herodotus had no rival , when he read the books of his history at Olympia . The bosom of the Hellenes was large enough to afford room for the reception of every thing which was glorious and beautiful , and it was especially at Olympia and Delphi , that the observer of the character of the Greeks could justly break forth in exclamations of admiring astonishment . The Amphictionic assemblies , as they were called by the Grecians , appear to have exercised a still greater influence on political union , f Under that name the assemblies are signified , which were held in some common temple by several tribes which occupied the territory round it , or by neighbouring cities , in order to consult on the affairs connected with the sanctuary , and on others of a more general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gymnastic exercises soon came to be connected , were the most ancient Ionic national games ; as Thucydidcs , iii . 104 , has already proved from the Homeric hymn to Apollo . They were originally connected with the service of that god , and were communicated with it by the lonians to the Dorians . Hence they were not regarded at Olympia , iN'emea , and on the Isthmus , as forming an essential part of the solemnity . f The Greek word is sometimes spelt HpQun'iom , those , who dwell round about , sometimes dftfmrutns from the hero Amphictyon , called by tradition the founder of the same . /q/ It was therefore characteristic of these assemblies , first , that a temple or sanctuary formed their central point ; farther , that several tribes or cities participated in them ; thirdly , that assemblies of the people , festivals , and , of course , games were connected with them ; and fourthly , that besides these popular assemblies and festivals , deputies under various names , ( Theori , Pylagorae ) were sent by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of common interest . We shall be able to see these institutions in their true light , after taking a view of the origin of temples in Greece . As soon as the manners of cities were distinctly formed with the Greeks , and the individual cities in the mother country , no less than in the colonies , had for the most part become rich by means of commerce and industry in the arts , temples were built by single towns . Beside this , as we shall show more fully in another place , the luxury of the public was connected almost exclusively with these temples , and they were to serve as the measure of the splendor and wealth of the respective cities . The building of temples , therefore , became , especially after the Persian wars , and even a century before them , a matter , in which the honour of the cities was concerned , and their public spirit was to be exhibited . In this manner that multitude of temples arose , which still present , in their numerous ruins , masterpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so in the earliest times . The building of a temple was then commonly a joint undertaking ; partly because these temples , however much they may have been inferior to the /z/ later ones , * were still too costly to be borne by the separate communities ; and partly and chiefly because such common sanctuaries were needed for celebrating the common festivals of each tribe . Such a sanctuary formed in some measure a point of union . It was an object of common care ; it became necessary to watch over the temple itself , its estates , and its possessions ; and as this " could not be done by the several communities at large , what was more natural , than to depute envoys for the purpose ? But in a nation , where every thing was freely developed , and so little was fixed by established forms , it could not but happen , that other affairs of general interest should occasionally be discussed ; either at the popular festivals , or in the assemblies of the delegates ; and that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , as branches of the same nation . They became therefore the points of political union ; the idea of a formal alliance was not yet connected with them , but might be expected from their maturity . We find traces of such Amphictyonic assemblies in Greece itself , and in the colonies . f Their origin , * See what Pausanias , x. p. 810 , says of the temples , which were successively built at Delphi . t A catalogue of them , which might perhaps be enlarged , has been given by St. Croix , Des ancient Gourernements federatift , p. 115 , etc . We follow him , as it will afford at the same time , proofs of what has been said above . There was such an Amphictyonia in Bceotia , at Orchestus , in a temple of Neptune ; in Attica , in a temple , of which the same is not mentioned ; at Corinth , on the isthmus , in the temple of Neptune ; in the island Calauria , near Argolis , also in a temple of Neptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juno ' H7 ) ; in Blis , in a temple of Neptune ; also on tlift Grecian islands ; in Eubcea , in the temple of Diana Amaurusia ; in Delos , in the temple of Apollo , the Panegyris , of which we have already made mention , and which served for all the neighbouring islands ; in Asia , the Panio /q/ especially in the mother country , is very ancient ; and we may in most cases assert , and with justice , that it belongs to the period , when the republican forms of government were not yet introduced , and the constitutions of the tribes were in vigour . For we find that those who shared in them , were much more frequently influenced to assemble by tribes than by cities . And this affords an obvious reason , why they lost their influence as the nation advanced in culture , except where peculiar causes operated to preserve them . In the flourishing period of Greece , most of them had become mere antiquities , which were only occasionally mentioned ; or , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( and popular festivals are always longest preserved ) , they were but bodies without soul . This result was a necessary one , since , on the downfall of the constitutions of the tribes , the whole political life of the nation was connected with the cities , the spirit of the tribes had become annihilated by the spirit of the cities , and each of the cities had erected its own temples . Yet of these Amphictyonic councils , one rose to a higher degree of importance , and always preserved a certain measure of dignity ; so that it was called , by way of eminence , the Amphictyonic council . This was the one held at Delphi and Thermopylae. * When we bear in mind the ideas which have just been nium at Mycale , afterwards at Ephesus , for the lonians ; the temple of Apollo Trioplus for the Dorians ; for the Eolians , the temple of Apollo Grynasus . Even the neighbouring Asiatic tribes , the Carians and the Lycians , had similar institutions , either peculiar , or adopted of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abovementioned author . ' According to Strabo , ix.p 289 , it does not appear that the assembly was held alternately at Delphi and Thermopylae ; but the deputies first came together at Thermopylae to sacrifice to Ceres ; and then proceeded to Delphi , where business was transacted. /z/ illustrated , we shall hardly be led to expect , that the nation , in its whole extent , would ever have been united by any common bond ; and still less that this bond should have been more closely drawn with the progress of time , and finally have united all the Grecian states in one political body . But this Amphictyonic assembly contributed much to the preserving of national feeling and national union , and as such deserves to be considered by us with more attention . Strabo concedes , * that even in his time it was impossible to ascertain the origin of the Amphictyonic assembly ; this however was certain , that it belonged to remote antiquity . We must here remark , that Homer does not make any mention of it ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his silence affords no proof that it did not exist , we may at least infer , that the council was not then so important as it afterwards came to be . The causes which made this Amphictyonia so much superior to all the rest , are not expressly given ; but should we err , if we were to look for them in the ever increasing dignity and influence of the Delphic oracle ? When we call to mind the great importance attached to the liberty of consulting this oracle , scarcely a doubt on the subject can remain . The states which were members of this Amphictyonia , had no exclusive right to that privilege ; but had the care of the temple , and therefore of the oracle , in their hands.J No ancient writer has preserved for us so accurate an account of the regulations of that institution , that all important * Mrabo. c 1 . t II . is. 404 , 4O5 . Homer calls it Pytho . Individual states obtained the right of being the first to consult the oracle , TM*ri/ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATIONAL CHARACTEft. 139 questions respecting them can be answered ; and those who speak of them do not agree with each other . But from a comparison of their statements , we may infer , that though this Amphictyonia did not by any means embrace the whole of the Hellenes , yet the most considerable states of the mother country and of Asia Minor took part in it . According to JEschines , * there were twelve of them , ( although he enumerates but eleven ) ; Thessalians , Boeotians , ( not the Thebans only , he expressly remarks ) ; Dorians , lonians , Perrhsebians , Magnesians , Phthiotians , Maleans , f Phocians , ( Etaeans , Locrians ; the twelfth state was probably that of the inhabitants of Delphi themselves . Every city belonging to these tribes , had the right of sending deputies ; the smallest had an equal right with the largest ; and the votes of all were equal ; of the lonians , says /Eschines , the deputies from Eretria in Eubcea and from Priene in Asia Minor , ! were equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dorium in Laconia , and from Cytinium on Parnassus , had as much weight as those from Lacedaemon . But the votes were not counted by cities , but by * schines de Falsa Legatione iii . p. 285 , ed . Reisk . This is the most important passage . St. Croix , p. 27 , has compared the discrepant accounts of Pausanias x. p. 815 , and Harpocration v. AfttfiKruatm . The authority of JLschines , respecting his own times , seems to me of more weight than all the others ; and therefore I follow him alone . No one had better means of information than he . But many changes in the regulations were subsequently made by the Macedonians and the Romans . t The four last were all in Thessaly . The reason of their being thus distinguished from the rest of the Thessalians is probably to be found in the privilege , which they had preserved , of a separate vote . Herodotus vii , 132 , divides them in the same manner . J It is therefore certain , that the individual colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the question , whether all the Asiatic colonies , and whether colonies in other regions , did the same . /z/ tribes ; each tribe had two votes , and the majority decided. * And how large was the sphere of action , in which this assembly was accustomed to exert its influence ? Its first duty was to take charge of the temple ; its property ; its presents , the offerings of piety ; its sanctity . From this it naturally follows , that the assembly possessed judiciary powers . Persons who had committed sacrilege on the temple , were summoned before its tribunal , where judgment was passed and the acts of penance and punishment decreed.f But to these , political objects were added at a very early period ; such as the preservation of peace among the confederates , and the accommodating of contentions , which had arisen . We have , it is true , no proof , that those who participated in the assembly , considered themselves as nearly allied to each other ; but it is as little doubtful , that under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffused , which might be considered as forming , in some measure , the foundation of a system of national law , although it was never brought to maturity . Of this ve have indisputable proof in the ancient oaths , which were taken by all the members of the assembly , and which have been preserved by /Eschines.J " I *For all farther knowledge which we have of the regulations of the Amphictyonic council , we are indebted to Strabo ix . p. 289 .

" This form of oath , it can not be doubted , was very ancient , and expresses with sufficient clearness , the original objects of the confederation . But it shows equally distinctly , that the attainment of these ends depended much more on the circumstances and condition of the age , than on the members of the council themselves .

The institutions which we have just described , preserved , in a certain degree , the national spirit ; but they were by no means sufficient to produce political union ; to which any tendency was counteracted by the whole condition and internal relations of the nation . Even the colonies were unfavourable to it ; not only by their distance , but still more by the independence which they enjoyed . In our days , how soon do colonies which become independent , grow estranged from the mother countries , after having long stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which preceded the Trojan war , * the Grecian states , excepting the Asiatic cities , which languished under the Persian yoke , had in many respects made advances in culture .

Above all , Athens had shaken off the Pisistratidae , and came off victorious from the contest which it had been obliged to sustain for its liberty .

The islands , no less than the continent , were in a flourishing condition : their independence stood at that time in no danger from the Persians or the Athenians . Samos never saw an age like that of Polycrates , who trembled at his own prosperity ; the small island of Naxus could muster eight thousand heavy-armed men ; the inconsiderable Siphnus , very much enriched by its gold mines , deemed it expedient to consult the Pythian oracle on the duration of its fortunes . U The cities of Magna Graecia , Tarentum , Croton , and Sybaris , ** had attained the period of their splendor : in Sicily , Syracuse , although disturbed by internal dissensions , was yet so powerful , that Gelon , its ruler , claimed in the Persian wars the chief command of all the Grecian forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The year 584 before Christ . % From about the year 600 B.

Yet Sybaris was destroyed just before the Persian wars , by the Crotoniatae. /q/ of Gaul ; Cyrene was established on the coast of Lybia . But some grand object of common interest still was wanting ; and as the Spartans were already jealous of Athens , it was the more to be feared , that the consciousness of increasing strength would lead to nothing but the mutual ruin of the cities in civil wars . The Persian wars supplied the object which was needed . Although they by no means resulted in the establishment of that general union of the whole nation of the Hellenes , of which a great man had formed the idea without believing in the possibility of realizing it ; the whole condition of Greece in succeeding ages , its foreign and domestic relations , were all a consequence of them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert , that the political character of Greece was formed by them . There never was any general union of the Greeks against the Persians ; but the idea of such a confederation had been called up ; and was , if not entirely , yet in a great measure carried into effect . What is more arduous , than in times of great difficulty , when every one fears for himself , and is chiefly concerned for self preservation , to preserve among a multitude of small states , that public spirit and union , in which all strength consists . The Athenians were left almost alone to repel the first invasion of Darius Hystaspes ; but the glory won at Marathon was not sufficient to awaken general enthusiasm , when greater danger threatened from the invasion of Xerxes . All the Thessalians , the Locrians , and Bosotians , except the cities of Thespise and Plateae , sent earth and water to the Persian king at the first call to submit ; although /z/ these tokens of subjection were attended by the curses of the rest of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be devoted to the deity of Delphi. * Yet of the rest of the Greeks , who did not favour Persia , some were willing to assist only on condition of being appointed to conduct and command the whole ; f others , if their country could be the first to be protected ; others sent a squadron , which was ordered to wait till it was certain which side would gain the victory ; $ and others pretended they were held back by the declarations of an oracle . So true is the remark of Herodotus , that , however ill it might be taken by others , he was constrained to declare , that Greece was indebted for its freedom to Athens.il Athens , with Themistocles for its leader , gave life to the courage of the other states ; induced them to lay aside their quarrels ; yielded , where it was duty to yield ; ** and always relied on its own strength , while it seemed to expect safety from all .

In the actions of men , greatness is seldom or never quite unmixed with meanness ; and he who investigates the actions of those times with care , will find many and various proofs of it . And yet in the whole compass of history , we can find no series of events , which deserve to be compared with the grand spectacle , then exhibited ; and with all the exaggerations of the orators and poets the feeling of pride , with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small country had withstood the attack of half a continent ; it had not only saved the most costly possessions , which were endangered , its liberty , its independence ; it felt itself strong enough to continue the contest , and did not lay aside its arms , till it was permitted to prescribe the conditions of peace . The price of that peace was the emancipation of the Greek colonies in Asia , from the Persian yoke . Twenty years before the invasion of Xerxes , when those cities had attempted to throw off the supremacy of the Persians , the Athenians had boldly ventured to send a squadron with troops to reinforce them ; and that expedition occasioned the burning of Sardis , which was the capital of the Persian dominions in Asia Minor . " These ships , " says Herodotus , f /z/ " were the origin of the wars between the Hellenes and the barbarians . " This interference was deeply resented by the Persians ; and their resentment would have been reasonable , if they had possessed the right of reducing free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copious narration of the ill success of the revolt , and of the manner , in which Miletus suffered for it . Even in the subsequent expeditions of the Persians against Europe , the ruling idea was the desire of taking revenge on Athens ; and when Xerxes reduced that city to ashes , he may have found in it no small degree of satisfaction. * But when the victory remained in the hands of the Greeks , they continued with spirit a war , which for them was no longer a dangerous one ; and if the emancipation of their countrymen became from that time nothing more than an ostensible reason , f it was still a proof of the reviving national spirit . When the war after fifty-one years was terminated by the first peace with the Persians , it was done under the conditions , that the Grecian cities in Asia should be free ; that the troops of the Persians should keep two days ' march distant from them ; and that their squadron should leave the jEgean sea. $ In a similar manner , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more recent age , prescribed the conditions of peace to the ruler of both the Indies , and blockaded the * Herod , viii . 64. fThe Asiatic Greeks , however , during the expedition of Xerxes , in which they were compelled to take a part with their ships , had entreated the Spartans and Athenians to free them . t In the year 449 B. C. Plutarch in Cimon.Op. iii . p. 202 , quotes the decree of the people , conraining the conditions . /q/ months of his rivers , while it preserved the ocean open to itself . Thus the people of Hellas , by means of this war , appeared among the nations in the splendor of victory . They were now permitted to look around in tranquil security ; for who would venture to attack them ? The eastern world obeyed the humbled Persian ; in the North , the kingdom of Macedonia had not yet begun its career of conquest ; and Italy , still divided into small states , did not as yet contain a victorious republic . The period was therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigour ; poetry and the fine arts put forth their blossoms ; the philosophic mind contemplate itself in tranquillity ; and in public spirit , the several cities vie with each other in generous competition . A nation does not need peace and tranquillity , to become great ; but it needs the consciousness that it is possessed of strength , to gain peace and tranquillity . The Persian wars gave a character , not only to the relations of Greece with foreign countries , but also to its internal condition ; and were of hardly less importance to the nation by means of the latter , than of the former . During that contestj the idea of a supremacy , or ytfMvicty as the Greeks termed it , entrusted to one state over the rest , or usurped by that state , became current throughout Greece . Even before the Persian war , the idea had been faintly expressed ; Sparta had always , as the strongest of the Dorian tribes , claimed a sort of supremacy over the Peloponnesus ; and had in some measure /z/ deserved it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * In the common opposition , made by so many of the Grecian cities , to the attack of Xerxes , the want of a general leader was felt ; but according to the Grecian rules , this command could not so well be committed to one man , as to one stdte . We have already observed , that several laid claims to it ; those of Syracuse were at once rejected ; and Athens was at once prudent and generous enough to yield . At that time , therefore , the honour was nominally conferred on Sparta ; it was actually possessed by the state , of which the talents merited it ; and Sparta had no Themistocles . But Athens soon gained it nominally also ; when the haughtiness of Pausanias had exasperated the confederates ; and Sparta was deprived by his fall of the only man , who in those days could have reflected any lustre upon the state , f *Thucyd. i. 18.76. f Of this ' we have accurate accounts in Thticydides , i. 95 . The Spartans , Athenians , and many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byzantium , 470 years before Christ . Offended with Fausanias ( who about this time was recalled by Sparta herself ) , the allies , especially the lonians , entreated the Athenians , as being of a kindred tribe , to assume the supreme command . Those who were of the Peloponnesus , took no part in this act . The Athenians were very willing to comply with the request ; and the confederates never received another Spartan general . From this account , the following points are to be inferred : 1 . The Athenians obtained the same chief command , which had been exercised by the Spartans. 2 . The states which conferred that command on Athens , must have been islands and maritime towns , as the whole expedition was a naval one . 3 . Although not all who shared in it , were lonians , yet the relationship of tribes Iiad a great influence on the choice . 4 . The command conferred on the Athenians , embraced therefore by no means all the Grecian cities , nor even all , which had been united against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other states of the interior took no part in the matter . /q/ In this manner , Athens was placed at the head of a large part of Greece , confederated against Persia ; and from this moment its supremacy begins to have a practical importance for Greece . The circumstances under which this chief command was conferred on Athens , showed that nothing more was intended to be given , than the conduct of the war that was still to be continued with united efforts against the Persians . No government of the allied states , no interference in their internal affairs , was intended . But how much was included in the conduct of a war against a very powerful enemy from the very nature of the office ; and how much more for them who knew how to profit by it . As long as the war against the Persian king was continued , could it be much less than the control of all external affairs ? For in a period like that , what other relations could have employed the practical politics of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least intimately connected with that war ? And as for the grand questions respecting the duration of the war and the conditions of peace , did they not depend on those who stood at the head of the undertaking ? The first use which Athens made of this superior command , was the establishment of a general treasury , as well as a common fleet , for the carrying on of the war ; while it was fixed , which of the allies should contribute money and ships , and in what proportion . The Athenians , says Thucydides , * now first established the office of treasurers of Greece ; who were to collect the tribute , as the sums which were raised. , /z/ were denominated ( and names are not matters of indifference in politics ) ; the amount of which was then fixed at four hundred and sixty talents. * Yet to avoid every thing which could seem odious , the treasurer was not directly fixed at Athens , but at Delos , in the temple of Apollo ; where the assemblies also were held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just of the Grecians , Aristides , was appointed treasurer ; and the office of assigning to each state its proportion of the general contribution , was entrusted to him.f No one in those days made any complaint ; and Aristides died as poor as he had lived . Two remarks are here so naturally suggested , that they hardly need any proof ; the first is , that Athens , by means of this regulation , laid the foundation of its greatness ; the second is , that hardly any government , and how much less a popular government , could long withstand the temptation to abuse this power . But a third remark must be made in connexion with the preceding observation ; Athens gained the importance which she had for the woilcl , by means of her supremacy over the other sta , * . - It was that , which made her conspicuous in thy history of mankind . Tile importance which sheai ied , was immediately of a political nature ; hi every thing of a vast and noble character , for wh ? h Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will disguise no one of the abuses , of which the consequences were finally most fatal to Athens herself ; but we can not limit our view * Full $350,000. t Plutarch . Aristid . Op. ii . p. 535. /q/ to the narrow range adopted by those , who make the abuses the criterion of their judgment . The allies , by committing the conduct of the war to Athens , expressly acknowledged that city to be the first in Greece , and this was silently acknowledged by the other states ; for Sparta , which alone was able to rival it in strength , voluntarily withdrew into the background. * Athens had the consciousness of deserving this rank ; for the freedom of Greece had had its origin there . But it was desirous of preserving its high station , not by force alone ; but by showing itself to be the first in every thing , which according to the views of the Greeks could render a city illustrious . Its temples were now to be the most splendid ; its works of art the noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most costly . But for the supremacy of Athens , Pericles never could have found there a sphere of action worthy of himself ; no Phidias , no Polygnotus , no Sophocles could have flourished . For the public spirit of the Athenian proceeded from the consciousness , that he was the first among the G'reciJ ' * 5 an d nothing but that public spirit could have r- ? ed and rewarded the genius , which was capable r educing such works as theirs . Perhaps their very ness prepared the fall of Athens ; but if they were doo.oed to suffer for it , the gratitude due to them f , , om ma'akind , is not on that account diminished . The supremacy of Athens was , as the nature of the whole confederation makes apparent , immediately connected with its naval superiority ; for the allied states were all islands or maritime cities . Thus the /z/ expressions of supreme command ( riysfioviot ) and dominion of the sea , * that is , the dominion of the Sgean and Ionian seas ( for the ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signify the same thing . This dominion of the sea was therefore , in its origin , not only not blameahle , but absolutely essential to the attainment of the object proposed . The security of the Greeks against the attacks of the Persians depended on it ; and so too did the continuance of the confederacy . We can not acquit Athens of the charge of having afterwards abused her naval superiority j but he , who considers the nature of such alliances and the difficulty of holding them together , will concede , that in practice it would be almost impossible to avoid the appearance of abusing such a supremacy ; since the same things , which to one party seem an abuse , in the eyes of the other , are only the necessary means to secure the end . When the sea was made secure , and no attack was farther to be feared from the Persians , how could it be otherwise , than that the continuance of the war , and consequently the contributions made for that purpose , should be to many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some should feel themselves injured , or be actually injured in the contributions exacted of them . The consequences of all this were , on the one side a refusal to pay the contributions , and on the other , severity in collecting them ; t and as they continued to be refused , this was t " The Athenians , " says Thucydides i. 99 , " exacted the contributions with severity ; and were the more oppressive to the allies , as these were unaccustomed to oppression . " But if the Athenians had not insisted on the payment of them with severity , how soon would the whole confederacy have fallen into ruin . /q/ considered as a revolt , and wars followed with several of the allies ; at first with the island Naxos ; * then with Thasus , f with SamosJ and others . $ But those who had been overcome , were no longer treated as allies , but as subjects ; and thus the relation of Athens to the several states was different ; for a distinction was made between the voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay in money an equivalent for the ships , which they were bound to furnish ; for Athens found it more advantageous to have its ships built in this manner , at its own charge . But the matter did not rest here . The sum of the yearly tribute , fixed under Pericles at four hundred and sixty talents , was raised by AlcibiadesIT to six hundred . When , during the Peloponnesian war , Athens suffered from the want of money , the tribute was changed into duties of five per centum on the value of all imported articles , collected by the Athenians in the harbours of the allies. ** But the most oppressive of all , was perhaps the judiciary /z/ power , which Athens usurped over the allies ; not merely in the differences , which arose between the states , but also in private suits. * Individuals were obliged to go to Athens to transact their business , and in consequence , to the great advantage of the Athenian householders , innkeepers , and the like , a multitude of foreigners were constantly in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . . It is therefore obvious , that the nature of the Athenian supremacy was changed . It had been at first a voluntary association , and now it had become , for far the larger number of the states that shared in it , a forced one . That several of the confederates were continually striving to break free from the alliance , has been shown by the examples cited above ; but it is easy to perceive , how difficult , or rather how impossible it was , to effect a general union between them against Athens . If they had been desirous of attempting it , how great were the means possessed by Athens , of anticipating them . Yet there was one moment , when , but for their almost inconceivable want of forethought , an attempt might have justly been expected from them ; and that period was the close of the war with Persia . f The Greeks framed their articles in the treaty of peace ; and had nothing farther to fear from the Persians . The whole object of the confederacy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that any voices were then raised against Athens . On the other side , it may with propriety be asked , if justice did not require of the Athenians , to voluntarily restore to the allies their liberty . But this ' See , upon this subject , Xenopb. de Rep. Athen . Op. 94. ed . Leunclav. t In the year 449 befo.e Christ . /q/ question will hardly be put by a practical statesman . To free the allies from their subordination would have been to deprive Athens of its splendor ; to dry up a chief source of the revenues of the republic ; perhaps to pave the way to its ruin . What Athenian statesman would have dared to make such a proposition . Had he made it , could he have carried it through ? Would he not rather have ensured his own downfall ? There are examples where single rulers , weary of power , have freely resigned it ; but a people never yet voluntarily gave up authority over subject nations . Perhaps these remarks may contribute to rectify the judgments of Isocrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea ; f which he considered as the source of all the misery of Athens and of Greece . The views which he entertained were certainly just ; but the evils proceeded from the abuses ; and it were just as easy to show , that his celebrated Athens , but for that dominion , never would have afforded him a subject for his panegyrics . But how those evils could result from that abuse ; how they prepared the downfall of Athens , when Sparta appeared as the deliverer of Greece ; how the rule of these deliverers , much worse than that of the first oppressors , inflicted on Greece wounds , which * We shall be obliged to recur frequently to Isocrates . It is impossible to r ? ad the venerable orator , who was filled with the purest patriotism which a Grecian could feel , without respecting and loving him . But he was a political wetter , without being a practical statesman ; and , like St. Pierre and other excellent men of the same class , he believed much to be possible which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberation .

Steph. /z/ were not only deep , but incurable ; in general , the causes which produced the ruin of that country , remain to furnish a subject for investigation in one of the later chapters , to which we must make our way through some previous researches . /q/ /z/ IN the present chapter , we do not undertake to give an outline of the several Grecian states ; but rather to delineate the general characteristics of the Grecian forms of government . Such a general investigation seems the more essential , as it would obviously be impossible to analyze each one of them . With respect to a nation , in which every thing that could be done in public , was public ; where every thing great and glorious was especially the result of this public life ; where even private life was identified with that of the public ; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , this investigation must have a much higher degree of interest , than if it related to any other , in which the line of division is distinctly drawn between public and private life . He who will judge of the Grecians , must be acquainted with the constitutions of their states ; and he must not only consider the inanimate forms , as they are taught us by the learned compilers and writers on what are called Grecian Antiquities ; but regard them as they were regarded by the Greeks themselves . If the remark , which we made above , * that the Grecian states , with few exceptions , were cities with their districts , and their constitutions , therefore , the constitutions of cities ; if this remark needed to be /z/ farther confirmed , it could be done by referring to the fact , that the Greeks designate the ideas of state and of city by the same word. * We must therefore always bear in mind the idea of city constitutions , and never forget that those of which we are treating , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empires of modern times , but not even with those of the smaller principalities . If for the sake of giving a distinct representation , we were to compare them with any thing in modern history , we could best compare them , as the character of the Italian cities of the middle age is hardly more familiar than that of the Grecian , with the imperial towns in Germany , especially in the days of their prosperity , previous to the thirty years 7 war , before they were limited in the freedom of their movements by the vicinity of more powerful monarchical states ; were it not that the influence of the difference of religion created a dissimilarity . And yet this comparison may throw some light on the great variety , which is observed in those states , in spite of the apparent uniformity which existed among the Grecian states ( as all were necessarily similar in some respects ) , and which equally existed in those German cities . And the comparison will be still more justified , if we add , that the extent of territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole was nearly the same . There were few , which possessed a larger territory , than formerly belonged to Ulm and Nuremberg ; but in Greece as in Germany , the prosperity of the city did not depend Tlo.i ; , cirilas . Respecting the meaning of Wx/j , and the difference between - r'o , s and M , state , and nation , consult Aristot . Polit . Op. ii . p. 23-3. ed . Casaub. /q/ on the extent of its territory . Corinth hardly possessed a larger district than that of Augsburg ; and yet both rose to an eminent degree of opulence and culture . But great as this variety in the constitutions may have been ( and we shall illustrate this subject ? more fully hereafter ) , they all coincided in one grand point . They all were free constitutions ; that is , they allowed of no rulers , whom the people as a body , or certain classes of the people , could not call to account ; * he , who usurped such authority , was , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea is contained , that the state shall govern itself ; and not be governed by an individual ; and of course a very different view of the state was taken from the modern European notion . The view of the Greeks was entirely opposed to that of those modern politicians , who conceive of the state as a mere machine ; and of those also , who would make of it nothing but an institution of police . The Greeks regarded the state , no less than each individual , as a moral person . Moral powers have influence in it , and decide its plans of operation . Hence it becomes the great object of him who would manage a state , to secure to reason the superiority over passion and desire ; and the attainment of virtue and morality , is in this sense an object of the state , just as it should be of the individual . If with these previous reflections we proceed to investigate the laws of the Greeks , they will present themselves to our view in their true light . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderns , were framed by necessity , and developed by circumstances . But as abuses are much sooner felt in small states and towns , than in large ones , the necessity of reforms was early felt in many of them ; and this necessity occasioned lawgivers to make their appearance , much before the spirit of speculation had been occupied on the subject of politics . The objects therefore of those lawgivers , were altogether practical ; and , without the knowledge of any philosophical system , they endeavoured to accomplish them by means of reflection and experience . A commonwealth could never have been conceived of by them , except as governing itself ; and on this foundation they rested their codes . It never occurred to them , to look for the means of that self-government , to nothing but the forms of government ; and although those forms were not left unnoticed in their codes , yet they were noticed only to a certain degree . No Grecian lawgiver ever thought of abolishing entirely the ancient usage , and becoming , according to the phrase now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving laws , they only reformed . Lycurgus , Solon , and the rest , so far from abolishing what usage had established , endeavoured to preserve every thing which could be preserved ; and only added , in part , several new institutions , and in part made for the existing ones better regulations . If we possessed therefore the whole of the laws of Solon , we should by no means find them to contain a perfect constitution . But to compensate for that , they embraced , not only the rights of individuals , but also morals , in a much higher degree , than the latter can be embraced in the view of any /q/ modern lawgiver . The organization of private life , and hence the education of youth , * on which the prevalence and continuance of good morals depend , formed one of their leading objects . They were deeply convinced , that that moral person , the state , would otherwise be incapable of governing itself . To this it must be added , that in these small commonwealths , in these towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed , which could not be put into operation in a powerful and widely extended nation . Whether these regulations were always good , and always well adapted to their purpose , is quite another question ; it is our duty at present to show , from what point of view those lawgivers were accustomed to regard the art of regulating the state , and the means of preserving and directing it.f Whenever a commonwealth or city governs itself , it is a fundamental idea , that the supreme power resides with its members , with the citizens . But it may rest with the citizens collectively , or only with certain classes , or perhaps only with certain families . Thus there naturally arose among the Greeks that difference , which they designated by the names of Aristocracies and Democracies ; and to one of these two classes , they referred all their constitutions . But it is not easy to draw a distinct line between the two . W T hen we are speaking of the meaning which they bore in practical politics , we must beware of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the speculative politicians , by /z/ Aristotle* and others . In their practical politics , the Greeks no doubt connected certain ideas with those denominations ; but the ideas were not very distinctly defined ; and the surest way of erring would be , to desire to define them more accurately than was done by the Greeks themselves . The fundamental idea of democracy was , that all citizens , as such , should enjoy equal rights in the administration of the state ; and yet a perfect equality existed in very few of the cities . This equality was commonly limited to a participation in the popular assemblies and the courts . f A government did not cease to be a democracy , though the poorer class were entirely excluded from all magistracies , and their votes of less weight in the popular assemblies . On the other hand , an aristocracy always presupposed exclusive privileges of individual classes or families . But these were very different and various . There were hereditary aristocracies , where , as in Sparta , the highest dignities continued in a few families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly the richer and more distinguished class , which obtained the sole administration of the state ; and it was either wealth , or birth , or both together , that decided . But wealth consisted not so much in money , as in land ; and it was estimated by real estate . This wealth was chiefly exhibited , in ancient times , in the sums expended on horses . Those whose *lf here , in investigating the practical meaning of those words , we can make no use of the theoretical definitions of Aristotle in his Politics , we would not by nny means give up the right of citing him as of authority in the hislory of the Greek constitutions , in so far as he himself speaks of them . And whose testimony on these subjects deserves more weight than that of the man , who , in a work which has unfortunately been lost , described and analyzed all the known forms of government of his time , two hundred and fifty-five in number . f Aristot . Polit. iii . I t Aristot . Polit. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry of the citizens ; and these formed the richer part of the soldiery , which consisted only of citizens or militia . It is therefore easy to understand , how it was possible that the circumstance , whether the district of a city possessed much pasture land , could have had so much influence , in practical politics , on the formation of the constitution. * It was therefore these nobles , the Eupatridse and Optimates , who , though they did not wholly exclude the people from a shape in the legislation , endeavoured to secure to themselves the magistracies , and the seats in the courts of justice ; and wherever this was the case , there was what the Greeks termed an aristocracy.f In cities , where wealth is for the most part measured by possessions in lands , it is almost unavoidable that not only a class of great proprietors should rise up ; but that this inequality should constantly increase ; and landed estates come finally into the hands of a few families. ! In an age , when there were much fewer mechanic professions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , the consequences of this inequality were much more oppressive ; and it was therefore one of the chief objects of the lawgivers , either to prevent this evil , or , where it already existed , to remedy it ; as otherwise a revolution of the state would sooner or later have inevitably followed . * Aristotle cites examples of it in Eretria , Chalcis , and other cities . Polit. iv . 3. t Oligarchy was distinguished from this . But though bolh words were in use , no other line can be drawn between them , than the greater or smaller number of Optimates , who had the government in their hands . That this remark is a true one appears from the definitions , to which Aristotle , Polit . Hi . 7 , is obliged to have recourse , in order to divide them from one another . $ This was the rase in Thurii , Aristot . Polit. v. 7 /z/ In this manner we may understand why a new and equal division of the land among the citizens was made ; * why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only permitted in the way of inheritance and of marriage : f why a limit was fixed to the amount of land , which a single citizen could possess. : : But with all these and other similar precautions , it was not possible to hinder entirely the evil , against which they were intended to guard ; and hence were prepared the causes of those numerous and violent commotions , to which all the Grecian states were more or less exposed . In the constitutions of cities , however they may be formed , the right of citizenship is the first and most important . He who does not possess it , may perhaps live in the city under certain conditions , and enjoy the protection of its Iaws : $ but he is not , properly speaking , a member of the state : and can enjoy neither the same rights , nor the same respect , as the citizen . The regulations , therefore , respecting sharing in the right of citizenship , were necessarily strict ; but they were very different in the several Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were secured , if both the parents had been citizens ; in others , it was necessary to trace such a descent through two or three generations ; 1f whilst in * As in Sparta , by the laws of Lycurgus. t As in Sparta , and also among the Locrians , Aristot .

As , for example , at Athens . ' X-. in Larissa , Aristot . Polit. iii . 2 . So too in /q/ others , no respect was had , except to the descent of the mother. * There were some cities which very rarely and with difficulty could be induced to confer the right of citizenship ; whilst in others foreigners were admitted to it with readiness . In these cases , accidental circumstances not unfrequently decided ; and the same city was sometimes compelled to exchange its early ' and severe principles , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be too small . f In colonies , the milder principles were of necessity followed ; since there might arrive from the mother country a whole company of new emigrants , whom it would either be impossible or inexpedient to reject . And hence we may explain what is so frequently observable in the colonies , that the wards of the citizens were divided according to their arrival from the different mother countries ; one of the most fruitful sources of internal commotions , and even of the most violent political revolutions . In free cities , the constitution and the administration are always connected in an equally eminent degree with the division of the citizens . Birt here again we find a vast difference among the Greeks . Ve first notice those states , which made a distinction in the privileges of the inhabitants of the chief town , and of the villages and country . There were some Grecian states , where the inhabitants of the city enjoyed great privileges ; and the rest of their countrymen stood in a subordinate relation to *Aristot . Polit iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of foreigners into the class of citizens . /z/ them ; * whilst in others there was no distinction of rights between the one and the other , f The other divisions of the citizens were settled partly by birth , according to the ward to which a man happened to belong : partly from his place of residence , according to the district in which he resided ; $ and partly from property or the census , according to the class in which he was reckoned . Though not in all , yet in many states , the ward , and the place of residence , were attached to the name of each individual ; which was absolutely necessary in a nation , that had no family names , or where they at least were not generally introduced . There is no need of mentioning how important was the difference in fortune ; as the proportion of the public burden to be borne by each one was decided according to his wealth ; and the kind of service to be required in war , whether in the cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armour , was regulated by the same criterion ; as will ever be the case in countries , where there is no other armed force than the militia formed of the citizens . On these divisions of the citizens , the organization of their assemblies ( UxX/a* ) was founded . These assemblies , which were a natural result of city governments , were , according to the views of the Greeks , so essential an institution , that they probably existed in every Grecian city , though not always under the same regulations . Yet the manner in which they were held in every city except Athens and Sparta , is almost wholly unknown to us . The nature of the * Hence in Laconia , the difference between Spartans and Lacedaemonians ( i ? . ' ( . ( ) .

It was the custom to give to but one magistrate , the right of convoking and opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes were taken in the several cities , whether merely by polls , or by the wards and other divisions of the people . And in this too , there was a great difference , whether all citizens had the right of voting , or whether a certain census was first requisite. ! In most of the cities , regular assemblies seem to have been held on fixed days , and extraordinary meetings also to have been held.J To attend was regarded as the duty of every citizen ; and as the better part were apt to remain away , especially in stormy times , absence was often made a punishable offence . It may easily be supposed , that the decisions were expressed in an established form , written down and preserved , and sometimes engraved on tables . But although the forms were fixed , the subjects which might come before the assembly , were by no means so clearly defined . The principle which was acted upon , was , that subjects which were important for the community , were to be brought before it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is not important . How much too depends on the form which the constitution has taken at a certain period ; whether the power of the *In the heroic age , it was the privilege of the kings to convoke the assembly . See above , in the fourth chapter . t That a great variety prevailed in this respect , is clear from Aristot . Polit. iv . 13 . ' I'lil- was the case in Athens and Sparta . This is the case , says Aristotle , Polit. iv . 13 , in the oligarchic , or aristocratical cities ; while on the contrary , in the democratic , the poorwere well paid for appearing in the assemblies . /z/ senate , or of certain magistrates preponderates . We find even in the history of Rome , that questions of the utmost interest to the people , questions of war and peace , were sometimes submitted to the people , and sometimes not . No less considerable difference prevailed in the Grecian cities . Yet writers are accustomed to comprehend the subjects belonging to the common assemblies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Greeks called a law ( xo ' oj ) ? was always a decree passed , or confirmed by the commons ; although it is difficult , we should rather say impossible , to define with accuracy the extent of this legislation . The second embraces the choice of magistrates . This right , although not all magistrates were appointed by election , was regarded , and justly regarded as one of the most important privileges . For the power of the commons is preserved by nothing more effectually , than by making it necessary for those who would obtain a place , to apply for it to them . The third class was formed by the popular courts of justice , which , as we shall hereafter take occasion to show . were of the highest importance as a support of the democracy . The consequences which the discussion and the decision of the most important concerns in the assemblies of the whole commons must inevitably have had , are so naturally suggested , that they hardly need to be illustrated at large . How could it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the commons , was not much less than to pave the way for the rule of the populace , if we include under that name the mass of indigent citizens . * The chief passage on this subject is in Aristot . Polit. iv . 14 , /q/ The most natural means of guarding against this evil , would without doubt have been the choice of persons , possessed of plenary powers , to represent the citizens . But it is obvious , that the system of representation has the least opportunity of coming to perfection in city governments . It is the fruit of the enlarged extent of states ; where it is impossible for all to meet in the assemblies . But in cities with a narrow territory , what could lead to such a form ; since neither distance nor numbers made it difficult for the citizens to appear personally in the assemblies . It is true , that the alliances of several cities , as of the Boeotian or the Achaean , led to the idea of sending deputies to the assemblies ; but in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed ; they were reserved for the consideration of each city ; and the deliberations of the whole body , related only to general affairs with respect to foreign relations . But a true system of representation can never be formed in that manner ; the true sphere of action of a legislative body , is to be found in the internal affairs of the nation . It was therefore necessary to think of other means of meeting the danger apprehended from the rule of the populace ; and those means were various . Aristotle expressly remarks , * that there were cities , in which no general assemblies of the citizens were held ; and only such citizens appeared , as had been expressly convoked or invited . These obviously formed a class of aristocratic governments . But even in the demo- *Aristot . Polit . Hi . 1 . A similar regulation existed in several German imperial towns ; as , for example , in Bremen , where the most distinguished citizens were invited by the senate to attend the convention of citizens ; and of course no uninvited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Aristotle has cited no Grecian city as an example . /z/ cracies , means* were taken , partly to have the important business transacted in smaller divisions , before the commons came to vote upon it ; partly to limit the subjects , which were to be brought before them ; partly to reserve the revision , if not of all , yet of some of the decrees , to another peculiar board ; and partly , and most frequently , to name another deliberate assembly , whose duty it was to consider every thing which was to come before the commons , and so far to prepare the business , that nothing remained for the commons , but to accept or reject the measures proposed . This assembly was called by the Greeks , a council ( /3etAj ) . We are acquainted with its internal regulations only at Athens ; but there is no reason to doubt , that in several Grecian states , a similar assembly existed under the same name.f If we may draw inferences respecting its nature in other states from what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens annually chosen ; its members , taken after a fixed rule from each of the corporations , were chosen by lot ; but they could not become actual members without a previous examination . For in no case was it of so much importance as here , to effect the exclusion of all but honest men ; who. being themselves interested in the preservation of the state and its constitution , might decide on the business presented to them , with prudence and moderation . In Athens at least , the greatest pains were * See in proof what follows , Aristot . Polit. iv . 14 . Op. ii . p. 286. /q/ taken with the internal organization of this body ; so that it seems to us , as will appear from the investigations respecting this state , to have been almost too artificial . Regulations , similar in kind , though not exactly the same , were probably established in the other cities , where similar wants and circumstances prevailed . It is easy to perceive , that the preservation of the internal liberties of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , made such regulations essential . It was probably to promote this end , that the appointments to the council were made only for the year. * It prevented the committee from becoming a faction , and thus assuming the whole administration of the state . But beside this , another great advantage was gained ; for in this manner , by far the larger number of distinguished and upright citizens became acquainted with the affairs and the government of the state . In other cities , instead of this annual council , there was a senate ( ygoyr/a ) ? which had no periodical change of its members , but formed a permanent board . Its very name expresses that it was composed of the elders ; and what was more natural , than to look for good counsel to the experience of maturity ? The rule respecting age may have been very different in the several cities , and perhaps in many no rule on the subject existed . But in others , it was enforced with rigorous accuracy . The immediate object was to have in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by no means so limited . In Sparta , the assembly of elders had its place by the side of the /z/ kings . The senate of Corinth is mentioned under the same name ; * that of Massiliaf under a different one , but its members held their places for life : and in how many other cities may there have been a council of elders , of which history makes no mention , just as it is silent respecting the internal regulations in those just enumerated . J Even in cities which usually had no such senate , an extraordinary one was sometimes appointed in extraordinary cases , where good advice was needed . This took place in Athens after the great overthrow in Sicily . Besides an assembly of citizens , or town meeting , and a senate , a Grecian city had its magistrates . Even the ancient politicians were perplexed to express with accuracy , the idea of magistrates.il For not all to whom public business was committed by the citizens , could be called magistrates ; for otherwise the ambassadors and priests would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not seldom difficult to decide , who ought to be reckoned in the number of magistrates , as will be apparent from calling to mind the inferior officers . But no important misunderstanding can arise , if we are careful to affix to * Plutarch . Op. ii . p. 177. t Strabo , iii p . 124. t There was perhaps no one Grecian city , in which such a council did not exist , for the nature of things made it almost indispensable . They were most commonly called ixi and yipvf 'm , and these words may often have been confounded . For although the favXn in Athens was a body chosen from the citizens but for a year , and the yipvf'i* of Sparta was a permanent council , we can not safely infer , that the terms , when used , always implied such a difference . In Crete , e. g. the council of elders was called fuii , according to Aristot . Polit. ii . 10. though in its organization it resembled the yttveim , of Sparta . Thucyd. viii . i . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 15 . The practical politicians , no lessthan the theorists , were perplexed in defining the word . An important passage may be found in Eschin. in Ctesiphont. iii . p. 397 etc , Reisk. /q/ the word the double idea of possessing a part of the executive power ; and of gaining , in consequence of the importance of the business entrusted to them , a higher degree of consideration , than belonged to the common citizen . In the republican constitutions of the Greeks a second idea was attached to that of a magistracy ; it was necessary to call every magistrate to account respecting the affairs of his office. * He who went beyond this rule , ceased to be a magistrate and became a tyrant . The magistrate was therefore compelled to recognise the sovereignty of the people . This certainly implied , that an account was to be given to the commons ; but as in such constitutions not every thing was systematically established , there were some states , in which separate boards , as that of the Ephori in Sparta , usurped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquiry respecting magistrates , says Aristotle , J several questions are to be considered ; How many magistrates there are , and how great is their authority ? How long they continue in office , and whether they ought to continue long ? Farther , Who ought to be appointed ? and by whom ? arid how ? These are questions , which of themselves show , that republican states are had in view ; and which lead us to anticipate that great variety , which prevailed on these points in the Grecian constitutions . We desire to treat first of the last questions . According to the whole spirit of the Grecian constitutions , it can not be doubted , that their leading /z/ principle was , that all magistrates must be appointed by the people . The right of choosing the magistrates , was always regarded , and justly regarded , as an important part of the freedom of a citizen. * But although this principle was predominant , it still had its exceptions . There were states , in which the first offices were hereditary in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe , this was a rare case ; and where one magistracy was hereditary all the rest were elective ; at Sparta , though the royal dignity was hereditary , the Ephori were chosen . But beside the appointment by election , the custom very commonly prevailed of appointing by lot . And our astonishment is very justly excited by this method , which not unfrequently commits to chance , the appointment to the first and most weighty employments in the state . But even in several of the German imperial towns , the lot had an important share in the appointment to offices . It is uninfluenced by favour , birth , and wealth . And therefore the nomination of magistrates by lot , was considered by the Grecian politicians , as the surest characteristic of a democracy. ! But where the appointment was left to be decided by that method , the decision was not always made solely by it . He on whom the lot fell , could still be subjected to a severe examination , and very frequently was so . And where some places were filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the appointment to all . * Aristot . Polit. ii . 12 . MSt ya , reureu , rto rij ccgKtt xvpes *v o tripos , Sai/Xo ; 0.1 tin KCU *iifiitf. /q/ But in the election also , the greatest differences prevailed ; since sometimes all classes , and sometimes only particular ones took part in them. * To admit all citizens to vote , is one of the chief characteristics of a democracy ; and we know this was done not only in Athens , but in many other cities . But when the aristocratic and democratic party had once become distinct , endeavours were almost inevitably made to exclude the mass of the people from any share in the elections . For the aristocrat found nothing more humiliating , than to approach the common citizen as a suppliant , before he could arrive at places of honour . Where the first step succeeded , the second soon followed ; and the magistrates themselves supplied any vacant places in their board . This , says Aristotle , f is the peculiar mark of oligarchy , and leads almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible to office ? This question is still more important , than that respecting the electors ; and an equally great difference prevailed on this point in the various states . The maxim , that men , to whom the control of the public affairs should be committed , must not only possess sufficient capacity , but must also be interested in the support of existing forms , is so obvious , that the principle of excluding the lower orders of the people from participating in the magistracies , could hardly seem otherwise than judicious and necessary 4 But when it was adopted , it could seldom be preserved . When a state became flourishing /z/ and powerful , the people felt itself to be of more importance ; * and it was not always flattery of the populace , which in such times induced its leaders to abolish those restrictive laws , but a conviction of the impossibility of maintaining them . In an individual case , such an unlimited freedom of choice can become very injurious ; but it is , on the whole , much less so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to become pernicious . If it be birth , which forms the limiting principle , if a man must be of one of certain families in order to gain an office , it would be made directly impossible for men of talents to obtain them ; and this has often produced the most violent revolutions . If fortune be made the qualification , ! this is in itself no criterion of desert . If it be age , want of energy is too often connected with riper experience . In most of the Grecian cities , there certainly existed a reason , why regard should be had to wealth ; because that consisted almost always in real estate . But where the poor were excluded by no restrictive laws , they were obliged of their own accord , to retire from most of the magistracies . These offices were not lucrative ; on the contrary , considerable expenses were often connected with them.J There were no fixed salaries , as in our states ; and the prospect , which in Rome in a later period was so inviting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in Greece . It was therefore impossible for the poorer class to press forward with eagerness to these * See , on this subject also , Aristot.l. c. t Many places in Aristotle show , that this was the case in a large number ef cities ; and under the most various regulations : e. g. iv . 11. * As for banquets , public buildings , festivals , &c.; Aristot . Polit. vi . 8. /q/ offices ; in many cities there even existed a necessity of imposing a punishment , if the person elected would not accept the office committed to him. * It was far more the honour and the glory , than the gain , which gave a value to the magistrates . But the honour of being the first , or one of the first , among his fellowcitizens , is for many a more powerful excitement , than that which can be derived from emolument . In small republics , no other fear needs be entertained respecting the offices of magistrates , than lest certain families should gain the exclusive possession of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! when the number of such families remained small . These were with justice regarded as a corruption of the constitutions . There may have been exceptions , and we find in history , examples both within and without Greece , where such states have been administered with moderation and wisdom . But more frequently experience has shown the contrary result . The precautions taken against this evil by the Grecians , were the same with those adopted in many of the German imperial towns ; persons connected by blood , as father and son , or several brothers , could not at the same time be magistrates . Connections by marriage are no where said to have excluded from office ; on the contrary , it would be easier to find examples of brothers in law filling magistracies at the same time. $ Most of the magistrates were chosen annually ; many for but half a year . This frequent renewal * Aristot . Polit. iv . 9. t Not only Aristot. iv . fi . but many passages in Thucydides ; as e. g. viii . 82 . J @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polit. v. 6 . As Agesilaus and Pisander in Sparta . Arietot . Polit. iv . 15. /z/ had its advantages , and also its evils . It is the strongest pillar of the rule of the people ; which is by nothing so much confirmed , as by the frequent exercise of the right of election . This was the point of view taken by the politicians of Greece , when they considered the authority of the people to reside in the elections. * That these frequent elections did not tend to preserve internal tranquillity , is easy to be perceived . But on the other side , the philosopher of Stagira has not failed to remark , that the permanent possession of magistracies might have led to discontentf An enumeration of the different magistracies usual among the Greeks , is not required by our purpose ; neither would it be possible , as our acquaintance with the several constitutions of the cities is incredibly limited . The little that we know of the regulations in the individual states , especially in Athens , proves that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the classification , which Aristotle has attempted to mske of them.J Their duties are commonly indicated by their names ; but these again were entirely different in the various cities ; even in cases where the duties were the same . The Cosmi were in Crete , what the Ephori were in Sparta . Most of the cities must have had a magistrate like the Archons in Athens ; and yet it would not be easy to find the name in any other . The numerous encroachments , made by the lawgivers on domestic life , contributed much to multiply the offices of magistrates and extend their sphere of action . The /q/ Grecians had formed no idea of a police , as a general branch of the administration of the state ; but they were acquainted with several of its branches ; and although they had no general board of police , the circumstances just mentioned led them to establish several particular branches ; and even some , which are not usual in our times . The superintendence of women , the superintendence of children , was in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Areopagus of Athens had in general the care of morals , there were undoubtedly similar tribunals in other Grecian cities . Thus then it appears , that amidst an almost infinite variety of forms , assemblies of the citizens , senates , and magistracies , are the institutions which belonged to every Grecian commonwealth . The preservation of freedom and equality among the commons , f formed their chief object . It was not considered unjust to take from anyone , of whom it was only feared that he might become dangerous to this freedom , the power of doing injury , by a temporary banishment from the city ; and this took place at Athens and ArgosJ by ostracism , and by petalism in Syracuse . Nothing can be more jealous , than the love of liberty ; and unfortunately for mankind , experience shows but too clearly , that it has reason to be so . Nevertheless , neither these , nor other precautions were able to save the Grecian cities from the usurpations of tyrants , as they were termed . Few cities , in the mother country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Grecians connected with this word the idea of an illegitimate , but not necessarily of a cruel government . It was illegitimate , because it was not conferred by the commons ; but usurped without , or even against their will . A demagogue , however great his power may have been , was never , as such , denominated a tyrant ; but he received the name , if he set himself above the people ; that is , if he refused to lay before the people the account which was due to them. * The usual support of such an authority , is an armed power , composed of foreigners and hirelings ; which was therefore always regarded as the sure mark of a tyrant.f Such a government by no means necessarily implied , that the existing regulations and laws would be entirely set aside . They could continue ; even an usurper needs an administration ; only he raises himself above the laws . The natural aim of these tyrants usually was , to make their power hereditary in their families . But though this happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time by the same family . It continued longest , says Aristotle , : : in the house of Orthagoras in Sicyon , for as it was very moderate and even popular , it lasted a century ; and for the same causes it was preserved about as long in the house ofCypselus in Corinth . But if it could not be maintained by such means , how could it have been kept up by mere violence and terror . Where the love of freedom is once so deeply fixed , as it was in the character of the Grecians , the attempts to oppress it only give a new impulse to its defenders . *By desiring to become awrtuttns .

By that , which a modern school , placing the object of the state in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . We may observe in Greece exertions made to gain that security ; but it is equally clear , that it was but very imperfectly attained , and with such constitutions could have been but imperfectly attained In the midst of the frequent storms , to which those states were exposed , that tranquillity could not long be preserved , in which men limit their active powers to the improvement of their domestic condition . It does not belong to us to institute inquiries into the correctness of those principles ; but experience does not admit of its being denied , that in these , to all appearances , so imperfect constitutions , every thing , which forms the glory of man , flourished in its highest perfection . It was those very storms , which called forth master spirits , by opening to them a sphere of action . There was no place here for indolence and inactivity of mind ; where each individual felt most sensibly , that he existed only through the state and with the state ; where every revolution of the state in some measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property was necessarily much less firmly established , than in well regulated monarchies . We leave to every one to form his own judgment , and select his own criterion ; but we will draw from the whole one general inference , that the forms under which the character of the human race can be unfolded , have not been so limited by the hand of the Eternal , as the wisdom of the schools would lead us to believe . /z/ But whatever may be thought of the value of these constitutions , the reflection is forced upon us , that they surpassed all others in internal variety ; and therefore in no other nation could so great an abundance of political ideas have been awakened . and preserved in practical circulation . Of the hundreds of Grecian cities , perhaps there were no two , of which the constitutions were perfectly alike ; and none , of which the internal relations had not changed their form . How much had been tried in each one of them , and how often had the experiments been repeated ! And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new results ? Where then could there have been so much political animation , so large an amount of practical knowledge , as among the Greeks ? If uniformity is , in the political world , as in the regions of taste and letters , the parent of narrowness , and if variety , on the contrary , promotes cultivation , no nation ever moved in better paths than the Greeks . Although some cities became preeminent , no single city engrossed every thing ; the splendor of Athens could as little eclipse Corinth and Sparta , as Miletus and Syracuse . Each city had a life of its own , its own manner of existence and action ; and it was because each one had a consciousness of its own value , that each came to possess an independent worth . /q/ /z/ THE increasing wants of modern states have not only employed practical statesmen , but have led to the formation of many theories , of which the truth and utility are still subjects of discussion . Among the ancients , the finances of the nation were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore could not have been , in the same degree , an object of speculation . Whether the world has lost by this , or not , is a question which we prefer to leave unanswered . If the ancients knew less of the importance of the division of labour , they were also less acquainted with the doctrine of the modern schools , which transforms nations into productive herds . The Greeks were aware , that men must have productive arts , if they would live ; but that it is the end of life to be employed in them , never entered their minds . But the modern should not look with absolute contempt on the state of political science among the ancients . The chief question now agitated between theorists and practical statesmen , whether the mere gain in money decides on the wealth of a nation , and should form the object of its industry , was correctly understood and answered by the illustrious Stagirite . " Many , " says he , * ( i suppose wealth to consist in the abundance of coined money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Money is of itself without value , and gains its utility only by the law ; when it ceases to be current , it loses its value , * and can not be employed in the acquisition of necessaries ; and therefore he who is rich in money , may yet be destitute of a necessary support . But it is ridiculous to say , that wealth consists in any thing , of which a man may be possessed , and yet die of hunger ; as the fable relates of Midas , at whose touch every thing became gold . " f In a nation , in which private existence was subordinate to that of the public , the industry employed in the increase of wealth , could not gain the exclusive importance , which it has with the moderns . With the ancients , the citizen was first anxious for the state , and only next for himself . As long as there is any higher object than the acquisition of money , the love of self can not manifest itself so fully , as where every higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged the attention of states , as of individuals , the science of finances could not be fully developed , although the want of money was often very sensibly felt . Men learned to tread under foot the most glorious productions of mind , to trample upon the monuments of moral and intellectual greatness , before they received those theories , which assigu to the great instructers of mankind in philosophy and /q/ in religion , a place in the unproductive class . In the states of Greece , each individual was obliged of himself to say , that his own welfare was connected with the welfare of the state ; that his private welfare would be ruined by a revolution in the existing order of things , by the rule of the populace , or by subjection to a foreign power ; that all his industry was of advantage to him only while the state should continue to subsist . Although the patriotism , thus produced , proceeded frequently from selfishness , it had as a consequence , that the exertions of the individual were directed to something besides his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded than that of the public . The times arrived , in which this too was changed ; but they were the precursors of the ruin of liberty . There was still another reason , which contributed to make the Greeks regard the arts of industry in general , and some of them in particular , in a very different light from that in which they are now considered . And this was slavery , which was generally prevalent , either under the form of domestic servitude , or , in some states , of villanage . To be convinced of this , we need only look at the variety of employments , which were carried on by slaves and villains . Such were all those household duties , which with us are committed to footmen ; and beside them , several other charges , as the superintendence , and , in part , the early education and instruction of children . Vanity , still more than necessity , increased the number of those who were held in bondage , after it became the custom to be served by a numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all labours were performed , which are now done by journeymen and lacqueys . Some of the rich Grecians made a business of keeping slaves to let for such services . All kinds of labour in the mines were performed by slaves ; who , as well as the mines , were the property of individual citizens. * The sailors on board of the gallies , consisted , at least in part , of slaves . Most if not all trades were carried on by slaves ; who were universally employed in the manufacturing establishments . In these , not only the labourers , but also the overseers were slaves ; for the owners did not even trouble themselves with the care of superintending ; but they farmed the whole to persons , who were perhaps often the overseers also , and from whom they received a certain rent , according to the number of slaves , which they were obliged to keep undiminished.f In those states , where there were slaves attached to the soil , as in Laconia , Messenia , Crete , and Thessaly , agriculture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters may have bestowed more attention on the subject ; but as the Strepsiades of the comedian shows , they did little more than superintend ; and the work was left to the slaves . If we put all this together , we shall see how limited were the branches of industry , which remained for the free . But the most unavoidable , and at the same time the most important consequence of it was , that all those employments which were committed to slaves , were regarded as mean and degrading ; $ and this view of them was not only confirmed by prevail- * Xenoph. de Redit. speaks of this point at large , t See Petit , de Leg . Alt . ii . 6. $ Bu* , artea iUiberales . We have no word which exactly expresses this idea , because we have not the thing itself . /q/ ing prejudices , but expressly sanctioned by the laws . To this class belonged especially the mechanics , and even the retailers . For although all mechanic employments were by no means conducted by slaves , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated states , " says Aristotle , * " the lower order of mechanics are not even admitted to the rights of citizens ; " and now we cease to wonder at the proposition of another statesman , ! who would commit all mechanic labours to public slaves . This was not merely a theory ; it was once actually put in practice at Epidamnus.f In the cities which were democratically governed , the condition of the mechanics was somewhat more favourable . They could become citizens and magistrates , as at Athens during the rule of the people . $ The inferior branches of trade were not looked upon with much more favour . In Thebes , there was a law , that no one , who within ten years had been engaged in retail dealings , could be elected to a magistracy . ) ! As the Grecian cities were very different in character , the ideas which prevailed on this subject , could not be the same . In those states where agriculture was the chief employment , the other means of gaining a livelihood may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number was very considerable , the business of commerce must have been esteemed . But those who were employed in manufacturing and selling goods , were never able to gain that degree of respectability , which they * Aristot . Polit . Hi . 5. *H t /3sX'nWj - r'oKi ; eu iroirif ' . i fiatuffr ? rX/Ti. /z/ enjoy among modern nations. * Even in Athens , says Xenophon , f much would be gained by treating more respectfully and more hospitably the foreign merchants , brought by their business to that city . The income derived from landed estate , was most esteemed by the Greeks . " The best nation/* ' says Aristotle , J " is a nation of farmers . " From the little esteem in which the other means of gaining a livelihood were held , it followed that a wealthy middling class could not be formed in the Grecian states ; and this is censured by those who have criticised their constitutions , as the chief cause of their unsettled condition . But this censure rests , for the most part , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry on any of those kinds of employment with his own hands ; but it by no means lessened his consideration to have them conducted on his account . Work-shops and manufactures , as well as mines and lands , could be possessed by the first men in the country . The father of Demosthenes , a rich and respectable man , left at his death a manufactory of swords ; which was kept up by his son ; $ and examples could be easily multiplied , from the orators and the comedian . When this circumstance is kept in view , the blame attached to the Grecian constitutions is , in a great measure , though not entirely removed . The impediments which public opinion put in the way of industry , did not so much injure those concerned in any large enterprise , as * Compare on this subject , first of all , Aristot . Polit. 1 . 11 , where he analyzes and treats of the several branches of industry . tXen. de Redit . Op. p. 922 . Leunclav . J Aristot . Polit. vi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 816. /q/ those engaged in the smaller occupations . The latter did really feel the evil , and we are not disposed to represent it as inconsiderable . But we must return once more to the remark which explains the true cause of this regulation ; that in the Grecian states , public life was placed above private life . u All agree , " says Aristotle , * " that in every well regulated state , sufficient leisure must be preserved from the wants of life for the public business ; but a difference of opinion exists as to the manner in which this can be done . It is effected by means of slaves ; who are not , however , treated in all places alike . " Here we have the point of view , from which the politician should consider slavery in Greece . It served to raise the class of citizens to a sort of nobility , especially where they consisted almost entirely of landed proprietors . It is true , that this class lived by the labours of the other ; and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against slavery , may therefore so far be applied to the Grecians . But their fame does not rest on the circumstance of their obtaining that leisure at the expense of the lower order ; but in the application , which the noblest of them made of that leisure . No one will deny , that without their slaves , the character of the culture of the upper class in Greece could in no respects have become what it did ; and if the fruits which were borne , possess a value for every cultivated mind , we may at least be permitted to doubt , whether they were too dearly purchased by the introduction of slavery.f * Aristotle ii . 9. /z/ The free exertions of industry were in some measure limited by the regulations of which we have spoken ; but in a very different manner from any usual in our times . They were the result of public opinion ; and if they were confirmed by the laws , this was done in conformity to that opinion . In other respects , the interference of government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object , to preserve the mass of species undiminished , or to increase it ; nothing was known of the balance of trade ; and consequently all the violent measures resulting from it , were never devised by the Greeks . They had duties , as well as the moderns ; but those duties were exacted only for the sake of increasing the public revenue , not to direct the efforts of domestic industry , by the prohibition of certain wares . There was no prohibition of the exportation of the raw produce ; no encouragement of manufactures at the expense of the agriculturalists . In this respect , therefore , there existed freedom of occupations , commerce , and trade . And such was the general custom . As every thing was decided by circumstances and not by theories , there may have been single exceptions , and perhaps single examples , * where the state for a season usurped a monopoly . But how far was this from the mercantile and restrictive system of the moderns ! The reciprocal influence between national economy , and that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at different times ; in different countries ; and even in the same country . On this sulject I would refer to the following instructive work ; Geschichte und Zustand der Sclaverey und Leibeigenschaft iu Griechenland , von J. F. Reitemeyer . Berlin , 1789 . History and Condition of Slavery and Villanage in Greece , by J. F. Reitemeyer. * Aristot. de Re Farail. 1 . iithat /q/ it was necessary to premise a few observations respecting the former . Before we treat of the latter , it will be useful to say a few words on a subject , which is equally important to both ; the money of the Greeks . National economy can exist without money , but finances can not . It would be important to fix the time , when coined money first became current in Greece , and when money was first coined in the country itself . But it is difficult to give an exact answer to either of these questions , especially to the first . Homer never speaks of money ; and his silence is in this case valid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of a barter , * he must necessarily have mentioned it , if he had been acquainted with it . On the other hand , we may confidently affirm on the authority of Demosthenes , that in the age of Solon , f coined silver money was not only known in the cities of Greece , but had been in circulation for a length of time ; $ for the punishment of death had already been set upon the crime of counterfeiting it ; Solon mentioned it as in general use throughout * As for example , II . vi . 472 . Od. i. 430. t About 600 years before the Christian era. j . " I will relate to you , " says the orator , while opposing a bill brought in by Timocrates , " what Solon once said against a man who proposed a bad law . The cities , said he to the judges , have a law , that he who counterfeits money , shall be put to death . He thought this law was made for the protection of private persons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin of the state . They , therefore , who corrupt the laws , must be much more heavily punished , than they who adulterate the coinage or introduce false money . Yea , many cities exist and flourish , although they use brass and lead instead of silver money ; but those which have bad laws , will certainly be ruined . " Demosth. in Timocrat . Op. i. p. 763 , 764 . Compare with this what Herod , iii . 56 , says of the counterfeit money , with which Polycrates is said to have cheated the Spartans. /z/ the Grecian cities ; and many of them had already supplied its place with the baser metals . The Grecian coins , which are still extant , can afford us no accurate dates , as the time of their coinage is not marked upon them ; but several of them are certainly as ancient as the age of Solon ; and perhaps are even older . The coins of Sybaris , for example , must be at least of the sixth century before the Christian era ; as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ancient coins of Rhegium , Croton , and Syracuse , seem from the letters in the superscriptions to be of far higher antiquity. * If the account that Lycurgus prohibited in Sparta , the use of money of the precious metals , is well supported , ! we should be able to trace the history of Grecian coins to a still more remote age ; and this opinion is corroborated at least by the narration of the Parian chronicle , that Phidon of Argos in the year 631 ( i. e. 895 years B. C. ) first began to coin silver in the island of Egina . But although we can not at present trace the history of coined money in Greece any farther , we may from the preceding observations infer one general conclusion ; the founding of colonies and the intercourse kept up with them , caused coined money to be introduced and extensively used in Greece . Before their *Ekhel . Doctrina Numorum Veterum , i. p. 170177. 242. t Plutarch , in Lycurg . Op. i. p. 177 . His code is computed to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ep . xxxi. cf. Strabo viii . p. 247 . This was about 15 years before the legislation of Lycurgus . It might , therefore , not without probability be supposed , that Lycurgus wished and was able to prohibit money of the precious metals , because it at that time was just beginning to circulate in Greece . Compare Wachteri Archaeologia Nutnmaria , Lips . 1740 ; and the introductory inquiries in Ekhel . D. H. V. /q/ foundation , the Greeks knew nothing of coined money . When money was first coined in . /Egina , the colonies of Asia Minor and of Magna Graecia* were already established and flourishing ; and we are expressly informed , that money was coined in that island , in order to carry on commerce beyond the sea.f It can not be proved with certainty , that money was coined in the Asiatic colonies sooner than in the mother country . But when we call to mind the well known relation of Herodotus , : : that the Lydians were the inventors of money coined of gold and silver ( a thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounded in gold , and that the most flourishing Grecian colonies were situated on the Lydian coasts ) we can not but find it highly probable , that the Greeks received their stamps for coining , like so many other inventions , from Asia ; and here too , the remark is valid , that in their hands every thing received a new form and a new beauty . For no nation has ever yet had coins , of which the stamp equalled in beauty those of the Grecian , and especially of the Sicilian cities . The right of minting gold was regarded in Greece as the privilege of the state , which superintended it . Hence arose that variety and multitude of city coins , which are easily distinguished by their peculiar stamp . Coins were also struck by several of the tribes , the Thessalians , the Boeotians , and others , as they formed by their alliances one political body . * As e. g . Cutnae. t Strabo viii . p. 259 . He refers to Epborus . J Herod , i. 94 . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lydians . For the Egyptians e. g. are named without any reason . See Wachter , 1 . c. cap . iv . /z/ Though the Grecian coins were of both precious and base metals , they were originally struck of precious metal only , and probably at first of nothing but silver . So few of the gold coins have been preserved , that we can not certainly say , whether they are altogether as ancient ; but those of base metal are certainly of a later period . That even before the time of Solon , silver money had in many cities a large proportion of alloy , appears from the passage which we cited from Demosthenes. * In Hellas itself , we know of no silver mines except those of Laurium , which were very ancient ; f but the gold mines of Thrace and the neighbouring island Thasos were quite as ancient , for they were wrought by the Phoenicians . Yet the Greeks received most of their gold from Lydia . And still there was not species enough in circulation , especially in the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , several cities made use of the same resource , which had been introduced at Carthage , J the use of nominal coins , which possessed a current value , not corresponding to their intrinsic one . Such was the iron money ( if my view is a just one ) which was adopted in Byzantium , Clazomene , and perhaps in some other cities.H /z/ t Heeren 's Ideeu ii . S. 164 . Pollux ix . 78 . Aristot . ( Econ. ii . Op. ii . p. 383 . A decisive passage . H Most of the cities , says Xenophon , Op. p. 922 , have money , which is not current except in their own territory ; hence merchants are obliged to barter their own wares for other wares . Athens makes a solitary exception . It was therefore quite common for cities to have two kinds of money coins of nominal value , current only in the city - which struck them ; and metallic money , of which the value depended on its intrinsic worth , and which circulated in other places . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . /q/ It is certain , therefore , that the Greeks had money which was current only in the state , and out of it was of no value ; as we learn also from a passage in Plato. * It is much to be regretted , that we do not know by what means its value was kept from falling . The inquiry into the economy of a nation , intricate as it may be , can be reduced to the following points ; What were the wants of the state ? What means were adopted to supply them ? How were those means brought together ? How administered ? The inquiry respecting the economy of the Grecian states will be conducted with reference to these questions . The small republics of that people appear at the first view , according to the modern criterion , to have hardly had any wants , which could make a financial system necessary ; and in fact there were some states , as Sparta during a long period , without any finances . The magistrates were rewarded with honour , not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and many of those public institutions , which are now supported by the governments for the most various purposes , and in part at very great expense , were then entirely unknown , because they were not felt to be necessary . Nevertheless we find the contrary to have been true . The burdens which the citizens of those republics had to support , continued gradually to increase ; and in the later period of Grecian liberty , became so great , that we can not but esteem them oppressive . States can create wants , no less than indi- // viduals . Even in Greece , experience shows that necessities are multiplied with the increase of power and splendor . But when we call them oppressive , we must not forget , that the heaviness of the contributions paid to the state , is not to be estimated by their absolute amount ; nor yet by the proportion alone , which that amount bears to the income . In our present investigations , it is more important to bear in mind , what our modern economists have entirely overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in them ) there exists beside the criterion of money , a moral criterion , by which a judgment on the greater or less degree of oppression is to be formed . Where the citizen exists only with and for the state ; where the preservation of the commonwealth is every thing to the individual ; many a tax is easily paid , which under other circumstances would have been highly oppressive . But in the theories of our modern political artists , there is no chapter , which treats of the important influence of patriotism and public spirit on the financial system ; probably because the statistical tables do not make mention of them as sources of produce . The wants of states are partly established by their nature ; hut still more by opinion . That is a real want , which is believed to be such . The explanation of the management of the affairs of any nation would necessarily be very imperfect , if we should pay no regard to the ideas , which it entertained respecting its necessities . On this point the Greeks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , which do not appear so to us ; many /q/ things are needed by us , of which they did not feel the necessity . The first object with the Greek was the honour and splendor of his city . In that world of small republics , each wished to make itself remarkable ; each to be distinguished for something . Now there were two things , which in the eyes of the Greeks , rendered a city illustrious ; its public monuments and its festivals . These objects were therefore politically necessary , in a different sense from that in which they can be called so in modern states . Among these the first place belongs to the temples . No Grecian city was without gods , of whom it honoured some as its guardian deities . How could these gods be left without dwelling-places ? The art of sculpture was very naturally exerted in connexion with that of architecture ; for the statues of the gods did not merely adorn the temples , but were indispensably necessary as objects of adoration . The same may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to be life to a Greek . But these holidays were not passed exclusively in prayers , or at banquets . Processions , music , and public shows , were an essential part of them . These were not merely the diversions of the people during the festival , they constituted the festival itself . All this was intimately connected with religion . The Greeks had almost no public festivals except religious ones . They were celebrated in honour of some God , some hero ; above all in honour of the patron deities of the place. * By this means , many things /z/ which we are accustomed to regard as objects of amusement , received a much more elevated character . They became duties enjoined by religion ; which could not be neglected without injury to the honour and reputation , and even to the welfare of the city . The gods would have been incensed ; and the accidental evils , which might have fallen on the city ? would infallibly have been regarded as punishments inflicted by the gods . We need not therefore be astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously embarrassed for want of sufficient means to celebrate its festivals with due solemnity. * Thus a field , an almost immeasurable field was opened for public expenses of a kind , hardly known to modern states . Even in cases where the governments believe it necessary to expend something on public festivals , little is done except in the capital : and this expenditure has never , to our knowledge , made an article in a budget . It would have made the very first in Grecian cities , at least in times of peace . And he who can vividly represent those states to his mind , will easily perceive how many things must have combined to increase these expenditures . They were prompted not by a mere regard for the honour of the state ; jealousy and envy of the other cities were of influence also . And still more is to be attributed to the emulation and the vanity of those , who were appointed to the charge of the expenditures . One desired to surpass another . This was the most reputable manner of displaying wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public shows were not , in the Grecian cities , so indispensably the means of gaining the * Consult what Aristotle relates of Antiss sus , Op. ii . p. 390. /q/ favour of the people as at Rome , ( probably because what in Rome was originally voluntary , had ever been considered in Greece as one of the duties and burdens of a citizen , which did not merit even thanks , ) politcal ends may have often been of influence with individuals . The Grecian temples had , for the most part , possessions of their own , with which they met the expenses incurred in the service of the god . Their possessions consisted partly in votive presents , which had been consecrated , especially where the divinities of health and prophecy were adored , by the hopes or the gratitude of the suppliants for aid and counsel . We know from several examples , especially from that of the Delphic temple , that treasures were there accumulated , of more value probably than those of Loretto , or any other shrine in Europe. * But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into circulation , they were , for the most part , but unproductive treasures , possessing no other value than what they received from the artist . We could desire more accurate information respecting the administration of the treasures of the temples ; for it seems hardly credible , that the great stores of gold and silver , which were not wrought , should have been left entirely unemployed . But besides these treasures , the temples drew a large part of their revenue from lands ; f which were not unfrequently consecrated to /z/ their service . When a new colonial city was built , it was usual to devote at once a part of its territory to the Gods. * But although these resources were sufficient for the support of the temple , the priests , the various persons employed in the service of the temples , and perhaps the daily sacrifices , yet the incense and other expenses , the celebration of the festivals with all the costs connected with it , still continued a burden to be borne by the public . Beside the expenses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were others which the administration made necessary . The magistrates , in the proper sense of the word , were without salaries ; but the state needed many inferior servants for the taxes , the police , etc. ; and these must certainly have been paid.f Add to this that several of the duties of citizens were of such a nature that it subsequently became necessary to pay for the performance of them , though it had not been done at an earlier period . To this class belongs the duty of attending in the courts ; and the investigation of the ritory of Lecythus , which he had conquered . Thucyd. iv . cap . 116 . It is a mistake to believe that the consecrated land must have remained uncultivated . That of Cirrha remained so , because a curse rested on it . Pausan. p. 894 .

An example of this kind rs found in Demosth. in iMid . Op. i. p. 570. /q/ Attic state will prove to us , that the number of those who were to be paid , caused this expense to be one of the heaviest . But as the states increased in power , the greatest expenditures were occasioned by the military and naval establishments . These expenditures were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of peace had no standing army , and no mariners to pay . But even in times of peace , large appropriations were needed for the support of the magazines and the ships ; and unfortunately for Greece , the common condition of the more powerful states came at last to be that of war rather than of peace . If wars under any circumstances are costly , two causes contributed to make them especially so in Greece . The first was the custom which arose of employing hired troops . As long as wars were carried on by the militia of the country , which required no pay , the costs of them were not very considerable , as each one served at his own expense . But when hired troops began to be used , every thing was changed . We shall take another opportunity of showing how this custom , by which the whole political condition of Greece was most deeply and incurably disordered , continued to gain ground from the first moment of its introduction . Hence proceeded the pecuniary embarrassment of so many Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be found in the progress of naval forces , and their increasing importance to the ruling states . The building , support , and fitting out of squadrons , which are always so expensive , must have been doubly so to the Greeks , who were obliged to import their tim- /z/ her and many other articles from a distance . The expense became still greater , when the cities began to outbid each other in the pay of their mariners : which they did , as soon as the Spartans were enabled by the Persian supplies to cope in this matter with their rivals. * Need we be astonished , then , at finding under such circumstances , that the trierarchies , or contributions of the rich towards the fitting out of the gallies , ' were the most oppressive of all the public burdens ? f Different , therefore , as was the list of public expenses from that of modern states , we still find points of agreement . We have now to inquire , What were the sources of the public revenue ? What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one state in Greece , that of Athens , respecting which , any accurate information on this subject has been preserved . It would be too hasty an inference to say , that what was usual in that city was usual in the others . But though the particular regulations may have been very different , a great general similarity must certainly have prevailed ; and it is that , which we are now to consider . Such a resemblance was a natural consequence of the great preponderating power and political influence of Athens . In the states which were its allies , how much must necessarily have been regulated by its example ! * This is known to have been done during the Peloponnesian war as well by the Corinthians , Thucyd. i. 31 , as by Sparta , which state received of the Persians more than 5000 talents ( nearly five million dollars ) for that purpose . Isocrat. de Pace , Op. p. 179. /q/ And the little information which we are able to collect respecting their revenues , appears to prove the fact beyond a doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general view of this subject. * After classifying the sources of revenue in monarchies , with respect to the general no less than the provincial administration , f he continues ; " The third kind of administration , is that of free states . For them , the principal source of revenue is from the produce of their own soil ; the second from merchandise and the markets ; the third from the contributions paid by the citizens in turn . ? ' J When we learn , that these last were a sort of property tax for the richer class , and that the second could have been nothing but duties on articles of consumption , we perceive at once , what we are soon to prove , that in the Grecian states , our direct and indirect taxes were known and introduced , though in technical language the distinction was differently made . The subject deserves to be treated with closer attention . In the political economy of the moderns , the taxes on lands and houses are considered the most important of all direct taxes .

" In Menda , " says Aristotle , " the common expenses of the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties ; the taxes , on the contrary , on land and houses are regularly assessed : but they are collected from those who are bound to pay them , only in times of a great want of money . " * This example shows very clearly , that the Greeks knew the practical difference between direct and indirect taxes ; but it still remains doubtful , whether the tax on the soil was a land tax in the modern sense , according to its square contents and quality ; or whether it was a tax on the raw produce . The first is not probable . We hear nothing of a register of landed estates in Greece ; though there existed such an one in the great empire of Persia.f Where the taxes are treated of , the expressions appear rather to indicate , that ' a proportion of the produce was paid . It was commonly tithes , which were taken of fruits and of cattle ; as Aristotle expressly mentions in the passages first cited.f In what degree these taxes were usual in the Grecian cities , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were levied on certain estates , or on all lands . That they were very common , is hardly doubtful , since the remark of Aristotle is a general one . Poll taxes were less frequently levied on the citizens ( though we would not assert , that they did not in any degree exist with respect to them ) , than on /q/ the inquilini or resident foreigners . These formed in most of the Grecian cities a numerous class of inhabitants , and were obliged to pay for protection , a sum* which was sometimes a poll tax , and sometimes an impost on property . We know with certainty , that such sums were paid by the foreigners at Athens . However much the practical politician may be excited by increasing wants , to exert his inventive powers , the character of the state settles in a certain measure the kinds of taxes . Where a community imposes its own taxes , the direct taxes , and among them those on property , will have the first rank . That each citizen , or rather , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course apply to the poorer classes ) should share in the public burdens in proportion to their means , is so naturul an idea , that it can not but occur of itself . But when we consider the taxes on property as forming the chief division , we must premise two observations in connexion with that remark . First : The taxes on property were not so regular , that they were paid from year to year according to the same fixed measure . The necessary sums were rather voted , as circumstances required ; which also decided the degree of rigour , with which they were collected . Of this we have proof in very many examples in Demosthenes and others , f In times of peace , whole years might pass away , in which no such taxes were required to be paid ; while in others they *T fttvaixiov . The regulations respecting this , and its amount , may be found in Harpocration , h. v. /z/ increased so much , that Isocrates could say , it was was almost better to be a poor man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to them. * Secondly : There were certain kinds of expenses , which were not estimated at a fixed amount , but were too considerable to be borne by any but the opulent ; we mean those offices which each citizen was obliged to perform in his turn , and at his own expense , ( Ag ; roty/a/ ) . t To this class belonged partly the charge of the public festivals and shows , banquets and bands of music connected with them ; and partly , at least in Athens , and probably in other maritime towns , the fitting out of the gallies . The first class of these expenses , was by its nature a permanent one ; and the other was almost , though not perfectly so . They were borne by the citizens in rotation ; and those who were free one year , were obliged to defray them the next . But they , especially the first , were the more oppressive , as they were not fixed at any certain amount ; but depended not merely on the wants of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxes on property are attended with one great difficulty , that they can not be apportioned out without a knowledge of the fortunes of each contributor . But they depend also more than any other on correctness of moral sentiment and on public spirit . Where these exist , ( and they can no where more prevail , than in such civil communities as the Grecian states , ) there is no need of returns on the part of those who *Isocrat. de Pace . Op. p. 185. /q/ are to be taxed , nor of any inquisition on the part of the state . Confidence is reposed in the conscience of the contributor ; and examples may be found in history , of states in which even a suspicion of any insincerity was almost unheard of. * In the Grecian cities , at least in Athens , very severe measures were in the later periods made use of against those , who were suspected of concealing the true state of their fortunes , or whom it was desired to vex in that manner . They could be compelled to exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.f But in better times , such measures , though perhaps permitted , seem never to have been usual . A division was made into classes according to the income ; such as had been established in Athens , by the regulations of Solon . These classes presupposed an estimate of property ; $ but whether this was made in the Grecian cities as accurately as the census of the Romans , is a question which we must leave undecided . /z/ The indirect taxes , by which we mean the duties paid on the importation and exportation of articles , * As in several of the late German imperial towns . The author is acquainted with one , in which the contributions were thrown into a box , unexamined ; and yet the amount of the whole was previously known , with almost perfect exactness . t The itvntairiis .

He who possessed no property , XT*/** ovfa , paid a poll tax ; his person being reckoned as a capital of two minae ( about thirty dollars ) , he paid the tax due on such a sum . Aristot . I. c. /z/ as also on their consumption , were probably as common in the Grecian cities , as those above mentioned . The instance of the city Menda , which we have already cited , shows that they were preferred , at least in some instances to the direct taxes . Much that related to them , was decided by the situation and chief employment of the cities . The duties were naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial towns , than to the cities of the interior . But where these taxes were introduced , they were a constant source of income ; while the taxes on property were each time imposed anew . From this it naturally resulted , that they were chiefly destined to meet the usual expenditures . Our knowledge of the organization of the Grecian customs , is very imperfect . Yet we can not doubt , that duties were almost universally common . But they were most probably limited to the seaports and harbours ; in connexion with these , they are almost always mentioned ; * I know of no instance of customs in the interior . They were , according to Aristotle , levied on imported and exported articles . f In Athens , the customs are frequently mentioned by the orators ; in Thessaly they formed the chief source of the revenue ; J and they were not of less moment in Macedonia .

This comparison is the more just , as the duties of Byzantium , no less than those in the Sound , have been the occasion even of a war.J These examples , of which the number could easily be increased , are quite sufficient to prove , that duties were very generally exacted in the seaports . The principle , according to which the customs were regulated , had nothing in view but the increase of the public revenue ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the encouragement and direction of domestic industry . At least we have never been able to find any hint to that effect . But the tariff seems to have been very different in the several cities , and for the different articles of merchandise . At Byzantium , the duty was ten per cent , on the value of the wares . $ The Athenians , on the contrary , when they imposed duties in the harbours of their allies during the Peloponnesian war , exacted only five per cent . In Athens itself , there were , at least in the time of Demosthenes , several articles which paid a duty of but two per cent . IT To this class belonged all corn introduced into Athens ; ** and several other * Thucyd. iv . 28. t Demosth . Op. i. p. 475 . Namely between Byzantium and Rhodes . Demosth . Op. 1 . p. 475 .

It may be asked , if this was also the case in Greece ? I do not doubt that it was ; but in the Grecian cities , as in Rome and perhaps in the whole of the ancient world , these taxes were imposed in but one very simple form . They were connected with the markets . Whatever was there offered for sale , paid a duty ; and hence this duty is mentioned only with reference to the markets . And I find no proof , that the taxes on consumption received in any ancient state the same extent , which they have acquired in several modern countries . $ Beside the taxes already enumerated , there were other particular ones on various articles of luxury . Thus in Ephesus , a tax was paid for wearing gold on the clothes ; and in Lycia , for wearing false hair .

In all the Grecian cities , the indirect taxes , especially the duties , were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a much greater degree in several of the monarchical states of antiquity ; in the Grecian republics , it seems to have been restricted to the indirect taxes . It is generally known , that in Athens the duties were farmed ; but the same was the case in Byzantium , in Macedonia , and in other places , f Demosthenes distinguishes three classes of persons who were interested in this transaction ; those who rented this branch of the revenue ; their bondsmen ; and the inspectors and receivers. ! It would be superfluous to speak of the great evils of this arrangement ; but has it not been preserved by much larger states in modern Europe ? One important question still remains : In the Grecian cities , who had the right of fixing the taxes ? The political science of the moderns has regarded it as one of the most important points , as the peculiar characteristic of a free constitution , that the government should not be permitted to impose taxes without the consent of the people ; given directly , or by consent of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same custom probably prevailed ; yet it is remark - *A general income tax of ten per cent , on all employments , was laid by king Tachus in Egypt , at the instance of Chabrias . Aristot. 1 . c. p. 394 . Though executed in Egypt , the idea was that of a Greek ; and Pitt must resign his claim to the invention of the Income tax . t See the passages cited above , which prove this . /z/ able that no particular value was ever set upon this privilege ; and much less was it ever considered ' a criterion of political liberty . The whole system of taxation , we have already remarked , was not viewed from the same elevated point which is now taken ; nor can this principle be fully developed , except where the representative system is introduced . But properly speaking , the whole subject was considered by the Greeks from a very different side . Their magistrates were bound to acknowledge the obligation of laying their accounts before the people . This was the characteristic of freedom. * Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much less importance by whom the taxes are imposed . But this question hardly admits of a general answer in the Grecian cities . It can not be doubted that the difference of constitutions produced differences in this matter ; but if from the want of documents this is only a conjecture , it is on the other hand certain , that the difference of the taxes must have produced such a variety . The regular and abiding taxes were fixed by laws ; which in part were expressly called ancient laws.f The sum which was allotted in Athens for the annual expense of the public sacrifices , was fixed by the laws of Solon at six talents.J For this purpose , no other appropriations were needed . The tariffs of the duties and taxes on consumption were in like manner established laws , which , as their very names indicate , were doubtless granted by the people ; who * See above , page 176. t Demosth . Op. i. p. 462 . J See Lysias in Nicomacb . Or . Gr. v. p. 856 . Demosth. i. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them . Those public charges , which were borne in turn , the trierarchies and the providing of the Chorus , were also established by ancient laws ; * although these offices , especially the first , were , from their very nature , much influenced by the circumstances of the times ; and hence they underwent greater and more frequent changes than any other imposts . That these regulations and their changes could not be made without the consent of the people , will not be doubted by any one , who knows that every thing which the Greeks called a law , op , of 9 could proceed from no other fountain . But what were the regulations respecting those extraordinary imposts , which were hardly less than permanent , those taxes on property , which we comprehend under the name of tribute ( e'rpogoti ) ? That these should have been fixed exclusively by the people , seems so natural in states where the highest authority is possessed by a popular assembly , that it may be thought superfluous to suggest this question . Yet we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes were fixed , not by the people , but solely by the senate . But in Athens , as we may learn from any one of the political orations of Demosthenes , the taxes needed always to be confirmed by the people . It would be too hasty to infer from Athens , that the same was true of all the other Grecian states . But whereever the financial regulations of the other states are mentioned ( unless they were in subjection to a ty- /z/ rant* ) , it is always done in expressions which authorize the conclusion , that the consent of the people or the assembly of the citizens was necessary.f So much the greater variety seems to have prevailed in the administration of the public revenue , not only in the several states , but also at different periods in the same state . Those places and offices which were connected with that administration , were naturally the objects of the greatest competition ; and this alone would be sufficient to explain the changes which were made . But must not the difference of the constitutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain families , distinguished for their wealth and descent , had made themselves the leaders , what could be expected , but that they should obtain the management of the public money ? In the principal cities of Greece , the most remarkable difference is perceptible . At Athens , the council of five hundred had the care of the public money ; in Sparta , this had been secured by the Ephori . A great difference may be supposed to have prevailed in the other Grecian cities ; certainly with respect to the persons who held the offices of collectors and accountants . But we have almost no historical information respecting any place but Athens . * Where tyrants had possessed themselves of the government , they imposed taxes at their own pleasure , as they were not vrututu ; they also adopted various artifices to increase their revenue , such as debasing the coin , &.c.; of which Aristotle , ( Econ . L. ii , has preserved various examples . But where they desired to preserve an appearance of decency , as Dionysius I. in Syracuse , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laid by them before the ixxAWa . Aristot. 1 . c. /q/ Of all forms of government , those of free cities are perhaps the least adapted to the developing of an artificial system of finances . For in them the wants , and the means of satisfying those wants , are commonly very simple . Changes are difficult ; for they presuppose the consent of the commonalty . They who propose them , can hardly expect thanks ; but rather hatred , and even persecution . Hence ancient usage is preserved as much as possible ; and when extraordinary wants occur , recourse is had to extraordinary measures , concerted for the moment , rather than to any change in the existing institutions . It is different in extensive monarchies , where every thing moves more firmly and more regularly ; and though their practice is not so much founded on scientific views as on certain maxims , still it is in them , that an artificial system of finances can be formed . The question , Which is best for the nations ? may be answered by history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt on Greece , because she knew nothing of their doctrines , they should at least remember , that Greece was so happy as to have much less need of them . Where nature has made the support of life sufficiently easy , where there are fewer wants to be satisfied , the arts of industry , which after all have regard only to our physical being , stand on a lower scale . The inhabitant of Otaheite can be happy without the system of Adam Smith ; and though the division of labour could secure greater gain to those islanders , they would hardly be made more contented , because they stand less in need of gain . But even in those modern countries , where the /z/ theories of political economy have been refined with the utmost acuteness , how much notice is taken of them by practical statesmen ? And who are in this case to be censured ? The theorists , or the statesmen , or both ? /q/ /z/ UNLIKE the regulations of our modern states , the judiciary department did not form in Greece a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , it was so intimately connected with the rest , that it can with difficulty be made a separate object of investigation . Hardly any subject in Grecian antiquities is so intricate , or so difficult of explanation ; and yet without a knowledge of it , no correct view of the ancient states can possibly be formed . Our present object is , to develope the general character of the judicial institutions , without entering into particulars respecting the organization of the Attic courts . All that we have to say upon this subject , will find a place in our inquiries concerning that state . The want of accounts is the chief but not the only source of the difficulty , which attends this investigation with respect to every state but Athens . From the want of uniformity , as well as the foreign character of many of the regulations , it would be arduous to take a general survey of the subject , even if the historical documents were abundant . To gain a correct view of it , some attention must be paid to its history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of time and circumstances . The form , there- /z/ fore , which they eventually assumed , could not well correspond to the requisitions of a theory . We are forced to content ourselves on many points with saying that it was so ; without being able to give any satisfactory reasons why it was so . The judicial institutions of a nation proceed from very simple beginnings . Where they are left to be developed by circumstances and the necessities of the times , they can not but become more and more intricate ; since with the progress of culture , new relations arise , both at home and with foreign countries . In the heroic age , kings sat on the tribunals of justice , though even then arbitrators were not unusual. * There existed at that time no written laws ; questions were decided by prescription , and good common sense , directed by a love of justice . When nations begin to emerge from the rude condition of savages , the first necessity which is felt , is that of personal security , and next the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal code and the police laws ; the rights of citizens were defined more slowly , and at a later period ; because it was not sooner necessary . The oldest courts of justice were established very early , probably in the times of the kings . Their immediate object was to pass judgment on the crime of murder and other heinous offences . This was the case with the Areopagus , the most ancient court with which the Greeks were acquainted ; and others were of almost as great an age . The royal governments passed away ; and the popular assemblies took their place . The existing * See above , p. 90. /q/ courts of justice were then by no means abolished ; although in the progress of time , and amidst the revolutions in the forms of government , they could not but undergo various modifications . In the states of modern Europe , the form of the judicial institutions was in a great measure the result of the form of the feudal . In the latter there were different degrees of fealty and submission ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tried by any but his peers . Thus a difference in the courts was necessarily produced . The immediate vassal of the crown recognised only those for his judges , who stood in the same rank with himself , and owed fealty to the same master . The freeman and the villain could not stand before the same tribunal . The same principle , that a man must be tried by his peers , prevailed among the Greeks . But its application must have produced very different results . The community consisted of citizens , who either were or claimed to be equal . It discussed all affairs relating to itself , and hence actions at law among the rest . Thus the common assembly performed the office of judges ; and the foundation of the popular courts of justice was laid . A political notion now prevailed , a notion never adopted in our modern constitutions ; that it was essential for a citizen to take a part in the administration of justice . Even in those of our modern states which in so many things resemble the Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been suggested and applied . They had adopted the laws of an ancient nation , written in an ancient language ; and to understand them , much learning was required , of which not every one could /z/ be possessed . It was not so in Greece . The laws were in the language of the country ; and although their number gradually increased , they were still accessible to all . Neither was it necessary to retain them in the memory , and have them always present to the mind . The orator during his speech , had a reader at his side with a copy of them . Whenever he referred to any law , it was read aloud ; as is proved by a multitude of examples in Demosthenes and others . Every thing was , however , transacted orally . The judges were not obliged to peruse written documents : they listened , and gave in their votes . All this appears very simple , and easy to be understood . And yet the judicial institutions of Greece , if we should form our opinion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for the most learned antiquarians to find their way out of the labyrinth . The greatest errors are made by those , who , forgetting that the institutions in question were not formed systematically , but practically with the progress of time , endeavour to find the means of explanation in speculative ideas . The first and most important difficulty is presented when we attempt to fix the characteristic difference between the public and private courts . This difference was not only general in the existing states , but was adopted by Plato himself in his sketch of a perfect colony. * These two classes were so distinctly separated , that different expressions were appropriated , not only for the general , but even the particular relations of the one and the other , f * Plato de Legg . L. vi . vol. iv . p. 282. /q/ Certain general ideas , according to which Plato makes the distinction , lay at the bottom of this division . " One class of judicial processes , " says he , * " is formed of the suits which one private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second class , on the contrary , is , when the state believes itself injured by one of the citizens , or when a citizen comes forward to its assistance . 7 ' According to this explanation , nothing would seem simpler , than the difference between public and private processes . But if we compare the objects comprehended under each of the two classes , we shall find many things enumerated as affairs of the state , which to us do not seem to belong to this class . f Of this , two causes may be mentioned . The first is the view which the Greeks entertained of the relation of the individual citizen to the state . The person of the citizen was highly valued ; and could not but be highly valued , because the whole personal condition was affected by the possession of citizenship . An injury done to a private citizen , was therefore in some measure an injury inflicted on the state ; and so far , almost every injustice suffered by the individual , was a public concern . Yet a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury ; nor was it indifferent , whether the rights of person , or only those of property had been violated . bring an action fiy.n and ilftfiout rm S/*i , to be defen Such were the expressions at least in Athens . * Plato 1 . c. fin Athens , e.g. there belonged to this class , besides several other offences , murder , intentional wounds , adultery , &.c.; The public and private processes are enumerated in Sigonius de Repnb . Athen . L. iii , and may be found also in Potter 's Archsol . Grasc. /z/ A second circumstance also had its influence ; prescription for the most part determined what was a crime against the public , and what was but a private concern . But what had once been established by prescription , was ever after valid as a law . Yet who can discover all the causes , perhaps frequently accidental , by which various suits came to be considered in one age or another , as affairs of the public ? It would be ineffectual to attempt to draw very accurately the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most important , but not all criminal cases were regarded as public concerns . This class embraced not merely offences against the state ; though this idea lay at the foundation . We must rather be content with saying , that prescription had caused certain offences to be regarded as public , and others as private matters . The regulations respecting them , were , however , in the Attic law very exact ; and it was firmly established , which processes belonged to the state , and which to individuals . The character of the two classes was essentially distinguished by this ; that in the public affairs , a complaint might be made by any citizen ; and in the private , it could be made only by the injured person , or his nearest relation ; * for in the one case , the state or the whole community was regarded as the injured party ; in the other , only the individual . But whoever brought the suit , it was necessary in private and public concerns for the complainant to enter his complaint before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he charged against the accus- * See the proofs in Sigonius , 1 . c. /q/ ed . The magistrate , before whom the suit was thus commenced , was now obliged to prepare the action , so that it could be submitted to the judges . These judges were either the whole community ; or some particular courts , which may perhaps be best denominated , committees of the people . For the tribunals consisted for the most part of very numerous assemblies , the members of which were selected from the citizens by lot , and were required to be thirty years old , of a good reputation , and in nothing indebted to the state . They were sworn to do their duty ; they listened to the orators , both the accusers and the defendants , to whom a limited time was appointed ; the witnesses were examined , and the affair so far brought to a close , that the court could pronounce its sentence of guilty or not guilty. * In the first case , the nature of the punishment remained to be settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed ; did the nature of the offence render that impossible , the defendant was permitted to estimate the punishment , of which he believed himself deserving ; and the court then decided . Those courts were therefore similar both in their organization and design to our juries ; with this difference , that the latter are with us but twelve in number , while the former were not unfrequently composed of several hundreds . And this is not astonishing , for they occupied the place of the whole community , or might be regarded as committees of the same ; for when suits began to grow frequent , the community could not always be assembled . But where the mem- ' * This was done in Athens partly by votes written on small tablets , and partly by white and black beans . /z/ bers that constituted the tribunal were so numerous , as in the Hehaea at Athens , it is hardly credible , that every action was tried before the whole assembly . It is much more probable , especially when suits were multiplied , that the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial of several causes could proceed simultaneously. * As a difference was made between private and public actions , we might expect to find different tribunals for the one and the other . Yet this was not the case ; suits of both kinds could be entered in the same courts . The difference must therefore have lain in the methods of trial and the legal remedies , ! which the two parties could employ . We are astonished to find , that the rules respecting what suits should come before each particular court were so uncertain , that it would be vuin for us to attempt to settle any general principles on the subject . But at this moment we have in England an example , which shows how vain it is to expect exact regulations , where courts of justice have been formed and enlarged by circumstances . Criminal cases , it is true , belong exclusively to the court of the King 's Bench ; but it shares civil actions with the court of Common Pleas , and the court of Exchequer , in such a manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be said to belong exclusively to either of these tribunals . Our remarks thus far on the organization of the * We would not say , that all trials were necessarily brought before those courts . In Athens the police officers had a jurisdiction of their own ; and affairs belonging to their department appear to have been immediately decided by them . /q/ courts apply immediately to Athens ; but they will without doubt admit of a much wider application to the other Grecian cities . Yet on one point there existed a remarkable difference . Though the popular tribunals were generally introduced , they did not prevail in every state . For if I understand Aristotle rightly , there were no popular tribunals in Sparta , but all processes were there , as in Carthage , decided by magistrates. * If Sparta had had such courts , would they not have been mentioned ? But when Aristotle says in general , that it is the leading characteristic of a democracy , that the citizens should be the judges of one another , ! may we not infer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , that popular tribunals disappeared , wherever the sway of a few was established ? The example of Athens shows in a remarkable manner , how the institution of these popular tribunals could affect the whole character of a state . Such could be the case in Athens , where the greatest extent was given to the public trials , by permitting any who desired , to appear as accusers . The whole organization of the Grecian city governments leads us to believe , that most of the other cities had popular tribunals , which , without having exactly the same form , must have been similar to those of Athens . Such tribunals must have existed in Argos , before the introduction of ostracism , and in Syracuse before the similar method of banishment by petalism came into vogue . But * Aristot .

Polit. vi . 2. /z/ whether the public processes embraced elsewhere as many subjects as at Athens , and as many things , which to us seem to regard the private citizen alone , is a question which we can not decide for want of information . This point has been entirely overlooked by those , who have written 0:1 the judicial institutions of Greece ; for they had Athens only in view , and treated the subject more as one of jurisprudence than of politics . And yet it is of all the most important . The more limited was the number of public suits , the smaller was the possibility of instituting them , unless some personal injury had previously been sustained . In the list of public offences at Athens , there were many , which , by their very nature , were indefinite . Hence it was easy to bring a public action against almost any one . We need but think of an age of curruption , to understand how Athens , after the Peloponnesian war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the orators are so loud in their complaints ; and whom all the measures , first adopted in consequence of the magnitude of the evil , all the danger and punishments to which false accusers were exposed , were never sufficient to restrain . Were other cities , at least the democratic ones , in as bad a condition as Athens ? Here we are deserted by history ; which has preserved for us almost nothing respecting the extent of the public processes and the popular tribunals . But if in Athens several adventitious causes , lying partly in the national character , and partly in the political power of Athens ( for the importance of state trials increases with the importance of the state ) , contributed to multiply this /q/ class of processes ; it by no means follows , that the number was much smaller in most of the other Grecian cities . Popular tribunals are the sources of political revolutions ; and what states abounded in them more than the Grecian ? The man of influence , always an object of envy , was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a ground of accusation ; but the man of influence had the greatest resources without the precincts of the court . He with his party , if he is conscious of possessing sufficient strength , has recourse to arms , and instead of suffering himself to be banished from the city , prefers to terminate the action by driving away his enemies . Were we more intimately acquainted with the history of the numberless political revolutions in Greece , how often would this same succession of events recur ? But though we are not always able to establish them by historical evidence , they can not on the whole be doubted ; and they distinctly exhibit the close connexion which existed between the states and their judicial institutions . /z/ THOUGH wars were so frequent in Greece , the art of war did not make any considerable advances . The constitutions and the whole political condition opposed too many obstacles ; and war never became a science , in the full sense of the word , till standing armies were introduced . This has already been satisfactorily proved by history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did all that talents could do ; but all that they effected was personal . Besides , the extent of states sets limits to improvement These bounds can not be accurately marked , where genius and circumstances exercise so much influence ; but the absolute strength must also necessarily be considered . The advancement and perfecting of the art of war require experiments on so large a scale , that small states can not perform them . After the republican constitutions of the Greeks were established , their armies consisted chiefly of militia . Every citizen was obliged to serve in it , unless the state itself made particular exceptions . In Athens , the obligation continued from the eighteenth to the fifty-eighth year ; we do not know whether it was elsewhere the same ; but a great difference could hardly have existed . Each citizen was therefore a /z/ soldier ; even the inquilini , the resident strangers , were not always spared ; * and there were times of distress , when the very slaves were armed , usually under the promise of their freedom , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , under certain circumstances , very nearly resemble a standing army . Yet the principles on which the two are founded , are very different . The citizen who serves as a soldier , has for his object the defence of his family and his property ; and hence the maxim in states , where the army is composed of citizens , that he who has the most to lose , will make the best soldier . In Rome the poorer class ( capite censi ) , till the times of Marius , was excluded from military service ; and it seems to have been hardly otherwise in Athens.J Yet this poorer class was or grew to be the most numerous ; accustomed to privations , those who composed it were perhaps for that reason the best . fitted for the duties of war .
