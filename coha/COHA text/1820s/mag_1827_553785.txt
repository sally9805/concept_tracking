OF all the sages of antiquity , whose names have been handed down to our time , none have excited so general a notice , as the three wise men of Gotham . The short fragment of the history of these unfortunate navigators hitherto known to us , which records their lamentable fate , has not been the theme of the learned antiquary and studious scholar alone , but is in the mouths of persons of every class , and of all periods of life , from lisping infancy to tremulous old age . Whether this universal interest and sympathy , is to be attributed to the sudden exit of these venerable men ; to the extraordinary character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious brevity of the fragment alluded to , are questions , which , considering the numerous learned disquisitions on less important subjects , we might have expected , would before this , have exercised the ingenuity of many laborious commentators . This , however , has not been the case , and the history of these distinguished philosophers has remained involved in the most profound obscurity up to this time . The documents noticed at the head of this article purport te be the memoirs of these ancient personages . To eonvey // to our readers a just sense of their important bearing upon the present times , it is necessary to say a few words of the state of the sciences , and of public opinion , in our country at this period . it has no doubt been remarked , that whilst all other parties among men , whether of a religious , political , literary , or any other nature , have come by the force of circumstances , from time to time , to change their character , subside , and amalgam .. ate , the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes the one , and sometimes the other , claiming to be the superior in acquirements and intelligence . From a very early period , however , there has been this great advantage observable on the side of the ancients , that notwithstanding the moderns had the field to themselves , and might use what arguments they pleased , without the fear of a reply from their opponents , yet sooner or later all the moderns were found to go over to the party of the ancients , whereas no ancient was ever known to become a modern . This circumstance operated so powerfully in favor of the ancients , and by degrees so greatly increased their numbers , that the moderns a long time since , yielded up the victory to them , and freely acknowledged their own inferiority . Insomuch , that , until towards the close of the last century , these last , from generation to generation , have been accustomed , with a praiseworthy modesty , to look back upon their ancestors , who lived centuries before them , as the only genuine source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider themselves as mere children , bound to receive , and observe with reverence , the information handed down to them from earlier and wiser ages . The obscurity which time threw around the characters and writings of antiquity only served to increase their reputation ; and the venerable black letter had its just influence , being ever the more respected the less it was understood . But when the great school of children of this Western world , undertook to break their leading strings , and commenced a general barring out of their masters , the froward spirit which led to this act of disobedience carried them on to still greater extravagancies , and they began to pretend that they were as wise as their ancestors . This long exploded opinion they supported with such arguments as these . That although it could not be denied that the individuals then living , were much younger than their ancestors , who lived a thousand years before , still it was to be recollected , // that the world was just so much the older ; and that inasmuch as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and knowledge obtained by the world since the existence of their ancestors , added to that of their ancestors themselves , must plainly be somewhat greater than that of the latter taken alone . These and other like arguments operated so powerfully , as soon to bring a majority of people in this country over to that way of thinking , and to a belief that our ancestors were by no means so wise as they had been said to be . The great success and spread of these opinions , at length so inflated the moderns , that they began to lay aside all reserve , and openly to assert , that there was no science , art , invention , or discovery of any consequence which had not originated , within the last fifty years , or been so improved upon , as that they were justly entitled to the merit of it ; the great advancement made in these things , they attributed to the rapid march of mind ' within that period , and pretended to look upon the first six thousand years of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in three things particularly , that the moderns boast to have utterly surpassed all that was ever done or thought of in former times , and by which they expect to secure to this age the admiration and gratitude of all future ones . The first of these is the invention of the woman mac/tine , whereby the productive power of mankind in the making of cottons , kerseys , &amp;c. is increased to a most wonderfnl degree , and the most important parts of female education greatly improved upon . And of this machine the moderns claim to be the original and sole inventors . Secondly , the bringing of the common law to a pitch of perfection , such as was never before imagined to be possible . Thirdly , the introduction and prosecution of the science of phrenology , a science said by knowing men to be fraught with more important consequences to mankind than any other ever before pursued . Now upon an examination of the work before us , it appears that these three ancients represent themselves to be proficients in these very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have perfected in these latter days . In a matter of so great importance as this , a regard , as well to the reputation of those venerable ancients , as to the just rights of the present age , makes it our duty as impartial critics , to examine and decide upon the respective pretensions of the twQ parties . // The learned editor in his preface gives the following account of the manner in which those remarkable papers first came to light . A great Oxford antiquary , of whom it has been said that he remembered whatever others forgot , and forgot whatever other people remembered , speaks of the " Merry Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham , " a work in great repute in his time , when the kindest name given to a philosopher , was that of madman , a phrase which often saved him from the stake or the block . This work was long supposed to be extinct , but at length came to light , not long since , at Mr Bindley 's sale , and was bought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deplorable ignorance of two munificent noblemen , who little suspected that it was the only copy in the known world , and for that reason considered it as worth nothing ' . ' The work is divided into three distinct memoirs or narrations , said to have been delivered individually by the three wise men during their perilous voyage , and giving a minute account of their experiences in the prosecution of the three sciences in which they were proficients . We shall take up these several memoirs separately , in their order , and state our reasons for thinking as we do , that the learned editor has been imposed upon by some invidious modern , who having arrived at such a period of life as made it certain that he must soon become an ancient , took the opportunity , whilst it was yet within his power , to do something in favor of the party which he was about to be connected with ; and for that purpose , to use a legal phrase , first pirated the most remarkable improvements and inventions of the moderns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these memoirs purports to be that of the Man Machine , or the Pupil of Circumstances . ' The account of his birth and initiation into the science of productive labor is thus described . I was born , began the first Wise Man of Gotham , in a country that I- consider unworthy of my nativity , and for that reason I shall do all in my power to deprive it of the honor , by not mentioning its name . I am , moreover , descended from a family , which must necessarily be of great antiquity , since , like all old things , it has long since fallen into decay . My father had little or no money , but was blesseA with the poor man 's wealth , a fruitful wife // and great store of children . Of these I am the eldest ; but at the period I shall commence my story , we were all too young to take care of ourselves , until the fortunate discovery was made by some great philanthropist , that little children , of six or seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day without stinting their minds , ruining their health , or destroying their morals . This improvement in the great science of PRODUCTIVE LABOR , delighted my father-it was shifting the onus , as the lawyers say , from his own shoulders to that of his children . He forthwith bound us all over to a cotton manufactory , where we stood upon our legs three times as long as a member of congress , that is to say , fourteen hours a day , and among eight of us , managed to earn a guinea a week . The old gentleman , for gentleman he became from the moment he discovered his little flock could maintain him-thought he had opened a mine . He left off working , and took to drinking and studying the mysteries of political economy and productive labor . He soon became an adept in this glorious science , and at length arrived at the happy conclusion , that the whole moral , physical , political and religious organization of society , resolved itself into making the most of human labor , just as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other beasts of burden . ' pp. 21 , 22 . This wise man , whose name is Harmony , goes on to give , at great length , a minute description of the science of productive labor as exemplified in the management of a cotton factory . We think it will be apparent to our readers that the object is , under the feigned name of a man machine , to decry and run down that most useful and remarkable invention of modern tim&amp;s called a woman machine . The more fully to show that the moderns nre justly entitled to the merit of this invention , and that the slurs cast upon it by this writer are altogether groundless , we shall shortly state how , and when , this machine came first to be invented in this country ; explain the mode of its construction ; and briefly notice the very important uses to which it is applied . The invention of the woman machine , as can be incontestibly proved , first came about in this manner . As soon as the people of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , and discharged themselves of their ancestors , all classes of persons here began to thrive and multiply exceedingly , but more especially females ; insomuch that our political economists suggested a fear that , in process of time , the whole country would get to be overrun with women , unless some check was put to them . Now our mechanical geniuses , casting theit // eyes around in search of cheap materials to work with , which is a great object with them , and seeing large stores of girls in all directions apparently useless , caught the idea , that it would answer an excellent purpose to work them lip into machinery , and so planned the woman machine , the mode of constructing which is after this fashion . You take from one hundred and fifty to two htmdred youths , varying the number according to the intended size of your machine ; they should be rather of a tender age , from ten to fifteen years is preferable , and mostly females , say not less than nine tenths . After well sorting these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed of brick or stone , near a considerable head of water ; on the several floors of this building are to be placed various piecesof machinery , called mulc* , spinning jcnmes , double speeders , &amp;c . Then having distributed the girls about the rooms according to your taste and judgment , you attach one or more of them , as circumstances may require , to each piece of machinery , and the whole machine is ready for use . A machine thus prepared and put together is called a mannfactory . The principal rule to be observed in the working ot'it , is to keep it in as constant operation as possible ; the best regulated ones , not being stopped more than three times a day , for about twenty minutes at a time , to oil the wheels and feed the girls . After adhering strictly to this course for two or three years the girls are found , as it were , to become a part of the other machinery , so that neither of them can go to any purpose without being put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to a carriage , or a carriage without a wheel . And when the whole machine is in motion , the double speeder and spinning jenny part , appears to be just as much alive as the girl part . The principal advantages of this machine , as enumerated by the inventors , appear to be these ; that a great part of the machinery , as before mentioned , being made out of a very cheap material , goods can be manufactured by them at a much lower rate than in the old way , and so our English and other competitors derive from our market . That by this mode of educating females , four of the principal natural defects in their characters are eradicated , or greatly lessened ; which has never before been known to he effected by any other course of education ; namely , first , a frequent restlessness and fondness for running about ; secondly , a too free use of speech ; thirdly , a constant desire for med // dung in other persons ' concerns to the neglect of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authority of parents , husbands , and guardians ; for the curing of which defects , some dozen years ' steady exercise in one of these machines is said to be a most valuable and certain specific , so that it is confidently expected , that by a very general establishment of them , the world will shortly become a very quiet and peaceable place , that all riotous , routous , and noisy assernbla 6es will cease , and that , excepting at Congress and in the state legislatures , excessive talking will only be persisted in when it is to some purpose . From this statement our readers will plainly see that this machine is unquestionably of modern invention , and that so far from failing to accomplish the purposes contemplated , it promises to be of the greatest advantage to society , whether viewed as a most useful seminary for the education of females , or a cheap manufacturing machine . The second memoir is that of quominus ; and it narrates the great exertions and sacrifices he made , in pursuing the study of the Perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus introduces the subject . " My brother Harmony , " said Mr Quominus , the second Wise Man of Gotham , " has fallen a sacrifice to the perfectibility of man ; I , on the contrary , am a martyr to the Perfection of Reason . I was born in a country , where they have sufficient wisdom to make their own laws , but not quite enough , as it would seem , to understand them afterwards . In order to remedy this singular inconvenience , they resorted to a method equally singular , and original . They enlisted the wise men of other nations in their behalf ; and justly considering that it was quite a sufficient effort of human wisdom for one country to make its own laws , they deterinined to resort to another for their iiiterpretation . Accordingly , they made a vast number of laws , believing they could not have too much of a good thing , and then sent beyond sea to get them explained . In a couple of hundred years , these explanations , being all carefully recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly size , containing upon an ayerage , each , one hundred contradictory interpretations of different wise men . Such a mass of wisdom , and such a variety of opinions , supported by such unanswerable arguments , never got together under the same roof in this world . Some very aged persons , who had lived long enough to get about half througl* this invaluable collection , discovered that it was like the sermon that // suited any text , and the text that suited any sermon ; for every man could find in it a decision , or at least an opinion , to suit his purl ) ose . A system so supported on all sides , by all sorts of opinions , certainly merited the honor of being called a science ; and such a science , as certainly , deserved a respectable name . It was accordingly aptly denominated THE PERFECTION OF REASON , because it furnished every man , however different his opinions might be , with reasons in support of them . In addition to this great requisite of every perfect system , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , it was affirmed , possessed another irresistible claim to the dignified appellation it had obtained . It can not be denied , said the admirers of this science , that although the laws are expressly devised to settle such disputes , or conflicting claims , as might otherwise occasion a resort to force , still it is never the intention of a wise legislator , that people should actually appeal to them for this purpose . They are merely to be held up in terrorem , or rather like buoys , to float on the surface of society , for the purpose of warning mankind of the shoals and quicksands below . In this point of view , then , it is apparent , that the more intricate and inconsistent the laws , and the more various and contradictory their interpretations , the greater delay and expense there will be found in settling appeals to them , and consequently the number of lawsuits be greatly diminished . Thus , when the laws become perfectly unintelligible , they are absolutely perfect , for then nobody in their senses will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the manner of a scarecrow , which frightens the birds from the corn , merely by flourishing its unintelligible rattle . Thus you see , that no other name than that of the perfection of reason , could possibly have suited this excellent science . ' pp. 145-147 . And here again our readers will perceive , if they take the trouble to go through the narrative , that the sole object of it is to ridicule that most important and most ancient of all sciences , the common law , and particularly the great improvements made upon it by the moderns . Nor ought we to be greatly surprised at such an attempt . Experience shows us , that let a science be carried to any state of perfection , however great , there are always found persons enough prepared to pick out some defects in it . For at all periods of the world two principal paths have been pursued in the attaining of distinction , which , though widely apart at their setting off , are found to lead out to the same eminence . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other // by finding fault with everything well done by our neighbors . Which latter being by far the easier road , is therefore much the more frequented . A very hasty sketch of the principles and foundations of the common law , and of ' the most remarkable improvements made upon it within a few years , will convince any one of the incor. - rectness of the views which this memoir would give of that distinguished science . Municipal law , or the law as applicable to particular societies , ' the learned Mr Justice Blackstone says , in his Commentaries , vol. i. p. 34 , is properly defined to be , a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state , commanding what is right , and prohibiting what is wrong . ' It must be apparent , therefore , to the smallest mind , that the essential requisites of good laws are these ; first , that they should be reasonable and applicable to the times and to the persons upon which they are to operate ; and , secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them easily to be come at by all parts of the community . We shall proceed to show that these requisites are most remarkably conspicuous in the common law , and , indeed , are the grounds of that just preference which is given to this over the civil and statute law . And to the first point we will cite what is laid down by the learned Lord Coke on this subject , namely , that the common law is the very perfection of human reason . ' And this , to the minds of all enlightened jurists , at once settles the matter , my Lord Coke being considered the very oracle of the common law , and no equal authority being to be found to the contrary . But in respect that many of our readers may not be so well versed in the legal rules of reasoning , we shall no doubt more satisfactorily prove to them the reasonableness of the common law , and its especial applicability to the present state of the world , by stating the fact that these laws are not written rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mistakes in the printing , and to the interpolations of interested persons , and the misconstructions of feeble or perverse minds . Nor have any of them been made in modern times , so as that they might be fashioned to suit any partic*ular parties , persons , or purposes . But they are a collection of customs , never committed to writing , but handed down to us by tradition , and were first adopted , nobody knows when , why , nor by whom . And , as Mr Justice Blackstone says , the maxims and customs so collected are of higher antiquity than memory or history can reach , nothing being more difficult than // to ascertain the precise beginning , and first spring , of an ancient and long established custom . ' And so my Lord Hale says , The original of the common law is as undiscernible as the head of the Nile . ' And indeed in this seems to consist the very essence and excellency of these customs , for so soon as any one can ascertain the commencement and original reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as see Blackstone 's Commentaries , vol. i. p. 70 , So that if any one can show the beginning of it , it is no good custom . ' From which preceding remarks and authorities our intelligent readers are no doubt fully satisfied that the common law is admirably well adapted to our times , and in the highest degree reasonable , for although the learned Mr Christian in his notes upon the Commentaries , alleges , that it can not be dissembled that there are decisions drawn from established principles and maxims , which are good law , though such decisions may be manifestly absurd and unjust , ' and that precedents and rules must be followed , even when they are flatly absurd and unjust , ' thereby plainly hinting that these precedents and maxims are sometimes absurd and unjust , yet fortunately the learned Blackstone himself has furnished us with a very ready way of getting over such difficulties , for , ' says he , speaking of the rules of the common law , though their reason be not obvious at first view , yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that they acted wholly without consideration ; ' which key to the proper understanding and due digestion of many rules of the common law , has been of infinite assistance , and is much used , in the study and practice of that science . Having thus satisfactorily disposed of the first point , we proceed to show how easily an acquaintance with this law may be attained to . Now these rules of the common law , upon a due knowledge and observance of which the life and property of every member of the community in a great measure depend , are not , as we have before observed , written out and collected in one or more books or sets of books , as the civil and statute law are , so that a person should have occasion *o know how to read , and Teflect , and reason , in order to come to a knowledge of them ; but very happily for us are stored up in the breasts of divers learned judges , whence they are to be extracted by a certain process , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a desire to be informed of his own rights , or those of his neighbor , in any particular , instead of tumbling over musty books , to // the great waste of his time and injury of his eyes , has only to set about such a process , in which he is very kindly and willing . " ly assisted by gentlemen of the bar , so called , ( great numbers of xvhorn are always at hand , ready for such undertaking ) when after a few years constant attendance upon courts , and the lay . " ing out of several small sums of money , not worth mentioning , he will obtain a sufficient knowledge of the point in question , by a regular decision of the jud0es . And this course of inquiry being free to every one , rich or poor , high or low , all classes and mei*crs of society have by these means an equal opportunity of enjoying the laws of their country . Nor ought we to neglect mentio*ug here what puts this mode of acquiring a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several sufficient reasons , the legal information , once obtained after this manner , lays such good hold upon the memory as seldom or never to be forgotten for the rest of one 's life . But notwithstanding the plain excellencies of the common law , many persons said , and perhaps it may be thought with some reason , that if people were only able to ascertain what the law was after it was decided against them , it was no better than ex post ficto law , and therefore contrary to all justice ; and that all the rules and maxims of the common law ought to be collected and written out plain in some book , so that any person might go to it and suit himself , according to his case . Upon which , and many other like suggestions , it was set about to improve the old system . And this was done in the only feasible way , namely , by creating at once a great abundance of new judges , of all sorts and kinds , from whom , by a constant employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law might in a short time be extracted . In addition to these , nurnerous learned reporters were also appointed , whose duty it should be , to write out at length , and publish under their own hands , the decisions of the judges . By which judicious means these said rules and maxims of the common law have now got to be so well collected and reduced to writing , that it is thought Con. " congress will shortly have to set apart one of the western territories for the sole purpose of storing away the numerous books of reporCs containing them ; after the manner of a careful housewife , who is always known to appropriate some one chamber in her house to the purpose of a rubbish room . Nor did this rapid extraction of the common law fail of producing the advantages expected from it . For it often happened before this , that when persons who chanced // to fall into some small dispute with each other , came to examine into the law on the subject , they either found no adjudicated cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were very like to be all on one side of it , which greatly disappointed one of the parties and much discouraged useful judicial investigations . Whereas since the better settlement of the law by the multiplication of valuable reports , numerous decisions may be found , not only applicable to every case that can arise , but also to every side of it , so that both parties apply with equal confidence to the legal tribunals , and are said to be reclus in curke , or to stand right in court , which , freely rendered , we understand to mean , start fair , it being impossible to conjecture on which side the weight of law is , until all the cases are regularly cited by the counsel and counted by the court . These striking improvements on the common law as administered by our ancestors , raised such an enthusiasm in favor of the new system of things , that even the judges themselves fell in with it , and began to make experiments , so that notwithstanding it had always heretofore been the received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother country , that the wisdom of a judge lies principally in his wig , and that he might as well appear upon the bench without his head upon his shoulders , as without his wig upon his head ; yet in their warmth , with one accord , and in the face and eyes of all precedents , they pulled their venerable hair wigs off their heads and converted them into seats , in the shape of hair cushions , alleging that the administration of justice was thereby rendered much more easy . But of all the sciences cultivated in these times , the sublime science of Phrenology is that upon which the moderns most pride themselves ; a science calculated to give us a perfectly new view of mankind . To attack this important science , the favorite of distinguished heads , seems to be the aim of the third and last memoir . The name given to this wise man is Le Peigne , and he describes in the following extract his unexpected and extraordinary meeting with the first phrenologist . My bfother Harmony , began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been shipwrecked in pursuit of the Perfectibility of Man ; and my brother Quominus has fallen a victim to the Perfection of Reason , or the Wisdom of Ages , I can hardly tell which : I , on the contrary , am the martyr of science . // 1827 . The Wise Men of Gotheun . I was born and educated in the most scientific , literary , and philosophical city in the world , for the women were all blues and the men metaphysicians . In truth , I may say , with perfect veracity , there were so many people running after science , that there were not sciences enongh for them to run after . The business was overdone ; the game was exhausted , as in countries too thickly settled and too much cultivated ; and nothing was left for them but the invention of new sciences , to give them employmerit . Besides , such had been the unwearied industry , the deep sagacity , with which they bad pursued the old sciences , that they had driven them from their most secret recesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , in fact , pulled them by the ears , as it were , out of every hole and corner where they had entrenched themselves for ages . Strangers , who were allured to the city by the fame of its learning , obseryed with astonishment , that the women could call every thing by its scientific name , and that even the very children talked nearly as wisely as the best of them . Learning , science , and philosophy were becoming vulgar , insomuch that several people of the highest rank and fashion , began to study ignorance , and actually sent their children to school to unlearn every thing . It was high time , therefore , for the lovers of science to begin to look about them ; for the writers and lecturers upon the old Grey Beard mathematics , philosophy , botany , and chemistry , instead of an audience of pretty fashionables , with nodding plumes , were content to confine their instructions to classes of rusty students , who actually came for no other purpose than to learn . The fashionable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax themselves with political economy and metaphysics ; and a universal alarm prevailed , when a great heiress , who was considered the bulwark of the blues , backslided , and married a regular dan* dy , with a thin waist and no learning . It was high time to get up something new for these people , and as the natives of our isle are more apt to improve upon the inventions of others than to invent anything themselves , I was selected by a coterie of philosophers , and sent out into the world to discover a new plaything for these grown up children of knowledge . I travelled , and travelled , and travelled , as the storybooks say , over divers countries that have neither latitude nor longitude ; I visited all the colleges , scientific institutions , and bedlams * sought out the most learned and adventurous philosophers of christendom ; consulted the Pundits of India , the Chingfoos of China , the Dervises of Turkey , and the Jugglers of the Flathead Indians of the Missouri . In short , I ransacked the uttermost ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XXJV. - NO. 54* // many , to my native city , with a firm conviction that there was nothing new under the sun , when an unexpected adventure befell me on the eve of a long day 's journey . Owing to various untoward accidents , one of which was the lameness of my horse , I had been overtaken by twilight in the midst of the forest of Tentoburgium , not far , as it afterwards proved , from the spot where Varus and his legions had been cut off by the German hero Arminius . As the night gathered thick around me , obscured into Cimmerian darkness by the overarching shades , I became more and more confused and uncertain of my way . I heard the growling of bears , the howling of wolves , the hooting of owls , and the shrill whistle of the bandit , mingling with the sighing and moaning of winds as they wandered in the impenetrable shades . At length my progress was arrested by a cold and heavy hand , forcibly applied to my mouth , with such excellent aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entirely and prevented me from calling for help , had I bethought myself of doing it . So forcible was the blow , that it knocked me from my horse , and I lay on the ground for a few moments insensible to everything around me . As I gradually recovered , the pain of my fall , the loneliness of my situation , and the apprehension that the bandit would return with his companions , and finish , perhaps , what he had begun , overcame me entirely , and I groaned at intervals aloud . Nothing for a time answered me , but the dismal echoes of the forest , and once or twice the neighings of what I snpposed my own horse , who had wandered to a distance . At length , however , my cries were answered by a voice which seemed close to my ear . " Who and what art thou , that thus wanderest alone , at midnight , on the spot where the bones of tens of thousands have been bleaching for ages ? " cried a hollow and tremulous voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from a far distant country , travelling the earth in search of a new science . " " Thou hast hit the nail on the head , " replied the invisible voice . " Follow me , give me thy hand , thou art a lucky man , and hast been born , without doubt , with a silver spoon in thy mouth . " " But my horse , " quoth I. lie is safe , " replied the voice , taking me by the hand . As I lifted it to my lips in token of thankfulness , I started back with horror . It smells of mortality ! " cried I. " True-It hath handled nothing but the bones of Yarns and his legions , for in ore than thirty years . " Art thou a sexton ? " // " A grave digger ? " " Follow me , and thou shalt know . " I again gave him my hand with tremhling reluctance , and we struck to the ri* ht in a direction towards a dim light , which till now escaped my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of a cave which descended gently into the bosom of the earth , through a passage dimly lighted by a lamp , leading into an apartment that struck me with inexpressible dismay . It was a charnelhouse of skulls , which I took for granted appertained to thousands of murdered wretches , made away with by a band of robbers , of which this wily old wretch was the stoolpigeon , or chief , I hardly knew which . His whole appearance was a composition of sul ) ernatural horrors . Thare did not seem a drop of blood in his body , or an ounce of fi *sh on his bones . His eye , deep sunk in his head , glimmered dimmer than the half expiring lamp which obscured rather than illuminated the passage by which we had descended ; and his cheeks , for want of the support of teeth , had sunk in on either side , and met together lovingly in the roof of his mouth . His head was without a single hair , and the glossy surface of the skull , divided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map . Each of these was numbered after the manner of sheet maps , teaching children geography . " Gracious heaven ! " exclaimed I , mentally , " he is not only a robber hut a necromancer perhaps one of the infernal quizzical imps of Number Nip ! perhaps the wooden demon himself . This forest has long been famous for evil doings , and these lines and figures are doubtless the spell by which this diabolical caitiff works his infernal ends . " I cast my eyes from the necromancer to the paraphernalia by which he was surrounded . Nothing was seen but skulls piled up in various recesses , or lying about in horrible confusion , so that at every step , they rolled beneath my feet , and grinned in my face , as if in scorn of these impotent injuries . The rest of the embellishments of this Golgotha , have escaped my recollection , for as I continued to stare around , my courage deserted me , my senses wandered , arid I trembled from head to foot . " Thou art cold and doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was inhospitable not to offer thee something to eat . " He then arose and went to an obscure part of the cave .

I would give thousands for your skull . Why , sir , you must be a universal genius . You have the finest collection of organs in the world . You are a poet , a mechanic7 a chymist , a philosopher , a musician , a lover of children , an artist , a metaphy. * sician , and anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very few words will be sufficient to vindicate this remarkable science from the aspersions thrown upon it in this memoir . it had always heretofore been supposed since Adam first shoxved his face in the world , that the passions , propensities , and mental qualifications of a man were best expressed by the front side of his head , whereas this science teaches that they are only to be correctly judged of by the backside ; thereby entirely changing the face of things , and clearly showing that our ancestors have all along been looking upon the wrong side of them . Which sufficiently accounts for the slow progress the world has been making until within a few years past ; and also for the sudden start it has lately taken . It has ever been a universal sentiment that the most important study of mankind is man ; notwithstanding which , and the great apparent opportunities we have of examining individual character , such have been the peculiar difficulties of the subject , that a very imperfect knowledge , after all , has ever been obtained of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most approved means of judging of a man 's character was by observing his conduct ; which could only be conclusively determined upon after he had closed his life , nor was this test a perfect one ; for who could decide how the same person would have acted , exposed to the operation of different circumstances . And , indeed , it is one of the tritest maxims , that so far from easily ascertaining the character of others , it is one of the severest tasks to become acquainted with our own . Now , through the help of this science of phrenology , all such difficulties are at once done away with ; and by a mere glancing of our eyes , or even momentary application of our fingers , to the heads of our neighbors , we are as certainly informed of what they can and will do , as by our experience of what they have done . Thereby changing future time at once into present ; a thing which people at all times of life have continually desired to do , but never before been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned grammarians . We have not time to notice all the beneficial changes which this science is expected to work in our customs , manners , and laws ; they may , however , in some small measure , be judged of by a single instance . To take a principal one in the law . A man commits a murder ; society is put in great terror , and to great expense and trouble in catching the felon and bringing him to justice , when after all he may get off , for the want of sufficient evidence of the fact , and commit half a dozen more like crimes before he can be legally hung ; it being a rule of some of our courts not to punish a man for any offence before he can be proved to have committed it . Now observe the effects of this science ;  --  a man in walking the streets , riding in a stage coach , sitting in the theatre or anywhere else , sees a person before him with a fully developed murder bump on the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the criminal is forthwith seized without having an opportunity to escape ; and this being a matter of easy proof , he may be tried , condemned , sentenced , and executed off hand . Fot it certainly is a matter of equal justice whether you hang a man before or after thecrirne , provided only you are satisfied that , if left unhung , he would be sure to commit it ; and moreover the being beforehand with him , has this great advantage , that you thereby save the life of the murdered person . But we might as well attempt to count the stars , as to enumerate the various excellencies of this wonderful science . Nor is // it necessary . The obvious advantages of having an accurate chart of every man 's character drawn out upon his head for gerieral inspection must be sufficiently apparent . Having thus explained the origin and the important uses of the several sciences which are attempted to be decried by the book before us , we hope we have convinced our readers that these memoirs are in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three distinguished ancients to whom they are attributed . But if we should have failed in this , still there is one science of jeat and increasing repute at the present day , not noticed in these memoirs , and which has so plainly grown out of the prevailing opinions of these times that we can not but think that the claims of the moderns to it are unquestionable . We refer to the novel science of inversion or transposition . As soon as our late peace with Great Britain had set the people of this country at their ease , and given them an opportunity of turning their attention to peaceful and speculative subjects , having , as we before observed , effectually discarded their ancestors , they began soon to examine with a careful and scrutinizing eye the foundations and merits of many of the old established opinions and principles received from them , and which had for centuries past controled the minds and influenced the conduct of mankind . Among these , their attention was particularly attracted to that universal and lon6 continued custom among men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiser sort gave out , that this was nothing more than an old prejudice , and a very injurious one , and no more natural to man than to other animals , but only a foolish fashion of our ancestors , which ought to be immediately corrected . And they said it was so far from according with the nature of things and the order of the universe to have the head always uppermost , that the most approved and received theories of the motion of the planets and the diurnal rotation of the earth showed that mankind ought to be heels over head at least half the time . These opinions were immediately caught up and assented to by such politicians as were of the prevailing parry at this tine in the country , who said that the usurpation , tyranny , and infringements upon the rights of the people , which had vexed the political world for so many ages , were chiefly owing to some persons carrying their heads too high . The medical men , too , assisted in attempting to reform this custom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bad habit // of keeping the head always uppermost , that most of the mental and bodily disorders of mankind might be traced , and particularly that worst one of all , called dyspepsia . In pursuance of these opinions , and in order to effect as rapid and radical a change of this mischievous habit as possible , corporations were formed , and schools established in our principal cities ) called Gymnasiums , where all those who had hitherto been goii*g head over heels to the injury of their health , the distress of their friends , and the detriment of society , might endeavor to mend their ways by learning to go heels over head . The same system of education , after mature examination , has also been introduced , as we are informed , into some of our most distinguished universities , where it is said to have taken the place of the Hebrew and other dead languages , it being a general opinion , that if much of the time which has heretofore been bestowed upon the heads of the youth there , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more apparent ; so that at these venerable seats of science you may daily see learned philosophers , professors , and alumni with their heels where their heads used to be , to the great admiration of spectators , the advancement of science , and the manifest improvement of undergraduates . We can not close our remarks without expressing our thanks to the learned editor of these documents , fur the great and continued zeal he manifests in composing or editing such works as tend to show the real state of improvement of this country in the arts , sciences , and general civilization . And if he should have been deceived , as we think he has , in attributing these compositions to the three venerable philosophers , whose memoirs they purport to be . still they have their good effect , in this , that they raise the suggestion , whether , how much wiser soever than our ancestors we moderns may think ourselves , x 7e shall not best show our wisdom by saying but little about it ; inasmuch as it happens every now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Herculaneum manuscripts and Milton 's essay , has been buried for centuries among the ruins of a lost town or the rubbish of an overgrown library , and has so slipped through the fingers of the intcr.mediate generations , accidentally falls into our hands , and gives us some reason to doubt whether the great march of mind in our day , may not , after all , have been in a circle .
