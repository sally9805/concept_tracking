VII. - Histoire de la Louisiane et de la Cession de cette Colonie par la France aux Etats-Unis de l'dm&amp;ique Septentrionale ; prU6&amp;e d'un Discours sur la Constitu .. tion eL le Gouvernement des . Etats- Unis . Par M. BARBEMARBOIs . Paris . 1829 . IT is so rare to receive from Europe a work of interest and valua on the United States , that we have peculiar pleasure in bringing to the notice of our readers a performance on that subject , sanctioned by such a name as that of the Marquis de Marbois . This gentleman has long been known , both in France and America , for his eminent talents , and the important stations which he has filled . Sixty years ago he com menced his public career , and during a large portion of the period since that time , he has been employed in the service of his country . His name and deeds are intimately blended with the events of the American Revolution . To no person are we more indebted for the good understanding which existed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for although he acted in a subordinate capacity to that of M. de la Luzerne , the French minister to congress , who was also friendly to the interests of the United States , yet it is well known that Marbois was the principal agent in the most important operations of the embassy . At the close of the war , Luzerne returned to France , and Marbois was left in his place , which he filled till he was appointed governor of St Domingo . At the time of the Directory we find him in Paris among those , who voted against the measures of that body , and who were rewarded for this courageous exercise of their prerogative by a banishment to Cayenne . He remained in exile two years and a half . Under the consulate he wa* minister of the treasury , and after the second restoration he became minister of justice . The Marquis de Marbois is now first president of the Cour des Comptes , a station of dignity , responsibility , and application , which demands much of his time ; and , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most active* members of the house of Peers , constant in his attendance , and taking a lively interest in all the political movements of the day . He has nevertheless found leisure for other inquiries , not immediately connected with his pursuits , and by no means common to , persons of any rank or profession in the old world . The // fruits are seen in the work which he has just published , and which , we do not hesitate to say , contains a wider knowledge and more accurate views of the government , institutions , progress , and political history of the United States , than any other which has appeared from a European hand . This is not high praise , perhaps , when we consider in what manner these topics , whether through real or affected ignorance , have been usually treated on the other side of the Atlantic . We will therefore add , that , although the author touches upon a great number and variety of subjects , relating to our civil and political condition , we know not how he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his reflections , or enlightened in his opinions , even if he had lived among us , and gathered his materials from their immediate soutces ; and the citizen of the United States must be a very fastidious patriot indeed , who is not charmed with the tone of candor and spirit of liberality , which everywhere pervade his remarks . A few years ago M. de Marbois wrote an accQunt of Arn6ld 's conspiracy , containing such authentic particulars as he had collected in America at the time of that event , and also many judicious observations on the revolutionary history and the government of the United States . The present work is divided into four parts , the first of which is a discourse on the constitution of the United States , with reflections on its principles , operation , and results . Secondly , a brief sketch of the history of Louisiana , both under the French and Spanish domination , from the time of its discovery till the treaty of cession to the United States . Thirdly , a history of the formation of that treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Monroe and Chancellor Livingston on the other , embracing curious details respecting the motives and designs of Bonaparte in making this cession . Fourthly , an account of the proceedings in taking possession of Louisiana , and a continuation of the history to the end of the last war . As the third part is the one upon Which the the author lays the most stress , and is indeed the main purpose of his book , we shall confine ourselves chiefly to that head . That out ' readers may see , however , in what manner an enlightened foreigner and a peer of France is disposed to view our political system , we shall select a few passages from his discourse on the constitution and government of the United States . He begins with an analysis of our great political charter , and en- // 39 ' ters into a concise exposition of its principal features in such a manner as to show , that he has not only acquainted himself with the theory and form of this instrument , but has reflected deeply on its principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . All the affairs of the republic , ' says he , are brought as soon as practicable to the knowledge of the people , without any exaggeration of the favorable condition of some or concealment of the adverse state of others . And why , indeed , should Congress and the administration concert together to deceive the public or to conceal from them untoward truths ? They are themselves part of this public . Resolutions which concern the state are never adopted till after the most mature deliberation . They are determined on in the presence of the citizens , and during the discussion of them , those who are interested in the result seldom fail to make known their opinions by publications which the government never disregards . Publicity only incommodes those who would wish to make their private interest prevail over that of the public . When the law is once promulgated , no one would dare to prevent its droi into effect or to elude it . * , ng The history also of every day cites at its bar the Presidents and other rulers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their acts are public ; posterity already exists for them , and the powerful , as well as the weak , are disgraced or praised while they are still living . The two chambers profess the same political doctrines . Nothing in the tendency of their speeches distinguishes the one from the other . They are both animated by a desire to render their country happy . The deliberations of the Senate are , however , the most conspicuous for calmness and gravity , and those of the Representatives for warmth and vivacity . There is a cause for this difference . The members of the Senate are in office for six years , the Representatives for only two . The latter are therefore the most anxious to bring themselves into notice . Congress , in its uniform course , is always consistent with itself , and its policy does not vacillate . In order to remain free from those internal agitations from which the most happy country is not always exempt , it practises constantly and sincerely the maxim , that " the end of government is the happiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumph of despotism over liberty ; the old nations of Europe would never have experienced this calamity , if , instead of simple traditions subjected to human and variable passions , at the will of an ambitious chief and of an ignorant multitude , they had had constitutions written by sages and confided to the vigilance of all the citizens . // *392 April , It is thus that the fundamental laws of the different states of the union are preserved . The sincerity and clearness with which they are expressed remove every opportunity for sophistical interpretations , and their legislators have been careful not to introduce any obscurity of which advantage may one day be taken with a view to an arbitrary explanation . If there are some differences in the constitutions , they exist only in the external forms of the government ; they have justice and equality for their foundation ; that which is just at Boston , is so at New Orleans . In every township or village , there are some well instructed in the true interests of their country , and if to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public affairs , they unite the virtues of the citizen , they will infallibly be raised to the first employments . Every man can be called to the highest functions . The great Washington had been a surveyor , Franklin a journeyman printer , Jefferson a planter . Magistrates , chosen by those whom they are to govern , are easily obeyed . The scarcity of crimes and of punishments is the proof as well as the consequence of the docility of these people to the laws . A long peace does not weary them . They do not fear that idleness will render the youth seditious . To undertake a war in order to occupy them , to render them less numerous , or upon.futile pretences , would seem to them impious and could not possibly occur . They have at length discovered the solution of this ditliculty , proposed several centuries since to the reflection of philosophers and to the experience of statesmen ; " To render communities happy with the least constraint and at the least expense possible . " ' pp. 40-43 . After speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , he adds , Such , in its political economy , is the conduct , such are the maxims of a new republic , strong in its present greatness , and of so rapid a growth , that every year its friendship becomes more desirable , its enmity more to be feared . It is no longer one of those republics by name , to which was refused an equality with kings , and whose ambassadors were , as if by tolerance , admitted after those of crowned heads . An attempt to assign to this republic a different rank Srom other powers and to subject it to another law of nations would be made in vain ; as independent and sovereign as the monarchs on their thrones , it has on every occasion maintained an equality with them , and without doubt it will be sufficiently wise never to aspire to elevate itself abQve them . If from the sketch of the condition of the general confederation , we pass to that of the constitutions of the separate states and // of their relations with Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision , without violence , and without any difficulties arising between the superior and subordinate governments of a nature to lead to a rupture . The legislative , executive , and judicial authorities in the several states are invested with all the powers which have not been delegated to Congress . Every state legislates in civil and criminal matters . During the fifty years that this order of things has existed , its results have been successful . The confederation has been enlarged , and the power of Congress increased at the same time . Some states have voluntarily limited their extent and their population , and abandoned vast territories where other states have been formed . They thus expressed themselves in making these cessions ; " We renounce our rights over these lands , because , after the protection of Providence , nothing can be better adapted to strengthen the union and to advance its honor , power , and dignity , than this proof of a general good understanding . " Those wars which fanaticism , ambition , cupidity , excite among other nations , that distrust which torments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to man , will never trouble that which the United States enjoy ; not because individuals in that country are free from human passions , but because the public councils are so formed that their decisions are always dictated by the general interest . A country which will be greater than Europe , and which is composed of many different states , enjoys a peace which promises to be perpetual and to accomplish the bright vision of a friend of humanity . Is it unreasonable to hope that this spirit of moderation will one day penetrate the councils of those monarchs whose states might form several kingdoms ? Is it not possible that wise ministers may say to their masters , " Our eyes and our arms can not extend twelve or fifteen hundred leagues ; . divide your empire , there will always be a place for you ; the people will be more happy ; you will be more tranquil ; instead of being the terror of your neighbors , you will excite the admiration of the world and be its benefactor . " ' It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elective magistracies of temporary duration are suited only to states of limited extent and small population . The experience of the United States has proved the incorrectness of this impression . If a bad selection happens to be made , the remedy is in r&amp;Mection , and the trial* of half a century ' has proved that it is an efficient one . Thus the example of the United States presents itself , whenever the oh .. ject is to prove that liberty is in every respect good and that it can // never be hurtful . It puts in despair all those , whom this liberty alarms , and who can not at this day deny its benefits . Judges , senators , ministers are not , however , more wise , more skilful , in these states than in many others . They have weaknesses and prejudices , but they must necessarily have them to a less degree than those who are elevated to magistracies by chance , intrigue , or bribery . They have also an advantage not possessed by men elsewhere placed at the head of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to the censure of every one , render it necessary for them to be always just , always impartial ; not to give employments except to the most worthy , and never to sacrifice the good of the state to private passions or to the interests of individuals . A sincere integrity can alone insure the confidence *f the public , ever ready to distinguish truth from falsehood . Knaves and hypocrites would be soon unmasked . Even though accident should have elevated to an important post a vicious individual , he would be obliged to govern in the same manner as one who was excellent by nature , or he would be unable to preserve his office . ' The display of all , these advantages is not a censure on the old governments , which , formed many centuries since upon other plans , can only be reformed gradually and after mature consideration . We have reason , indeed , to be astonished at the improvements whict* have been introduced into these last mentioned states , in spite of the many obstacles which they have to encounter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if the Americans have profited ky the lights and wisdom of Europe , she will receive in her turn similar benefits from America . Her example , and recent facts , have taught us that liberty does not diminish the vigor and energy necessary for execution . If it does not enervate republican governments , there is no reason to fear that it will become a principle of weakness in limited monarchies . Already , in spite of resistance from all quarters , laws are improved , and wise monarchs have acknowledgedthat the throne is firm only when it is established on the united interests of the prince and the people ; that placed upon any other foundation , it is constantly liable to be shaken by internal commotions and by attacks from without . pp. 47 , 49 , 52 , 64 . The auth6r concludes his observations on the constitution and government of the United States in the following words . The population increases in a degree which surpasses al* conjectures . The citizens enjoy an entire liberty of conscience , and nowhere are families to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them , but it does not exclude the // consideration and respect which are the usual attendants of personal merit and services . To what is this beautiful and advantageous condition of things to be attributed ? To the goodness of the laws , and to the wisdom of the government . We have seen Bonaparte overturn and raise up thrones at his pleasure . If these sportings of his prodigious power had for their objects the degradation of royalty , he was thoroughly deceived . It is very true that he has irreparably destroyed that great mystery of power , which gave to monarchs a supernatural and almost divine existence . We now know that they are men like ourselves , but nothing has been capable of taking from them a proud prerogative ,  --  a privilege , the loss of which would have carried with it their ruin . It is the obligation of being just , virtuous , and good under the penalty of being incapable of reigning ; and it is thus that this maxim , so often false , has become true ; " Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has often occurred to me , that it might seem only to contain allegories imagined by timid moralists to soften the severity of their counsels . Such has not been my intention . How is it possible to assimilate the situation of America with that of Europe ? How can we pretend to treat in the same manner a country , where vast and fertile territories will offer themselves for more than a thousand years to the industry and wants of man , and . our Europe , where five families out of six are without property ? I have desired , however , I say it frankly , I have *esired , that it should be admitted that the differences are not great between the principles of monarchies and those of republics . The prince , whether called king , magistrate , or people , can henceforth . reign only by the aid of respect for political liberty . There can not be mischievous rulers in the United Stat.es , and it appears to me that there can no longer be mischievous kings in Europe . The love of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of children for their parents . The citizens of a republic do not love their rulers in the same manner ; but they have confidence in their wisdom , and are attached to the constitution , of which they every day experience the benefits . It depends now upon the princes who reign over the nations of . Europe to unite all these enjoyments . They will then taste the highest happiness which can belong to man upon earth , that of rendering happy numerous generations . ' pp. 98-100 . Before we come to the Louisiana Treaty , some Preliminary remarks are necessary to lead the way to that subject . The cession by France of Louisiana to Spain in 1763 , had been considered in all the mercantile cities of the former country , // as essentially impolitic and injurious to the interests of navigation in the French Antilles , and ' it was a general desire that a suitable opportunity should occur for recovering that colony . When Bonaparte took the lead of affairs , it was one of his first cares to renew a negotiation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive , that the forced contributions which he imposed on Europe could never hold the place of the immense tribute , that would be voluntarily rendered to the industry and navigation of a commercial people . Besides , this youthful , and ambitious , and successful warrior had another purpose , which was to make himself preponderant in America . The possession of Louisiana was an essential preliminary . He had also at this early period yet another project , which he attempted to realize afterwards , namely , a league of all the maritime powers against the pretensions of England and her empire over the sea . France , ' said he , will never endure that inert existence , that stationary tranquillity , with which Germany and Italy content themselves .. The English reply with disdain to my offers of . peace ; they have protected , and even freed and armed , the rebel blacks of St Domingo . Be it so , I will make St Domingo one vast camp ; I will have there an army always ready to carry war into their own colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned , and Bonaparte himself seemed desirous of a general peace . The battle of Marengo and its fortunate consequences gave him an ascendancy , which he knew how to turn to his advantage ; and the powers of Europe , weary with the disasters and sacrifices of war , were not reluctant to accord terms of peace favorable to France . At this juncture the first consul commenced a negotiation at Madrid , in which he found it not difficult to convince the Prince of Peace , that Louisiana restored to France would beCome a barrier to Mexico and a guarantee for the tranquillity of the Gulf . It was never the design of Spain to profit by the navigation and agriculture of Louisiana . She had acquired this territory on the principle adopted by barbarous nations , that their frontiers are not safe except when protected by vast deserts and solitudes , which separate them from neighboring nations . It was thus , that one of the most beautiful and fertile regions of the world was to be consigned to the perpetual dominion of savages and wild beasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the equally desolate soli // tudes of Mexico ; and it is thus , that the Emperor of China at this day keeps off the wandering hordes of Siberia from his wandering hordes of Tartary , and no doubt values himself , as much as did the kings of Spain , upon his wisdom and policy in these measures of protection . It seems , however , that the Prince , of Peace , and the king his master , had less fear of republican Frenchmen than of republican Americans ; for on the 1st of October , 1800 , a treaty was concluded at St Ildephonso , by which his Catholic Majesty promised and engaged to retrocede Louisiana to the French republic , ' six n*ionths after certain conditions should be complied with on the part of France . It was also made a condition by Spain , that in case France should be disposed at any future time to retrocede Louisiana , the preference should be given to Spain . It reflects not much credit on the faith of na* tions , that little respect was afterwards paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and England , and it was of course the policy of Bo*iaparte to keep the treaty of St Ildephonso a secret . To this end it was necessary , that he should avoid taking possession of Louisiana , *r a maritime peace was absolutely essential to enable France to hold that colony . With her naval superiority , England would have found it an easy acquisition . And in any casey had this treaty been known , it would have thrown fresh embarrassments in iJi*e way of a peace with England , which the first consul at that moment deemed important for his interest . The cabinet of St dames at last listened to his proposals . The negotiation was commenced at London , and on the 27th of March , 1802 , peace was finally concluded at Amiens . There was no reason for longer concealing the treaty of St Ildephonso . Towards the close of the year it was known to Congress , and it was understood that France was about to take possession of Louisiana . This excited much alarm in the Western states , whose very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Difficulties of a serious nature had recently occurred with the Spaniards , and the alarm of the people had raised apprehensions , from which even Congress was not free , that these French neighbors would be even less accommodating than their predecessors . By a treaty concluded between the United States and Spain on the 27th of October , 1795 , the right of entrepdt at New Orleans had been // granted to the United States for three years . The term expired , but the Spanish intendaht did not interrupt the exercise of the right , which continued by tacit consent . All at once , however , the intendant , Morales , conceived the notion , without any advice from the Spanish government , that such a privilege ought not to continue any longer without some equivalent , and on the 1*th of October , 1802 , he issued a proclamation declaring it to have ceased . This act spread consternation among the inhabitants of the Western states . Complaints and petitions flowed in from every quarter to Congress . The news of the cession to France , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was inferred that the intendant had acted in conformity to orders , and that France was to take possession of the colony in its present condition , and thus perpetuate the prohibitive system , which would lead to the ruin of the West . This plan was supposed to have been concerted between the governments of France and Spain , and it was believed that France was about to send an army to ensure its execution . The ferment became general ; the strong motives of personal interest kindled and nourished the flame in the West* the spirit of party , ever busy in the work of discord and desolation , wafted it over the mountains and carried it swiftly to the middle and eastern states . The contagion entered the halls of Congress , and even in the senate qhamber there was a loud talk of war , of rights encroached upon , dignity degraded , and strength to repel and restore . Let us not wait the arrival of the French , ' cried an eminent senator ; and since a solemn treaty has been violated , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ours : The people of the West are ready ; and it would be an excess of simplicity to suppose that New Orleans will ' be spontaneously ceded to us , or even in virtue of a treaty with the first consul . ' Such was the state of excitement , which , for the moment , had grown out of the hasty ' act of the Spanish intendant at New Orleans ; but of which , it afterwards appeared , neither the Spanish nor French government had any knowledge . There were yet other causes , of a deeper nature , which tended to keep alive the irritation . During the mad career of the Directory , in their attempt to govern what was strangely miscalled the French Republic , depredations had been committed on our commerce , and insults offered to our flag . // Commissioners were sent out to procure reconciliation and redress , but without avail . The preparations in the United States for a French war , and the state of public feeling at the time , are well known . The consular government began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties between the two nations . A convention was accordingly signed on the 30th of September , 1800 , in which it was stipulated , that a full indemnity should be paid for all prizes that had unjustly been made of our vessels . A minister had been sent out , under the expectation of a prompt compliance with the conditions of the convention . He was I at first flattered with hopes of success , and wrote back accordingly to the government . His hopes were not realized ; to his demands he received only neglect or vague replies , as disrepectful to the dignity of the minister , as they were dishonorable and unjust in the French cabinet . Naturally dissatisfied with such a glaring breach of good faith and equity , the American government thought it time to rouse from their moderation , and spesk in a . Zone better suited to the exigency of the case . The American minister at Paris , ' says , the Marquis de Marbois , had received orders to make known this dissatisfaction , and his communications were drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any of the continental powers of Europe hacf dared to express themselves in the same manner , an invasion of their territory would have be ? n the consequence . The Congress , separated by the Atlantic ocean , might show itself without danger in a menacing attitude , for the first consul took good care not to give evidence of a resentment , which would only have manifested his weakness . ' Yet Mr Livingston 's letters remained unanswered ; our merchants , who h*41Qsttbeir property , became impatient , and murmured against the government . Mr Livingston suggested the cession of New Orleans ; he also proposed , that France should cede to the United States the vast regions to the north of the Arkansas river and the right bank of the Mississippi . All these overtures were equally neglected , and in his official and private correspondence with the government and his friends at home , he gave it as his opinion , that New Orleans would not be obtained except by force of arms . The tenor of this correspondence , as well as the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution of the war party in Congress . // 400 April , Mr Jefferson had formed an opinion on this Stibject different from that of the advocates of war , or even of the A*nerican minister in Paris . He resolved to make another effort towards a i*egotiation , and to send Mr Monroe on a s**cial mission for that purpose . The first consul , ' says the author , infornied of the contents of Mr Monroe 's public instructions , believed also that the president had entrusted it to the prudence of the plenipotentiary to enter into more extensive stipulations relative to the projected acquisition . The possibility of a war between Frane* arfd England had suggested to Mr Jeffi*son the measures which he had taken , and it was at the di*tetu , e of ZtWO thousand leagues from Europe , that this statesman foresaw the rupture . ' A w*r was in fact on the eve o* breaking ot*t jetween the ' two rival powers . In England the treaty * had never been cordially received by all parties . Suspicions , and jealousies , and ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sincerity of the leaders in concluding the peace of Arniens had been iloubted . On the other hand , It has been pretended that the first consul placed at first little value in its continuance , and only * a*4 ' * truce . He pursued without relaxation his design* in Upper Italy , and united to France under equivocal denominations those countries so long contested between it and Austria . When these changes and those which he was effectipg ir*Holla4 and Svvitzerland had given him a great prepoh*eiaiice in the afVairs of Europe , the felt that in order to strengthen this new order of things , and to exercise this vast supremacy , he had need in his turn of preserving peace . But he wished it on conditk*i of being in some sort the universaldictator ; *nd he Was so much the more removed from every concession , that the revocation of one of the acts of his power would have been followed by demands on the part of his rivals for the revocation of all the others . Like all eonquerors , this great captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one country to another * . warlike ' youth , in putting masses of population in movement , in astonishing the world by the rapidity and success with which he executed the most extensive and most complicated designs . But there was then reason to believe , that these convulsions of empires had less attractions for him ; he spoke of them with a sort of disdain , and seemed to carry the prodigious activity of his genius into works which in peace embellish society , and give to nations tranquil enjoyments . To give to France better civil laws , to meditate in advance // the ieibnn *f e*odes , to reii*stablish order in the finances , to reanimate commerce and iridustry , . - such were the objects to which , assisted by skilful counsellors , he consecrated his time , constantly prolonging his labors to midnight . If with these generous sentiments he had thought that liberty under good laws was the most noble present which he could make to men , the age in which we live would be called by his name . Diverted for a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs of a continenta1* war , he did not conceive that his republic ootild be flourishing without a commercial marine , sustained and protected by great naval threes . Heoften *repeated the following maxims ; " With .. out the freedom of the seas there is no happiness th.v the world . But , in order to obtain this liberty , it is necessary that the coi*ti. ' nental powers should impress the English with serious fears for their commerce .

Finally , " added he , " the liberty of the seas must be odious to the English , because it would reduce them to their natural share in the general prosperity . " ' pp. 268-270 . It is not to our purpose here to narrate the causes or progress of the new dissention between France and England . It is enough that it happened just at this juncture , and paved the way for the treaty which immediately followed , ceding Louisiana to the United States . M. de Marbois says , that the first consul , although resolved not to yield any point , regretted in the first stages of the contest , that he could not escape with honor from the , embarrassment . But as soon as he found war inevitable , he pretended , according to his custom , that this rupture was a gift of fortune , and that had it arrived two or three ye*rs later , the vigor of his armies would have been exhausted by repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonaparte did not subject himself : , like other princes , little initiated in the mysteries of their own policy , to treat with ambassadors and envoys through the medium of a minister .

Some days had elapsed since the date of the two messages of the king of England . The respective ambassadors of the two countries were not , on that account , less assiduous in going to audiences and formal receptions . At Paris these assemblies were held at the Tuileries ; they were numerously attended , and the foreign ministers mixed in the crowd of courtiers . One evening the first consal was seen to enter , surrounded by his usual retinue ; he appeared anxious and musing . He shortened the circuit which he was in the habit of making in the saloon , and approaching the ambassador of England , said to him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " " No , " replied Lord *Whitworth ; " we know too well the advantages of peace .

Against whom do you take precautions * For what are your armaments ? Is it that another war of fifteen years is desirable ? I do not arm . My good faith is manifest .

" * It was by these haughty menaces , * rather than by good reasoning , it was by this rough and unmethodical eloquence , that Napoleon intended to establish his claims , or cause that to be apprehended which he had not yet entirely resolved on . ' p. 276 . To this anecdote may be joined another of a similar description . They are both the more interesting , as it may be presumed that M. de Marbois , being one of the ministers , was present and heard what he relates . He has just been speaking of the causes of the approaching war , and the general points of difference between the contending powers , and adds , These great topics were discussed at the Tuileries , at one of those private conferences , in which the first consul , carried away by the abundance of his ideas , exposed with energy the wrongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed any himself . " The principles of a maritime supremacy1 " said he to his counsellors , " are subversive of one of the noblest rights which nature , science , and genius have insured to man ; * it is the right of traversing the seas of the whole world with as much liberty as the bird who cuts the air ; of participating in the use of the waves , winds , climates , and productions of the globe ; of bringing together , by a bold navigation , nations separated since the creation ; of carrying civilization into countries that are a prey to ignorance and barbatism . See what England wishes to usurp over all other nations . " One of the ministers present could speak to him freely . He said , " Have not the English as many motives to fear a continental supremacy , and to be alarmed at your great influence over all Europe ? " He appeared to reflect , but instead of replying to so direct an observation ; he consulted the extracts which he caused to be made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there read a passage with which he appeared very much irritated . It was from the speech of one of the most distinguished members of Parliament . " France , " said this speaker , " obliges us to remember the injury which she did tos twenty-five years ago , in allying herself with our revolted colonies . Jealous of eu* ' commerce , our navigation , our opulence , she wishes to annihilate them .

As soon as Bonaparte became convinccd that war was inevitable , he turned his thoughts towards the eQloflies . Oi* // the continent he confided in his own stre*gth for success ; bet his navy was in no condition to compete with that of England , and the colonies could only be defended by a naVal force . From that moment he hastened to change his policy relative to Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1803 , we find Talleyrand , after a long , silence , writing to Mr Liringston in a tone strangely altered from anything which this minister had before been so fortunate as to receive from an official source . Talleyrand is surprised that the pacific dispositions of the French republic towards the United States should have been suspected , and assures him that the affection of France for her old friends is trnaitered* . He alludes to the expected arrival of Mr Monroe , and says he will be received with great pleasure by the first consul , who hopes his mission will terminate to the mutual satisfaction of both nations . It was evident that Louisiana must be lost to France . The object of Bonaparte was to turn it to his own advantage , and prevent its falling into th' hands of I*n*land . The following description of an interview between him and two of his ministers , explains the subject so fully , and is written in so graphic and interesting a manner , that qur readers will be pleased with perusipg it in detail . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had likewise been in America , *nd was well acquainted with the affairs of the colonies . On the 10th of April , 1803 , Easter Sunday , after ha*ing given his time to the solemnity of the *lay , and to the demands of ceremony , he called those two counsellors , and speaking to them with that vehemence and passion with which he was especially carried away in political affairs , said , " I know the whole italue of Louisiana , and I have wished to reintir the thult ofthe French negotiator who abandoned it in 1763 . Some lines of a treaty have restored it to me , and I have scarcely recovered it , when I must expect to lose it . But if it slips from me , it Will one day cost dearer ! to those who oblige me to deprive myself of it , than to those to whom I wish to deliver it . The English have successively taken from France , Canada , Isle Royal , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , the richest parts of Asia . They are at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they covet . Loids*ana is nothing in comparison with their acquisitions throughout fhe globe ; and yet the jealousy which the return of this colony under the French dominion causes theta , proves to me that they desire to get possession of it , and that it is thus that they will commence the wax . They have twenty vessels in the Gulf of Mexico , // they oveirwi those seas as sovereigns , whilst our affairs in St Domingo grow worse every day since the death of Le Clerc . The conquest of Louisiana would be easy , if they only took the trouble of making a descent there . I have not a moment to lose in putting it out of'their reach . I do not know ' whether they are not already there . it is according to their practice , and were I in their place , I would not have waited . I wish , if there is yet time for it , to take from them even the idea of ever possessing the colony . I think of ceding it to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , for it is not yet in our possession . If I leave ever so little time to our enemies , I shall only transmit an empty title to these republicans , whose friendship* I seek . They only ask of me one town in Louisiana ; but I already consider the colony as entirely lost , and it appears to me that in the hands of this growing republic , it will be more useful to the policy and even to the commerce of France , than if I attempt to retain it . Tell me each of you his opinion . " ' M. do Marbois was the first who replied , and he reports his answer in the following terms . " We . **not hesitate to make the sacrifice of that which is about to es*pe from us . The war against England is inevitable . How can we defend Louisiana against that power with a naval force so inferior ? The United States , justly dissatisfied with our proceedings , will not offer us a single harbor , not even an asylum , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , on the eve of a reconciliation with us ; but they have a difference with the Spanish government , and they menace New Orleans , of which we shall* not have even a. momentary possession . At the time of the dis .. covery of Louisiana , she had neighbors as feeble as herself ; but they are now powerful , and she is yet in her infancy. , The country is hardly inhabited ; you have not there fifty soldiers . Where axe your means for sending garrisons thither ? Can we restore the ruined fortifications , and construct a chain of forts along a frontier of four hundred leagues ? If EngJ*nd shall allow you to attempt these things , it is because they drain your resources , and she will , with a secret joy , see you exhaust yourself in vain efforts , which will be profitable only to her . You will send out a squadron ; but while it is crossing the seas , the colony will succumb , and the squadron will be in peril on its return . On the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great lakes , and on the south , if they only appear at the mouths of the river , New Orleans will immediately fall into their hands . Of what consequence is it to the inhabitants to what power they are subject , if their country is never to cease to be a colony ? This conquest will be yet more easy to the Americans ; they will // reach the Mississippi by many navigable rivers , and to be masters of the country it will be only necessary for them to enter it . One of these : two neighbors increases every day in population and indu*try ; and the other has maritime means sufficient to make any invasion by which her commerce may be increased . The colony has existed for * century , and in spite of efforts and sacrifices of every description , the recent examinations attest its feebleness . If it receives a new increase and importance after it becomes a French colony , it will contain , even in its prosperity , a getm of independence , which will not be tardy in developing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have of preserving it . Nothing is more uncertain than the future lot of the European colonies in America . The exclusive right which the ther countries exercise over these distant establishments , is becoming from day to day more precarious . The people feel humbled in being dependent on a small country in Europe , and will free themselves the moment they are aware of their strength . " The French have attempted to establish colonies in different parts of the American continent . Every where their attempts have been abortive . The English ar6 patient ; laborious ; they do not fear the*solitude and silence of countries newly settled . The Frenchman , spirited , active , seeks society ; he ' loves to associate with his neighbors . He makes vohtnt*ry efY*ts , but on the first disappointment the quits the spade.and axe for the chase . " Here the first consul , interrupting the discourse , asked how it h*ppened , that the French , incapable of succeeding in continental colonies , had always made progress in the Antilles , " It is , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab6r . The whites , soon exhausted by the climate and heat , have sufficient vigor of head and body to direct them . " C* J am again unde. * cided , " said the first consul , " touching the maintenance or aboli-. tion of slavery . By whom is the land cultivat*d in Louialana . " " Slavery , " replied the minister , " has peopled Louisiana with half of its inhabitants . An inexcusable imprudence has been committed in suddenly granting to the slaves of St Domingo a. liberty for which they were not prepared . The blacks and whites have been the victims of this great fault . But without examining , at present , in what manner this evil can be repaired , let us recol-* lect , that the colonies where slavery exists are rather chargeable than useful to France . In the mean time , nevertheless , let us. take care not to abandon them ; they have not the means of governing themselves . The creoles are French , they have been encour*ed in those modes of culture , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . Let us save them from new calamities . It is for us to provide for their defence , the adminis .. tration of justice , and the cares of government . But towhat good // end would you involve yourself in greater embarrassments in regard to Louisiana I You would make the colonial laws incessandy at war with those of the mother country . Of all the evils which afflict the human species , slavery is the most *4etestable ; but humanity itself exacts great precautions in the application of a remedy , and you can not apply it if Louisiana is restore4 to France . The governments still partially resist emancipatie* they tolerate in secret what they condemn osten*ibly , and they are themselves embarrassed with the false position in which they are placed . The general sentiment is favorable to emancipation ; it Is , i*.v.ain for the colonists and planters to oppose amovement which public opinion approves . The ocup*ttionof Loi4siana , peopled with slaves , will cause us greater expense* than it ' will afford profit . " But there is another kind of servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is that of a monopoly . Do you hope to reestablish this in a country bordering on another , where commerce enjoys the greatest liberty ? The reign of prohibitive laws is at an end , when a numerous population has resolved to shake off their yoke . Besides , the products so long exclusively possessed by some commercial nations , have ceased to be privileges . The sugar cane and coffee tree are now everywhere cultivated at a small expense . Every people expects to cultivate on its own account the articles peculiar to its territories and climate . There are on the globe , between the tropics , regions a thousand times more extensive than our isle* , and susceptible of the same culture . A monopoly is impossible when the products are so multiplied , and the Louisianians will never suffer their commerce to be tramruelled . Would you , with arms in hand , subdue resistance ? The malecontents will find support in the neighborhood , and you will render France an enemy to the United States , with whom reciprocal interests ought to unite us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisianians to your person . They render homage to yo*ir renown , and to your exploits , hut th' l9ve , of a people is for those princes only whom they regard as the authors of their felicity ; and whatever may be your solicitude , this felicity will be for a long time , and perhaps for ever , sterile . The colonists have lost the remembrance of France ; they are a mixture of three or four nations , and hardly regard Louisiana as their country . Laws varying continually , chiefs who know not those whom they govern , and who are not known by them ; perpetual changes made according to the interests of the mother country , or the inexperience of ministers ; the constant danger of becoming a party in quarrels to which they are really strangers ,  --  these are the causes which , for a hundred years , have extinguished in their hearts every sentiment of affection towards their masters , residing // two thousand leagues from them , and who barter or transfer them as a commodity of traffic . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sentiment of well-being should be joined to the certainty of its continuance . The Louisianians , in learning that they are united to France , will say , This change will be of no longer duratzon than the others . Citizen consul , having hy one of the first acts of your government made your iritentionto give this country to France sufficiently manifest , should you now cease to keep it , there is no person who will not be satisfied that you have yielded to necessity ; and shortly our merchants will discover that Louisiana , thus freed , offers them a better chance of profits , than Louisiana subjected to a monopoly . Commerci*tl establishments are preferable at this day , to colonies , and even in default of these , it is best to let commerce take care of itself . " ' pp. 287-293 . It was next the other minister 's turn to express his views of the subject , which proved to be entirely opposite to those just advanced . " We are as yet at peace with England , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it depends on the first consul to preserve it . Wisdom will not counsel him to abandon , through fear of a doubtful danger , the most important establishment which we can form beyond the limits of France , and to despoil ourselves of it without any other cause than the possibility of a war . It would he better that it should be taken from us by force of arms . If peace is maintained , the cession can never be justified , and this premature act of an ill founded inquietude will be the subject of the most lively regret . On the contrary the preservation of it will be to our commerce and navigation of inestimable value , and in our maritime provinces a subject of universal joy . The advantages which we have derived from the colonies are present to all minds . Ten flourishing cities have been created by this commerce ; the navigation , the commerce , the luxury which embellish Paris , are the effects of colonial industry . There can be no marine without colonies ; no colonies without a powerful marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistance skilfully combined of many against one . This resistance is necessary as well by sea as by land , if we would not submit to the tyranny of a universal domination of commerce , and the loss of the immense advantages of a free navigation . You will not admit , you will not acknowledge , that England is sovereign mistress of the seas , that she is there invulnerable , and that no one can possess colonies except by her good pleasure . It is not for you to fear the kings of England . If they seize Louisiana , as some pretend to fear , Hanover will be immediately in your hands as the // price of a ' restitution . France , deprived of her marine and her colonies , is despoiled of half her splendor and a , great part of her force . Louisiana will indemnify us for all our losses . There exists not on the globe a single port , a single city , susceptible of becoming so important a.st*iat of New Orleans ; and already its vicinity to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The Mississippi brings to its doors the contributions of twenty other rivers , many of which surpass in grandeur the most beautiful streams in Europe . The country is known , the principal discoveries have been made , and expense has not been spared . Spain ' has paid a large amount 9f *t . Forts exist , the soil is fertile and suited to rich productions* which it already yields abundantly . Other parts require only cultivation ; and this colony , open to the activity of the French , will soon remunerate them for the loss of India . " " The ' climate is the same as that of ' Ilindostan , and the distance is not in*re ; than.a Iluarter as great . The navigation to the Indies in doubling the Cape of Good Hope has changed the direction of the commerce of Europe , and ruined Venice and Genoa . Wh4'wQit ke when a canal shall one day be cut across the Isthmus of Panam* and connect the two oceans ? The revolution in navigation will then be more extraordinary , , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lon*'voyages which are now made going and returning . Louisiana will be in the middle of this *iew *route ; eiui it will be acknowledged that its possession is of immense importance . " The country which pertains to us is without limits , and the savages have only an imaginary right to it . They wander over the : i*ast deserts with 4heir bow in hand in pursuit of wild beasts . Thit the social state requires possession , and these strolling huntsmen are not proprietors . The savage has a right only to subsistence , and this we can provide for him at a small expense . " All the produetions of the Antilles are suited to Louisiana . This variety of products has already introduced large capitalists into countries for a long time deserted and desolate . If we are obliged to renounce St Domingo , let us retain Louisiana in its place . Consider also the evils which will follow , if ' this eouiitry becomes our rival in productions , of which we have fhr so long a time enjoyed the privilege . Attempts have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mulberry tree ; and these attenipts , which Spain has not been able to prevent , have but too well succeeded . If the colony becomes free , it will be necessary for Provepce , and our vineyards , to be prepared for the rivalship of a country new and without limits . If , on the contrary , it is subjected to our . laws , every branch of agriculture injurious to our interests will be prohibited . // 410 April , " It is necessary , even for the advantage of Europe , that France should be rich . As long as she has divided with England the commerce of America and Asia , the princes , the cabinets , which have consented to be subsidized , have profited by the enhanced prices which one has imposed upon the other . What a difference to all , if this competition should cease to exist , and if England alone should regulate this tariff of friendship between princes . " In fine , France , after her long agitations , has need of such a colony for her internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ago were to England the plantations , which the emigrants from the three kingdoms raised to so high a degree of prosperity ; it will relieve us of a part of the evils caused by the revolution ; it will be an asylum for our political and religious dissidents ; a supreme conciliator of all the parties into which we are divided , you will there find the remedies , for which you search with so much solicitude. " ' pp. 293-297 . The deliberation lasted till late at night , and Bonaparte dismissed the ministers without making known his intentions . They passed the night at St Cloud , and very early in the morning the first consul sent for M. de Marbois , *vhorn he requested to read the despatches just arrived from London . The ambassador had written , that an extraordinary activity prevailed in making preparations for war both by land and sea . * " The English , " said Napoleon , " demand of me Lampadosa , which I do not possess , and in the mean time they would hold Malta for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted all its resources in bringing the places of defence to such a degree of perfection as no one could conceive without having seen them , would be for the English another Gibraltar . To leave them there would be to give up to them the commerce of the Lee . vant , and to tele it : from my southern provinces . They would keep this possession , and have me immediately evacuate Holland . " But we have no time now for uncertainties and deliberations . I renounce Lowrnana* It . i. * ixot only New Orleans that I will cede , it is the whole colony without reserve . I know the price of what I abandon , and I have given sufficient proof of the manner in which I esteem this province , since the object of my first diplomatic act with Spain was its recovery . I renounce ' it therefore with the greatesl* dissati. *faction . To be obstinate in attempting its preservation would he folly . I charge you ta negotiate this affair with the envoys of Congress . Wait not even for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject this day to Mr Living .. ston ; but I have need of much money for this *iiar , and I would not commence it by new contributions . It is a hundred years since France and Spain have , been expending means for the me. // lioration of Louisiana , and commerce has never indemnified them . Sums have been lent to companies and agriculturists , which have never again been returned to the treasury . The price of all these things is justly due to us . If I were to regulate my condi-. tions by the value of these vast territories to the United States , the indemnity would be without bounds . I will be moderate , by reason of the necessity I am under to make the sale . But observe well ,  --  I will have fifty millions , and for less than that sum I will not treat ; I would rather make some desperate effort to preserve those beautiful countries . To'morrow you shall have your full powers . " Here the new plenipotentiary made some observations of a general nature respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the Germans call les Ames , as whether these should be an object of contract of sale or of exchange . He received for answer ,  --  " Be sure that you maintain in all its perfection the ideology of the right of nature and of nations ; but I must have money to carry on a war against a nation who has the most of it . Send your doctrine to London ; I am certain it would there be a subject of great admiration ; and yet it seems not to be there much regarded , when the question is agitated of seizing the most beautiful countries in Asia . " Perhaps also it will be objected , that the Americans will become too powerful for Europe in two or three centuries ; but my foresight does not embrace these distant fears . Besides , one may expect hereafter rivalries in the bosom of the union itself . The confederations , which are called perpetual , will endure no longer than till the contracting parties shall find their account in breaking them ; and it is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collossal power of England , that I would provide a remedy . Mr Monroe is on the point of arriving . To this teinister , coming two thousand leagues from his constituents , the president must have given , after having defined the object of his mission , secret instructions more extensive than the ostensible ones of Congress for the stipulated payments . Neither this minister , nor his colleague , will expect a resolution , which surpasses infinitely what they are about to demand of us . Begin with them , and come directly to the point of the negotiation . Inform me from day to day , from hour to hour , of the progress you make . The cabinet of London are acquainted with the resolutions at Washington , but they can have no suspicions of that which I am taking . Keep it a profound secret , and recommend the same to the American ministers . Their interest in it is not less than ours . Correspond with M. de Talleyrand , who alone knows my intentions . If I were to follow his advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhine , and would make war only to protect the feeble , and prevent being dismembered . But he ac // knowledges also , that the cession of Louisiana is not a dismern .. berment of France . Be careful to inform me of the progress of this affair . " ' pp. 298-301 . The French commissioner made no delay in commencing the negotiation with Mr Livingston , but that minister had *ot the necessary powers for treating in the manner proposed . He had been two years in Paris ; his attempts to gain the object of his mission had been unsuccessful ; he had been turned off with vague replies , and deceived with false hopes . It was not surprising , therefore , that he should have little confidence at this time in the advances of the French cabinet . Talleyrand 's letter , and the overture made by Marbois , he considered as equally an artifice to gain time and tranquillize the excited feeling , which began to show itself with so much warmth in the United States . He accordingly avoided coming to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival , and even then he relied so little on the sincerity of the French councils , that , in a letter to Mr Monroe at Havre he expressed his opinion , that the best means of ensuring success would be the certainty of the United States ' having already taken possession of New Orleans . When Mr Monroe arrived in Paris , Mr Livingston said to him , I could wish the proposition made by Mr Ross to the Senate had been adopted ; I am almost certain we shall never obtain New Orleans by negotiation . We must employ force . Let us first take *possession , and ne. * gotiate afterwards . ' But Mr Monroe , since he had not the same prepossessions to combat , nor the same reasons for distrust , found it less difficult to convince himself that the . French commissioner was in earnest , A n3utual confidence was im*-mediately established ; no other preliminaries were necessary , and the negotiation was entered upon without delay . The American plenipotentiaries felt themselves under much embarrassment . They had not been authorized to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louisiana situate on the east side of the Mississippi . For this cession it was proposed to offer two millions of dollars . The project of procuring the entire colony seems never to have been contemplated , or even thought of . At least there was no provision to this effect in the instructions to the plenipoten .. tiaries . Hostilities were on the point of breaking out between France and England ; the treaty , if made at all , must be closed before that event ; no time could be allowed to apply to // the American government for more ample instructions , and there was an absolute necessity for the l ) lenipotentiaries to act with such powers as they possessed , or forego the opportunity of making a negotiation of immense importance to the United States , and which , considering the state of France at that moment , could certainly never again be commenced under , circumstances so favorable . These considerations brought the plenipotentiaries to a speedy decision to treat for Louisiana in its fullest extent , and submit the result of their proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation divided itself into three parts , namely , the cession , the price to be paid for it , and the indemnity for the claims of the citizens of the United States against France . These three objects were considered separately , and it was agreed , that a distinct treaty should be made for each . The particulars of the cession were first discussed . Each party drew up a project as the basis of a treaty for this purpose , but that of the French negotiator was adopted as the text by which the conferences were to proceed . The chief difficulties of this part of the negotiation were in fixing the limits . Maps were examined , charters perused , ancient treaties consulted , but all these only served to increase the despair of the negotiators , and to convince them that they were searching for a thing that had never existed . No one could tell , or even conjecture , where were the western boundaries of Louisiana ; and for a very good reason ,  --  they had never been defined . Those regions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiators had the wisdom , therefore , to abandon a search , which only led them more and more into the dark . To solve the difficulty in the shortest way , the American plenipotentiaries proposed to insert the third article of the treaty of St Ildephonso , by which Spain agreed to cede to France the province of Louisiana such as it was in the bands of Spain at the date of the treaty . This was leaving the utmost latitude of construction , and opening the door to a tangled discussion between the United States and Spain , which , in due time , this latter power took care to revive . It was nevertheless obvious that no better plan could be devised by the plenipotentiaries . Upon this clause M. de Marbois observes ; ambiguous terms should never be introduced into treaties , yet in the present instance the American ple*ipotentiaries made no objection ; and i4 in appearing to resign themselves to general expressions // April , through necessity , they considered this in effect preferable to more precise stipulations , it must be confessed the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were certainly never meant to be comprised in the cession , yet the United States are already established there . ' The point of this sentence is not perhaps strictly correct to the full extent in which the author would have it understood . It must be remembered , that the United States had claims growing out of the right of discovery at the mouth of the Columbia river , and that their possession of the territory in that quarter was not in consequence solely of the cession of Louisiana . When this obscurity in the article on the limits , and the inconveniences that might arise from it , were mentioned to the first consul , he replied , If there were no obscurity , it might perhaps be good policy to put it there . ' M. de Marbois doubts the wisdom of this maxim , and adds , that although circumstances maysometimes render such a case necessary , yet sound policy disavows all obscure stipulations . The third article of the treaty was drawn up by Bonaparte himself . It stipulates , that , the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and admitted as soon as possible , according to the prin-. ciples of the federal constitution , to the enjoyment of all the rights , advantages , and immunities of the citizens of the United States ; and in the mean time they sh*ill be maintained and protected in the enjoyment of their liberty and property , and in the exercise of the religion which they profess . ' This cession was to produce a most important change in the constitution and laws of Louisiana , and in the condition of the people ; and it was considered a duty , it seems , on the part of the French government , to make the best provision possible for the security of the rights and privileges of the inhabitants , whose destiny was thus decided by the single act of a power on another continent . In alluding to the above article , M. de Marbois says , The first consul , left to his natural dispositions , was always inclined to the side of an elevated justice and generosity . He himself prepared the article in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered on the journal of the negotiation , and they deserve to be perpetuated . Let the Louisianians know , ' said he , that we separate ourselves from them with regret , that we stipulate in their favor everything which they can desire ; and hereafter , happy in // their independence , may they remember that they have been Frenchmen , and that France , in ceding them away , has secured to them advantages , which they never could have obtained under a metropolitan government in Europe , however paternal it might have been . Let them preserve for us , therefore , sentiments of affection ; and may their common origin , relationship , language , and manners perpetuate the ties of friendship . ' The other articles of the treaty of cession were in their order discussed and adopted . The negotiations came next to the second treaty , which relates to the amount of money to be paid by the United States . Bonaparte , as we have seen , fixed this sum at fifty millions of francs , but the negotiator deemed this amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul on this subject , M. de Marbois first spoke of a hundred and twenty millions as the probable value of the ceded territory , but the definite sum , which he proposed , was eighty millions . Our citizens , ' * observed Mr Livingston , have an extreme aver* sion to public debts , and how can we , without incurring disgrace , charge them with the enormous contribution of fifteen millions of dollars ? ' This was not , perhaps , a very easy point to settle by any . of the common modes of valuing property . The sovereignty of a people , the works and fortifications heretofore built at the public charge , and the right to a territory undefined , hut of almost immeasurable extent , were to be exchanged for a specified quantity of gold or silver . How to measure this quantity with much approach to exactitude , might well have puzzled the science of more adroit and practised financiers than our negotiators may be supposed to have been . The American plenipotentiaries at last agreed . to the eighty millions , reserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated in payment of the claims held by the citizens of the United States against France . M. de Marbois supposes , that the American ministers fluted upon this round sum of twenty millions with the expectation , tb*at a reduction in the amount would be demanded . But no discussion of this nature took place . It was immediately conceded , that twenty millions should be deducted as t*n indemnity for such captures as should be proved to be real . The intention to extinguish all past claims , ' says he , was sincere on both parts . The gross sum of twenty millions // was evidently an estimate formed on reasonable conjectures , and could not be an absolute result established on accurate knowledge . But the American plenipotentiaries agreed in opinion , that if there was any difference , it rather exceeded than fell short of the exact amount ; and the French negotiator gave an assurance , that , in case of an excess , no part of it should be reclaimed by France . ' This important part of the negotiation was thus amicably settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was attended with some difficulties , and was unfortunately not very successful in its execution , by not having provided for a pro rata division of the money among the claimants , according to the principle afterwards followed in liquidating the Spanish claims . The first consul , ' says M. de Marbois , had followed with a lively interest the progress of the negotiation . It will be recol-. lected , that he had announced fifty millions as the sum for which h*i would make the cession , and it is believed he did not expect a larger amount . He learnt that eighty millions had been agreed to , but that it had ' been reduced to sixty , by the amount withdrawn to extinguish the debt of France to the Americans . Forgetting , or feigning to forget , the sum he had mentioned , he replied with vivacity to the French minister ; " I would have these twenty millions rendered to the treasury . Who has authorized you to dispose of the effects of the state * The rights of the claimants should be second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was reminded of his previous consent to treat for a sum much less , and that the treasury would receive one much larger , without comprehending the twenty millions of indemnity for captures . " It is true , " he rejoined , " the negotiation has left me nothing to desire . Sixty millions for an occupation , which will endure perhaps only for a day ! I would have France enjoy this unexpected capital , and profit by it in her marine . " At that moment he dictated a decree for the execution of five canals , the projects of which had occupied him for some time . But other cares caused him in a few days to forget this decree . The following words indicate the thoughts of the first consul at that time . " This cession of territory , " said he , " confirms for ever the power of the United States , and I have just given to England a maritime rival , that will humble her pride . " ' The acquisition of Louisiana , ' adds M. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain grants and original titles , have cost the United States about a hundred and sixty millions of francs . The territories acquired contain three hun- // 417 history of the Louisiana Treaty . dred millions of acres . About eighteen millions only have been sold . That which remains unsold will , in less than a century , be worth many thousand millions to the United States . The value of these lands when in th' possession of individuals is not to be calculated . The cession of Louisiana was followed by judicious and enterprising explorations . Expeditions were fitted out by Congress , and others were undertaken by private travellers and merchants . They arrived at the shores of the West , across a country till that day unknown to civilized people . They found hospitable and pacific nations , and they met with no obstacles except those of nature . These regions are more extensive , than the previous territory of the whole of the United States . There is space for numerous republics , and ages will pass before population and civilization will there arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what form of government will be adopted by ( these societies ; what ties will wiit*them , either among themselves , or with a metropolis . It is enough to foresee , that they will be formed on the model of the United States , that they will be certainly happy , and that the new world will see , what the old has never seen , societies founded for the advantage of all the members , and not for that of the founders alone , either to augment their riches , increase their power , or feed them with vain glory . Even should they detach themselves from the confederation , they will remain ' united by the preserving laws of peace , and by all that assures public felicity . ' pp. 316 , 334 . In the fourth and last part of his work , M. de Marbo*s con*-tinues the history of the chief events in Louisiana down to the close of the late war , with remarks on the changes in its form of government , and its political and civil condition .

It was *oposed on the part cf England to cede Louisiana to the ited States , after it should be taken , but there seems to have been no hint as to the terms of the cession . From the long extracts with which we have indulged our readers , they will be able to fort-n an idea of the character and spirit of M. de Marbois ' performance .
