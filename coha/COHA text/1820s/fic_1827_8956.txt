PREFACE . For this we naturally look  --  something must be said , if nothing done . Squire Hartley is the child of imagination , and made its first appearance in March , 1825 , in York , Upper Canada . Of course , I must say , the little thing has no merit ; but yet it had an amazing run , and pleased , if not the spectators , at least the author 's pocket . So far , so well . I never saw a farce better played . Thanks to the performers ; each one felt an interest in the piece , and seemed as if its fate depended on himself . To Mr. Forbes , " who was then stage manager , " I feel particularly indebted for his unremitting attention in getting it up , and his masterly personation of Sir Edmund Faintiey . This young gentleman is a candidate for fame ; and as an American , and one of talent , I trust his countrymen will support him . Mrs. Forbes , as Peggy , was excellent ; the applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hart deserves much credit for his Doctor Allcure ; and Mr. Pemberton 's Squire Hartley was inimitable . Mrs. Talbot played the part of Emily . As for myself , I blundered through that of Dermot . All the other actors acquitted themselves respectably . C. S. TALBOT . CHARACTERS IN SQUIRE HARTLEY .

Servant shewing in Hartley and Susan . Hart . Squire Hartley Are these the rooms my servant has prepared for me . Serv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartley Has he been here this morning . Serv . Servant No , sir . Hart . Squire Hartley Very well , when he calls , say I desire to see him . Servant bows and exit . Well , Susan , here we stand at ease , at least for the present ; we have nearly knock 'd up our horses , and I might almost say , ourselves . But as you , my dear sister , " like myself . " delight in the sports of the chace , I expect a few hours repose will set all to rights again . Susan . Susan Doubtless , Harry ; I admire the sports of the chace , but not chacing with a wild romantic fellow after a silly girl . Hart . Squire Hartley Let me but start the game , Susan , and I will skim the hedges , ditches , five bar 'd gates and all , just as the sea-bird skims the rising wave . Susan . Susan Very fine , Harry , very fine ; there are other things beside hedges , ditches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . bolts and bars . Hart . Squire Hartley Hang all such trumpery . I defy them , Emily , and love , death or glory , damn me , that 's your sort . Susan . Susan Really , Harry , I sometimes think you were not born to make poor Emily happy . ' T is true her imagination and disposition are wild and irregular as your own , but then your lightheaded conduct and carelessness respecting her at one moment , and your enthusiastic enumeration of her perfections the next , induce me to say our friend the doctor , was tolerably correct in removing his daughter from your presence . Hart . Squire Hartley Most amiable sister , ha , ha , ha ! most wise young lady , your servant , ha , ha ! Looking at his watch by heaven , the hour is come ; fate be propitious . Susan . Susan What hour has come ? Hart . Squire Hartley The precise time Dermot was to wait upon me . Susan . Susan This Dermot will be the ruin of you . Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true son of Hibernia , and the best judge of horses in the whole country . Susan . Susan You deem him a judge of every thing else as well as horses . Hart . Squire Hartley True , was it not he that defeated Vernon 's plan of carrying you off : was it not he that discovered the doctor 's manoeuvre of retiring from his seat in the country , and settling here in Bath , to deprive me for ever of a sight of my Emily . and was it not he that suggested the propriety of his driving post before me , to discover the position of the enemy . Susan . Susan No general could have managed better ; but you will allow that his blundering officiousness sometimes renders you truly ridiculous . Hart . Squire Hartley All with the best intentions . ' T is a rough outside , but my life o n't , the gems within are pure and brilliant . Susan . Susan You should never marry , Harry , for I pledge you my honour , I think this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection . Hart . Squire Hartley I must acknowledge I admire him ; he has the courage of a lion , the attachment of a woman , and the heart of a man . Susan . Susan But not , I suppose of your every day , common sort of men . Hart . Squire Hartley No , Susan : but of men as they should , and were intended to be , by the power that made them . Susan . Susan Strange being , you are really never half so rational as when speaking of your horses , dogs , or servants ; believe me , I do not dislike your favourite  --  " far from it . "  --  with all his oddities , I admire him , but I am determined he shall not run away with my heart . Hart . Squire Hartley Looking at his watch . It gets past the time , I shall become all impatience . Dermot you  --  Enter servant . Serv . Servant A gentleman below stairs , sir , desires to see you ; he did not leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , no  --  who the devil can it be  --  no matter , shew him up . Exit servant . This is strange . Susan . Susan Very , that any person should know you were in town . I shall retire , and as I have given my word , when call 'd upon again to play my part , you may rely upon my services ; I shall retire . Exit Susan . Hart . Squire Hartley Who the devil can this be  --  a gentleman  --  it ca n't be Dermot  --  He comes however , and as I live , the captain . Enter Vernon . Ha , Vernon , I rejoice . Eh , the devil , man , look pleasant . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Mr. Hartley , although I have done myself the honor of this visit , I do not intend it as one of that very friendly nature your conduct would intimate  --  You have acted , sir  --  Hart . Squire Hartley I understand you  --  a further explanation can not redound to your credit . Vernon . Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartley In what have I offended . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Have you not deprived me of all this heart holds dear . Hart . Squire Hartley And have I not protected a sister from the violence of a thoughtless and intemperate lover . Vernon . Capt . Vernon By heaven , Hartley , could I believe you acted from feelings towards your sister , I should forgive you , but it is not so  --  you well remember it is not the first time you have injured my pursuits and mar 'd my projects . Hart . Squire Hartley I do remember that once I saved an innocent little angel from the gripe of folly and dishonor . Vernon . Capt . Vernon True  --  give me your hand , there indeed you saved me from a pang my heart bleeds to think of . Hart . Squire Hartley And yet you look upon me as unfriendly to your interest . Vernon . Capt . Vernon No , I do not  --  but why oppose my union with your sister . My sentiments towards her , you must allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Hart . Squire Hartley Then why not seek her like a man ; there may be excuses for a lover running away with the mistress of his affections , but surely the case should be very desperate before he resorted to such a mode of obtaining her . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Did not necessity demand of me to act in that manner , I should perhaps shrink from the task with as much abhorrence as yourself ; but when you reflect how frequently you have opposed my wishes . Hart . Squire Hartley Halt , stand at ease , since that I have changed my mind , and now briefly acquaint you that should you prove to be Susan 's choice , she is your 's with my consent Vernon . Capt . Vernon Can I believe you . Hart . Squire Hartley ' T is true , she feels offended , and justly , at your premature conduct , and believe me you will find some difficulty in becoming again a favourite . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Love and fortune be my friends . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of wonder , captain , how did you discover me here . I drove in my own travelling carriage , and to avoid observations , kept the blinds down the entire way ? Vernon . Capt . Vernon There lies the secret . I saw your carriage , and could not conceive it came empty to town ; beside , I met your servant , and from his endeavours to avoid me , I suspected something was on foot  --  and if the question be a fair one , allow me to ask what has brought you so suddenly to town . Hart . Squire Hartley A petticoat ! Vernon . Capt . Vernon Indeed ! Hart . Squire Hartley As true as  --  Hang you , Dermot . Impatiently and aside . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Nothing else . Hart . Squire Hartley Yes . Vernon . Capt . Vernon What . Hart . Squire Hartley A fine eye  --  pretty face  --  good figure  --  handsome leg  --  bewitching ankle  --  tolerable foot  --  fair skin . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Stop , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfections is certainly irresistible , and her name is  --  Hart . Squire Hartley Mum . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Short and pretty  --  this added to her other good qualities . Hart . Squire HartleyAside , looking at his watch.  --  Dermot , you dog , I have all the heart to break your head . Going . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Are you going . Hart . Squire Hartley Yes , Vernon , I have particular business ; you must excuse me . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Then I shall instantly set off for Hartley Hall . Hart . Squire Hartley You may save yourself the trouble . Vernon . Capt . Vernon How so ? Hart . Squire Hartley Susan is in town . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Can it be possible ? Hart . Squire Hartley Good bye  --  and should any person enquire for me , remember , mum . Vernon . Capt . Vernon That name belongs to your mistress , therefore if I desire a whole skin , had better not make free with it . Exit Hartley , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtless a fellow as ever liv 'd ; his character no man can define ; sometimes gay , sometimes serious  --  he becomes a perfect riddle . He has a good heart , however , and his sister is an angel . I have acted imprudently towards her , still shall I seek forgiveness ; she is in town too , if I can depend upon the worthy squire .  --  Be it so ; I must to work directly , and endeavour to become once more a favourite . Exit . SCENE II .  --  A Street . Enter Dermot  --  " full brogue . " Dermot Dermot O'Dogherty does not enter until the last line of the song . Says Sal , Cato , do you know what , Sure my blackguard has listed , And he has gone to fight the French , Although I never wish 'd it . Then Caty a heager , pray give us a drop , Because I 'm in such sorrow ; And suppose my cloak I 'm forc 'd to pop , I 'll give you a throw to-morrow . Dermot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born to be a gentleman . Nature never intended thee to disgrace a livery . If this is'nt the most wonderfullest place I ever saw ; it fairly flogs for sport  --  and the girls  --  to be sure , I hav'nt bother 'd a few of them .  --  There is Miss Peggy O'Brian too , she 'd make a body believe she came from Ireland with her mistress ; but leave me alone for knowing all about it  --  now that I have pop 'd myself into decent service . Peg shall be paid off in her own coin .  --  Ha , ha , ha ! how she was struck all of a heap with botheration when she saw me . But a faith , I 'm after thinking my master will be playing the very devil at the Red Lion all this time  --  I was to have waited upon him an hour ago . But as there was a lady in the question , I hope I knew better than to be particular .  --  Yet I must go . Squire Hartley is the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dermot , if ever you prove unfaithful in his service . As Dermot is going , enter Hartley opposite side . Hart . Squire Hartley Dermot . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty O , by the powers  --  your honor 's servant . Hart . Squire Hartley What has delayed you after the appointed hour . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Ask the ladies , your honor . Hart . Squire Hartley Did you see her . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Let me alone for that . Hart . Squire Hartley Well  --  what did she say . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty She was knock 'd all of a heap with surprise , and could'nt squeeze a word out . Hart . Squire Hartley And when she recovered , Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Recovered  --  she did'nt recover at all .  --  First she turned white , then red , then white , then red again  --  and at last she bawl 'd out , Dermot , you bewitcher  --  why do you be following me ? Hart . Squire Hartley What the devil do you mean ? Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hart . Squire Hartley What , does she prove false  --  ungrateful , fickle girl . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty And that she does , your honor ; but when I found she was beginning her tantrums  --  Peg , says I. Hart . Squire Hartley Peg  --  are you mad , what Peg . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Why , Peggy O'Brian to be sure . Hart . Squire Hartley Damn Peggy O Brian  --  fool . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Damn Peggy O'Brian . I 'll be damn 'd if that is'nt too bad  --  Damn Peg . Hart . Squire Hartley Answer me , fellow , or you shall instantly quit my service ; what have you been doing in town . Seizing him . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Oh Lord  --  O , O ! Sir , you , you , I  --  Hart . Squire Hartley Have you seen Emily . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Emily  --  By St. Patrick I forgot all about her . Hart . Squire Hartley Answer me , sirrah , have you seen her . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy did'nt drive the whole matter clean out of my head . Would you wish to hear the whole matter from beginning to end ? Hart . Squire Hartley No , sir , answer my question , have you seen Emily ? Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty And that I have  --  ha , ha , ha ! by the powers , it was an odd bit of an accident that brought both our sweethearts slap together on the very same floor  --  for you must know my Peggy happens to be a servant in the very house that contains your mistress . Hart . Squire Hartley What , at the doctor 's . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty The same . Hart . Squire Hartley Well , Dermot , and what have you done ? Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Done  --  and hav'nt I done every thing ; I told the whole business to Peggy , and she says all your commands shall safely go to your mistress . The old doctor doesn't know me , so I can go in and out as often as I like . Hart . Squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , your honor  --  and Peggy , ha , ha , ha ! by the powers I soften 'd her ; at first she would'nt listen to me at all . You must know I was courting her when we liv 'd together at Ballintubber , and because I happened to be a turf cutter , she despised me  --  but her mind seems plaguely alter 'd now ; for when she cried " Dermot , why do you be following me "  --  " be easy , my darling , says I , do you think I do n't know what you are at "  --  so I turn 'd upon my heel , whistled the first part of Patrick 's day , and was going ; but she was after me before you could say turnips . So we settled the whole matter almost before we began to speak of it . Hart . Squire Hartley You 're a happy fellow . Dermot . Fortune seems to smile upon us both . You will marry her , no doubt . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty As to that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genteel woman of her . Hart . Squire Hartley This is indeed a very serious circumstance . How does it happen ? Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty Why the truth is , she has got such a damn 'd brogue that it entirely spoils her beauty . Now your honor knows the brogue might do well enough in Ballintubber , but here it 's the very devil . Hart . Squire Hartley Ha , ha , ha ! well said , Dermot ; come , I shall prepare a letter for Emily  --  and although Peggy has a little of the brogue , you must prevail on her to deliver it . Dermot . Dermot O'Dogherty That I can do ; but if she do n't copy after me and drop the brogue , she never becomes Mrs. O'Dougherty as long as she lives . A wife with a brogue , oh fie ! Exeunt . Scene Scene changes to the Doctor 's house . Emily discovered at her toilette  --  a book open on the table . Emily . Emily Allcure This indeed must be one of my sad days  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Never look 'd half so ill in my life ; never so provokingly ugly . But for what should I look otherwise . Nobody now to see me , except it be my cross father and the cats , or what is worse still , that old frosty fac 'd , starch 'd up piece of family pride , my aunt Deborah , before whose august presence I must appear as demure as  --  . But even so ; I do really dislike looking so bad ; and strange as it may appear . though most young ladies are desirous of being beautiful to please others , I some how am a little desirous even to please myself ; so , poor Maria I shall return to you once more . Reads No , I can not  --  throws down the book . I am so out of conceit with myself  --  and then when I think of my wise headed fathers , driving , or rather flying here , to avoid young Hartley  --  What a piece of madness , for surely if Hartley loves me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finding me out .  --  To night is Lady Grace 's ball . I must be unwell  --  what a pity at such a time  --  Looks in the glass  --  really frightful , heighho . I feel quite indisposed . Oh , oh , oh ! Rings the bell and falls as if fainting , in her chair Enter Peggy . Oh . Peggy , run , child .  --  I shall faint  --  hold up my head  --  stay , the other side . I am almost off . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian Afore heaven , Miss Emily , what can be the matter . Emily . Emily Allcure Oh , Peggy , and at such a time  --  do n't squeeze me  --  do you think I have no feeling . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian Miss . Emily . Emily Allcure There , now , I am gone again , and at such a time too  --  Do n't I look pale , Peggy , very pale . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian Pale  --  afore heaven , Miss , you look as red as the comb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean to insult me  --  You insensible , unfeeling creature  --  falling in her chair  --  do you perceive I am dying . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian St. Patrick forbid . Miss . I never saw you look more beautiful in all my born days . Emily . Emily Allcure Rising and looking in the glass  --  Beautiful , Peggy , no , it can not be , and to night is my Lady Grace 's ball , heigho . Falls again . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian Why , Miss  --  Miss Emily . Emily . Emily Allcure Beautiful did you say . Peggy . A little pale , though more of the lily than the rose . You say I look red ; how vulgar . I can not forgive you  --  red , oh shocking . Peggy . Peggy O'Brian Well , red or white , Miss , if you do n't play the very deuce among them at her Grace 's Ladyships , my name is not Peggy .

Why the fellow I suppose , with his horses and his dogs , has'nt got a sixpence . A pretty son-in-law indeed  --  and finely he 'd squander your money . Doct .

Exit . Scene , the Red Lyon . Hartley , Captain Vernon and Susan . Vernon . Capt . Vernon Ha , ha , ha ,  --  really Hartley , you are composed of most extraordinary materials  --  this doctor , I should suppose , meditated sweet revenge . Hart . Squire Hartley No doubt  --  but while the old gentleman was bustling at the street door , barring and bolting , Dermot and I leap 'd from a back window , on the garden wall , and away , having two or three dogs at our heels , and a parcel of lazy rascals roaring murder , stop thief , and I know not what else . All . All Ha , ha , ha . Vernon . Capt . Vernon And how did you manage , Susan ? Susan . Susan Thanks to Emily , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street door in safety . Vernon . Capt . Vernon So then it appears , you are determined to profit by this new scheme of Dermot 's . Hart . Squire Hartley No doubt . Dermot is a wag , and his plans generally succeed . Vernon . Capt . Vernon How do you like all this , Susan ? Susan . Susan Not at all . I sometimes feel regret at being oblig 'd to perform a promise sacredly given to my brother  --  and yet when I consider that he is sincerely attached to Emily , and that she lives only for him , I can not deem it any great breach of honor or decorum to serve at the same time , my brother and my friend . Vern . Capt . Vernon True , Susan . I never suspected that you could act imprudently , or without the most honorable feeling ; but I trust you will not forget your promise to me . Susan . Susan Never  --  you understand our agreement , you engage in my brother 's service , to act as necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part performed  --  I again pledge myself  --  the hour that yields Emily to Hartley , shall make me your 's  --  this was our agreement Harry  --  was it not . Hart . Squire Hartley Right , Susan  --  do you keep the reckoning , for upon my soul I have forgot half that pass 'd between you . I know you met sour and parted sweet ; but you understand each other I suppose , and that answers every purpose . Susan . Susan Has Dermot gone with the letter yet , apprising Emily of our further intentions . Hart . Squire Hartley Yes , and he 's returned  --  he says Emily will receive it the moment his darling Peggy has an opportunity . I believe , after all , Vernon , we shall be a match for the doctor . Vernon . Capt . Vernon I trust so ; and be assur 'd I am more than anxious to see Dermot in his disguise . Hart . Squire Hartley He will act his part much better than you imagine . I have given him a few lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new style of language , and has impudence sufficient for a peer of the realm . Vernon . Capt . Vernon It will really be laughable  --  you are to be his servant . Hart . Squire Hartley Yes , all his own planning , he assumes the master and I the servant , and that he may not be discovered , he intends to personate a fop , and I a Yorkshire booby  --  but time moves swiftly  --  we must prepare for action  --  Dermot says she must be mine to night , Vernon . Capt . Vernon If so  --  Susan  --  Susan . Susan A truce I beg of you  --  Dermot is his oracle  --  and were he to wish it , I dare say he 'd renounce the girl altogether . Hart . Squire Hartley Perhaps so  --  now to arms , each to his post  --  Vernon I depend upon you  --  Vernon . Capt . Vernon Once more my faith  --  we sink or swim together . Exeunt severally .

To-day the flowing tide yielding our hearts a respite from our cares ; to-morrow 's ebb withdrawing all of comfort , and leaving a dismal blank of sorrow and disappointment . I 've heard it said that none are so truly wretched , as not to receive even in their last moments , a consoling balm from hope . Yes , hope , dear hope , must light me to my pillow , and with the morning 's dawn once more refresh me . This night is fixed for my double wedding  --  my father expects my hand for Sir Edmund Faintley , and Hartley says I shall be his before the hour of twelve . How shall I act . Hartley too comes in disguise  --  Oh , I feel a throbbing here that would prevent my imposing on my father .  --  He seeks my comfort and advancement in life  --  yet I hate Sir Edmund , and I love my Hartley . As a last resource , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward my design . He gave me but one hour to consider  --  and even now he comes to have my final answer . Enter the Doctor . Doct . Doctor Allcure Well , Miss , have you considered of my proposal , and are you ready to give me a becoming answer  --  I hope your own sense and duty to your father will lead you to act as then directed . Emily . Emily Allcure Duty towards the best of parents induces me at the present moment to say I can not become the wife of Sir Edmund Faintley . Doct . Doctor Allcure Indeed . Emily . Emily Allcure The man on whom I bestow my hand , I should wish to possess my heart . Doct . Doctor Allcure And so he shall possess your heart , to be sure he shall . Emily .

Doctor Allcure That 's a lie , hussy , that 's a lie  --  hav'nt I procured you a title , a great establishment , and a splendid fortune . Emily . Emily Allcure And what are these  --  are they sufficient to quell the throbbings of my anguish 'd heart ? Oh , my father , reflect for a moment  --  and save your child . Do not give me to Sir Edmund  --  towards him I could not even assume a cold indifference . I should despise and hate him  --  and surely with such feelings he would not wish me for his wife . Doct .

Doctor Allcure You wont then  --  then squeeze me , if you do n't marry Sir Edmund this very night . Emily . Emily Allcure Can you consign me thus early to the grave , by the sacred love you bore my mother . By the hallowed faith you pledg 'd her , I conjure you , spare me . Doct . Doctor Allcure Emily , can you so soon forget that mother 's express commands  --  if possible , keep Hartley and my child asunder .
