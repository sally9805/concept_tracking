ART . III. - The Duties of an american Citizen ; two Discourses delivered in the First Baptist Meeting house in Boston , on Thursday , . dpril 7,1825 , the Day of Public Fast . By FRANCIS WAYLAND* Jr , Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Boston . Svo. pp. 52 . J. Loring . IT is seldom that we have met with sounder views , or with sentiments more just and liberal on some important topics , than are contained in these discourses . The author , it is true , sets himself rather a formidable task in proposing to consider , within so small a compass , what appears to be the present intellectual and political condition of the nations of Europe , the relations we sustain to them , and the duties which devolve upon us in consequence of those relations , ' hut he has prosecuted his attempt with ability , and with as good success as the nature of the case would admit . The first discourse is devoted to a consideration of the present state of the European nations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a few brief hints on the changes , which society has been undergoing for the last half century throughout christendom , the author speaks of some of the causes , which are still operating with a renewed energy to increase these changes , and to put a new aspect on the social and political condition of man in all parts of the civilised world . The great and powerful instrument of change is knowledge . The means of intelligence are multiplying in every direction , and the desire of attainment is growing stronger and stronger , in spite of the efforts of despotism to arrest the progress of improvement , or cramp the natural aspirations of the mind after freedom and knowledge . The time , indeed , has arrived , when every man must he in a considerable degree a spectator of the doings of the world , or he is soon very far in the rear of the intelligence of the day . ' Nations and men are teaching each other by example ; the actions of one are known to all the others ; different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of navigation , and the interests of nations are becoming more closely'linked by new facilities *of commerce , and a more extensive interchange of commodities , which one can spare and which another wants . // It is thus that a kind of common interest , which has not till lately existed , is growing up between nations , and wider channels are every day opened for communicating to one , a knowledge of the doings and improvements of the others . Hence it is , ' says the author , that the moral influence , which nations are exerting upon each other , is greater than it has been at any antecedent period in the history of the world . The institutions of one country are becoming known almost of necessity to every other country . Knowledge provokes to comparison , and comparison leads to reflection . rrhe fact , that others are happier than themselves , prompts men to inquire whence this difference proceeds , and how their own melioration may be accomplished . By simply looking upon a free people , an oppressed people instinctively feel that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rest , until the enjoyment of these rights is guaranteed to them . Thus , oii e form of government , which in any preeminent degree promotes the happiness of man , is gradually but irresistibly disseminating the principles of its constitution , and from the very fact of its existence , calling into being those trains of thought , which must in the end revolutionise every government within the sphere of its influence , under which the people are oppressed . And thus is it that the field in which mind may labor , has now become wide as the limits of civilisation . A doctrine advanced by one man , if it have any claim to interest , is soon known to every other man . The movement of one intellect , now sets in motion the intellects of millions . We may now calculate upon effects , not upon a state or a people , but upon the melting , amalgamating mass of human nature . Man is now the instrument which genius wields at its will ; it touches a chord of the human heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rivet the attention of a community upon an elementary principle , hitherto neglected in politics or murals , or who can bring an acknowledged principle to bear upon an existing abuse , may , by his own intellectual might , with only the assistance of the press , transform the institutions of an empire or a world . In many respects , the nations of christendom collectively are becoming somewhat analogous to our own Federal Republic . Antiquated distinctions are breaking away , and local animosities are subsiding . The common people of different countries are knowing each other better , esteeming each other more , and attaching themselves to each other by various manifestations of reciprocal good will . It is true , every nation has still its separate boundaries and its individual interests ; but the freedom of commercial intercourse // is allowing those interests to adjust themselves to each other , and thus rendering the causes of collision of vastly less frequent occurrence . Local questions are becoming of less , and general questions of greater importance . Thanks be to God , men have at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs of each other . Mountains interposed do not so much make enemies of nations . Let the trumpet of alarm be sounded , and its notes are now heard by every nation , whether of Europe or America . Let a voice borne on the feeblest breeze , tell that the rights of man are in danger , and it floats over valley and mountain , across continent and ocean , until it has vibrated on the ear of the remotest dweller in christendom . . Let the arm of oppression be raised to crush the feeblest nation on earth , and there will be heard everywhere , if not the shout of defiance , at least the deep toned murmur of implacable displeasure . It is the cry of aggrieved , insulted , much abused man . It is human nature waking in her might from the slumber of ages , shaking herself from the dust of antiquated institutions , girding herself for the combat , and going forth conquering and to conquer ; and wo unto the man , wo unto the dynasty , wo unto the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall the scath of her blighting indignation . ' pp. 10-12 . In the further consideration of his subject , Mr Wayland very properly divides the different forms of government , under which society has existed , into two kinds , the government of will , and the government of law . The first supposes all mankind to be separated into two very disproportionate classes , the rulers and the ruled , who originally possess rights and privileges wholly distinct from each other , it being the province of the former to command , and of the latter to obey , without reference to the wishes , will , or voice of the subordinate party ,  --  subordinate in station and power , although immeasurably superior in numbers . This species of government is fully illustrated by that maxim of the Holy Alliance , which declares that all useful and necessary changes ought only to emanate from the free will and intelligent conviction of those , whom God has made responsible for power . ' Such is the government of will , in which a few persons , whom accident has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Thurlow would say , the accident of an accident , ' undertake to assert , without regard to any distinctions of wisdom , virtue , or merit , that the Almighty has put the rod of authority into their hands , to be wielded over the whole // human race , as the folly , caprice , or interests of these self constituted favorites of heaven may dictate . The government of law is founded on principles in all respects of an opposite kind . Here only one class of society is recognised ; by nature all men are equal , and the husiness of government depends on the mutual choice and agreement of the parties . The power is in the people , and they give up such part of it as they think proper , and into such hands as they choose , and on such conditions as they suppose will best promote the ends of social union . Under this system , the doctrine that human beings , endowed with rational faculties , do not know how to govern themselves and consult their own happiness , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no state of society , in which the people are not qualified to form a government better suited to their condition , than any that can be hnposed on them against their will from abroad . The government of law is a government of choice , in which each individual has a share in appointing the law makers , and subinits to restraints on his own actions , that he may promote private and public benefit by securing the same submission from others . All power of the rulers is held in trust , to be taken away when it is abused . Our own government is an example of this sort , which requires no illustration . Now , which of these two , ' says Mr Wayland , is the right notion of government , I need not stay to inquire . It is sufficient for my purpose to remark , that whenever men have become enlightened by the general diffusion of intelligence , they have universally preferred the government of law . The doctrines of what is called legitimacy , have not been found to stand the scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power is as inseparable from the human bosom as the love of life . Hence men will never rest satisfied with any civil institutions , which confer exclusively upon a part of society , that power which they believe should justly be vested in the whole ; and hence it is evident , that no government can be secure from the effects of increasing intelligence , which is not conformed in its principles to the nature of the human heart , and which does not provide for the exercise of this principle , so inseparable from the nature of man . We see then that the people under arbitrary governments , whenever they have become enlightened , must begin to desire some change in the existing institutions . On the contrary , it is not unreasonable to suppose , that to such change the rulers would everywhere // be opposed . Instances have been rare in the history of man , in which the possessor of power has surrendered it to anything but physical force . The rulers everywhere will , to the utmost of their ability , maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance has declared its determination to bring its whole power to bear upon any point , from which there was reason to fear the love of change , or in other words the love of liberty , would be disseminated . They have announced , that " the powers have an undoubted right to assume a hostile attitude , in relation to those states , in which the overthrow of governments may operate as an example. ** You perceive then , that if the people in Europe have become dissatisfied with the government of will , and if the rulers have determined to support it , the present progress of intelligence must be rapidly dividing the whole community into two great classes . The one is composed of the monarchy , the aristocracy , and the army , and in general , of all those whose wealth , whose rank , or whose influence depends on the continuance of the existing system . The other is composed of the middling and lower classes of society , of the men who understand the nature of liberal institutions , and those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question at issue is , whether a nation shall be governed by men of its choice , or by men , whose only title to rule is derived from hereditary descent ; whether laws shall be made for the benefit of a whole or a part ; and whether they shall be the expression of a monarch 's will , or the unbiassed ( lecisions of an enlightened community . It is a question between precedent and right ; between old notions and new ones ; between rulers and ruled ; be . tween governments and people . It has already agitated Spain , Portugal , Italy , France , Germany , Prussia , and South America . Hence you see , that the parties formed in those nations have all taken their names from their attachments to one or the other of these notions of government . Hence we hear of constitutionahists and royalists , of liberals and anti-liberals , of legitimates and reformers . It is in a word the same question , though modified by circumstances , which *vrought out the revolution under Charles the First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed at Lexington and at Bunker Hill , at Saratoga and at Yorktown. ' pp. 15-18 . Mr Wayland next considers the relations , which this country sustains to the countries of Europe , and these he deduces chiefly from our example in successfully contending for liberty , and establishing and maintaining free institutions , founded on the broad principles of human right and equality , and supported // by a steady and resolute adherence to those principles . Our progress is daily affording a demonstration not only of the practicability of a popular form of government , but of its unrivalled superiority ' to any other form . In connexion with this part of the suhjcc ; , the author remarks , It was not long since fashionable to ridicule the idea , that a people could govern themselves . The science of rulers was supposed to consist in keeping the people in ignorance , in restraining them by force , and amusing them by shows . The people were treated like a ferocious monster , whose keepers could only be secure while its dungeon was dark , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rapidly consigning these notions to merited deruetude . It is teaching the world that the easiest method of governing an intelligent l ) eople is , to allow them to govern themselves . It is demonstrating that the people , so far from being the enemies , are the best , nay , the natural friends of w*olesome institutions . It is showing that kings , and nobles , and standing armies , and religious establishments , are at best only very useless appendages to a form of government . It is showing to the world that every right can be perfectly protected , under rulers elected by the people ; that a government can be stable with no other support than the affections of its citizens ; that a people can be virtuous without an established religion ; and more than this , that just such a governnwnt as it was predicted could nowhere exist , but in the brain of a benevolent enthusiast , has actually existed for half a century , acquiring strength , and compactness , and solidity , with every year 's duration . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , so happy , so enlightened , or so enterprising , and nowhere have the legitimate objects of civil institutions been so triumphantly attained . Against facts such as these it is difficult to argue ; and you see they furnish the friends of free institutions with more than an answer to all the theories of legitimacy . It is unnecessary to pursue this subject further . You are doubtless convii*ced , that this country stands linked by a thousand ties to the popular sentiment of Europe . We have no sympathies with the rulers . The principles , in stipport of which they are allied , are diametrically opposed to the very spirit of our constitution . All our sympathies are *vitb the people ; for we are all of us the ; ) eople . And not only are we thus amalgamated with them iii feeling , we are manifestly at the head of that feeling . We first promulgated their sentiments , we taught them their rights , we first contended successfully for theii principles ; and for fifty years we have furnished incontrovertible evidence that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Herculean // strength , in the very infancy of our empire , and have given us political precedence of governments , which had been established on the old foundation , centuries before our continent was discovered . ' pp. 27- 29 . The topic of example the author pursues at a greater length , and shows how wide an influence the people of the tTnited States may have on the coining destinies of many other nations , by a proper exercise of the privileges of freedom , and an unwavering attachment to the principles on which their political fabric is founded . If this country remain happy , ' he observes , and its institutions free , it will render the common people of other countries acquainted with the fundamental principles of the science of government ; this knowledge will silently produce its practical result , and year after year will insensibly train them to freedom . ' Hence it is easy to poiz*t out the duty of an American citizen , as a member of a politieal union . A moral and intellectual elevation of national character is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people is increased , in the same proportion must the intelligence of the people be enlarged , that they may know how to wield this power with discretion , and be disposed to direct it in a channel , where it shall produce the greatest amount of public benefit . That man only , who is in some good degree advanced in moral and intellectual culture , is qualified to exercise the right of suffrage , and to contribute to promote the strength and happiness of a free community . The subject in this important bearing is discussed with the author 's usual ability and discrimination . We shall select from these discourses only one passage more . But before we leave this part of the subject , it may be well to pause for a moment , and inquire whether , in addition to its moral efficacy , the Bible may not exert a powerful influence on the intellectual character of man . And here it is scarcely necessary that I should remark , that of all the books with which , since the invention of writing , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small which have produced any perceptible effect on the mass of human character . By far the greater part have been , even by their contemporaries , unnoticed and unknown . Not many a one has made its little mark upon the generation that produced it , though it sunk with // that generation to utter forgetfulness . But after the ceaseless toil of six thousand years , how fe*v have been the works , the a ( lamantine basis of whose reputation has stood unhurt amid the fluctuations of time , and whose impression can be traced through successive centuries on the history of our species . When , however , such a work : *ppears , its effects are absolutely incalculable ; and such a work , you are aware , is the Iliad of homer . Who can estimate the results produced by this iucornparable effort of a single mind Who can tell what Greece owes to this first born of song . Her breathing marbles , hei* solemn temples , her unrivalled eloquence , an ( l her matchless verse , all point us to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own effulgence , woke the humaFi intellect from the slumber of ages . It was Homer who gave laws to the artist ; it was Homer who inspired the f ) oet ; it was Homer who thundered in the senate ; and more than all , it was Homer who was sung by the people ; and hence a nation was cast into the mould of one mighty mind , and the land of the Iliad became the region of taste , the birthplace of the arts . Nor was this influence confined within the limits of Greece . Long after the sceptre of empire had passed *vest* *ard , genius still held her court on the banks of the Ilyssus , and from the country of Homer gave laws to the world . The light , which the blind old man of Scio had kindled in Greece , shed its radiance over Italy , and thus did he awaken a second nation to intellectual existence . And we may form some idea of the power , which this one work has to the present day exerted over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nation , and century after century , has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents , new name his characters , and paraphrase his * But considered simply as an intellectual production , who will compare the poems of homer with the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament . Where in the Iliad shall we find simplicity and pathos , which shall vie with the narrative of Moses , or maxims of conduct to equal in wisdom the Proverbs of Solomon , or sublimity , which does not fade away before the conceptions of Job or David , of Isaiah or St John . But I can not pursue this comparison . I feel that it is doing wrong to the mind , which ( lictated the Iliad , and to those other mighty intellects on whom the light of the holy oracles never shined . Who that has read his poem has not observed how he strove in vain to give dignity to the mythology of his time ? Who has not seen how the religion of his country , unable to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the unseen world where the master spirits of our race breathe freely and are at home ; and it is mournful to behold the intellect of Homer striving to free itself from the conceptions of materialism , // and then sinking down in hopeless despair , to weave idle fables of Jupiter and Juno , Apollo or Diana . But the difficulties under which he labored are abundantly illustrated by the fact , that the light , which he poured upon the human intellect , taught other ages how unworthy was the religion of his day , of the man who was coml ) elled to use it . " It seems to * says Longinus , " that Homer , when he ascribes dissensions , jealousies , tears , Imprisonments , and other afflictions to his Deities , hath , as much as was in his power , made the men of the Iliad gods , and the gods men . To man when afflicted , death is the termination of evils ; but he bath made not only the nature but the miseries of the gods eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one effort of a single mind , what may we not expect from the combined efforts of several , at least his equals in power over the human heart ? If that one genius , though groping in the thick darkness of absurd idolatry , wrought so glorious a transformation in the character of his countrymen , what may we not look for from the universal dissemination of those writings , on whose authors was poured the full splendor of eternal truth ? If unassisted human nature , spell bound by a childish mythology , have done so much , what may we not hope for from the supernatural efforts of preeminent genius , which spake as it was moved by the Holy Ghost ? pp. 42-45 . The above extracts will serve as a specimen of Mr Wayland 's mode of thinking and writing , although it would not be fair to judge of the entire merits of his discourses , from the very imperfect outline , which we have here presented . As an exhibition of strong powers of intellect , united with a wide reach of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind are worthy of higher commendation . We object to nothing but some of the author 's remarks on the Romish church , which would have been more applicable three centuries ago , than at the present time . How far these discourses may be compared with Mr Wayland 's very eloquent Sermon on the Moral Dignity of the Missionary Enterprise , which has been so much read and praised in this country and Great Britain , we shall not decide . Nor is such a parallel necessary ; they are both the productions of a vigorous mind and a good heart , creditable to the talents and religious motives of the author ' and form a valuable addition to the stock of our literature .
