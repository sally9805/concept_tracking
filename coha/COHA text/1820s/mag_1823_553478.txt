Observations on a Journey to England , with Recollections of memorable Occurrences and Contemporaries , during the last // fifty years . By . tlugustus Herman Niemeyer , D. D. 2 vols. 8vo , 2d edition . Halle , 1822 . No nation in Europe is better calculated than the German to furnish travellers in England . The French are too much embittered by the natural hostility ' existing between the countries , to be impartial on the subject of the British character and institutions . The Germans , if erring on either side , are too prone to view every thing in England ; with admiring eyes . This disposition is , however , in some degree corrected by the offence which the Germans naturally take at the disdainful manner in which their national character , language , and literature are treated in England . In self-defence , a considerable freedom of censure is therefore exercised by German travellers in England ; while the better qualities of industry , curiosity , and not seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , than among their mercurial neighbors on the continent . Some excellent books of travels in England have accordingly appeared in German , of which the best , that of Professor Go*de of G6ttingen , in an English translation by Mr Home , has been reprinted in this country , and was noticed in our number for July , 1822 . Excepting the work of Mr Simond , that of Goede is the best book of travels in England with which we are acquainted . The work before us is from the pen of Dr Niemeyer , chancellor of the University of Halle , a seat of learning , which , to say nothing of living scholars , is renowned among theologians at least , for the name of Semler . Dr Niemeyer has long filled , with great distinction , the honorable place of chancellor of the University , of which he is also a professor in the theological faculty . He is likewise at the head of a high school in Halle , which forms a part of a series of charitable foundations , that owe their origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in importance the private benefactions for literary and charitable purposes , in any other part of Germany . Among these establishments , the Canstein press for printing bibles is justly worthy of note , and has been called the pattern of the British and Foreign Bible Society . Twelve presses are constantly employed in this establishment , in multiplying copies of the scriptures , not indeed for gratuitous distribution , but for sale at a low price ; and from these presses , within a century , over two hundred editions of the bible have appeared . // To his standing as chancellor of the University of Halle , Dr Niemeyer adds that of one of the most esteemed of the living writers in Germany . His Scripture Characters and his various works on the theory and practice of education have passed through many editions , and are particularly acceptable to that moderate party in Germany , who though not inheriting the strictness of times gone by , are still farther from adopting the bold speculations of the last half century . The personal character of Dr Niemeyer contributed not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous period of the French domination . Twice , the decree of its suppression was pronounced by the Westphalian government , whose patronage of letters was almost confined to the more fortunate University of G6ttingen . Dr Niemyer , however , has had the happiness to see the University , where he received his own education , and to which he has devoted the labors of his life , survive these shocks ; and possess at the present day a reputation among the most respectable of the German seminaries . His journey to England appears to have been rather an excursion of relaxation , pleasure , and philosophical curiosity1 than a professed traveller 's expedition . It began about the end of May , and at the beginning of August we find him on his return , at the mouth of the Elbe , leaving , after a deduction of the time consumed on the way , but about two months for his visit in England . We mention not this as at all detracting from the value of the work before us , in which the observations made by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opportunities . So far from condemning journies of so short a duration , we could wish that they were oftener undertaken , even from our shores and with the discouragement of an ocean to be crossed . The idea that all Europe must be visited , and two or three years passed abroad , terrifies many , whose leisure and means do not extend to so formidable a length . Whereas a season is enough to answer some of the most desirable purposes of a voyage to Europe ; and the improvements in navigation are now so great , that with rational views of the length of time requisite to be abroad , many more of our young men might command this advantage than at present , without the danger to which they are exposed of being weaned from their national tastes and habits , by a protracted residence in foreign dissipated capitals . // As Dr Niemeyer 's time in England was limited , his obser vations are chiefly confined to London , Cambridge , Oxford , and Windsor , and to topics , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those relating to education , charitable establishments , and religion . In point of variety , therefore , his work is not designed to enter into competition with that of Professor Gcade , nor would it prove so generally interesting to readers , who open a book of travels for matter-of-fact information as to the countries of which it treats . Neither does Dr Niemeyer profess , like Mr Simond , whom he quotes with great respect , to enter much into economical and statistical details . Scarce any thing in this way is attempted from original sources . The matter of the works with the exception of a moderate portion of traveller 's anecdote and adventure , consists of his observations on what he had occasion to see and hear in England . What we have already stated of his character and standing will prepare our readers to place a good deal of reliance on his remarks upon a large class of very interesting topics ; nor will they find themselves on the whole disappointed . If we take any exception , it is to the extreme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bright side of English institutions . Though in many things he censures with freedom , yet in others he strains a point , as it seems to us , to defend what ought not to he defended . When we find him , with nearly equal zeal , arguing against the trial by jury , and in favor of the mode of education pursued at the public schools and universities in England , we can not but regret that so respectable an authority should have placed himself so much and so unexpectedly in the wrong . In general , however , Dr Niemeyer 's remarks are judicious and impartial , and his work , which with unusual rapidity has passed through two editions , is equally honorable to his feelings and to his understanding . As it is wholly out of the question to analyze a book of travels , we shall attempt nothing more , in the remainder of this article , than an extract of some part of the amusing and instructive matter which it eontains . One of the most incomprehensible things to every traveller is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in which the peculiarities of the English are most marked , having descended by inheritance to us , strike us in no degree as A*'ew &amp;rzes , No. 16. 40 // strange . It is often not a little amusing to see what portentous oddities alarm the foreigner of some other nation , in what pass with us for the most common incidents of life . We shall abridge from Dr Niemeyer 's work , as an illustration of this remark , an account of an English dinner party , which he has himself extracted from a book on England , written by a lady of some note in Germany , Madame Schopenbaner , who is mentioned , if we remember , by Madame de Sta*l. our readers will be inclined to think , from one or two points in the description , that Madame Scbopenhauer*s dining acquaintance did not all live in St James ' Square . The table , ' says this lady , as quoted by Dr Niemeyer , appears to you as you enter the dining-room all *erved , but for the most part without napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in sitting takes it upon his knee , and uses it , as we do our napkins . The lady of the house sits in an armed chair , at the head of the table , and her husband opposite to her* at the other end . The guests take their places in common chairs on either side , and intermingled with each other , as their places are prescribed to them by the host . All the dishes , which belong to the first course , stand upon the table under block-tin covers . The lady helps to the soup ,  --  somewhat thin , but well seasoned with Cayenne-asking every individual guest if he choose any . Soup with the English is a rarity . A friend or two next assist the lady and gentleman of the house in helping to the other dishes . All the dishes are helped to immediately after the soup , and not in a regular order , one dish at a time , as in Germany . They consist , generally , of fish , such as salmon , cod , turbot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt in the cooking ; of puddings , vegetables , tarts , and all sorts of flesh and poultry , without salt , butter , or other addition ; cooked with steam , broiled , roasted , or boiled . Pepper only is bestowed in abundance . When a thin , dry crust is laid on such a dish , it is dignified with the name of a pasty . The half-raw vegetables must look green and fresh , and it is not till they appear on the taide , that melted butter is put to them , and then by each one according to his taste . Potatoes fail at no dinner ; they are excellent , but cooked in steam alone . The puddings of all kinds would be very good , but that they are too fat , often made of little els* than beef marrow . The pies , the triumph of English cookery , consist of half-ripe fruit , boiled in water , and provided with a cover of dry paste . The pickles , which accompany the roasted dishes , consisting of vegetables of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions , and so forth , preserved with strong // vinegar and much spice , are excellent . In these , as also in soy and other rich sauces , which are manufactured by wholesale , a great trade is carried on from London to all parts of the world . The sauces , mustard , oil , and vinegar , stand in ornamental frames for the use of the guests ; also for every two persons is placed a saltcellar . The salad is dressed and cut small , by the lady of the house at table , with great ceremony ; it consists of a very tender , succulent lettuce , whose leaves are narrow , but half a yard long . I have never seen it out of England ; and in return the English are wholly unacquainted with our head lettuce ! At an Lng*ish table there is no end of questions on the side of the host , and answers on that of the guest ; a great embarrassment for a foreigner , who though otherwise well enough acquainted with English , is still wholly unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly of every dish whether he will have any-much or little-with sauce or without-what part of the fowl or fish-well done or rare . ' This account , ' interrupts Dr Niemeyer , is not exaggerated . While eating , nothing but eating is spoken of ; a circumstance which tasks a foreigner not a little . The technical terms must first be learned ; and yet , with very little choosing , I have generally surrendered at discretion ; little to the content of host and hostess , who are really concerned that you should have what you like best . ' The ceremony of drinking , says Madame Schopenhauer , is every where the same . The host commonly begins and " demands permission of a lady to drink a glass of wine with her , " and at the same time desires her to say whether she will have red port or white sherry . These two wines are always on the table and every where in two decanters exactly matched , often of the finest cut glass , with two glasses for each guest of somewhat different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman say , as in chorus , " Sir , your good health , " " Madam , your good health , " drink out their glasses , and set them away . Presently the s*me challenge is heard from another voice , the same ceremony is repeated , and still repeated , till every gentleman has drunk with every lady , and every lady with every gentleman , at least once round ! No one can decline ; that were offensive . Besides this , at the first glass every one is bound , at least with a bow , to wish the health of every one at the table , and also to give particular note , if the same attention be paid him by any of the other guests . It would be improper for a lady to drink without being asked ; which , however , she can not long be uninvited to do . The gentlemen also , with every glass , invite some one to join them ; to whom a third also may join himself after duly asking permission . In this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking healths , and attending when your own is drunken , // one has enough to do . ' Dr Niemeyer justly observes here , that though this may be the ancient order in many families , it is more or less departed from in others , and that health-drinking is in general going out of use as unfashionable . ' The number of dishes , ' continues Madame Schopenhauer , is seldom great . All moves briskly ; and in an hour or more the dinner is over . The table is cleared , the crumbs of bread carefully swept up with a cloth , and different kinds of cheese , butter , radishes , and again salad are brought on . The latter is eaten with cheese , without any dressing but salt . This interlude lasts not long , and gives place to another ; every guest receives a small , finely ground cup of water , for rinsing the teeth and washing the hands , together with a small napkin ; and they are used just as one alone at home would use them . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The table-cloth , with every thing upon it disappears , and the beautiful , polished mahogany table shines before you . Decanters and glasses are now placed before the master of the house , the fruit is set on , and every guest receives a small dessert plate , two glasses , and a small red checked or plain red cloth , folded square . This however is seldom unfolded , and is only used to place a glass on . The fruit is not handed round , but as before , in the other dishes , helped out and offered , with many questions . Now the decanters begin to play the chief part ; each pushes them to his neighbor , after having helped himself to little or much as he will . The host now gives toasts , drinks to the health . of his friends , and never forgets the royal family . Soon the lady of the house rises from her armed chair , and with a slight inclination gives the signal to the other ladies . All rise and follow their leader modestly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all restraint is banished , and they are alone with their wine , politics , and cheerful conversation . * * * . Meantime the ladies amuse themselves as well as they can , by the fire in the other room , for an hour or more , till tea and coffee are prepared , when the gentlemen join their party and conversation grows more animated . ' We have quoted this account of an English dinner from a German lady of literary celebrity , to which Dr Niemeyer has given his sanction by adopting it into his work . It shows how easy it is by a little ignorance or inattention , and a little exaggeration , for a foreigner to make a strange story out of what seems to a native the simplest thing in the world . The wonderment of a native of the east would begin much sooner . Accustomed to leave his slippers at the door , he would be astounded // to see the carpet trod by the shoes and boots , which had just been traversing the streets . Used to wearing a turban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked head . Familiarized to sitting on the floor and eating with his fingers , he would be equally incumbered and perplexed at being put up into such a scaffold as a chair , and forced to perform , what he would consider the cook 's or the butcher 's office , that of carving and cutting the meat . As a further illustration of the difference of sentiment , as well a manners in different nations , we may add that common delicacy has forced us Americans to omit the reference , which Madaine Schopenhaner makes , toward the end of her description of an English dinner , to a custom , which though practised by English gentlemen and reported by German ladies , can not even be named among us . The following list of the charitable establishments in London is found toward the close of Dr Niemeyer 's first volume . 1 . Forty-three free schools in which four thousand children are either educated or supported , or both . 2 . Seventeen schools for children wholly destitute and forsaken . 3 . Two hundred and thirty.sevea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in which from ten to twelve thousand children , boys and girls , are educated . 4 . Twenty-two hospitals for sick , infirm , or lying-in patients . 5 . Two large lunatic hospitals , Bedlam and St Luke's. 6 . One hundred and seven poor-houses , for the support of indigent aged persons . 7* Eighteen establishments for the relief of specific classes of the unfortunate , poor , and helpless . 8 . Twenty dispensaries from which medicine is gratuitously distributed to the poor . In all these establishments it is calculated that about ? 850,000 sterling , or near $4,000,000 , annually are expended . ' These facts , which we believe are taken from Colquhoun , certainly exhibit an enormous patronage of poverty ; and may justly enough be compared to the w*fges , by which any other part of the community lives . Whether it is exclusive of the poor-rates in London , we are not apprized , but we presume it is . The survey of these enormous contributions levied for the support of poverty , connected with the doctrine that the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep pace with the demand , has led the economists of Mr // Maithus ' school , as has been hinted in the preceding article , to recommend the suspension of all legal provision for the poor . It is no part of our present intention , to engage in the discus-* sion of this great and difficult question ; but we would submit one or two doubts to the consideration of those benevolent persons , whose minds have been perplexed by the plausible arguments urged for so harsh a measure . Is it true that poverty is the effect of the sums of money appropriated for their relief ? Is it not a natural and an essential consequence of the bodily and intellectual inequality of man , that in a large and flourishing tommunity , there should be a gradation from the height of prosperity to the depths of misery ? Do not old age , sickness , misfortune , infancy , widowhood-besides the vices which are as much a part of our imperfect natures as the virtues-lead to a great amount of poverty , by the inevitable constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of all the members of society , according to their ability , to contribute to the relief of that poverty , which necessarily results from the organization of society ? If relief ought to be given , should it not be in the most regular , best concerted and efficient way ? And do the evils resulting from ill devised and ill administered poor-laws furnish any other reason against judicious laws well executed , than the evils resulting from bad governments badly administered , do against good governments well administered ? We apprehend that the true and obvious answers to all these questions would go far to furnish a refutation of the popular objections against systematic provision for the relief of the poor . No subject is treated more at length by Dr Niemeyer than that of education , and the various establishments provided for it in England . His remarks on the Bell and Lancaster schools probably contain more novelty for the German than for the American reader . Dr Niemeyer expresses very decidedly the opinion , that the system of mutual instruction is adapted only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce it into higher branches . But we confess we perceive no solid ground for this opinion . Besides a few mechanical and disciplinary arrangements , which are certainly as applicable to a high school as to a primary school , and for want of which most schools suffer , we suppose the great characteristics of the Lancaster method to be these two : the employment // of monitors , whereby a multitude of pupils can be instructed by one master ; and the constant keeping up of the attention , by the mode in which the exercises are conducted . Each of these methods may certainly be introduced into high schools . It has long been the practice in almost all schools , on occasion , to employ the more advanced pupils to teach the younger . We know of no reason why this may not be systematized and reduced to rule and generally applied , in one branch as well as another , or at least to the study of the languages , and uniformly as well as occasionally . The other principle , that of keeping up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the languages , in many respects , as in the humblest elements of arithmetic or spelling . Thus in construing , let the head boy in the class give the first word , Cano , I sing ; the second boy the second , arma , arms , war ; the third boy , virumque , and the man , &amp;c. - In case of error , since the boys might not , as in arithmetic or spelling , be able to judge when an error was really committed , the master should first make a sign , that an error had been committed , and the boys should then correct each other , in the usual way of Lancaster schools . This might be the usual mode of recitation , without wholly excluding that now practised , which might occasionally be used to give the pupils an opportunity of exercising and showing their taste in phraseology . In like manner , in parsing , the first boy might state the part of speech ; the second , the theme or root ; the third , go through the appropriate inflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ; the fifth its regimen , and the sixth the rule of syntax . It appears to us that , in this way , attention might be kept on the alert , as well in a classical as an elementary school , and that recitation might be made a much more searching test of proficiency . Without , however , enlarging on this subject , we may observe that Dr Niemeyer has given as a reason for the limited introduction of Lancaster schools in Germany , a circumstance , which has likewise prevented their general adoption here , viz , the goodness of the existing establishments . But since there is little doubt that in schools where only the common branches of English learning are taught , one teacher is , upon the Lancaster plan , competent to the instruction of four or five hundred pupils , it may deserve consideration whether the expenses of the schools in Boston might not be // materially lessened , and the schools themselves as well taught by the introduction of the new plan . The great experience of Dr Niemeyer in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , and the acknowledged excellence of the German schools , were circumstances which led us to look with no little eagerness toward that portion of his book , which relates to the school at Eton . Dr Niemeyer speaks of the great difficulty of getting access to the interior of the English public schools , and observes that his friends in London dissuaded him from making the attempt to visit them . This fact contrasts strongly with the readiness that exists both in France and Germany , and we may add in our own country also , to subject the daily condition and progress of the schools to the constant inspection of all , who choose to visit them . On his way from Oxford to Eton , Dr Niemeyer formed the acquaintance in the stagecoach , of the wife of a country clergyman , whose son had just been appointed an under-master at Eton , to which place she was journeying , in order to arrange her son 's household . On their arrival at Eton Dr Niemeyer was introduced by the mother to the son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be shown to a stranger in holidays . The college at Eton consists of two courts surrounded on all sides by buildings . The wing that divides the courts forms the lodge of the provost , the office for which Lord Bacon asked  --  and asked in vain . Another is taken up by a fine church . Opposite this , is the lower school with two sleepinghalls , in which are seventy beds for boys on the foundation . On the fourth side of this court , is the upper school in an immense hail . Under it , is a long cloister , in which in unpleasant weather the young men may take their exercise and diversion . The second court is occupied by the apartments of the fellows , the dining hall , and library . The foundation dates from the time of Henry VI , in the fifteenth century . A provost and seven fellows form the government of the college , and appoint to the offices . They are rather to be regarded as canons or prebendaries , as they have permission to marry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college , unless filling some other office there . They choose the master , the lower master , and the seventy collegers . Eton // has several rich livings in its gift , and its revenues are very considerable . The provost , besides a splendid dwelling , has about ? 1000 sterling , and a fellow , besides being able to hold a living , has about ? 300 a year . The boys on the foundation are gratuitously supported , and are distinguished from the other scholars by a black gown , which they are always obliged to wear . The scholars not on the foundation compose by far the greater part , and often amount to four hundred . They live near the college in private dwelling-houses , of which the mistresses are called dames . ' These are responsible for the be havior of their boarders , and subject to lose the privilege of taking them , by repeated connivance at violations of the laws . The houses , moreover , are visited by the teachers , to know whether the boys are at home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be charged are all fixed . The amount for the most essential articles is about ? 60 per annum , which , however , does not defray more than half of the necessary expense . The vacations amount to sixteen weeks in the year . Several of the instructers are also private tutors to individuals particularly committed to them , for which an ample compensation is given . In a word the average expence of a boy at Eton is about ? 170 yearly , which enables one to estimate how large a sum of money is thrown into circulation by the college . The external appearance of things corresponds but indiffer ently with such an expenditure . The rooms of the students , both in and out of the college , appeared to Dr Niemeyer extremely small and poor , ' accustomed as he was to the certainly not splendid accommodations of German free schools . The seventy boys on the foundation , have no place of abode , but in their sleeping ball , of which the disorderly and dreary as pect is compensated only by a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is throughout very deficient . In the school rooms the benches are about five inches wide , and the desks are of the plainest wood , and carry on their exterior , as do also the walls , traces of the youthful love of mischief . Tables are rarely seen in the school rooms , and no where are there marks of the neatness and elegance , which are almost universal in England . Dr Niemeyer avers that the appear . // ance of things in many of the schools in the villages and small towns of Germany is not worse than at Eton . The fare is very plain , consisting of mutton alone the year round . As to instruction Dr Niemeyer repeats his remark on the difficulty of becoming acquainted by actual observation with its details . He has , however , stated some facts relative to it , derived from the information collected by him at Eton , and also from an essay written by Mr Kiittner , a German who resided there several years as an instructer in the college . The whole body of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster the whole seven classes are crowded into one . In each ball at Eton , there are three or four desks at some distance from each other , from which the different divisions are instruct . " ed at the same time , without troubling themselves about each other . Instruction is wholly conducted on the principle of tasks assigned ; little instruction is imparted by the teachers vie6 voce , and nothing written down by the pupil , and the business of the teachers is discharged in hearing the recitations and correcting the exercises . Instruction , moreover , is confined almost wholly to the Latin and Greek languages , and in this department the chief progress is made . Dr Niemeyer observes that in other branches , in geography , history , and natural history , the English schools can enter into no comparison with the German ; that foreign languages and literature are wholly neglected , and that the religious instruction is very de. * ficient . In the study of the classics , the attention is directed rather to a knowledge of the quantity and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which absorb a considerable part of instruction in the German schools , and in this respect Dr Niemeyer has the candor to give the preference to the English method ; as more favorable to the formation of a polite acquaintance with classical literature . The discipline of the English public schools is represented by Dr Niemeyer as a mingled system of indulgence and severity , which , while it leaves much liberty to the pupils of settling their own little difficulties among themselves , nevertheless requires with great strictness an obedience to the prescribed laws . Dr Niemeyer having expressed his surprize at the sight of long birch rods in one of the school rooms , was informed that scarce a week passes in which one or another is not sent up ' to the head master ( who alone has the privilege of inflict* // ing the punishment of the rod ) to be flogged , in the way , ' says our author significantly , ' that little children are chastised in Germany . ' Notwithstanding this severity , however , our author observes that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt from the disorders usually fouud in such establishments . The foregoing is the amount of information contained in Dr Niemeyer 's remarks on the English schools , and with it we must close our notice of his work . Without laying claim to the character of an indiscriminate observer , he is certainly entitled to that of a fair and candid one , and his work must be , by almost every class of readers , perused with satisfaction .
