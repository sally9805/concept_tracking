txt ART . XI .. - Letters and Memoirs relating to the War of dinerscan independence , and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga . By MADAME DE RIEDEsEL . Translated from the Original German . New York . G. &amp; C. Carvill. l2mo. pp. *323 . THE custom of employing mercenary troops in warfare is as ancient , perhaps , as the history of civilization . It is recog-. nised among the laws of nations , and justified on the ground , that it is lawful for any sovereign , in combating his enemies , to use such means as he can command , both by the physical strength and the wealth of his dominions . These two togeth .. er constitute the actual measure of his power , to the full extent of which he may exercise his legitimate authority , and repel hostilities . On the side of the mercenary it is alleged , that he has a right to enlist in the service of any country he chooses , provided he does it not to the injury of his own government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is lawful for one is lawful for all , any sovereign may aid another with mercenary forces , if the soldiers who compose them engage voluntarily in the service . No little casuistry has been exercised by writers in discussing these topics , hut into this labyrinth we are not about to enter , nor shall we inquire how far usage is borne out by strict principles of justice , or even by a sound policy . It is quite certain that the British ministry , at the beginning of the American revolution , had no scruples on the subject , and that in Parliament they strenuously defended the course they adopted . The military operations of 1775 in the Colonies had been less successful , than was anticipated , and it was resolved to send over an army the ensuing year , that should quell all disturbances and speedily put an end to the contest . It was proposed to augment this force to fifty-five thousand men , but no more than twenty-five thousand regular English troops could be spared for this purpose . To make up the deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercenarlesq In the month of January , 1776 , an agent was despatched to Germany , who first made a treaty with the duke of Brunswic , in which it was stipulated , that four thousand three hundred Brunswic troops should be at the disposal of the British government for prosecuting the war in America . A few days afterwards , another treaty was concluded by the same agent with the Landgrave of Hesse , who agreed to furnish twelve thousand men . Similar treaties were also entered into with with the hereditary prince of Hesse , and the prince of Waldec . The whole amount of forces thus obtained in Germany , was somewhat over seventeen thousand men , all of whom , without much delay , were sent to America . When these proceedings were laid before Parliament , they were censured with great severity by the opposition , both as showing an inability on the part of England to cope with ' her enemies , a thing not to be acknowledged , and as sanctioning a principle in warfare , which violated justice , and the good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , moreover , that the terms imposed on England were extremely un* reasonable , and manifested a spirit of cupidity in the German princes , which it was disgraceful to tolerate . There was much truth in this charge . Seven guineas , as bounty or levy money , were to be paid for every soldier . The Duke of Brunswic was to receive , in addition , a stipend of fifteen thousand five hundred pounds sterling a year , and twice this sum for the two years after the term of the soldiers* service expired . The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel was also to be paid one hundred and eight thousand pounds a year ; and the other princes in the same proportion . These sums were exclusive of . the wages of the troops , which were likewise to be paid by the British government . The conduct of the German princes in these transactions has generally been reprobated by historians . They literally sold the sinews of their subjects , to be wasted in a foreign land , waging a war in which they could have no possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniary recompense , which redounded to their personal benefit . It was a private bargain on their part , in which the moral agency and natural rights of the soldiers seem not to have been ta* ken into the account . We have rQad of the humorist San. * cho 's wish , ' said Lord Irnham in Parliament , that if he were VOL. xxvi. -. - No. 58. 29 // a prince , all his subjects should be blackamoors , as he could , by the sale of them , easily turn them into ready money ; . but that wish , however it may appear ridiculous and unbecoming a sovereign , is much more innocent than a prince 's availing himself of his vassals for the purpose of sacrificing them in such a destructive war , where he has the additional crime of making them destroy much better and nobler beings than themselves . ' A celebrated European writer observes , that it has not been uncommon for two nations to enter into compacts , by by which one should aid the other in furnishing troops or money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both , ' but that it was reserved for an enlightened age to witness treaties , by which a sovereign condemned his subjects to pour out their blood in a foreign cause , solely for the purpose of increasing his personal wealth . ' The Duke of Brunswic 's case is said to admit of extenuation . He had lately taken the reins of government ; he found the finances in an embarrassed condition , and the people impoverished ; and he actually paid away all the money he received from Great Britain for the relief of his subjects . The Brunswic troops were put in motion , within six weeks after the treaty was concluded , under the command of the Baron de Riedesel . They proceeded first to England , and then to Canada , where they were incorporated into the English army under General Burgoyne , with whom they were eventually captured at Saratoga . The little volume , which we are about to notice , consists of letters from General Riedesel to his wife , but chiefly of letters and memoirs written by herseif describing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their seven years ' residence in America . The volume was printed many years ago in Germany , and is now for the first time translated into English . Madame de Riedesel early resolved to share her husband 's fortunes in America ; and as it was not convenient for her to depart with him , it was agreed that she should follow him to Quebec as soon as circumstances would permit . She left Wolfenbiittel , in Brunswic , on the fourteenth of May , 1776 , and travelled in her own carriage by way of Brussels , Tournay , and St. Omer to Calais . Her children and servants were her only companions , and her chief confidence was placed in good old Rockel , ' who had long been an appendage to her father 's family , and had attained the post of forester . // Neither this old domestic , nor any of the party had been accustomed to travelling , and various cross accidents fell out to try the patience of our heroine . Innkeepers were rude , disobliging , and exorbitant in their demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this naturally caused alarm . But the journey was , on the whole , fortunate , and she arrived safely at Calais . We must not forget to mention , that she had three children , all daughters , namely ; Gustava , who was four years and nine months old ; Frederica , two years old ; and Carolina , who was born ten weeks before she departed from Wolfenhiittel . Such a charge was enough to keep alive a deep anxiety in a mother 's mind , and to require resolution and fortitude . But in these respects she proved herself ade qute to the task she had undertaken . Her tenderness for her children , resolution in braving all difficulties , and habitual cheerfulness , were conspicuous from the beginning to the end of her wanderings . By the following extract she appears not to have been exempt from the common lot of inexperienced travellers , that of being imposed upon by interested persons . This is a tax , which all must pay at one time or another of their lives , and it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Riedesel , although they will not be likely to fall into a more odd or embarrassing train of incidents . On our landing at Dover , we received many congratulations , on having supported so well the fatigues of so long a voyage ; but this cost money . I was accosted by more than thirty innkeepers , who all begged me to take lodgings at their houses . I gave the preference to a French hotel , and was much pleased with it . It was a splendid establishment , and particularly remarkable for its extreme cleanliness . The custom-house officers came to visit the baggage , which was rather an irksome business ; but I was provided with letters for the collector , who , as soon as he was informed that the purpose of my voyage was to rejoin my husband in America , politely observed , that it would be very rude to vex the wife of a general , who had gone so far for the service of his king . This settled the matter . Having been obliged to leave my carriage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postchaise for my journey to London  --  a mode of travelling , which is very expensive , as the transportation of the baggage is regulated according to its weight . I reached London on the evening of the 1st of June , and found many of my acquaintance there , among whom were Geu.r ' // al Schijeffen , M. de Kurtzleben , and Count Taube . My husband had written to the latter , begging him to procure for me private lodgings ; but , for fear 1 should not come , he had given himself no trouble about it , by which I might have had better and cheaper accommodations . I was , however , happy to see how much interest my husband had taken in my voyage , and how sure he was that I should keep my resolution , and I rejoiced so much the more that I did not yield to the apprehensions with which some persons endeavored to impress me . I must now mention a circumstance , which rendered my lodgings here rather disagreeable . I had trusted entirely to my landlord at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I think that he abused my confidence , by sending over to England many things at my expense . He also advised me not to depart without being accompanied by some trusty man , because I should otherwise be exposed to great dangers ; and he seemed to take much pains to procure such a person for me . He at length came with a well-dressed man , whom he introduced to me as a nobleman , a friend of his , who was willing to accompany me to London . I received him with great civility , and felt at a loss how to acknowledge his extreme politeness . In the carriage I begged him to take his seat next to me , and kept the children opposite to to me ; thus endeavoring , by all means , to prevent them from being troublesome to him . lie affected the manners of a man of much consequence , and ate at my table during the whole journey . I observed , however , that the servants at the inns were on free and easy tennis with him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation under which I thought I was to him , blinding me altogether . But I could not help feeling some astonishment when , at the hotel where we alighted , on our arrival in London , I was ushered into a miserable room in the fourth story , though I had asked for a good apartment , and had been assured by M. de Feronce , of Brunswic , that I should find splendid lodgings . I imagined that I could not have a better room because the house was already full , and general Schlieffen , and the other gentlemen who came to visit me , and , particularly , the ladies for whom the hereditary princess , now duchess of Brunswic , had given me letters of introduction , wondered that I was in so bad an abode . On the following day , the landlord came with an abashed air , and a most reverential demeanor , to ask me , whether I knew the man with whom I had arrived , and whom I had so particularly desired him to provide with good lodgings ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in London . ) I answered , that he was a nobleman , who , on the request of Mr Guilbaudin , my landlord at Calais , had been kind enough to accompany me on my // journey . " Ali ! " cried the landlord , " that is one of his tricks . The man is a footman , a " valet de place , " a rogue , through whom he is glad to promote his own interest , Seeing him sitting next to you in your carriage , when you arrived , I could not , I confess , believe that you were the lady you pretended to be , and thought that these rooms were good enough for you . But I see now , by the persons that visit you , how much I was mistaken , and I ask your pardon , madam , and beg that you will follow me into another apartment , for which you shall not pay more than for that which you now occupy , for 1 really wish to atone by all means for my error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid me of my companion as soon as possible . I was , however , obliged first to pay him four or six guineas ( I do not remember the exact sum ) for his company* I could never forgive Mr Guilhaudin this trick ; and he did not behave much better concerning my carriage . It was he who told me that it was prohibited to import carriages into England , arid advised me to leave mine in his care . I was afterwards informed , that his purpose was to do with it , what he had already done with other vehicles entrusted to him , namely , to hire it to travellers on their way to Germany . But this I prevented , by soliciting of Lord North permission to bring it over to England , free from duties . The minister immediately complied with my request , and though this detained me a few days , 1 found it much to my convenience and comfort to have waited for my carriage . ' pp. 64-68 . She remained in London only a few days , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port she intended to embark for Quebec in the first suitable vessel that should sail . Here she resided three or four months , prevented by various obstacles from taking her departure , till at length the season was far advanced . She then wrote for advice to Lord George Germaine , Secretary of State for America , who offered her a passage in a packet-ship , which was about to sail . Resolving to accept this offer , she went to Portsmouth for the purpose of taking passage , but here she was discouraged from entering upon a voyage to Canada , which was deemed hazardous on the approach of winter , and which at all events would be attended with infinite discomfort to a lady with three young children . The voyage was given up for the winter , and she returned to London , where she stayed till spring . She speaks cheerfully of the manner in which the time passed during this period , although she had been severely disappointed in not being able to join her husband as soon as she expected . Hours and days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. by devoted attention to her children . A circle of friends , in the first ranks of society , afforded her solace and rational amusement . She was introduced to the king and queen , who expressed a lively interest in her situation , and gave her some testimonies of their esteem . In April she sailed for Quebec , where she arrived on the eleventh of Juiie . General Riedesel was then with the army at Chambly , and his wife remained in Quebec only long enough to dine with lady Carleton , and then hastened onward to meet him . Before she landed , an express had been despatched to give him notice of her arrival . Upon reaching Chambly , ' she writes , I saw several of our officers , and my coachman , whom my husband had left here . I ran towards the latter to inquire after Mr de Riedesel . " He is on his way to meet you , " replied he , " between here and Berthicux ; " ( fifteen miles from Chambly . ) I was not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was one of the officers present , approached , and assured me that my hu*-band would certainly be hack , at the latest , on the following day . He then took leave of me and returned to Quebec , after having surrendered to General Burgoyne the command of the army . One of my husband 's aids-de-camp remained with me , and the time , until the next day , seemed to me uncommonly long . Meanwhile my children , and the honest Rockel , watched on the road , in the hope that M. de Riedesel might yet arrive that evening ; and , indeed , a chaise was at length seen advancing up the road , and a Canadian in it . I saw the vehicle stop , the traveller alight , run towards my children , and fold them in his arms . It was my husband ! not having yet got rid of his fever , he wore ( though it was summer ) a blanket-coat or gown , with ribands , and the usual blue and red fringes , in the Canadian fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quick as I could to join the beloved group . My joy was inexpressible , tbou*h I beheld with painful feelings the sickly and wearied looks of my poor husband . I found my two daughters bathed in tears ; the eldest from joy to see her father again , and the second , because he wore a dress so different from that with which lie is represented in the portrait she was woaf to see , and from which she had conceived that he was as elegant as handsome . " No , no ! this is an ugly papa , " cried she in English , " my papa is pretty ; " and she would not go to him . But as soon as he had thrown off his Candian coat , she jumped upon his neck . ' pp. 124 , 125 . We shall not pursue the thread of Madame de Riedsel 's narrative , respecting the movements of the army under Bur // goyne , from this period till the disasters of Saratoga , although it contains a few facts worthy to be recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining . Some of her descriptions of what she experienced and witnessed , just before the surrender of the Brjtish army , are of too remarkable a cast to be omitted . They depict in strong colors the horrors and distresses of war , while they afford an eminent example of female resolution and endurance . While breakfasting with my husband , I heard that something was under contemplation . General Fraser , and , I believe , Generals Burgoyne and Phillips were to dine with me on that day . I remarked much movement in the camp . My husband told me it was a mere reconnoissance ; and as this was frequent , I was not much alarmed at it . On my way homeward , I met a number of Indians armed with guns , and clad in their war dresses . having asked them where they were going , they replied , " War , war , " by which they meant they were about to fight . This made me very uneasy , and I had scarcely got home , before I heard reports of guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the noise grew dreadful , upon which I was more dead than alive . About 3 o'clock in the afternoon , instead of guests whom I had expected to dine with me , I saw one of them , poor General Fraser , brought upon a hand-barrow , mortally wounded . The table , which was already prepared for dinner , was immedjately removed and a bed placed in its stead for the General . I sat terrified and trembling in a corner . The noise grew more alarming , and I was in a continual agony and tremor , while thinking that my husband might soon also be brought in , wounded like General Fraser . That poor General said to the surgeon , " Tell me the truth ; is there no hope ? " His wound was exactly like that of Major Harnage ; the ball had passed through his body , but unhappily for the General , he had that morning eaten a full breakfast , by which the stomach was distended , and the ball , as the surgeon remarked , passed directly through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these , " 0 bad ambition ! poor General Burgoyne ! poor Mistress Fraser . " * Prayers were read , after which he desired that General Burgoyne should be requested to have him buried on the next day , at 6 o'clock in the eveniflg , on a hill where a breastwork had been constructed . I knew not what to do ; the entrance and all the rooms were full of sick , in consequence of the dysentery which prevailed in the camp . At length , towards evening , my husband came , and from // that moment my affliction was much soothed , and I breathed thanks to God . He dined with me and the aids-de-camp in great haste , in an open space in the rear of the house . We poor fe-. males had been told , that our troops had been victorious ; but I well saw , by the melancholy countenance of my husband , that it was quite the contrary . On going away , he took me aside , to tell me everything went badly , and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any body . Under the pretence of removing the next day to my new lodgings , I ordered the baggage to be packed up . Lady Ackland 's tent was near ours . She slept there , and spent the day in the camp . On a sudden , she received the news that her husband was mortally wounded and taken prisoner . She was much distressed ; we endeavored to persuade her that the wound was not so dangerous , but advised her to ask permission to join her husband , to take care of him in his sickness . She was much attached to him , though he was rude and intemperate ; yet he was a good officer . She was a lovely woman . I divided the night between her whom I wished to comfort , and my children who were asleep , but who , I feared , might disturb the poor dying General . He sent me several messages to beg my pardon for the trouble he thought he gave me . About 3 o'clock , I was informed that he could not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present at his last struggle , I wrapped my children in blankets , and retired into the entrance hall . At 8 o'clock in the morning he expired . After he had been washed , he was wrapped in a sheet , and laid out . We then returned into the room , and had this melancholy spectacle before us the whole day . Many officers of my acquaintance were brought in wounded , and the cannonade continued . There was some tik of retreating , but I saw no indications of it . About 4 o'clock in the afternoon , I saw the house which had been built for me , in flames , from which I inferred that the enemy was near . We were informed , that General Burgoyne intended to comply with General Fraser 's last request , and to have him buried at 6 o'clock , in the place which he had designated . This occasioned an useless delay , and contributed to our military misfortunes . At 6 o'clock , the corpse was removed , and we saw all the generals , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony . The English chaplain , Mr Brudenel , officiated . Cannon balls flew around and above the assembled mourners . General Gates protested afterwards , that had he known what was going on , he would have stopped the fire immediately . Many cannon balls flew close by me , but my whole attention was engaged by the funeral scene , where I saw my husband exposed to imminent danger . This , indeed , was not a moment to be apprehensive for my own safety . ' pp. 168-172. // The following events took place after the affair of Bemus 's Heights , while the British army was retreating towards Sara .. toga . About 2 o'clock , we heard again a report of muskets and cannon , and there was much alarm and bustle among our troops . My husband sent me word , that I should immediately retire into a house which was not far off . I got into my calash with my children , and when we were near the house , I saw , on the opposite bank of the Hudson , five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without knowing what I did , I threw my children into the back part of the vehicle , and laid myself upon them . At the same moment the fellows fired , and broke the arm of a poor English soldier , who , stood behind us , and who , being already wounded , sought a shelter . Soon after our arrival , a terrible cannonade began , and the fire was principally directed against the house , where we had hoped to find a refuge , probably because the enemy inferred , from the great number of people who went towards it , that it was the headquarters of the generals , while , in reality , none were there except women and crippled soldiers . We were at Ja*t obliged to descend into the cellar , where I laid myself in a corner near the door . My children put their heads upon my knees . An abominable smell , the cries of the children , and my own anguish of mind , did not permit me to close my eyes , during the whole night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a different direction . I advised my fellow . sufferers to withdraw , for a while , from the cellar , in order to give time to clean it , for we should otherwise injure our health . On an inspection of our retreat , I discovered that there were three cellars , spacious and well vaulted . I suggested , that one of them should be appropriated to the use of the officers who were most severely wounded , the next to the females , and the third , which was nearest to the staircase , to all the rest of the company . We were just going down , when a new thunder of cannon threw us again into alarm . Many persons , who had no right to enter , threw themselves against the door . My children were already at the bottom of the staircase , and every one of us would probably have been crushed to death , had I not put myself before the entrance , and resisted the intruders . Eleven cannon balls passed through the house , and made a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a leg amputated , lost the other by one of these balls . All his comrades ran away at that moment , and when they returned , they found him in one corner of the room , in the agonies of death . I was myself in the deepest distress , not so much on account of my own dangers , as of those to which my husband was exposed , who , however , frequently sent me messaVOL . XXVI. - " - NO. 58. 30 // ges , inquiring after my health . Major Harnage 's wife , a Mrs Reynell , the wife of the good lieutenant who had , on the preceding day , shared his soup with me , the wife of the commissary , and myself , were the only officers ' wives at present with the army . We sat together , deploring our situation , when somebody having entered , all my companions exchanged looks of deep sorrow , whispering at the same time to one another . I immediately suspected that my husband had been killed . I shrieked aloud ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was giVefl to understand , by a sidelong glance , that the lieutenant had been killed . His wife was soon called out , and found that the lieutenant was yet alive , though one of his arms had been shot off , near the shoulder , by a cannon ball . We heard his groans and I entati6ns during the whole night , which were dreadfully reechoed through the vaulted cellars ; and in the morning he expired . My husband came to visit me , during the night , which served to diminish my sadness and dejection , in some degree . On the next morning , we thought of making our cellar a more convenient residence . Major Harnage and his wife , and Mrs Reynell , took possession of one corner , and transformed it into a kind of closet , by means of a curtain . I was also to have a similar retreat ; but I preferred to remain near the door , that I might escape more easiJy in case of fire . I had straw put und*n ' my mattresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my female servants slept near us . Opposite to us were three officers , who , though wounded , were determined not to remain behind , if the army retreated . One of them was Captain Green , aid-de-camp to General Phillips , and a very amiable and worthy gentleman . All three swore they would not depart without me , in case of a sudden retreat , and that each of them would take one of my children on his horse . One of my husband 's horses was constantly in readiness for myself . M. de Riedesel thought often of sending me to the American camp , to save me from danger ; but I declared that nothing would be more painful to me , than to live on good terms with those with whom he was fighting ; upon which he consented that I should continue to follow the army . However , the apprehension that he might have marched away , repeatedly intruded itself into my mind ; and , I crept up the staircase , more than once , to confirm or dispel my fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I became more calm , and could even have slept . ' pp. 179-183 . After Burgoyne 's surrender , the British and German troops were all marched to Cambridge , and General Riedesel and his lady accompanied them . Here they resided a full year very quietly and happily , ' as our author writes , till Novern // her , 1778 , when the convention troops were ordered by Congress to be transferred to Charlottesville in Virginia . This journey of more than six hundred miles at the opening of winter , was attended with great inconvenience to Madame de Riedesel and her children . The weather was very cold , and the roads in some places were blocked up with snow ; their accommodations were frequently bad , and , to fill up the catalogue of evils , the people whom they met on the way were sometimes hardhearted and uncivil . They felt an antipathy to the German troops , who had come into a foreign land to espouse a quarrel in which they had no concern ; and perhaps it was not unnatural that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among a people suffering under the calamities of war , and not accustomed to subdue strong emotions , or to inculcate humanity and kindness as a habit . There can be no apology , however , for the incivilities practised on some occasions , and we have no reason to think Madamo de Riedesel 's complaints exaggerated or unjust . From Cambridge to New J*ey she travelled under the protection of Colonel Robert Troup , an officer in the American army . We transcribe the followir*g extract from the original of Colonel Troup 's letter to General Gates , dated at Sussex Court House , New Jersey . We had the happiness of reaching Sussex the day before yesterday in the afternoon . You can not conceive the difficulties we have met with on the road . The people , in almost every house we stopped at , seemed to take pleasure in making our stay as uncomfortable as possible . I am sorry to add , that the women were very impolite to Madame de RiedeseL They could not banish from their minds the notions they have ifubibed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of being prisoners plundered by us , and others of being killed . One young girl , who had been lately married , cried and guashed her teeth near two hours , because I requested her to let Madame de Riedesel sleep in her bedroom , where she had a few gowns , pots , and trammels . Indeed such has been the incivility of all ranks and degrees to us , that I have suffered the most painful anxiety eter since I left Cambridge . Madame de Riedesel , the General , and his family have shown me every mark of complaisance and respect . They and the children were very well a few minutes ago , when they set off for Easton . The militia guard , that escorted the General 's baggage from Hartford to the York line , broke open some of the boxes and plundered them . ' // journey of nearly three months , in the midst of winter . General Riedesel had gone forward with the troops , and provided lodgings for his family . This was about the middle of February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the year , when the officers of the convention troops proceeded to New York to be exchanged . They had been in captivity more than two years . Indeed the exchange did not actually take place till the autumn following . In the mean time Madame de Riedesel presented her husband with a fourth daughter , whom they named* . tlmerica . Soon after the exchange was effected , General Riedesel was appointed to a command over the British troops on Long Island , where he and his family passed the spring and part of the summer of 1781 . He at length desired permission of General Clinton to return to Canada , and take charge of the remnant of his regiments , that had been left there before Burgoyne 's expedition . They sailed for Quebec , which place they reached in September , having touched at Halifax on the way . Governor Haldimand stationed General Riedesel at Sorel , at which place he held his headquarters during the remainder of his residence in America , making frequent excursions , however , to Quebec and Montreal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness . When peace was ratified and the war closed , they returned to England , where they received tokens of kindness from the king and queen , and attentions from numerous persons of rank . They stayed but a short time in England , and hastened onward to meet their friends in Brunswic , where they arrived after an absence of more than seven years . The above is a brief and meagre sketch , and our purpose will be answered if any one shall be induced by it to resort to the volume itself . It abounds with curious and interesting facts , related in a sprightly style , and , as far as the writer 's knowledge extended , we believe with a strict regard to veracity . We must demur at some two or three of the worthy lady 's anecdotes about " tarring and feathering a most respectable woman , " and the advice of an American gentleman to " cut off the captive generals ' heads . " In giving heed to these tales , her credulity got the better of her good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coming under her own observation , we put implicit confidence , and are induced to do it , not more from internal evidence , than from the circumstance , that her // repretentations accord in all essential particulars , with authentic history . She mentions one incident , worthy of notice more from its singularity , perhaps , than its importance . While the articles of convention were in progress at Saratoga , the Brunswic officers took care to conceal their colors , after having burnt the staves to which they were attached . At the time of the capitulation , they gave out that the colors were destroyed , hut they were secreted among the baggage , and conveyed in this manner to Cambridge . When they were about to commence their march to Virginia , it became necessary to make some other disposition of the colors to prevent a discovery . Madame de Riedesel devised the plan of concealing them in a mattress , and shut herself up with a tailor in her own room to execute this work . This mattress was taken to New York by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Halifax . At this place Madame de Riedesel received it on her voyage to Canada , and during all the rest of the passage slept upon these honorable badges . ' A different fate awaited the Hessian banners , which were taken at Trenton . General Washington presented them to the state of Pennsylvania , as a testimony of the good conduct of the Pennsylvania troops at the battle of Trenton . They are now in a most unseemly plight , in the office of the Secretary of State at Harrisburg , tattered and torn , and thrust away in a dark corner as useless rags . For ourselves , we acknowledge that we could not witness , without emotion , the indignities thus practised upon what our fathers honored as trophies of the brave , and as testimonials of great deeds in the cause of justice and freedom . There is no better safeguard for a nation , than a reverence for the noble acts of its departed sages , heroes , and patriots , and whatever tends to perpetuate the remembrance of such acts , should be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which our attention has been drawn , is understood to have been made by M. de Wallenstein , already favorably known to the public in this department , by his xv*jl executed version of the Leper of tiost , and the Russian Tales . The extracts given above are enough to show , in what manner his task has been performed in the present instance . He manages the English idiom with skill , and combines , with a ready use of words , an ease and vivacity of style . An original preface of considerable length has been prefixed by M. de Wallenstein , which adds to the value of the // work . We agree fully with his opinions , as expressed in the following passage . Madame de Riedesel 's memoirs and letters may claim , in addition to an equal interest with the works just mentioned , that , also , which belongs to the true picture of a conjugal devotion , of which there are few brighter examples , whether in history , biographies , memoirs , or even in novels ; - of fortitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be afforded too many examples for the eventual profit of the happiest , or the support of those who need encouragement and consolationand of success in a most arduous but noble undertaking , which , also , may be a lesson to all who have duties to fulfil , that seem above their strength . The moral of the story is more striking and impressive , coming from a female  --  a lady , who by birth and rank was probably the least prepared to encounter dangers fit only for the professional soldier . Whatever may be thought of the political expediency of admitting into camps , in the midst of actual war , the sex whose organization and whose duties are calculated for the sunny season of peace , the promptitude with which she hastened to traverse the ocean , in order to share with her husband , toils , sufferings , want , or death , and the reflected courage with which she disregarded the chances of a struggle , in which she had been told that savages were a portion of the belligerents ; will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions to which female tenderness can be exalted . There has been , indeed , in recent times but one brighter example of female fortitude and affection . Madame de Larochejaquelin stands alone in inimitable grandeur and goodness , in the midst of circumstances , which put her sex to trials unknown before , and which we devoutly wish may never more return to urge even a heroine equally courageous and amiable , upon the scene of civil wars . For the public to whom this translation is presented , it has , moreover , a national interest . Madame de Riedesel 's memoirs are a genuine appendix to American history . They trace national events , and delineate the state of society , in this country , at one of its most momentous epochs . Names that will go down to posterity , with the memory of lofty actions and events of a new , lasting , and far-spreading character , are here brought together by one , who was the friend , the associate , the companion , or , at least , the acquaintance of their bearers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phillips , and the person the nearest related to the noble authoress , General Riedesel. ' pp. 8-11 . In the volume is contained a memoir by General Riedesel , on the transactions at Saratoga , written immediately after they // took place . It throws a good deal of new light on the events of Burgoyne 's campaign , and is an important document among the materials for a history of the American revolution .
