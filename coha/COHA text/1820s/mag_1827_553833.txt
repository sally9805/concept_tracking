txt ART . 111. - Proceedings of sundry Citizens of Baltimore , convened for the Purpose of Devising the most efficient . Means of Improving the Intercourse between that City and the Western States . Svo. pp. 38 . Baltimore . William Wooddy. 1827 . THE fertile districts lying west of the Allegany ridge , and watered by the Ohio and the Mississippi , are among the most remarkable in the world , not so much merely from their great physical advantages , as from the rapidity with which these have been turned to account . In little more than half a century , the frontier of the Anglo-American population has been extended from Cumberland , in Maryland , on the Potomac , to a considerable distance beyond the Mississippi . The state of Ohio , whose nearest point to Cumberland is about one hundred and twenty miles , now numbers more than double the population of Maryland , whose western extremity bordered , in 1760 , on a solitary wilderness . One can hardly conjecture how far this torrent of civilization will rush in the next half century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and facility of interior communication ; the same equal laws , and security of property , will probably people the remote west with as great , perhaps greater rapidity . Whatever satisfaction the transatlantic critics may find in the retrospections inspired by their venerable abbeys , there is , to our indigenous taste , something still more inspiring in the anticipations suggested by the fertile solitudes of our own country . What renders the emotion more grateful still , is the cause of this rapid expansion of wealth and civilization . There are countries , perhaps , which excel a part of the regions we speak of , in fertility , and in the value of their products ; hut none whose progress is to be compared to theirs ; a superiority which finds its source in the moral and political condition of their people . It is difficult to imagine how much greater this progress would have been , had our western states lain more convenient // to the sea . From the physical features of the country , they have from the first , contended with the disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of much time and money . The great chain of the Allegany , which has been called the backbone of the United States , dividing the tributary streams of the Ohio and Thssissippi from those of the Atlantic rivers , neither affords a natural descending navigation from the western states to the Atlantic , nor has yet been pierced by a canal unitin their respective waters . The people of the west have depended , for the sale of their surplus produce , on the distant and otherwise disadvantageous market of New Orleans , or have reached the great towns on the seaboard by slow and difficult mountain roads , not always improved by art . Until the noble invention of Fulton doubled , as it were , the value of our mighty western rivers , the difficulty and delay of their navigation brought the larger part of the commerce of the west over these mountain barriers ; and it was this trade , combined with the then great demand for our produce , and with our advantages as neutrals , which gave to some of our Atlantic towns their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late immense increase * New York , was the most signal example of the sudden concentration of population and wealth in the towns of a new and fast peopling country . A hamlet in 1752 , it had in 1820 , acquired a population of nearly sixtythree thousand souls , and possessed most of the conveniences and embellishments which belong to cities of the second class . At that period , too , we have reason to believe , its numbers fell short of those of preceding years . The general embarrassments of trade , together with some peculiar causes , had already sensibly lessened its prosperity , and caused a considerable emigration . Its trade has since been revived in most branches , and its capital largely and profitably invested in others ; and its population , though no recent census has been taken , may be safely assumed at seventytwo thousand . Though this check to its prosperity is imputable , in great part , to the 6auses , which have depressed the whole commercial public , it is referrible , in some degree , to two , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboats on the Ohio and the iVlississippi , has diminished the transport of country produce across the mountains ; and , on the other hand , the western canal of New York has opened // another , and to many districts , a much more convenient conveyance of both the exports and imports of the west .. The combined causes of the distance of a market , and of the cheapness of subsistence , have extended a good deal the use of domestic manufactures in the western states , to the partial exclusion of British fabrics ; and various causes which we need not mention , have concentrated the trade in these fabrics almost wholly in New York , where it is done largely on foreign account , and through foreign agencies . What is not wholly without effect , the facility of travelling is so much greater than formerly , that the western dealer finds little difference , in expense or fatigue , between going to Baltimore and a little further to New York , and naturally prefers to purchase in the most extensive mart . From these causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former city . On the whole , though the position of Baltimore on a noble bay , suffi* cient of itself to supply trade to an important town ; though the large water power in her vicinity , already extensively applied to mills and factories ; her large commerce with the Susque .. hanna country , four fifths of whose produce seek a market in her harbor ; the great capital accumulated by former enterprise , as well as a respectable foreign trade remaining ; though all these have combined to bring together , and will continue to support a large and increasing population , it is certain that , since 1S18-19* she has taken much less vigorous strides than signalized her earlier career . We have been led to these remarks by the publication named at the head of this article , from which , and from the steps since taken in conformity with the opinions expressed in it , we learn that an important enterprise is on foot in that city , very likely , in the judgment of the projectors , to succeed , and certain in ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages , which it formerly derived from its proximity to the west , and even more . The importance of a canal communication with the states beyond the Alleganies , early attracted the attention of Washington , who fixed his view on the Potomac , as offering the shortest and most practicable route . Under his auspices was form*. ed the Potomac Company , ' and a canal commenced , which was never completed . The project was resumed in 1822 , by the states of Virginia and Maryland , in connexion with the general government , and the public is informed of the surveys // made in reference to it . They resulted in a belief of the practicableness of the scheme , but at an expense of twentythree millions , and a lockage of three thousand feet , with some doubt , perhaps , of an adequate supply of water . For a national work , this cost was not startling when compared with the vast results to be secured ; but the delay from the unparalleled amount of lockage , was a more serious objection . The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these inquiries on this important object . Baltimore was naturally concerned to draw back the gainful trade , which had been diverted from her , and the late publications in England on the subject of railways , led some of her intelligent citizens to the idea , that a connexion of this sort might be advantageously substituted for a canal . A.t a meeting in that city , on the twelfth of February last , the report before noticed was presented , embracing the reasonings of various writers on railroads , with some estimates of the cost of extending one from Baltimore to the Ohio , and of the amount of trade which might be presumed to take that course . A charter was afterwards obtained from the states of Maryland and Virginia ( Pennsylvania postponing her assent ) for a company called the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company , with a capital of three millions , and the power of extending it to five , in shares of a hundred dollars each ; a million to be subscribed by the state , half a million by the corporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the opening of the hooks in March , more than the total amount was subscribed in a few days , by individuals alone . Little known as railroads are in America , and their more extended use not yet fully proved in England , the scheme is certainly a bold one , of constructing a road of this sort , not less than two hundred and fifty miles in length , and surmounting an elevation of three thousand feet . We shall notice briefly the views which have been suggested by its projectors , and which have attracted so large a capital into the scheme . The substitution of railroads for canals , which appears to he generally contemplated in England , is rendered by some circumstances of climate , still more advantageous in this country than in that . Our rigorous winters would obstruct canals with ice , during several *veeks , and sometimes months ; our soil is still shaded by forests , and therefore the minimum volume of the streams is yet unascertained ; and our tropical summer // presents a serious objection to canals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate that Baltimore has reserved her means for the completion of a mode of conveyance which , besides being better adapted to the country , probably far excels the other in speed , in economy of construction , and in cheapness of carriage . It has been cQmputed by ai writer on this subject , that by the substitution of mechanic for4iorse power on the turnpike roads of England , there would be a saving in every twelve years of not less than ? 138,040,000 . Whether horse or mechanic power were adopted on the proposed railway , the saving would be immense on the carriage of the trade ; a saving which would be shared between the grower and the railway company , in the shape of profit to the one , and of tolls to the other . Baltimore lies two hundred miles nearer than New York to the navigable waters of the west , and about one hundred nearer than Philadelphia ; and this advantage in the distance , even were other circumstances the same , must always secure to her the trade of the regions which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of estimates on the actual and comparative cost of canals and railways ; on the comparative expense of transportation ; and , what is not least important , the economy of time . The length of a canal from Pittsburg to Washington , and thence to Baltimore , was estimated by the United States ' engineers , at three hundred and ninety miles ; a railroad may be extended from the latter place to the Ohio , with a length , as it is believed , of only two hundred and fifty miles , because it is neither confined , like a canal , to the valleys of rivers , nor needs it deviate with a view to a supply of water . The saving , therefore , in distance alone is one hundred and forty miles . The computed cost of the Ohio and Chesapeake canal , is twentythree millions three hundred and seventyfive thousand four hundred and twentyseven dollars , while that of the railroad. , at twenty thousand dollars a mile , which is believed to be a high estimate , is hut five millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of railways in England , varying from one half to one fourth of that of canals , and averaging , on a comparison of many sorts of railroads , to an extent of five hundred miles , about five thousand pounds sterling a mile , including all expenses besides the mere formation of the road . These expenses , particularly for lands , fences , and stone , would necessarily // be less in this country than there ; and the proposed partial substitution of wood for stone would still further reduce the cost . The price of labor , however , is greater here than there . Whatever m*y be the actual cost of a mile of railway , and the ultimate expense of the whole route from Baltimore to the O*o , it seems highly reasonable , at least , that both its first cosi and the expense of repair , must be vastly less than those of a canal . The experiments made in England seem to prove this in point of fact , and , reasoning a priori , one sees no reason to question it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly be so costly as for a canal ; the deviation must be less ; the structure less solid and massive ; and the difficulties of bridging greatly diminished . The face of the country does not alter the relative value of these two modes of conveyance ; and as experience has manifested the superiority of the rail-. way over the canal on levels , with the locomotive engine , so , where recourse must be had to lockage in the one , the difficulty is overcome , at a less expense , by the stationary engine on the other . While the cost of construction and repair is less , the facility of transport on a railway is greater , as regards both expense and time . The use of locomotive engines , ' says Strickland , in place of horses , has greatly changed the relative value of railways and canals . ' The enormous expenses of shipping , and the detention incident to canals during floods , frosts , and drought , and while undergoing repairs , by retarding conveyance , greatly enhance its cost ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much increased , and is irremediable . From the wear , likewise , of the embankments , and the resistance of the fluid , the speed can not be conveniently increased on canals beyond a certain limit , under the most favorable circumstances . In certainty and celerity , therefore , two points so important in trade , the advantage is greatly on the side of railways . It is computed in the Report , that the time saved by the railroad on each trip from the Ohio to Baltimore would be one hundred and fiftytwo hours , and that even at the rate of four miles an hour ( which , it is believed , may be doubled ) the whole distance may be performed in sixtytwo hours and a half . The cost of transportation is proportionably lessened . By the canal , the cost of a ton from Pittsburg to Baltimore , at one cent and a half a mile , would be five dollars and eightyfive cents and at the *amc rate* it would be but three dollars and // seventyfive cents by the railroad . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cent a mile per ton , the whole saving in the carriage of a single ton , would be three dollars and thirtyfive cents . The territory interested in this enterprise , including the three states of Kentucky , Ohio , and Indiana , thirteen counties of Virginia , nine of Pennsylvania , and four of Maryland , contains , at this moment a population of nearly two millions of people , not taking into account the states and districts which would derive an indirect advantage from it The annual exports from this territory , have been estimated at three hundred and fifty thousand tons , of which , assuming that but one third , or one hundred and sixteen thousand tons , will take the course of the canal , and that the return trade will employ fifty thousand tons , the amount of tolls on the whole , at the rate of charge on the New York canals , would be seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars , from which , deducting the interest of the capital invested , there would remain four hundred and fifty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have thus briefly stated some of the calculations which have led to the conception of this scheme . Whether its achievement be within the means of the projectors , or practicable at all , at any moderate cost , we have too little knowledge either of the subject of railroads in general , or of the country through which the projected one is to pass , to hazard more than an opinion , and that , we confess , is favorable . The scheme is so important , huwever , in a national view , and would so effectually answer all the purposes of the canal in the same direction , for which surveys have been made by the general government , that its aid to this more feasible project , would not be unwise , and is not improbable . In the meantime , we learn that additional surveys will be made of the country to be traversed , and competent persons despatched to England , to procure the best information on the subject . Should the results be satisfactory , the work will be commenced without delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populous and productive empire growing up in her rear , and compared with that of the other great marts on the seaboard , there seems little doubt of her securing , in the event of her completing the proposed road , far the larger portion of the western trade . Her greater proximity ( itself sufficient to tprn // the scale in her favor , other circumstances being th&amp;same , ) is accompanied by some other ohvioqs advantages . To the perishable articles of western export , such as breadstuffs and other provisions , the climate of New Orleans , her first competitor , is extremely injurious , and to the damage of this merchandise must be *4ded the no inconsideralAe danger of life to the trader , in that unwholesome mart . Neither has the coi*-veyance by the rivers , being liable to interruption by both drought and ice , the same certainty or duration as by a railroad , which may be used at all seasons , and the time of transit be computed to an hour . The imports to the west are still carried in waggons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New O*leans , and the construction of a railway would determine this branch of trade exclusively to that route . From the peculiar nature of the country bordering on the Mississippi and its tributaries , the dangers of the descending navigation of that river are unlikely to be ever effectually removed , to say nothing of the distance of New Orleans from the ocean , and from Europe . Nor is it more probable that the western canal of New York will divert any considerable portion of this trade , especidlly that of the districts lying remote from lake Erie . Besides the disadvantage of the port of New York in point of distance , and the greater cost of sbipping and the delay t*fore alluded to ( both of which will be much enhanced by the iwcessity of three or four different transshipments ) , that avenue must be closed by the climate during three or four of those months of the year which are most convenient to the farmer for bringing his produce to raarket . Even at this mnmcnt , the produce from the Susqu*hnnna country bordering clQse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore in the spring , and several thousand tons of merchandise are landed on ber wliaive , shefore the canal is released from its icy bqnds . This is an important evidence *f the prcferableness of a ready and early conveyance to market . *Neither is it believed , that the Allegany ridge can be pierced with the same advantage , by a canal or a railway , at any point , either north or south of that projected by Baltimore . In both directions , the abruptness of the rocky ridge , or its yeu*oteness from tide , or both , are greater than they are near the valley of the Potomac ; while to the south , moreover , there is no port of consequence , convenient at once to the sea and to the interior . As the effect , in short , of the pioposed road // will be to replace Baltimore on a level at least , with her rivals as to facility of conveyance , so her advantage in distance must restore to her that preeminence as a dep6t of produce from the interior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . When it is remembered that the streams of comruerce , like others , are determined in their course by the slightest circumstance , it seems highly probable that the tide of the western trade , especially from the middle regions , will , by one of such moment , be turned chiefly in the direction of Baltimore . Any certain computation of the increase of trade , to which the pending project would give rise , is of course , not to be expected . The estimates of the Report do not appear to be exaggerated , and , indeed , conjecture can hardly approximate very closely the results of opening such an avenue to regions so extensive , populous , and fertile . In the article of grain , alone , the cost of production , including in it the carriage to market , would be so greatly diminished , as probably to establish Baltimore , for an indefinite period , an unrivalled mart for grain . There would be a proportional increase , from the like cause , of the other usual products of agricultural and manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animal provision , lard , tallow , whiskey , iron , glass , &amp;c ; and cotton , instead of descending to New Orleans , would seek its way in large quantities , by this direct channel , to a seaport more convepient to the European markets . But it is , perhaps , on the trade in the heavy and bulky pro .. ducts of the soil itself , that the influence of a cheap and practicable road to market , would be the most striking . The dis . tricts contiguous to the . line of the railway , abound in coal of the best quality , in lime , slate , marble , freestone , marl , gypsum , and timber ; but their great weight , and the want of economical communications , have rendered them hitherto of little or no value to the proprietors of the soil . The* commerce in these would therefore he rather created than augmented , and that to an extent which may he conjectured from the single fact , that at present the lime used in Washington , is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it at her very doors . The value of the fuel abounding in this district would he so much the greater to Maryland , as that state possesses immense stores of iron ore of the most valuable kind , which will long outlast the supply of fuel from the present sources ; to say // nothing of the impulse which , in the increasing use of steam power , would be given to innumerable other manufactures , in a port convenient for shipping them elsewhere . But to descend to the particulars of this extensive subject , would much exceed our limits . There is , however , one branch of trade , which , at a small cost , will add materially to the luxury of the table in the interior ; we mean in fresh fish and oysters ; to commodities of this sort , as well as fresh fruits and vegetables from the interior , the saving of time in conveyance is every. * thing . By the present slow transport , sea fish and oysters are wholly denied to districts remote from the coast ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new branch of industry , and a great augmentation of their tonnage , would accrue to the nautical population inhabiting the shores of the bay . A mode of communication of which the celerity may be increased so far beyond that of any other , is especially advantageous in this country , whose population is comparatively sparse , and so many of whose most fertile districts lie extremely remote from the sea . if this circumstance be so important to the trade of England , no part of whose interior lies farther than perhaps a hundred miles from a seaport , of what moment must it be to the vast districts beyond the Ohio , some of which are distant two thousand miles from New Orleans , none of them nearer to an Atlantic port than two hundred and fifty ; and the greater part distant more than five hundred ? On the height of land between the Ohio and the Atlantic , there lies an extensive district , especially valuable for pasturage , which , being remote from both , is now desert and valueless , when compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile in vegetable and probably much more so in mineral treaSures , the completion of a way to market would Operaie with immense benefit , ' and open new fountains of trade at a point comparatively near to the Atlantic ports . In the western states the combined effect of the abundance of food and of the remoteness of a market , would naturally be the rapid introduction of- manufactures ; while , on the other hand , any diminution of the expense of getting their agricultural products to a market , and , from the like cause , of obtaining their supply of foreign fabrics in return , would , it is to be presumed , as naturally retard the extension of domestic manufac .. tuve . As this ci.eumstance would prolong in this country th' // present extensive importation of British fabrics and other foreign dry goods , so that importation would naturally be made to the port most convenient for distributing them into the interior . In the event , therefore , of the completion of the railway , Baltimoi'e would probably share largely with New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the latter , if she did not finally attract the larger portion of it . At any rate , her importance as a mere dep6t of goods to be conveyed to the west , would be very greatly augmented . And as speed and certainty are not less important to the dealer himself , than in the conveyance of his commodities , this route , and mode of conveyance , would have the preference in every case , except of mere pleasure . The conveyance of travellers on a route the shortest and most used , would , in the great and increasing intercourse between the east and the west , be of itself a lucrative source of income to the proprietors of the railway , and of profit to the towns on its course , and at its respective terminations . In counting the cost of such an enterprise as that which the people of Baltimore have embarked in , it is but fair in the computation , to oppose the magnitude of the results to that of the attempt , as the adventurousness of the latter is proportionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , the zeal exhibited by Baltimore on this subject , is no more than we should expect from a rational enterprise . On the one hand her importance will be infinitely magnified by success ; on the other , it is certain that , without some more practicable and convenient communication with the west , than she now has , the trade of that quarter , which has heretofore conferred on her such extraordinary advantages , will be in a great incasnrc grasped by more enterprising or more fortunate competitors . The necessary investment of capital , will not , perhaps , be greater than what has already been profitably bestowed on the numerous turnpike roads , which she has constructed , into the interior . We find among the diredtors of the company incorporated for carrying this scheme into effect , the names of some of her most conspicuous inhabitants ; men who have large interests at issue , and whose wealth is the accumulation of many years of industry and commercial sagacity . We have reason to believe that the greater part of the stock subscribed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but *vlio are determined to give the practicableness of the scheme a // cautious and thorough investigation , apd then to prosecute it to a completion , if within the compass of their means . As * great , national work , we shall feel much interest in seeing it brQught to , a su*cessful . ter*nination , and shall probably have occasion to , *otice hereafter the inquiries which , in the course of the sum*ner , are *o be pisrsued , both at home and abroad , in reference to j , t , After witnessing the many triumphs of science in the present age , we confess we are more inclined to confide in speculations reasonable in themselves , and to hope that railroads may add as largely to the facilities of cQmmerce , as can*ds have *kn* before them . It is certain , at least , that if this large entcrpriy*e of Baltimore be brought to a happy issueb its benefits will be of the first importance , not to that mart alone , but to the *e*eral commerce of the country ; and in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goi*rnment of the union .
