ALTHOUGH we have . not.the honor to agree with Mr Mal. thus in his tkieory* of Population , ' and even entertain doubts of the iruth of some of the principles advanced in his treatise on Political Economy , we have been pleased with the candor and urbanity which in general distinguish his wvith*gs. : The *k ' before us is by'ii*means ' entirely deficient in these valuable ' qu*lffies , but it is marked , we think , by a little more asperity towards persons of a different opinion thanwe have ob ' *rved in those which *reeeded ' it .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the system on which the author 's philosophical reputation principally rests , have led him to fear that the ground is shaking under . him , and . d*sturi d. in some degree the serenity of his humor ; or whether ( for either supposition ' is perhaps equally tenable ) a constantly increasing confidennein his peculiar theories induces him to look with diminished tob eration on the supposed errors of opponents ; certain it is , that we find in the ' treatise before us an occasional display of bitterness not exactly proportionate to the nature and ' aggravation of the offences , and an air of superiority not always per- ' haps sustained by a corresponding strength of ar*umerit . Without meaning to attach too much importance to 4*e superficial blemishes in the style of an eminent philosopher , we // shall nevertheless lay before our readers one or two specimens of the defect in manner to which we allude , before we proceed to remark upon the substance of the work . In the following passage , Mr Malthus while controverting certain opinions advanced by Mr M'Culloch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respect due from the Professor at the East India College to the Professor at the London University . The tendency of ' some of our most popular writers to innovate without improving , and their marked inattention to facts , leading necessarily to differences of opinion and uncertainty of conclusion , have been the main causes which have of late thrown some diecredit on the science of political economy . Nor can this be a matter of much surprise , though it may be of regret . At a period when all the merchants of our own country , and many in others , find the utmost difficulty in employing their capitals so as to obtain ordinary profits , they are repeatedly told that , according to the principles of political economy , no difficulty can ever be found in employing capital , if it be laid out in the production of the proper articles ; and that any distress which they may have suffered is exclusively owing to a wrong application of their capital , such as " the production of cottons , which were not wanted , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely assured that if they find any difficulty in exchanging what they have produced for what they wish to obtain for it , " they have an obvious resource at hand ; they can abandon the production of the commodities which they do not want , and apply themselves directly to the production of those that they do want , or of substitutes for them ; " and this consolatory recommendation is perhaps addressed to a merchant , who is desirous of obtaining by the employment of his capital at the ordinary rate of profits , such an income as will enable him to get a governess for his daughters and to send his boys to school and college . At such times , assertions like these , and the proposal of such a remedy , appear to me little different from an assertion , on supposed philosophical principles , that it can not rain when crowds of people are getting wet through , and the proposal to go without clothes in order to prevent the inconvenience arising from a wet coat . If assertions so contrary to the most glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , are said to be dictated by the principles of political economy , it can not be matter of wonder that many have little faith in them . And till the theories of popular writers on political economy cease to be in direct opposition to general experience ; and till some steadiness is given to the science , by a greater degree of care among its pro // 370 tApril , fessors not to alter without improving ,  --  it can not be expected that it should attain that general influence in society which ( its principles being just ) would be of the highest practical utility . ' Some of these expressions , we say , appear to us quite as strong as the occasion would require , whether Mr M'Culloch be right or wrong on the point , at issue ; but even these do not satisfy the zeal of Mr Maithus , who complains in a note , that he can find no language sufficiently powerful to express his feelings . I own I want words to express the astonishment I feel at the proposal of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conceives to be a new *and important discovery , may be excused for occasionally making a rash statement ; but that a proposal directly involving the discontinuance of the division of labor should , in a civilized country , be repeated over and over again , by succeeding writers and considered as an obvious resource in a sudden fall of profits , absolutely passes my comprehension . What a strange and most inapt illustration too is it to talk about the possessors of broad-cloths wanting to change them for silks ! Whoever heard of a great producer of any commodity wishing to obtain an equivalent for it in some one other sort of completed *ommodity ? If he is to produce what he wants , it must not be silks but raw materials , tools , corn , meat , coats , hats , shoes , and stockings , &amp;c. &amp;c. and this is the obvious resource which is at hand in a ghit . ' The langu*ge employed by Mr Malthiis in these passages would perhaps be considered by most readers as unnecessarily emphatic , supposing him even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without pretending to decide authoritatively between the two learned disputants , we must nevertheless add that , on our view of the subject , Mr M'Culloch has the best of the argument . The principle to which Mr Malthus takes cxception-if we undei*stand the matter right ? y-is , that an excess of production in one department of labor regularly prodtices a transfer of a part of the capital employed in it to some other , which transfer after a while corrects the evil , and equalizes the dern*nd and supply . This proposition is , we believe , as generally admitted by competent judges as perhaps any other within the compass of the science , and may be viewed in fact as one of its elementary axioms . The evidence of it is not , as we conceive , at all invalidated by the objection suggested by Mr Malthus in the first of the- above extracts . It is not meant by Mr M'Cullocb , that each of the persons who // abandon the production of - the commodities which they do not want , and apply themselves directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future all his own wants by his own personal labor . He does not mean , for example , that if the business of navigation and commerce should happen to be overdone and some of : the persons engaged in it shQuld withdraw their capital from it , each of them would afterwards be his own butcher , baker , tailor , bootmaker , and governess . The division of labor would continue to exist as before . Of the persons withdrawing their capital from navigation and commerce , one would invest it in the woollen fabr*c , another in that of cotton or iron , a third in agriculture , and a fourth in some mechanical art . In each of these branches of business profits , by the supposition , are higher than they were in navigation . These persons who from the low rate of profits realized in navigation were unable to employ governesses am ? tutors , having transferred their capital to a line of business in which it yields the ordinary rate of profits , are now at their ease , and are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may suit their condition . The proposition to remedy the excess of production in one department of labor by a transfer of a part of the capital employed in it to others , appears to us , therefore , a much more reasonable one than those with which Mr Malthus compares it , namely , the assertion that it can not rain at a time when crowds of people are getting wet , or the proposal to go without clothes in order to prevent the inconveniences arising from a wet coat , which , by the bye , as we are told by Humboldt , is the precise method adopted by some of the natives inhabiting the Spanish Missions in South America. * If a person should deny th*mt there was an excess of production at a time when many individuals were notoriously suffering in consequence of it , his error might no doubt be compared to that of one who shouJd assume that it did not or could not rain at a time when crowds were getting wet ; but in the case before us no one , we be- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ les vimes , surtout par un tems de pluic , d*pouill*s de leur v*temens et les tenant rouk*s sous le bras. us aiftmient mieux recevoir la pluie sur in corps tout nu , que de nmouiller leurs v*temens . Les feinmes les plus viellles se cachojent derridre les arbres , en jetant de grands &amp;lats de rire lorsqn'elles nons virent passer . ' Humb . Voy. vol. iii , p. 287. edit . in 8vo. // lieve , denies the possibility of a temporary excess of produc .. tion in one or more departments of labor . Mr M'Culloch and other writers , in pointing out the way in which such an excess naturally corrects itself , admit of course the possibility of its existence . In the same way , a person who should recommend as a remedy for such a temporary excess in tt particular branch of business , that a part of the capital employed hi it should be withdrawn and left entirely inactive , might be compared to one who should recommend a return to the completely unsophisticated state of nature as a remedy for the inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , no one recommends that the capital withdrawn from the line of business in which production is excessive , should be left inactive . The remedy proposed is , on the contrary , that it should be *mployed in some other line , where it will afford higher profits , and thus enable its possessor to enjoy his usual comforts . It is therefore , to keep up the simile of our author , as if we should advise , a man who , from having accidentally got his coat . wet , could no longer derive from it the comforts usually afforded by such a garment , to take it off and put on a dry one . We can not think that the remedy is in either 6ase so preposterously ridiculous ' as Mr Malthus is pleased to represent it , and we are even compelled to give it as our opinion , that the very strong language used by him upon this occasion-which , were he even in the rigbt , would be i*atheFungraceful-is not sustained by a corresponding correctness of principle . The following passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the same unnecessary emphasis in forms of ex*. pression . A dispute appears to have grown up among the economists of the mother country upon the question , whether a person who carries goods to market for sale does it for the purpose of getting the money for which he expects to sell them , or the other goods which he means to buy with the money after he has got it . If for instance ( and the case we understand has really occurred ) a citizen of New Hampshire cateb a large salmon on the Merrimac river early in the season , sell it in Boston market for two dollars a pound , and invest the proceeds in a good yoke of oxen , the question is , whether his object in making the sale was to procure the oxen or the two dollars a pound . Mr Mill and many other writers affirm that his intention is to get his money 's worth . Mr Mal .. thus as stoutly maintains that his object is the money itself . // The hop-planter who takes a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the supply of hats and shoes than he does about the spots in the sun . What does he think about , then ? and what does he want to exchange his hops for ? Mr Mill seems to be of opinion , that it would show great ignorance of political economy to say that what he wants is money ; yet , notwithstanding the probable imputation of this great ignorance , I have no hesitation in distinctly asserting that it really is money which he wants , and that this money he must obtain in the present state of society , in exchange for the great mass of what he has brought to market , or he will be unable to carryon his business as a hop-planter ; and for these specific reasons ; fitst , that he must pay the rent of his hop-grounds in money ; secondly , that he imist pay for his poles , his bags , his implements , &amp;c. &amp;c. , in money ; thirdly , that he must pay the numerous laborers which ' he employs on his grounds during the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is in money and in money alone of all the articles brought to the fair , that he can calculate his profits . It is perfectly true that both the landlords and the laborers who are paid in money will finally exchange it for something else , as no one enjoys money in kind except the miser ' ; but the landlord who may spend perhaps a good deal in post-homes , dinners at inns , and menial servants , would be little likely to accept from the hop-planter the articles which he could get at the fair in exchange for his hops ; and though the expenditure* 9f the laborer is much more simple , and may be said to consist almost enti7rely in food and clothing , yet it is quite certain that the power of commanding a given quantity of labor can never be represented with any approach towards correctness , by a given quantity of corn and clothing . As a matter of fact , the laborer in this country is paid in money ; and while it often happens that for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money price of corn is continually altering , and the laborer may perhaps receive the value of twice as much corn in one year as he does in another . What an entirely false view then does it give of the real state of things , what a complete obscuration instead of illustration of the subject is. it , to represent the demand for shoes as determined by the supply of hats , or the demand for hops by the supply of cloth , cheese , or even corn . In fact the doctrine that one half of the commodities of a country necessarily constitute an adequate market or effectual demand for the other halk is utterly without foundation . The great producers , who are the great sellers , before they can venture to think about the supplies of hats , shoes , and cloth , on which perhaps they may expend a tenth part of // what they have brought to market , must first direct their whole attention to the replacing of their capital , and to the question , whether , after replacing it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of intermediate acts of barter , which may take place in regard to commodities , whether the producers send them to China , or sell them in the place where they are produced ; the question as to an adequate market for them depends exclusively upon whether the producers can replace their capitals with ordinary profits , so as to enable them successfully to go on with their business . The tone employed in *tbis passage is , we think , too decisive not to say intolerant , supposing even Mr Malthus to be in the right . The heresy of his opponents-if such it be-is apparently harmless . To say that the object of a hop-planter in carrying his hops to Weyhill fair , is to prQeure hats and shoes for his wife and children , seems to us to be a proposition which , even if erroneous , is fraught with no very dangerous consequences to the public ; and the warmth of maaner with which our author repels it , reminds us of the comic indignation employed by the logician in the play at the frightful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . We must also add , that while we disclaimas before any pretention to decide between these great rival - authorities , we must honestly confess that , as far as we can trust our feeble judgment on a point of this importance , our author is with all his confidence clearly in the wrong . It is possible that a hop-planter , while conveying his hops to Weyhill fair , may not be thinking directly about hats and shoes , although in point of fact we believe it to be true that a cultivator who carries agricultural pzt*duce* *o the fair or the market does generally bring home a considerable part of the proceeds of it in manufactured articles for the use of his family ; and this being the case , we see no reason why his reflections as the road should not *turn upon his intended purchases , as well as on his intended sales . But admitting , for argument 's sake , that the money , which is doubtless the first , is also for the moment the exclusive object with the hopplanter , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a desirable object merely because it is the representative of hats , shoes , beer , and the other articles which he habitually consumes ,  --  that if he could not exchange it for these articles he would not consider it as a desirable object , while these articles would be equally desirable , were there no such thing as money in existence . From these plain , and , as we suppose , incon // trovertible considerations , it does seem to us to follow , that the purpose which the hop-planter really has in view , is that of exchanging his hops for hats , shoes , beer , stockings , petticoats , tortoise-shell combs , and other articles of rural comfort or luxury , and that money merely intervenes as an instrument to facilitate this exchange . Mr Malthus suggests , that it would be difficult for the hop-planter to pay his rent in hats and shoes , and that although these articles would answer the purpose of his laborers nearly as well as money , yet that the money price of them is a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might often be a great loser by employing them instead of cash in the payment of wages . Now if our author merely meant to affirm , that the precious metals are from the great comparative steadiness of their value a convenient medium of exchange , and may be usefully employed as such in the transaction of all economical business , we should readily concede the point , which would also , we imagine , not be contested by any person , tolerably well versed in the first elements of political economy . But the object of Mr Malthus in assuming that a hop-planter , while carrying his hops to Weyhill fair , is thinking no more of hats and shoes , than of the spots in the sun , and that his whole mind is bent on money , is not , as we understand it , to prove that money is a better medium of exchange than hats and shoes ,  --  a proposition which nobody would dispute ,  --  but to prove that the quantity of hops which the planter can dispose of is not determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market at the same time . Mill and most other writers assert , that , in proportion as there are more persons ready and willing to give hats , shoes , &amp;c. for hops , or rather for beer ( which is the form under which they consume them ) , *more beer will be called for , and consequently more hops wanted to make it . In a more general phrase , the demand for hops is determined by the supply of hats , shoes , and other articles ; or still more generally , the amount of production in one department of labor bears a regular proportion to that which takes place for the time being in all the rest . Mr Malthus ( we believe he is nearly or quite alone in his opinion on this subject ) warmly denounces this proposition as 6pouvantable , cifroyable , ecce*crab1e , an entirely false view of the state of things  --  a complete obscuration ' inatead of illustration of the subject  --  a doctrine utterly without foundation . ' But how does he refute this very dangerous // and alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , that money is steadier in its value , and of course more suitable for a circulating medium than almost any other article ; a well known truth , but one which has not the most remote bearing on the subject . It is quite clear , that what the hop-planter might lose at one time , by exchanging his hops for hats and shoes instead of money , an account of the greater fluctuation in the value of those articles , he would for the same reason gain at another , and that his situation would on either supposition be in general substantially the same . Mr Malthus afterwards suggests , that the object of the great producer is not to procure hats and shoes for himself and his family , upon which he may not perhaps lay out a hundredth part ( or as our author more rhetorically expresses it , the tenth part of a tenth part ) of his products , but to replace his capital with ordinary profits . This time , at least , the object is not money , but capital , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same connexion , machinery and materials ; so that we do not exactly see how Mr Malthus reconciles this new suggestion with his former unhesitating assertion , that money , and money alone , is what the hop-planter wants , and what he must have . Although the hop-planter may not be thinking of hats and shoes , yet if he be thinking of tools and raw materials , he is clearly not thinking of money . Without dwelling on this inconsistency , which is , however , palpable , we may remark that the only way in which a man can replace his capital with ordinary profits , is by exchanging his produce either directly or by the aid of some circulating medium for the produce of an equal amount of labor under some other form , that is , in the present case , by exchanging his hops for hats , shoes , and other articles . The distinction which Mr Malthus seems disposed to take between capital and other articles , that is , between articles intended to be used in reproduction , and those intended for immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present question . The quantity of machinery and raw materials , or capital , which a hop-planter wants , depends upon the quantity of hops which he can raise with profit , and this , in turn , upon the quantity of hats , shoes , and all other articles , which are offered in exchange for beer ; so that the extent to which he can replace capital with profit , which determines the extent of his production , is itself determined by the extent of the production of the ordinary articles // of consumption intended for the same market . Mr Maithus intimates , apparently with a view of supporting his objection , that a capitalist may send a part of his products to the other side of the globe ; but this fact tends , we think , to confirm rather than invalidate tho principle , , since it shows that in the present state of commerce , the world itself is to a certain ext. tent one great market , and that the amount of production in Europe is regulated in some degree by that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice versd . Because a brewer in London sends a part of his porter to the West Indies to pay for the sugar , rum , and coffee consumed by himself *nd his neighbors , does it follow that the quantity of porter which lie can afford to brew is not regulated by the amount of hats , shoes , rum , sugar , coffee , &amp;c. in the market ? It is easy to see that the conclusion is exactly the reverse . The more extensive we suppose tite mutual influence of the different branches of industry carried on through the world to be , the nioi*e evident will he the principle , that the amount of production in any depa*itner*t . Is wguJ*ed by that which takes place at the same time in all others . But we had nearly forgotten , in following out these trains of thought , that we are still upon the threshold of the work , and have not yet distieetly made known to the reader its nature and object . Our purpose thus far has pripeipally been to indicate a defect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inducea to do , as it forms an unfavorable contrast with That *vbich has generally prevailed in his former produc .. tions . It may seem ungracious to commence by pointing out faults , but as the error in question is merely of a superficial kind , it appeared more natural to dispose of it , before we took in hand the substance of the treatise . Without attaching too , much importance to any merely external qualities , we confess that we estimate very highly the advantages of conducting philosophical discussions in a cool , good-humored , and polite manner ; and we feel it a sort of duty to notice any deviation from propriety in this respect , in the works of a writer whose high reputation naturally holds him up to others as a model . It appears from the Preface to the little treatise now ' before us , that Mr Nalthus has been for some time past impressed with the opinion , that the obscurity and uncertainty , which , as he says , overhang the science of political economy , are mainly owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject . He conceives that , if the meaning of the most important terms could be clearly stated and generally agreed upon , there would be but little danger of any further dispute upon pririciples , and that the world would be relieved from the scandal of seeing the most distinguished doctors in the science at swords ' points about the most familiar practical truths . The present essay is a - well meant effort to aid in the accomplishment of these desirable objects . It consists of a series of chapters , in which the author successively points out the errors in the use of language , that have-been committed by the French economists , by Adam Smith , by Messrs Say , Ricar-. do , Mill , M'Culloch , and by the author of A Critical Dissertation on Value ; ' and afterwards undertakes to correct these errors by furnishing himself a list of definitions of the most important words that occur in economical discussions . Agreeing , as we do , with our author in the opinion that there is a good deal of confusion and obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfied , as we also are , of the great importance of correctness and precision in the use of language , we are yet free to confess , that we greatly doubt whether the method of preliminary definitions , which Mr Mal. * thus recommends by precept and example , be the best that - can be adopted for remedying the evil of which he complains . A definition , as we understand the matter , must always be substantially the statement of an acknowledged and settled principle . Whether for example we define the sun as a - luminous body , about half a yard over , that appears in the eastern part of the horizon , passes gradually over our heads , at a great distance from us ,  --  and at night disappears in the west ; or whether we define it , on the principles of the Newtonian philosophy , as a vast globe situated in the centre of the system to which our planet belongs , we suppose in either case that the facts are admitted , and our only object is to intimate that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either the popular or Newtonian theory be disputed , we can not determine the controversy by defining the word according to one or the other system , but must do it by an appeal to facts . if , on the other hand , the facts are agreed upon , the more or less imperfect use of language by particular writers will have little or no effect in rendering them doubtful . We incline , therefore , to reverse the order of cause and effect supported by Mr Malthus in undertaking the present work , and // instead of attributing the uncertainty of the science to the incorrect use of language by the popular writers , we should rather attribute their faults to the uncertainty of the science . Let a great truth be once fairly settled , and it soon becomes familiar to all . Different individuals enunciate it with different degrees of correctness and elegance as respects the forms , but all make themselves understood . The silliest girl at a boarding-school ( as a writer in the Edinburgh Review somewhat indiscreetly expresses himself ) could instruct Tycho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if facts are still doubtful , and principles unsettled , the same words must , in the nature of things , be used by different writers in different senses ; and an attempt by any one writer to induce others to use them in the sense which he prefers , is , in substance , an attempt to induce them to receive , upon his authority , principles of which he can not satisfy them by his logic . If we suppose it to be doubtful whether the Newtonian or the popular . theory of the universe be correct , it is quite evident that a writer who should undertake to force the former upon the public in the shape of definitions would fail in his purpose . The work now before us , we conceive to be substantially an attempt of this description , and we therefore doubt whether it can produce much effect . Nothing short of the bold speculations of Copernicus and Kepler , backed by the rigorous and complete demonstrations of Newton and Laplace , could have fixed the science of astronomy ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must venture to suggest to him , that if he means to render a similar service to political econ** omy , he must do it by observation and argument , and not by definition . But although a series of definitions , however excellent as such* could never be of much use in fixing a science , they might , if well drawn up , serve at least to elucidate the peculiar opinions of their author , and enable the public to judge more accurately of their correctness . We have some doubts , however , whether the work of Mr Malthus will answer even this purpose ; and we are compelled to say , that even assuming the truth of all his principles , we do not think the , statement given of them , in his definitions , peculiarly - just or happy . In fact , the framing of a good definition demands a rhetorical and not a philosophical talent , and although Mr Malthus be in the main a very good writer , his turn of mind and habitual QcQUpa. -* // tions have doubtless led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to things more than forms of expression . When he follows out naturally the train of his thoughts , he generally expresses himself with perspicuity and correctness ; but when he sets about the purely rhetorical operation of formal definition , he succeeds very ill in bringing out his meaning . He seems , indeed , to have a very indistinct notion of the qualities , in which the merit of a good definition cotisists . In all definitions , ' he remarks , the same meaning may be conveyed in different language ; and it is the meaning rather than the mode of expression , that should be the main object of consideration . ' Now it is quite obvious , on the contrary , that in a definition , considered as such , the meaning is of no importance whatever , and the form of expression every thing . A word , of which the meaning is unknown and unsettled , can not be defined . The meaning is therefore in all cases given or assumed , and the object of the definition is to express this given meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in the present work are far from being faultless , and are indeed among the most remarkable specimens of looseness and inaccuracy of style , that we recollect to have lately met with . The very first on the list , which is that of wealth , will serve to illustrate the truth of these remarks . It appears from other passages in the work , that our author 's notion of the meaning of this term is substantially correct . Thus he remarks very justly , that when Adam Smith says that a man is rich or poor , according to the quantity of the necessaries , conveniences , and luxuries of life which he can command , he gives a most correct definition of wealth . ' Let us now compare with this most correct definition , the one which stands at the head of our author 's list . WaAtTH . The material objects , necessary , useful , and agree . able to men , which have required some portion of human labor to appropriate or produce . ' Independently of the inelegant and even ungrammatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of Smith , which the author has pronounced to be most correct* but wholly omits the leading and only important idea conveyed by the term , which is - also distinctly expressed in the other . This idea is obviously that of quantity . The definition given by Malthus is a circumlocutory and rather awkward equivalent // for the more familiar and intelligible phrase , necessaries , conveniences , and luxuries of life , ' which is employed by Smith . But the mere possession of the necessaries and comforts of life , or of ' the material objects necessary , useful , and agreeable to man , which have required some portion of human labor to appropriate or produce , ' does not constitute wealth . The poorest man possesses these as well as the richest , and the only difference between the two in this respect is , that the latter is able to command a large quantity of them , and the former only a small one . Wealth , as correctly defined by Adam Smith , is therefore the power of commanding a large quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , in omitting entirely the notion of quantity , has in fact omitted the very essence of the definition , it is rather remarkable that most of the contemporary writers , although they differ a good deal among themselves in the terms of their definitions , have all fallen into this error . But while they omit the only important idea conveyed by the term , they all inquire very curiously , and dispute very warmly among themselves upon the questions , whether wealth do or do not include immaterial as well as material objects , and if material objects , those which are not the produce of human labor , as well as those which are . These controversies appear to us to reflect but little honor on the sagacity and good sense of the disputants , and resemble too nearly the frivolous debates that occupied the cloisters of the middle ages . But however this may be , it is obvious that they are irrelevant to the definition of the term wealth . The questions to which we have alluded , if they in fact deserve the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether wisdom and virtue ( immaterial objects , that are useful and agreeable ) on the one hand , or light and air ( material objects , not the produce of labor ) on the other , be or be not , in the correct use of language included under the phrase necessaries and comforts of life . In whichever way the point might be settled , the definition of wealth would remain the same . It would always signify an abundance of the necessaries and comforts of life , the particular articl*es of which these are cornpcused being left for the moment entirely out of view . So imperfectly has Mr Malthus succeeded in expressing his own correct ' notions of the meaning of the term wealth . Another proof of his want of precision in the use of language , which occurs in the same connexion , may be found in his // anxiety to guard his readers against confounding the terms wealth and value . After giving a definition of value , which , though clumsy , and indeed almost unintelligible , appears to be an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , he adds ; Value is distinguished from wealth , in that it is not confined to material objects , and is much more dependant upon scarcity and difficulty of production . ' He even accuses Adam Smith of occasionally confounding these terms , remarking that when Adam Smith says that a man is rich or poor according to the quantity of labor which he can command , he evidently ' confounds wealth with value . ' Some of the other modern writers appear to be equally anxious to guard against this dangerous confusion , and the author of A Critical Dissertation on Value , ' upon which Mr Maithus bestows a good deal of attention , has a separate chapter on The Distinction between Riches and Value . Now we beg leave to ask , how it is possible for any one at all accustomed to a correct use or language , or indeed for any person of common education , to confound the meaning of the words wealth and value . Who , except Mr Malth'us and his brother economists of the new school , ever imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not the illustrious author of the Wealth of ' Nations , ' one of the most correct and elegant writers , as well as just and powerful thinkers , that ever appeared . Synonymous terms may be substituted for each other , without altering the sense of the phrase with which they are connected . But who would think of saying that the greal work ' to which we have just alluded might ' be called , without altering the meaning of the title , An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Value of Nations ? ' Who , that was at all acquainted with the English language , would think that he could say indifferently , the value of this book is Jive dollars , or the wealth of this book is five dollars . It is quite clear that a writer , who shauld for a moment deem it possible to confound the two terms , must have a very loose and inaccurate notion of the ' meaning of one if not both . The definition of value given by Mr Malthus , and to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of wealth , a curious example of the obscurity that may be thrown over a word , which every body understands perfectly , by an-attempt to explain it in philosophical language . Mr. Maithus , like all // the rest of the world , kn6ws well enough what is meant by value , and when he uses the word naturally in the course of his composition always uses it correctly ; but whe2 he under-. takes to define it , his efforts are not only wholly unsuccessful , but so awkward and laborious as to be almost ludicrous . His definition is as follows . VALUE . The relation of one object to some other or others , in exchange , resulting from the estimation in which each is held . ' Now we greatly doubt , whether a person to whom this definition should be presented without the key , would know what was meant by it . By the relation of one object to another in exchange , our author probably intends the capacity of one object to exchange for another ; but in endeavoring to express himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making himself understood . Relation in exchange , or relation of objects in exchange , are phrases which , if interpreted according to the proper use of the terms , signify nothing . They border too nearly on the refined and elegant style of Mrs Malaprop . Compare now with the above definition , the one given in the Wealth of Nations . ' The value of an object , in exchange , is the power of purchasing other goods given by its possession . ' With this simpk and satisfactory ( though not in form wholly unexceptionable ) explanation of the . term by the master of the science before his eyes , it is really singular that Mr Malthus should have supposed himself to be promoting the progress of truth by substituting another definition , and such another as the one which he has proposed . We may add here , that our author has not in our opinion been more fortunate in his attempt to improve the theory of Dr Smith upon the measure of value , than in the above effort to amend his definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , ' as our readers are aware , that labor is the real measure of value , that the capacity of objects to exchange for each other depends upon the quantity of labor respectively laid out upon them , and that every object will always command the same quantity of labor which was employed in its production . If it require , for example , two days ' labor to make a hat , and also to make a pair of shoes , a hat and a pair of shoes will exchange for each other , or will possess equal value , and each will purchase two days ' labor , or any other articles which it requires the labor of two days to produce . These // principles approve themselves to the common sense of every judicious reader , and have been generally admitted for half a century by intelligent men . The somewhat hypercritical acu* men of our contemporary economists has detected various supposed errors in this as in many other parts of the work of Dr Smith . Some of these writers affirm , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature as an invariable standard or measure of value , and that the worth of labor fluctuates as much as that of any other article . This may he considered as , on the whole , the prevailing opinion at the present day . Mr Malthus rather inclines to admit the theory of Smith , but not without some alterations and improvements of his own , which he considers as being of essential importance . Labor is in general a correct measure of value , but the value of particular objects is determined not by the quantity of labGr only , but by the quantity of labor and profits invested in them , or em* ployed in their production . If a man purchase a quantity of cotton which is the produce of a hundred days ' labor , and employ himself for a hundred days in making it into cloth , the cloth ( leaving out of view , in order to simplify the question , the cost of the machinery ) will be equal in value , on the theory of Dr Smith , to the ordinary product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of labor , or the product of it in money or any other article . Not exactly so , says Mr Malthus ; for in order to know the real value of the cloth , you must add to the two hundred days ' labor the interest on the value of the cotton for a hundred days . The weaver , when he purchases the cotton , advances the value of it , which is equal to the ordinary pr9duct of a hundred days ' labor , and he will lose by the operation unless he replace his capital with ordinary profits , and also receive the ordinary produce of his own labor for a hundred days . Hence the sum total of the value of the cloth must be equal to the ordinary produce of three hundred days ' labor , and not of two , and it will purchase this amount of labor , or its product in money or any other article . This objection , which , if well founded , would destroy the simplicity and beauty of the theory *f Dr Smith , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily shown to be without foundation . The weaver who , by laboring a hundred days , has realized the ordinary product of that amount of labor in money , and exchanges it for cotton , obtains // in the cotton the full reward of his previous labor . His account is balanced , and he has nothing more to . expect for his past exertions . He now works a hundred days morg in making his cotton into cloth , and obtains , at the end of that time , a quantity of cloth equal in value to the ordinary produce of two hundred days ' labor . With this he replaces his cotton , and . retains the ordinary product of a hundred days ' labor as the reward of his own labor lbr that time . What more then has he to wish* or expect ? He has wrought two hundred days , and he has received the ordinary *pr6duce of the . labon of two hundred days . If he were to receive in addition the ordinary ' produce of a hundred days ' labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the product of three hundred days ' labor , after having wrought only two . His profit would exceed the common rate , and competitors would engage in. the same business , until the balance i*ere. r*stored .. It is clear , therefore , that the value of the cloth , and in general of all ar .. tides , is fairly measured by the quantity of labor employed in their production , without making any allowance for profits on advances made for materials or machinery . e*pJoyed in the production . The error of Malthus apparently results from an indistinct notiQnloX the *mie*ning of the word profits , which he secms to consider as a sort of s*ontaneou* product of capital entirely independent of the labor bestowed *ipon it , and over and above the product of this labor . In reality , jvrofiti are the returns which * . n*an , re*ive*s for the labor he employed upon his own stock or capital , as wages are the returns of his own labor employed upon the stock of others , and interest his share of thc returns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . their hands . It seems quite clear that he can not employ his caphal himself , and place it in other hands at one and the same time . , How then can he receive both profit and interest on the same capital ? T.o replace capital with ordinary , profits is to obtain from the labor errtployed upon it a return which will replace it , and leave as profits an amount equal to the ordinary produce of the same quantity of labor . It is not necessary or possible that any capital can yield in addition another return under the name of interest on advances , for the plain reason just intimated that no capital can be employed in two different ways *i , . t the same time ; and that , if it remain in its owner 's possession and yield profit , it can not also be out of his possession and yield interest . These // considerations appear to us not only quite incontestible , but almost too familiar to require being mentioned ; yet it is for want of having noticed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous theory of Dr Smith on the measure of value . The rest of our author 's definitions are generally not much superior in preci*ion and perspicuity to those which we have quoted , and are , in our opinion , of little or no value . We deem it unnecessary to examine them in detail . The real defect of the work , as we remarked before , lies in its plan . A science which is completely settled , and no longer a subject of dispute , may conveniently , for certain purposes , be digested into a list of axioms . But while principles are still unsettled , definitions are obviously impossible , and when we find a writer proposing them precisely as a remedy for this unsettled state of the science , which precludes the possibility of their exist* ence , we are tempted to suspect that he has not defined very exactly in his own mind the meaning of the word definition . ' We have been induced to notice this work , which is in itself of no great importance , and has excited little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers a specimen of the general power of reasoning exercised by Malthus upon the tqpics which habitually engage his attention , and thus enable them to judge what probability the mere authority of his name ought to give to his theories on population , independently of the direct arguments , by which they are supported . While writing this article , we have received the Edinburgh Review for September last , and we avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the subject we are treating , to notice a passage in the article on PrusskLn Political Economy . The reviewer commences by remarking , that his author , M. Schmalz , a privy counsellor in the service of the king of Prussia , does not appear to be acquainted with the great discoveries in political economy that have been made in England within the last fifteen years , and which have given a new aspect to the whole science . He concludes by intimating , that ignorant as the Prussians may be in this respect , it would be doing them great injustice to compare their commercial system with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many words , that the late tariff is ruinous to the best interest of the people , and disgraceful to the intelligence of the Congress of this country . // Without entering at large into a defence either of the state of political philosophy in Prussia , or of the act of our government to which the reviewer alludes , we can not but remark that the tone in which he speaks of both appears to us to be liable to the objections which we made at the commencement of this article , to that adopted by Mr Maithus in some* passages of the work before us . The reviewer expresses himself , in our opinion , in too overbearing and decisive a way . Admitting him to be as much in the right as he supposes himself to be , in regard to both classes of his opponents , it is nevertheless certain , that the north of Germany , and particularly Prussia , the country of the Jacobis and Schleiermachers , the Kants and Fichtes , the Humboldts and the Schiegels , whatever other faults it may be charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any branch of abstract science . We may say Perhaps with confidence , that Berlin and Kdnigsberg are on a level , in point of scientific information , with Edinburgh and London . If then the great discoveries in question have not been adopted in the former quarters , is it certain that the reason lies in the ignorance of the Germans , who are proverbially ignorant of nothing , and not in the errors of the British , who may possibly for once be mistaken ? As respects the intelligence of the Congress of the United States , it does not of course belong to Americai*s to fix precisely the reputation of their own government as compared with others ; but we cannot. help thinking that the general decorum that marks the proceedings of the public functionaries , and the respectful language habitually employed in their intercourse with foreign states , entitle them in turn to expect common civility from a foreign reviewer , who may have occasion to find fault with any of their measures . Politeness and decency have their value as well as truth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be t ? propagate his opinions in this country and in Prussia , he will probably succeed much better by employing a civil and conciliatory tone , than by indulging at the outset in contemptuous and insulting language . But waving this point , which is merely formal , we would also take the liberty of suggesting to the reviewer , that it might perhaps be expedient for the economists of Great Britain , before they treat foreign nations with so much harshness for not adopting their systems , to agree among themselves in the first place about what these systems ate . Mr Malthus , the // acknowledged founder of the new school of political economy , informs us in the present work , that it is as yet in a very distracted state . He calls up one after another of , the most distinguished among his disciples , and takes them all to task in no very measured terms . The harsh phrase preposterously ridiculous is , as we have seen above , levelled at professor M'Culloch , one of the luminaries of the train . If common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh Review , . - this ponderous missile must have been aimed at a point not very remote from the head of the author of the article on Prussian Political Economy . On the other hand , the disciples of the philosopher of Hertfordshire make pretty free *t times with their master , and are all at daggers ' drawing among themselves . What then becomes of the great discoveries of the last fifteen years ? or how has the aspect of the science been changed , otherwise than by the substitution of acknowledged confusion and obscurity , for the state of comparative certainty in which it was left by Adam Smith , in our opinion the only writer upon it in the language of any real value ? When the British economists shall have settled among themselves what their theories are , it will be time enough , as we just remarked , to complain of strangers for not adopting them ; and it will even t , hen be too early for an anonymous journalist to treat foreign governments of respectable standing with offensive rudeness , and accuse whole nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they differ in opinion upon their own affairs with him and his club . We shall not at present enter into a defence of the tariff , against the vague and sweeping denunciations of this reviewer ; but should he , as he promises , return to the charge in a future number , we may perhaps improve the opportunity to offer some remarks on the . dmericart Economical System , which , with all our respect for the doctors on the other side of the water , will , we think , for our purposes at least , bear a comparison with that which the British , very disinterestedly no doubt , are disposed to recommend to us.
