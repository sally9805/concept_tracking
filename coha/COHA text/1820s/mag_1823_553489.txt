txt ART . 11. - il Report to the Secretary of War of the U. S. on Indian . /Iffairs , comprising a narrative of a Tour performed , us the Summer of 1820 , under a Commission from the President of the U. S. , for the purpose of ascertaining , for the use of the government , the actual State of the Indian tribes , us our Country : By Rev. Jedidiah Mors*e , D. D. Newhaven , 1822 , Svo . THE subject of this work appears to be one of rapidly increasing interest , in this country . The extension of our states // and territories westward is daily giving greater political consequence to questions , relative to the condition of the yet existing nations of aboriginal inhabitants . Philologians , both abroad and at home , have of late years pursued with zeal the comparison of the native dialects of this continent . The well conducted expeditions , which our government has fitted out , and the enterprizing tours of individuals have brought to notice tribes and nations before unknown ; and lastly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has attended the great efforts now making for the civilization of the Indians , have turned the eyes of a great part of the community to their condition and prospects . It was in connexion with some of these societies , that the tour of Dr Morse , of which the narrative is given in this volume , had its origin . Being in the service of the Society in Scotland , for propagating Christian knowledge , and the Northern Missionary Society of the state of New York , Dr Morse was led to make an offer of his services to the government of the United States , which was accepted . In pursuit of his object the Dr undertook a tour to Green bay , in the summer of 1820 ; and those who recollect -- as so many among us may-  --  the idea which prevailed , not a generation since , of the effort required for a visit to Niagara , will be struck with the improvements introduced in the means of conveyance , in this quarter . Dr Morse started from Newhaven for Green bay , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to that city , * Aug 30th of the same summer , not having passed more than two thirds of the time on the road . The next summer Dr Morse also made a visit to York , in upper Canada , for the sake of an interview with Sir Peregrine Maitland , the governor of that province , on the subject of his mission . The volume before us consists of a narrative of these two excursions and a large appendix , containing documents of various kinds and various degrees of interest . As the personal observations of Dr Morse were almost wholly limited to those , which he had an opportunity of making on his hasty visit to Green bay ; the greater part of his materials rest of course on the authority of the gentlemen , who furnish them . A considerable part of these is already before the public , particufttrly most of the accounts of the missionary establishments among the Cherokees and Choctaws , and the accounts of the Indians in our high // latitudes , by Mr Harmon ; from whose journal Dr Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only exception we have to take to this volume , which we have read with great interest  --  and this is , perhaps , the highest compliment in our power to pay to a closely printed volume of five hundred pages-is , that more choice was not used in selecting the materials , and more care bestowed in arranging them . Had the whole been digested into one body , ' according to the judicious suggestion of Mr Calhoun , and the mass of materials , contained in the appendix , been woven into one continuous discourse or treatise , of about a third of the size of the present volume , it would have been likely to enjoy an extensive circulation . As it is , the size of the work and the manner in which it is put together , will confine it principally to those , who are willing to take some pains to master the contents of a volume . We must be permitted also to object to the practice of splitting up documents into paragraphs , with running titles in italics , to tell their contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in paragraphs , and it is very well in a newspaper designed for popular circulation ; but certainly the present work is not intended for a class of readers , who can not tell the subject of a document , till it has been thus dissected and labelled . The condition of the native inhabitants of this continent , especially of those parts of it included within our own settlements or on whom the wave of population is daily encroaching , is a very interesting , a very curious , and a somewhat difficult subject . It is common to speak of them as a much oppressed and wronged race , to deplore their extinction , and to form projects for their preservation and civilization . Many questions , however , seem to be confounded together in this subject , and it will aid us materially , in coming to a right conclusion , to separate them . Are they then a much injured and oppressed race , or rather is their gradual extinction and disappearance a great and crying injustice ? No one , directly challenged on this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be agreed , on all hands , that barbarous tribes have but a partial and imperfect right in the soil ; that they can not allege a prior occupancy of the forests and plains , which they do not in any civilized sense // occupy. * If this be so , a civilized company of emigrants have a right to land and settle on a savage coast . They certainly have a right so to do , if , as in most cases in our country , a regular agreement and treaty be had with the natives , by which they transfer their right , perfect or imperfect , to the new comers . Thus far then all will agree , and will allow that the pilgrims of New England and the quakers of Pennsylvania were lawfully and rightfully settled . But here begins the difficulty . The settlers possessing the arts of civilized life , enjoying the blessings of government , and backed by powerful countries beyond the sea , are likely to advance in population , much more rapidly than any equal portion of the natives . Forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds the white people , but it starves the red people ; and yet what hardy moralist will say , that the settlers shall not cut down the trees , because it will destroy the covert of the deer ? Thus we see , the very first step to feed and support the new comers aims at the extinction of the savages . To cut down forests is to apply , in the modern phraseology , the most effectual check to their increase . This is only the first step . The settler brings with him the art of extracting a strong liquor out of potatoes and rye , which taken in small quantities and with great discretion is a cordial ; but , in large quantities and without discretion , a poison . The savage has an ungoverned appetite for this liquor ; and though it be always made penal to furnish him with it , it is impossible , in the nature of things , to enforce the restriction , and it is put within his reach . This not only produces the fatal consequences peculiar to itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads to other vices , to quarrels , to violence , to murders ; and thus to wars of retaliation , punishment , and self-defence . Cannon , and musketry , and ammunition now come in aid of the silent operation of other causes ; and the savage foes are rapidly cut offl Collaterally with this , they take our diseases , and small pox , with aggravated ravages , hastens their extinction . This has been the immediate agent of breaking up and destroying several mighty tribes , and the volume before us furnishes proof that it is still at work . By the operation *f these causes , the Indian population is thinned , crowded together , driven off : a melancholy spectacle to the survivors , and brought about , as * See the authorities cited by Dr Morse , p. 279. // we have stated , partly by the vices of the settlers ; but yet not by any of that tyranny and oppression commonly urged . In a high moral sense , we certainly would allow , that to distil whiskey , knowing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is criminal ; but this can not be said of giving them the small pox , which has the opposite quality of mercy , and curses him who gives and him who takes ; ' nor can it be said of the disastrous result of Indian wars , growing out of the savage manners of the natives , and a just self-defence against them . We hope we shall not be understood to palliate any act of injustice and cruelty , of which doubtless many have been committed against the Indians . But it must be remembered , that many also have been committed by them , against the whites , and we are strongly inclined to think that this private score of oppression , cruelty , and guilt is nearly balanced . We maintain only , that the extinction of the Indians has taken place by the unavoidable operation of natural causes , and as the natural consequence of the vicinity of white settlements . Wherever , by the interference of the state , they have been preserved , it has been by a greater violation of their supposed rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they lords of the soil ? " they may then sell it to whom they please ; and that will be the first trader well furnished with whiskey . Are they not lords , and do they even require reservations made inalienable by government , to prevent their total extinction ? then they have not been driven from their own property . It appears to us therefore that the whole theory of injury and oppressionresting on the rapid and total extinction of so many nations and the impending disappearance of all-is unsound on any principle , which would not wholly deny the right of settling , on any terms , upon a barbarous coast . We have hitherto left out of view one consideration , which destroys even the shadow of plausibility in the argument which we combat . It is this , that most of the aboriginals-as we call them-certainly , all probably , hunted and fished in the streams and forests of this country , merely , by the right of the strongest . The traditions of their wars among themselves , of their conquests , and defeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . The Peruvians , Mexicans , and LenniLenape were none of them aborigir*als , in the literal sense of the term . Some of them , at a very late period , and all at no // very remote period , had driven out some still ' more oppressed and injured race . ' The Spaniards would never have reached Mexico , but for the alliance of the Tlascalans , with which nation the Mexicans would not make peace , because the supply of prisoners of war for human sacrifices would fail . The Eries , who gave their name to the lake , were exterminated by the Iroquois . And at the present day , Cherokees and Osages , Sioux and Chippeways are much more dangerous foes to each other than whites to either . Without regarding therefore their barbarous modes of warfare , or their treatment of prisoners , it is quite plain that they have no just cause of murmuring , at the progress of the whites , who had they , from their first landing , used no other means of extending themselves and extinguishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as good a right , as the Indians themselves . But if not an injured and oppressed race , still is not their extinction and disappearance from the face of the earth a great calamity , a subject of melancholy reflection ? Dr Morse , at the close of his report , thus expresses himself : In these circumstances , they become insulated , among those who despise them as an inferior race , fit companions of those only , who have the capacity and disposition to corrupt them . In this degraded , most disconsolate and heart breaking situation , in which man can be placed , they are left miserably to waste away for a few generations , and then to become extinct for ever ! This is no fancied picture . In a few years it will be sad reality , unless we change our policy toward them ; unless effectual measures be taken to bring them over this awful gulf , to the solid and safe ground of civilization . How many tribes , once numerous and respectable , have in succession perished , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now possessed by and giving support to TEN MILLIONS. * In confirmation of these feelings of his own , the Doctor quotes the following impassioned passage from a sermon of the Rev. Mr Clarke , of Amherst ( Mass . ) I hear too the voice of the savage sounding from the bosom of the trackless forest . And there is in that cry a wild and native eloquence . " You have stripped us of our hunting ground , all in lice that we held dear ; you have corrupted our morals ; our tribes , already incalculably diminished , have nothing before them but the dreary idea ef being swallowed up , unless it be the more fearful apprehen* // sion of perishing for ever in our sins . Once we were the heirs of your soil ; we now only ask to die the heirs of that salvation which is revealed to you in your bibles . " A cry like this has been uttered and is heard . Already the heralds of salvation have gone to look up the remnants of their depopulated tribes and point them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , and we should give evidence that we had their unpitying nature as well as their soil , were we willing to see it go down in total darkness . If the few that remain may live forever , it alleviates the retrospect of their wrongs , and creates one luminous spot in the Egyptian cloud , that hangs over the place of their fathers ' sepulchres . I would give any price for their forgiveriess and blessing ; and it cheers my heart , that my country is beginning to pay the long arrears , that are due to that injured people . ' We shall presently have an opportunity of saying that we wish success as heartily as any one can , to the efforts making , particularly among the Cherokees and Choctaws , for the instruction and civilization of the Indians . We have made these quotations for the sake of offering a remark on the supposed melancholy fact of the disappearance and extinction of the natives of this country . We are much mistaken , if it he not one of those confusions of ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing happened to the native inhabitants of this country , which has not happened at the same time to the whites , which has not always happened in all ages and to all the tribes of men ? The natives driven from the soil , destroyed , extinguished ! What then , would they not have died ; is it the Europeans , that have made them mortal and their generations transitory ? To hear the language sometimes used , in this connexion , one would suppose it to be thought , that but for the arrival of the Europeans , the aborigines would have been immortal on earth ; that it was the discovery of Columbus , that Brought death into the land and all their woe . If this is not the melancholy event , that is deplored , if it is granted that the Indians would have died in the course of nature , then nothing is left to lament but that , in proportion as the Indian generations passed off , civilized generations have come on . And is it a real subject of complaint that hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which // yielded a precarious subsistence to wandering savages , are the seats of prosperous and civilized villages ? Had not the Europeans come , the Indians would have died in the course of nature as before , and been succeeded by other generations of Indians , to lead a barbarous and wretched life , and die like their fathers . The Europeans came ; and-by causes as simple and natural , as they are innocent  --  the barbarous population , as it has passed off , has been replaced by one much better , much happier . Does any one doubt that man , the human mind , the human soul , stands higher in a civilized , than in a barbarous country ? And is it a cause of melancholy , that these dreary wildernesses , as our fathers found them , have been turned into the happy abodes of civilized christian men ? But the Indians are disappearing , wasting away ! - So are we ; we are no more permanent than they , we are all disappearing , and wasting . But while we do abide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is no just cause of melancholy reflection , that so much barbarity , heathenism , and moral degradation , have been succeeded by so much improvement and civilization. - ' How many tribes once numerous and respectable have in succession perished , in the manner describ*t1 , from the fair and productive territories , now possessed by and supporting ten millions of people ! ' We can scarce persuade ourselves that it is really intended as the climax of a mournful case , that ten millions of civilized men , prosperously cultivating the arts of peaceful life , and governed by its laws and principles , have succeeded to perhaps the twentieth part of that number of wandering , abject barbarians . When we wish for the progress of knowledge , christianity , and happiness , it is not surely red and black men alone , that we wish to have them ; and we would ask what plan or device of benevolence acting upon the Indians could , in ages , have brought forth the glorious result of ten millions of a population like ours . Let otheri* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes of Naticks and Narragansetts ; - for ourselves , while we would not insult the inferiority of their savage races , we rejoice in the memory of the pilgrims . Ample experience has shown that the contemporary existence of the Europeans and savages was impossible , and the natives o$ Pennsylvania , under the mild influence of the principles of Penn , have vanished more rapidly than those of Mexico and Peru , under the merci // less oppression of Mitas and Repartimientos . Since then it was not possible that the savage races could be perpetuated and the civilized settlements flourish , we see neither matter of regret nor commiseration in the course which events have taken . Somewhere in the course of the work before us , it is in substance said , that if the governments in New England had taken the proper measures , the Indians would have existed there to the present day . We profess ourselves unable to comprehend the advantage of such a result . It is a very plain alternative of an Indian and a civilized population . For ourselves , we like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from history and observation such ideas of the Indian character , that we are thankful our forefathers took no effectual steps ( supposing there were any such ) to perpetuate it . At the same time , however , the truth ought to be told . Our fathers really omitted nothing which seemed practicable for promoting the welfare of the Indians . At one pen-. od there were thirty Indian churches within a small circuit of Boston , * all built by private or public charity ,  --  some served by pious white men ,  --  some by natives , on whose education no pains had been spared ; while an uncommonly vigilant police watched over the rights and property of their race . If this was not all that could be asked of men , who had their own children , their own community , their own interests to work hard for , we are much deceived ; and in short we regard the disappearance of the natives in New England as full and final proof , that their preservation , within the limits of a white population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the commiseration , of which we have been speaking , seems founded on a figure of speech , badly applied to real life . Men have talked of the melancholy vanishing of the native tribes , as if but for the Europeans , the successive tribes would not have vanished ; and forgetting that the hunting ground of fifty savage families would feed and does feed a large city of civilized christians . Had the Indians been murdered to make way for these strangers , it would have been a deed of undying infamy ; and such deeds , we know , were done in many parts of the continent of America . But among the alleviations , which providence has connected with our mortal nature , is this , that it provides a way for happy improve * Neal 's history of New England . // ments , without cruel substitutions . It is not necessary to kill a bad man unless the case be extreme ; - he will die . It is not necessary to exterminate a savage tribe ; - place the germ of civilization in their soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis conservatrix of the arts of civilized life , that it will strike root , shoot up , and spread . Place a settlement of civilized men on a barbarous shore , and extend to them reasonable political muniments , and they will be sure , in the course of ages , to supersede the barbarous population , and by necessity ; - for if barbarity were more enduring , more permanent , more conducive to tbe increase and stability of population , more congenial to the human nature , as it would in this case be proved to be , then it would be better than civilization . One more remark and we close this portion of our reflections . The inconsiderateness of the commiseration of the supposed disastrous lot of the natives is in nothing more ap. - parent , than in the suggestions made for the benefit of the savage tribes , which still subsist . We lament that they have vanished : we would take measures to preserve the present stock . But what is it we would preserve ? Their languages ? that first great bond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages are in their structure , and perhaps the only historical monument of their ancient emigrations , affinities , and fortunes ? Would we preserve these ? 0 no . It is recommended at once , to hasten these into oblivion . Dr Morse , in his appendix , expressly says , as fast as possible , let Indians forget their own languages , in which nothing is written , and nothing of course can be preserved , and learn ours , which will at once open to them the whole field of useful knowledge . ' Is it their mode of life , tenure of property in common , their manners ,  --  that which makes them in all externals to be what they are : - is it these , which we deplore as lost , and would fix and perpetuate where they still exist ? No . The whole drift of Dr Morse 's speculations on the subject is to gather the Indians all into convenient settlements , wean them from the chace , teach them individually to hold a farm in fee , and plough and dig it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fathers , their traditions , that we would cherish and perpetuate among them ? Far from it . Their religious conceptiontm are notoriously of the grossest and most degrading kind , their traditions mere bloody recollections of prisoners scalped and tomahawked. // Is there any thing left then that we wish in fact to preserve ? Nothing , in the last analysis , but the copper color ; and why a civilized , christianized person , speaking our language , subsist- ' ing by regular labor , is any the better for being copper color- ' ed , we can not see . But some will not leave them even this . Dr Morse quotes a respectable Frenchman , who strongly recommends intermarriages , and is evidently not unfriendly himself to the suggestion ; and the advantages are that it will ameliorate the manners of the natives , and the offspring be nearly white . All this may be well , but what becomes mean- ' time of the Indians . The very efficacy of this course is to hasten their disappearance . This the shrewder natives them- ' selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , languages , mode of life , and religion . They know that to change these , to make them speak English , live on farms , and practise the civilized arts would be most directly to annihilate them as Indians ! If this is the tendency of their civilization , and if , on a large scale of benevolence , we wish the promotion and extension , not of Indian virtue , Indian piety , and Indian knowledge , but generally of virtue , piety , and knowledge , what is the best course to be pursued in our land ? If , when the pilgrims were about embarking for New England , the English government had wished to do a grand work of benevolence  --  to spread knowledge , virtue , and piety throughout the then savage continent of North America ; whether would it have been the more prudent and pr6mising course , to secure the Indians on the soil by inalienable reservations , and then penetrate their land with missions ; or do what was actually done-prohibit all violence and cruelty , and leave civilization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized and christian men . Let no one do us the injustice to think , that in these remarks we disparage the exertions making so successfully to establish colonies of civilization , in the western wilderness . The establishments at Brainerd and Eliot , and in the Arkansas territory are admirable in their plan , and must be the means of incalculable good . After what we have said , it is superfluous to add , that we do not look to these schools and establishments as Likely to effect what would be in fact a contradiction in terms , the establishment of communities of men in their physical descent Indians , but possessed of our arts and refinements and // language . Could this be done , it would be entailing the disadvantage of a physical inferiority , a degraded color , on men otherwise equal to their white neighbors . But these establishments will perform far more practicable and benevolent services . In the change of races , in the process now going on upon the frontiers , of substituting the white for the native population , much suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawless character of the pioneers of civilization , the base self-interest of the private traders and hunters , to stimulate the passion of the Indians for intoxicating liquors , the languishing existence of the tribes , who have lost the scanty and imperfect virtues of barbarity , and acquired only the vices of civilization , must cause , on the frontiers , and among the Indians near them , much misery in the power of these establishments to relieve . The rescue and education particularly of the children of these unhappy tribes is certainly an eminent work of charity , and as it is not to be expected that those , who have been trained to all the arts of civilized life , will return to the forests for husbands and wives , intermarriages between the educated natives* and whites will take place , and thus the absorption of the former in the mass of the latter be hastened . We should regard the erection of the institutions in question as highly propitious , were it only as calculated , by degrees , to furnish the government with persons well prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of agents , overseers , interpreters , and whatever other function is required . We have no doubt every thing has been done that the government could do , to protect the interest of the Indians ; but in general civil governments can command only money and force . But gold and the sword , though efficacious agents , often leave much to desiderate , in the manner of operation . The instrumentality of the members of these establishments , whose sole object is to protect , benefit , and serve the natives-factors of benevolence , who come not to cheapen beaver and buffaloe , but to teach the ignorant and serve the friendless-soldiers of the cross , bound on no expedition of violence-must be most benign . Hitherto in the nature o* things , the Indian has hardly known the white man , but in a form scarcely im-. proved above his own , that of a skilful , thrifty savage . The twilight of civilization between them and us has been at least // as near to darkness as to light ; and much of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us , has been obstructed by the prejudices they have imbibed against us , from the sorry samples of white men which they witness . The missionary colonies will present them the character of their powerful white neighbors , under a new and genial aspect . The establishments already founded , and others in contemplation , will form the nucleus of settlements of a kind scarce ever witnessed in the world , surely not on our western frontier . If the secular spirit can be kept out , with the increase of these establishments , and they continue to apply their resources as they multiply , with the zeal , disinterestedness , and singleness of view , which are too apt to be confined to infant establishments , they will prove blessings to the western country . The first furrows turned up in that wilderness of humanity will be planted with good seed ; and we shall see the fruits of it in a milder and softer character in the population of the new states , which spring up in the valley of the Missouri and of the Mississippi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day , which distinguishes them most advantageously from many of the older missions . We mean the union of the arts of civilized life with moral and religious instruction . Dr Morse proposes to call education families ' what have hitherto been called mission families . ' But if mission has gotten to be too exclusively a theological term , education is too nice and polite a term ; and if a change is to be made-of which we see no need-civilization appears to U8 the most expressive . This includes all the stages of the pro* cess , from instruction in the first arts of life , to communicating the last religious truths . Our missionaries have abandoned , if they ever pursued , the inverted course of former times , by which purely doctrinal instruction was addressed to a rude savage , wholly ignorant of the meaning of the abstract ideas which it involved , and unprepared for the views which it opened . All the establishments are now provided with persons capable of performing the duties of farmers and mechanics , as well as with instructers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this principle might be acte4 on much farther . We observe that the first step taken at the missionary establishments in the way of promoting the objects of the mission , is to build a school-house , send for the children , and begin to // teach them to read and write English . The idea of such a course of proceeding is borrowed from home . But the least advantageous way of teaching a child a language is to put him down to a book ; and considering the manners and habits of our Indians , their inaptitude to book-learning must be peculiarly great . So too , we should judge , would be confinement within four walls and the restraint of a Lancaster school . M. Von Fellenberg , at Hofwyl , teaches his poor children in the fields , in the woods , in the workshops , at meals ; and so , in the last address of Dr Worcester to the Choctaw mission , it is exhorted to do . The school room is but one among many places of instruction . The principle of imitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal agency , and that intenseness and heartiness , with which the youthful hands take hold of the implement , which it is made a mark of confidence to be allowed to handle , unite to give efficacy to this out-door method ; and establish its preference for such subjects as these , over the dull and constrained discipline of a school . We hasten , however , to drop this topic , feeling somewhat ashamed to surprize ourselves here , from our snug closet , dictating to men , who have subjected themselves to voluntary banishment from the world , and gone among the savages , which we only write about . We can not forbear , in closing , to say a word of the foreign mission school at Cornwall , in Connecticut , an institution , in our judgment , admirably devised , and capable of becoming highly useful . Its object is : - The education in our country of heathen youths , in such manner , as with subsequent professional instruction , will qualify them to become useful missionaries , physicians , surgeons , schoolmasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations such knowledge in agriculture and the arts , as may prove the means of promoting christianity and civilization . ' A detailed account of this school is given p. 264 of this work : and it appears to be highly deserving of the liberal patronage , which the government of the United States has extended to it . The opinion is expressed by Mr Daggett , the principal of the school* that the climate of New England is too unfriendly to the constitution of the islanders of the South Sea , to encourage the prospect that the school can be extensively resorted to , by them :  --  and that it See his letter , Appendix , p. 27.3. // is , in consequence , likely to be principally useful to the aborigines of this country . Considering how wide a field is open in our vast western country , and how immediate is the utility of what is there done , perhaps it would not be matter of regret should this be considered the main-not to say exclusiveobject of the institution . We feel no hesitation in the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this species of charity , than the savage parts of our own continent . Several very interesting specimens of the composition of n*atives , who have been educated either at Cornwall or at the missions of the south , have been inserted by Dr Morse in his appendix . Those written at Cornwall are said to be given , with a very few corrections and additions by the Rev , principal . We mean not to express the least doubt of their substantial authenticity ; but would observe , that all such corrections and additions detract essentially from the interest , which is taken in the performances . They are made , we presume , with an idea that the pieces are somehow better for having them . We regard such pieces as injured in just proportion as they are altered from the orthography , grammar , and composition of the authors . Since committing to writing the foregoing remarks , we are sorry to perceive , by the newspapers , that the flourishing establishment supported by the United Foreign Mission Society of New York , at Harmony , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the suspension of its operations . In the treaty of Fort Clark , concluded with the Osages , November 10 , 1818 , by which the indian title was extinguished to a tract of land estimated at more than fifty millions of acres , it was stipulated that the United States should support a trading house , in the neighborhood of the Osages , perpetuity . In pursuance of this stipulation , a trading house had been erected on the Marias de Cein , and near it was the flourishing missionary establishment in question . An article in a Washington paper informs us , that the Osage In .. * dians have consented to relinquish this stipulated trading house , in consideration of a quantity of merchandise . The result has been a determination on their part to destroy their village , and thus bury all traces of it , and of other things . ' This is a blow , ' continues the article we quote , at the mis- smonary establishment , which has just been organized on the // Gem , and near the factory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys and girls , had entered this asylum of benevolence , and were making very rapid improvement in learning and promised in every respect to do well. - " This prospect , " says our correspondent , ( who happens not to be a missionary , ) " is nearly blasted for the present . Within the last four days they have lost the greater part of their children ; the parents going off , were unwilling to leave them at so great a distance from them , and for this reason have taken them away . " There remained at the date of our correspondent 's letter ( 26th of Aug. ) four boys and three girls , but it was expected these , too , would soon be called to follow in the track of their wandering parents . '
