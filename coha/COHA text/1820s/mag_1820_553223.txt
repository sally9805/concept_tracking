Sx*vi*uY , with the various views arising out of it , is a subject deeply interesting , exerting a powerful influence upon the moral and political character , the security , prosperity , and happiness of the United States . A subject so intimateW connected with all the great interests of a powerful prosperous , an4l rapidly increasing community , demands the earnest attention of its statesmen and legislators , its l ) atrlots and philanthropists* of all those who think , as well as those who act for the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as affecting our character abroad , and our condition at home . Our sensibility is not particularly moved // by the observations of those travellers and - foreign journalists who have taken occasion to speak of this subjed , in a manner and temper calculated , and perhaps designed , rathei* to wound our feelings , than to suggest attainable improvements in our condition . Still we can not divest ourselves of a secret and distressing consciousness of the glaring inconsistency of our professions with our practice . Whilst our most solemn declarations , those constitutions which form the basis of our civil and social institutions , have set forth in language sufficiently strong , explicit , and comprehensive , the purest prin* ciples of natural and civil liberty , and the soundest maxims of universal right and justice , the institutions themselves seem destined , in practice , by a sort of uncontrollable fatality to allow a state of slavery , by which a large portion of human beings are utterly deprived of all their rights . Slavery , though a great and acknowledged evil , must be regarded , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply interwoven in the texture of society to be wholly or speedily eradicated . It is a subject therefore , whatever careless or superficial persons may imagine , which neither can nor ought to be passed over by contemptuous sneers or hitter reproaches upon those who are possessors of slaves , or by animated appeals to the passions of those who are not . It should b* approached with great calmness and good temper , with great firmness of purpose , with pure , enlightened , and benevolent feelings ; but at the same time with that sober and discriminat .. ing benevolence , which regards not merely absolute right , hut attainable good , and which in the eager pursuit of a desirable end , will not blindly overlook the only practicable means of arriving at it . Although we are constrained to acknowledge that this great evil can not be wholly removed , we are quite sure , that much , very much may be done to mitigate and restrain it by the pers*-vering exertions of humanity , virtue , and intelligence . If un example were wanting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a great and enlightened community , which in a short period may be brought about , the case of England would afford a most striking one . Very few years have elapsed since the most solemn tribunals of justice in that country , were engaged in discussing and settling such questions as these ; whether slaves infected with a contagious and mortal disease , and thrown overboard alive to prev*nt th' // 18*O . Sbrvery and the Missouri ( *uestion. spreadiig of the contagion , ought to be ; considered as the sub*-jects of general average ; whether *n : a policy against loss by . mutiny , the death of slaves not joining , in the mutiny who jump overboard to i*void being fired on , and are drowned , or those actively engaged , who die of despondency in conse quince of the failure of the mutiny , can legally be considered as a loss happening by mutiny ; whether if the master of a slave4hip through ignorance mistake his course , whereby a scarcity of water ensues , and a number of slaves are 41irow*u overboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of slaves ate , starved to death , in consequence of a voyage unusually protracted by head winds and boisterous weather , the losses thereby occasioned can be considered as losses by per .. Ils of the , sea ; whether the death of a slave driven to commit suicide , by that overwhelming sense of desolation and despair produced equally by bitter recollections of the past , and gloomy apprehensions of the future , technically anti contemptuously denomi*iated by slave dealers , the sulks , is to be consid** ered a violent death or one happening in the ordinary course of nature ; as an extraordinary loss , or one proceeding from the intrinsic vice of the article . Such discussions at the present time , in Westminster Hall , in the midst of a humane and pol ' ished people , would be regarded with little less abhorrence , and disgust , than the grave deliberations at the council .. fire of a savage tribe , upon the most approved and accustomed methods of torturing their captive prisoners . It is no reproach to the eminent men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; when the trade itself is held lawful , all questions arising out of it must be judiciak* ly settled . But it is one among the many evils of legally sanctioning such a trade , that it tends to degrade thendnis .. ters and profane the sanctuary of justice . The change of public sentiment in Great Britain has been entire and complete , as well as rapid. , Though so few years have elapsed , since the direct trade in slaves was not only allowed to British subjects , but was carried on to a frightful extent in British ships , by British capital . yet now no indi* vidual in that country , having any regard for his own repu* tation , or respect for public opinion , would venture to utt*t a word of apology for this detestable traffic . On the con* trary , her own abolition laws , and her strenuous and persevering exertions in her diplomatic arrangements with other // powers , to induce them torelinquish the slave trade , until the abolition shall become entire , are justly regarded by every enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . Though we think it will appear to the candid readers of the chapter on slavery in Mr. Walsh 's hook , that a little too much credit has been claimed by Engla'nd for her exertions in this cause , yet we are not disposed , on that account , to detract any thing from the just praise , which is certainly due to her . Her conduct in respect of the abolition is deserving of all commendation . We rejoice sincerely in the good she has already done , and we earnestly hope , that she will continue to apply all her powerful means to the attainment of this desirable object , until the entire abolition of the direct slave trade shall be effected . This trade had been sanctioned by long usage , and supported bycherished prejudices ; it was connected with the gainful pursuits of weal . thy and powerful individuals , and in point of ravenue and commercial advantage , was an object of complacent regard , even to the gover*iment . Its entire abolition therefore , by the judicious and persevering exertions of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of enlightened public opinion , and confirms the gratifying truth , that justice and humanity when wisely put in action must ultimately triumph over all the combinations of cupidity , pre , ju ( lice , and habit . But the subject of slavery is not new , and is not now for the first time brought before the Americaii public . However men may differ , and very honestly differ with regard to minor views and details , we consider certain great and leading principles to be firmly and definitively settled , by the unaniinous voice of all men who have taken the trouble to reflect upon the subject . Thus for instance we take it to be univer* sally agreed that the direct trade in slaves , that the act of depriving a man of his liberty , transporting him from his native country , and selling him in perpetual bondage in a foreign country , is an unqualified act of it*justice and cruelty ; that it is immaterial to this purpose , whether the person thus deprived of his liberty and all his natural rights , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midnight security of the peaceful dwelling , and overpowering the helpless and unarmed family , or by fraud and cunning , by tam . pering with the avarica and stimulating the treachery , rapa* // city , and cruelty of barbarous petty chiefs . It is universally conceded that so long as white men , members of civilized communities , christians , will purchase slaves on the coast of Africa , so long the people of that unhappy con ntry , without knowledge , or morals , or religion to enlighten and guide them , will make their fellow beings the subject of this nefa-* rious traffic . It follows as a necessary consequence , that so long as such a traffic continues , the whole land * hence it draws it supplies must be filled w1th violence and treachery ; so long must simplicity , innocence , and peace , which are among the prominent virtues and highest blessings of uncivilized man be banished ; and all hope of making any progress or even taking the first step towards civilization be frustrated . The slave trade therefore is tiow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , as a continued series of climes ; and any atteml ) ts to I ) aliiate it , on the frivolous pretence of bettering the condition of thosewho are reduced to slavery , is a solemn trifling with reason and a pitiable abuse of language . Domestic slavery , however , in communities where it has been long established , and where the number of slaves bears a con-. siderable proportion to the number of free inhabitants , is entitled to a ditl'erent consideration . Upon this 1 ) Oillt we mean to state our views explicitly , and we wish to be distinctly nndei*-stood . We would not unnecessarily awaken tile jealousies or alarm the fears of the l ) roprietors of slaves , of those of our fellow-citizens , who inhabit states where slavery is still permitted . Exempted as we are from the great moral and political evil entailed on them , we regard their condition , more in sorroW than in anger . The question whether slavery shall continue in those states , or whether it shall in any way be modified or limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those states respectively ; and whatever may be our wishes and our lloj ) es upon the subject , we expressly disclaim any legal or constitutional authority on the part of any other state or of the United States , to interfere in any arrangements respecting slavery , which those states respectively may think fit to adopt . We readily and cheerfully admit , and in making this admission we think we may include all those who on general grounds are opposed to slavery , that each state , where slavery is not expressly prohibited , his a perfect right to regulate this subject at it // pleasure . If this sentiment is unive*'sal , as we firmly belici 's it is , why should . a manly and liberal discussion of the vari* oundelicate topics connected with the subject of slavery , be viewed with suspicion and jealousy . We feel no hostility , we utter no reproach . But We do feel an intense interest in the rights of humanity , in the secure and permanent estabIish* ment of the acknowledged principles of natural , civil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of our common country , and more especially in the happitiess of every member of the great federal family . So intimately are all the states of the national union connected , that the peace , strength , and glory of the whole , essentially depend upon the safety and prosperity of each . Considering as we do , the original act of depriving a free person of his liberty and reducing him to slavery , under whatever pretence , except as a punishment ' for *n ofThnce of which he may have been convicte*d by a competent tribunal , absolutely and of itself unjustifiable and criminal , so as a general rule , we consider the act of holding such a person in slavery , to be a continuation of such criminality . No lapse of time , no continuance of abuse can cotivert wrong into right . No less is it unjustifiable in our view , to hold the innocent offspring of such slave in I ) erpetual slavery . What is slavery ? Usage and habit throw a sort of illusion abtut objects , and reconcile us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an effort to dispel this enchant . ' nient , let us pause and seriously ask ourselves what is neces* sarily the character and condition of a slave , what are his rights , his hopes , and his prospects . Can he regulate his own actions , can he pursue those occupations for which nature has fitted him , or to which genius or inclination may lead him ? Can lie enjoy the fruits of his own labour , can he provide for the wants of himself or his offspring ? Is he not driven to severe and incessant labour by the ' terror of the whip ? Is not his mind in a state of degradation and bondage , more deplo* rable even than that of his body ? Is he not deprived of the means of cultivating his mental powers , of enlightening his understanding , of improving his affections ? Is he not utterly incapable of - raising his mind to the source of intelligence , his heart to the fountain of good , of acquiring the principles , learning the promises , practising the duties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the knowl. // edge and hopes of a future and more blessed state of existence , which crime and misery can never reach ? Has he not before him the prospect of his otfspring being destined to a condilion as wretched and as hopeless as his own ? * Without taking into consideration the incalculable evils which slavery inflicts on society , we may venture to pronounce upon this single view of the case , that it is utterly irreconcilable with any notion of natural justice , that one set of men may thus rob another of all the rights , arid blessings* *f this life , and even of the knowledge and hopes of another . We think therefore we are justified by reason and conscience , in stating the general rule , that it is wrong for one set of men to hold another in slavery . This rule however has its exceptions . Self , defence is. the first law of nature , as well to communities as to individuals . In states where slavery has long continued and extensively prevailed , a sudden , violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils than the continuance of slavery . It would shake if not subvert the foundations of society . It would be at once the cause of misery to the slaves , and of ruin to the community . The principles of self-defence therefore , and powerful considerations of national safety , constituting a case of political and moral necessity , require at least the temporary continuance of this great evil . When a choice of evils is the only alternative , it is the part of duty as well as of wisdom to choose the least . But let it not be forgotten , that a practice wrong itself , yet justified by necessity , must be limited by that necessity . We hold it therefore to be the duty of those who influence public opinion , and of those who exercise any authority in states where slavery exists , to do all in their power to ameliorate the cOJiI ( lition , and limit and diminish the number of slaves , and to provide for their liberation as speedily and as extensi'vely as the safety of their several states will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that the evils of slavery do not end with the wrongs and wretchedness of the unhappy subject . Society suffers , froni* slavery , a suCcession of evils , scarcely less than those it inflicts . And we take it now to be generally agreed by intel.r ligent statesmen , that the honour and the practice of holding slaves , so far from being regarded as a privilege to be valued , is rather to be considered as an evil to be deplored . A state // whose laws and institutions recognise and habitually cherish a disregard to the fundamental 1 ) f'iricil ) les of natural right and social duty , can not be founded Uj ) OII a safe and stable basis . It possesses within itself sources of corruption , weakness , and degeneracy , which must endanger its safety and finally accelerate its*ruin . The employment of slaves has an obvious tendency to banish that steady , ' cheerful , and active industry , which is among the chief causes of national wealth arid strength . It discourages the healthful pursuits of agriculture , the ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active occupations , which give vigorous exercise to the body , salutary occupation to the mind , and which would ensure comfort , affluence , and independence to freemen . We forbear to urge the contaminating influence of slavery , upon the mind and passions , both of master and slave . It is sufficient , in considering it with reference to the influence which it exerts upon the strength* glory , and happiness of a political community , to find that it is calculated at once to diminish immeasurably the number of those who have hearts to love , and of those who have arms to defend their country . We think theretiwe that we do not state the proposition too strongly , when we assert that the wisest statesmen , and the most sagacious politicians , in those of the United States , where slavery is established , are perfectly satisfied that it is a great evil in their institutions , and are sincerely desirous of e6rrecting it . We shall not , of course , be accused of the extreme weakness of including in this description , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tears , and sulferings of slaves , , and who are incapable of extending their minds beyond a mere profit and loss comparison , of so much cost *nd wear and tear of slave.flesh on the one side , and the value of so much sugar , and rice and cotton on the other . We speak of men of powerful and commanding minds , of long and comprehensive views . The declarations of many such men , full of experience upon the subject of slavery in all its hearings upon th' iiderests of society , have been frank , and explicit . According to them , slavery is an evil of great magnitude to be endured only until it can be safely removed . To the sincerity of these declarations we yield our entire confidence . We should believe such men to be sincere , because we know them to be men of the highest integrity and observa // tion of character . But our belief rests upon still stronger grounds . We are satisfied that *o able and enlightened statesman , of sound princi ) les and sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *vitbout coming to the same conclusion , without in fact being thoroughly convinced that sound maxims of political expediency concur with the stronger dictates of reason , humanity , and justice , in condemning the l ) ractice of slavery . Deeply impressed with the importance of these considera* tions to the reputation and prosperity of the United States , and gratified with the belief that they are extensively , if not generally felt among leading men in the slave-holding states , we have marked with the liveliest interest the progress of various measures proposed and adopted , to affect the amelioration , and provide for the safe and gradual abolition of slavery . M*iny laws have been passed , both by Congress and the several states , tending to the same tiesirable end . Several states , where slavery partially prevailed , have provided by law for a gradual emancipation . We shall have occasion to consider hereafter , the several enactments of Congress on the sub ect . In addition to these , many voluntary associations have been formed , patronized and supported by individuals of the highest standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be highly interesting to pursue the consideration of these measures , to discuss their extent , efficacy , and practicability9 to consider whether any causes are now in operation , or any means may be devised , within the power of legislative bodies or of individuals , which will justify a reasonable hope that our country may ever be rescued from the dangers , and purifled from the contamination of slavery . At present , however , we must waive this discussion , for the purpose of considering more particularly that branch of the general subject , which is brought before the public , in the very important publication of Mr. King* announced at the head of this article . Of this work and the very momentous questions which it presents to the government and people of the United States , we shall now proceed to give some account . It is scarcely necessary for us to enlarge upon the profound talents , the long experience , and elevated character of Mr. King . Probably no man , still remaining in public life , is more thoroughly acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversant with the policy of the national government , fr ' , ni its establishment to the present time . Having contributed essentially to the establishment of that government , he has participated largely in its administration . He has filled many of its highest ofliceS , with equal honour to himself , and benefit to the union . It would be foreign from our prescribed course to disturb this inquiry , by stopping to consider the causes which have prevented his elevation to the highest . Upon a great and interesting question of national policy , we naturally and justly repose with confidence upon the judgment and experience of such a man , and we justly feel the conclusions drawn hy our minds , from general reasonings , greatly strengthened by the support of so powerful an authority . This pamphlet contains the substance of Mr. King 's speeches in the Senate of the United States , at the last session of Congress , or the bill for erecting the territory of Missouri into a state , and admitting it into the Union . It does not profess to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in which they wert delivered ; but contains a condensed view of the subject , embracing not merely the observations and remarks then made , but also Mr. King 's present opinions on this important subject . ' The precise question which excited so *varm and animated a debate in both houses of Congress and w hich has subsequently excited so high an interest in every part of the United States , was , whether the following provision should be embraced in the bill just mentioned ; - provided , that the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude , be prohibited , except for the punishment of crimes , whereof the party shall have been duly convicted ; and that all the children born within the said state , after the admission thereof into the Union , shall be free at the age of twenty five years . ' A slight examination of this qualified restriction of slaveryin the proposed new state , will show that it stands entirely free from some plausible objections , which might have been urged against it in other circumstances . The territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Louisiana , acquired by purchase , composed no part of any one of the United States , at the time of their union , and therefore can in no degree be affected by any of the terms of the express or implied contract formed between them by that Union . It is also obvious to remark , that inasmuch as the clause in question was // intended to prevent only the further introduction oC slavery , it could in no degree impair the rights of property iii slaves , already vested in the inhabitaiits of that territory . Judging from the previous views and measures of the general government , in similar and analogous cases , it could hardly have been conjectured , that the result of a proposal of such a limited and qualified restriction would be doubtful . The proceedings of the last Congress upon the subject , however , are well known . The house of Representatives , after a short but animated debate , refused to pass the bill without the restriction ; the Senate refused to pass the bill with it , conse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still continues tinder her former territorial government . Such , indeed , was the rapidity with which the several * ) roceedings passed in the two houses of Congress , that it was scarcely known beyond its walls , that such a question was agitated , before it was decid. od . When , however , it came to be generally known , what principles had . been advanced , what votes had been taken , with what ardor and vehemence the advocates of slavery had urged their demands , not merely upon the justice , the reason , and good sense of Congress , but upon their interests , their prejudices , and their fears , by how slender a majority a meastire had been checked , which , in the estimation of many of the best friends of American liberty , would have been productive of incalculable and interminable mischiefs , it excited a feeling of universal surprise and alarm . Those who had hardly believed , that principles were in operation , and measures in contemplation and in progress , which would slowly and silently diminish , restrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they had escaped , and barely escaped , some great national calamity , which had threatened to overwhelm them , and that while they were altogether unconscious of its presence or its approach . They felt rejoiced , indeed , that they had for a time escaped it , and , although well aware that it might , and no doubt would again recur , it was some consolation to know that time would be gained , that they would have opportunity to estimate the nature and extent of their change , and to adopt such means as might be in their power to guard against it . What reason , it may be asked , had any body to presume , that Congress would interpose its authority to prevent the further introdnction of slavery into Missouri , and why should // Jane any body be surprised , hsid they thought proper to establish the state of Missouri without any such prohibition ? This question we shall endeavour to answer . Without urging the argument from general principles , which we have slightly touched in the former part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and undeviating course of policy of the national government , to prevent the increase of slavery , so far as it possessed the practical means and constitutional powers , that such has been the steady course of measures , from the first formation of the Union to the present time , and that a recurrence to its legislative measures will demonstrate the truth of this proposition . Congress , indeed . have never attempted to interfere in the local arrangements of the several states upon this subject ; they have been too sensible of their duty and the limits of their constitutional powers to make such an attempt . They have never claimed , nor have the strongest opponents of slavery ever claimed for them , any power upon this subject . The ab sence of all legislative measures of this kind , therefore , whilst it fails to shew that Congress have ever been inclined to encourage or extend slavery , ought , we think , to remove all reasonable ground of apprehension , on the part of the slaveholding states . But it may again be asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-being of civil society , why was this Union formed , why did the other states consent to it , without giving Congress powers on the subject ? This question is satisfactorily answered by Mr. King . The question respecting slavery in the old thirteen states had been decided and settled before the adoption of the constitution , which grants no power to Congress to interfere with , or to change what had been so previously settled  --  the slave-states therefore are free to continue or abolish slavery . ' p. 7 . Prior to the revolution , the several provinces had been entirely independent of each other , making their own laws and managing their own concerns , subject only to the sovereignty of the parent country . When this sovereignty was thrown off , it is obvious that the states were powers perfectly sovereign and independent , and as such were free to enter into partial compacts with each other , or with other powers , or to form a general confederacy , and to regulate the terms of such compacts in any which inclination or interest might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great // objects of solicitude , and to secure them most effectually , a general confederacy , in which all should heartily join , was the obvious dictate of sound policy . Join or die was the niax* im , of which all felt the force . In this state of things it would have certainly been unfriendly and probably unavailing to have asked of any one state a relinquishment of so essential a portion of sovereignty . The articles of confederation were formed and agreed to , therefore , upon the basis of allowing to each state , exclusivejurisdiction of all its local concerns , and giving to Congress a general superintendence of the common interests . This satisfactorily accounts for the fact , that all the states were *villing to enter into the confederation , for general defence and protection , without requiring of each other any relinquishment of local jurisdiction . So far , ho*vev'er , as Congress have l ) O*VCP on this subject , . even before the adoption of the present constitution , they manifested an earnest desire , and adopted the most efficient measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil as slavery in the liJuited States . Congress could not legislate for the several states , but as soon as the United States acquit ' - ed exclusive jurisdiction over a portion of country , they seiz* ed the earliest opportunity to exclude slavery from their donu nions . Having stated that Massachusetts , Connecticut , iNe'v York , and Virginia had ceded to the United States their respective claims to the territory lying north-west of the river Ohio , Mr. King proceeds to narrate the measures adopted by Congress for settling and governing it . This cession was made on the express condition . that the ceded territory should be sold for the common benefit of the United States ; that it should be laid out into states , and that the states so laid out should form distinct republican states , and be admitted as members of the federal union , having the same rights of sove* reignty , freedom , and independence as the other states . Of the four states which made this cession , two permitted and the other two * ) rOhjbited slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the extensive territory north-west of the river Ohio , although the confederation contained no express provision upon the subject , Congress , the only representatives of the United States , assumed , as incident to their office , the power to dispose of this territory and for this purpose , to divide the same into distinct states , to provi ( le for the temporary *ovet'nment of the inhabitants thcreof* // and for their ultimate admission as new states into the federal Union . The ordinance for these purposes , which was passed by Congress in 1787 , contains certain articles , which are called " Articles of compact between the original states and the people and states within the said territory , for ever to remain unalterable unles by common consent . " The sixth of those unalterable articles provides , " that there shall be nejther slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory . " The constitution of the United States supplies the defect that existed in the articles of confederation , and has vested Congress , as has been stat*d , with ample powers on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the old Congress , was ratified and confirmed by an act of the new Congress during their first session under the constitution . The state of Virginia , which ceded to the United States her claims to this territory* consented by her delegates in the old Congress to this ordinance-not only Virginia , but North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , by the unanimous votes of their delegates in the old Congress* approved of the ordinance of 1 787 , by which slavery is for ever abolished in the territory north-west of the river Ohio . Without the votes of thesestates , the ordinance could not have passed ; and there is no recollection of an opposition from any of these states to the act of confirmation , passed under the actual constitution . Slavery had long been established in these states. - the evil was felt in their institutions , laws , and habits , and could not easily or at once be abolished . But these votes , so honourable to these states , satisfactorily demonstrate their unwillingness to permit the extension of slavery into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . The states of Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , on the north-west of the river Ohio , have been admitted by Congress into the Union , on the condition and conformably to the article of compact , contained in the ordinance of 1787 , and by which it is declared that thore shall be neither slavery nor involuntay servitude in any of the said states . ' p. 8. - lO . At the time when this ordinance was formed under the old confederation , and ratified immediately after the adoption of the *onstitut.ion , the subject was not affected by any idea of compact , but the measure was adopted upon general considerations of fitness and expedieucy . So when the same territory came to be erected into states , Congress might , with the cQnsent of the new states , respectively , have annulled the // prohibition . Parties competent to contract engagements may by mutual consent rescind them . The case then is a strong illustration of the views of the general government on the subject of slavery . The cases in which states have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impair the authority of the cases of Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois . Vermont had adopted her constitution before being admitted ; arid that constitution excluded slavery , and the *hoIe tenor of her laws , and character of her institutions form . ed an ample security against its introduction . All express prohibition therefore would have been nugatory . The case of Louisiana , when erected into a state , atands upon grounds somewhat different . The bounds of that state embrace New Orleans and the territory adjacent thereto , in which slavery had been permitted both by France arid Spain from its first settlement , to the time of its cession to the United States , and in which the number of slaves nearly equalled the number of white inhabitants . It was therefore undoubtedly regarded as one of those cases of imperious necessity to which all other considerations must yield . With regard to the other four states , all of which have been formed out of territory , formerly composing a part of the old thirteen states , the following statement of Mr. King is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled by Virginia , and the inhabitants of Kentucky equally with those of Virginia , by fair interpretation of the constitution , were exempt from all such interference of congress , as might disturb or impair the security of their property in slaves . The western territory of North Carolina and Georgia having been partially granted and settled under the authority of these states before the cession thereof to the United States , and these states being original parties to the constitution which recognises the existence of slavery , no measure restraining slavery could be applied by congress to this territory . But to remove all doubt on this head , it was made a condition of the cession of this territory to the United States , that the ordinance of 1787 , except the sixth article thereof4 respecting slavery , should be applied to the same ; and that the sixth article should not be so applied . Accordingly the states of Tennessee , Mississippi , and Alabama , comprehending the territory ceded to the United States by Nort. ? arolina and Georgia , have been admitted as new states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery shall be excluded from the same . ' pp. k04 1 1 . // With regard therefore to the cases of Tennessee , Mississippi , and Alabama , the faith of Congress was expressly pledged not to insist on the prohibition of slavery , by the condition of the grants of North Carolina and Georgia . This condition , while it is binding on Congress , and should unquestionably*be executed in l ) erlect good faiTh , shews manifestly the sense which those states entertained of the disposition and views of the general government . One other remark occurs to us upon all these cases , including that of Kentucky , which will entirely justify the proceedings of Congress , without imputing to it any design to encourage or tolerate the extension of slavery* The constitution of the United States having expressly provided that no new state shall be formed out of territory composing part of another state , without the express consent of the latter , it will always be in the power of the 01 ( 1 state 4o annex to its consent , a condition that slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is undoubtedly a question of expediency with Congress , whether a new state shall be admitted , on such condition . Should they refuse however , no substantial acquisition is gained to the cause of liberty , humanity , and safety , because the whole territory of such state being already subjected to the evil of slavery , the evil would be the same , whether the whole should continue to compose one state , or be divided into several . The statement of this course of measures , with regard to the admission of new states into the Union , shews the strong disposition and steady determination of Congress to l ) revent , by all the means in their power , the further extension of the great evil of slavery . But the proof of this point does not stop here . The eonstitution provides , art . 1 . 9 , the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing , shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress , prior to the year 1808 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strikingly manifests the views , which the convention entertained with regard to the general dispositions and probable course of measures of the United States . Congress is authorised by that instrun*nt to regulate foreign commerce , and commerce among the several states . It was therefore at once perceived that Congress would have the power to prohibit the importation gf slaves // from abroad , and also the traffic in slaves between the several states . That they would have a disposition to exercise it , at least with regard to the importation , nobody could doubt . The nefarious traffic to the coast of Africa , involving innumerable crimes of murder and kidnapping , the indiscribable horrors of the middle passage , the wanton waste of life , and contempt of natural rights , which attended every step of its progress , was universally regarded in the United States , with utter detestation . The ordinance of 1787 had already beea passed by the old Congress prohibiting slavery within their own domains , all had joined in the declaration of Iridependeuce , and most of the states had adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the support of the true principles of natural rights and civil liberty . The views of Congress therefore , under the new constitution could not he doubtful . Hence , those who determined to share a little longer in the profits of this odious traffic , insisted on an indulgence for twenty years ; and as the other states had no means of compelling them to assent to the adoption of the constitution upon better terms , they reluctantly yielded their consent to this condition . Congress adhered to this condition with good faith . But they fitithfully executed all the powers placed in their hands by the constitution . They early passed laws to prohibit the citizens of the United States from engaging or shariug in the slave* trade from one foreign place to another , and seized the first opportunity allowed them by the constitution to prohibit the importation of slaves into the United States , by enacting laws for that purpose to take effect on the 1st of January 1808 . Various regulations have been made to meet and prevent all the subsidiary arts , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enforced by severe , we wish we could add effectual penalties . The United States therefore , have not , as yet , been charge* able with the crime and disgrace of having willingly encouraged or countenanced the extension of slavery . On the comitrary , this review of their measures will justify us in the assertion that hitherto the United States have maintained a steady and uniform course of policy adverse to the extension of slavery . And it was as little to be expected on the occasion of passing the Missouri Bill , that Congress would forego so favourable an opportunity to prevent the further introduction of slavery , // as it would have been , that they should have suddenly passed a bill at the close of the session , to repeal the prohibition of the slave-trade . Can any reasons , we will not say solid or satisfactory rea sons , but can any plausible reasons be assigned , why Congress should now depart from a settled course of measures , which they have hitherto thought wise and expedient , founded in the principles of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to secure the safety and promote the happiness of their constituents , and of the unborn millions for whom they are legislating ? We confess we can discover none . On the contrary , it appears manifest to us , that all the conclusions drawn from general reasonings , apply with increased force to the case of Missouri . It is immaterial for the purposes of this inquiry , what are the precise limits assigned to the proposed state . It is perfectly certain that the decision of this question in the case of Missouri , is a decision of the question with regard to all the states which may be erected in the vast regions west of the Mississippi . * o possible reason can be imagined applicable to this case , which would not equally apply to them . It tasks the imagination to conceive of the numbers which this extensive territory , equal to the whole of the United States , is capable of supporting , when fully peopled and cultivated . That it will be fully peopled , at no very distant period of time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement are as operative and immutable , as the laws of nature and the progress of the heavenly bodies . It is an appalling consideration therefore , to those who are called on to ( lecide this question , that upon their decision will be fixed , immutably fl'ed , the destinies of innumerable millions of human beings , in all coming time . We do not say that considerations of this nature should alter and change the judgments of men ; but we think that they should lead them to pause upon their decisions , to retrace and re-examine the grounds of their conclusions , to be well assured of the soundness and justice of their views , to take counsel of their hearts , to be quite certain that they are not swayed by passion , influenced iy interest , or blinded by prejudice , and then to give such a decision as they can justify to themselves at the hour , when conscience shall sit in judgment on their lives . Seldom indeed was a legislative body ever called on to act upon so impor // taut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and interests of minor importance , and operate within comparatively narrow limits . This is to operate on a vast extent of country , to affect the condition of millions , aNd to determine whether they shall enjoy the most essential rights , which their creator has bestowed on them , or lie doomed to perpetual slavery . Ordinarily , if laws are found to be useless or pernicious , they may be amended or repealed ; this xviii be a fundamental law , which when once made can not be altered . On a question of such magnitude , we should think all men would act correctly , who act intelligently , and when so great an amount of happiness or misery is depending , we must believe that reason and conscience will triumph over all the pleadings of self-interest . Let us then take a short comparative view of the future situation of these new states , with and without slavery . In the one case , we behold a 1 rge , industrious , and happy people , cultivating their own soil , with their own han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of their property and liberty , el*joying the means and institutions of education , blessed with all the useful and liberal arts , exercising their political rights with freedom and intelligence , cultivating sound learning , good morals and pure religion , devotedly attached to the government from which they derive their protection , and ready to shed their best blood for the defence of their country , whenever it may need their aid . In the other , we see the same country cultivated and peopled indeed , but by two distinct races of men , differing as widely in character and condition as in color . None of the useful labours of society are performed with skill , dispatch , or cheerfulness , because freemen regard labour as disgraceful , and slaves shrink from it as an intolerable burthen . Slaves , from the very necessity of their condition , from the natural operation of the laws of the human mind , of which physical force may control the condition , but can not change the nature , can feel no sympathy with the society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no attachment to a government , at whose hands they receive nothing but injustice . There must necessarily be a perpetual struggle for deliverance on the one side , and constant apprehensions of violence on the other . What renders this state of things the more // wretched and deplorable is , that the great body of labourers of all descriptions being of the class of slaves , the real and actual l ) hYsical force of the community , is in the hands of those who are ever seeking occasions to use it for the purpose of insurrection. it is easy to perceive that in such a stale of society , there must be a great amount of misery and discontent , in the class of slaves , and little of security , contentment , and peace in the more favoured ranks of freemen . What is the object of admitting new states into the Union ? Not surely the mere increase of numbers , without regard to character and quality . IS it not to extend the principles of free government , to multiply the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly attached to their country , and able and willing to defend it ? Is it not inshort to extend and increase that national strength , on which we all depend for the security and protection of our rights . The question then recurs , are these objects promoted by admitting these st*ates into the Union , with the permission to people their territories with slaves ? To the question with regard to the relative prospect of happiness we shall not re ( ur . But the question , so far as it respects the moral , political , and military strength and security of these remote and numerous states , is one of great interest and magnitude , not only to The states themselves , but to the Union , into which they claim to he admitted with equal rights and privileges . When admitted , it is manifest that they will have a just right to claim of the national government , protection , not only from insurrection , but from the invasion of all foreign powers . These states must always be far removed from the centre and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes of which we hardly know the names , the numbers , or the character , and contiguous to the only great foreign powers , with whom we can come into territorial contact , or with whom we may justly fear hostilities ; we mean Great Britain , Spain , perhaps Russia . If these states are covered With a hardy , bold and enlightened race of men , having an interest in the soil , capable of hearing arms , and with whom arms may be safely entrusted , a very little aid from the national government will enable them successfully to defend themselves . If on the contrary , they are filled with discontented slaves , always thirsting for liberation , and eager for revenge , , always ready to join the standard of a hostile invader , or to // follow the fortunes of a desperate leader on the first signal of danger from within or without , the whole force of the country , which may be depended on , is not only paralized , but overwhelmed . Much time must elapse before sufficient aid can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be defended at an enormous and ruinous expense of lives and of treasure . Is it then proper , is it reasonable or just , that the people inhabiting1 these territories , should now clamorously demand an admission into the Union , a participation in all the rights and privileges of the Union , a share even in the national treasury , without placing themselves in a condition , in which alone they will be safe and useful members of that Union , in which alone they can add strength and security to an exposed and remote frontier . Can it be equitable , is it consistent with the plain rules of fair dealing , to require the United States to enter into a perpetual compact in which all the benefit is on one side , and all the burthens upon the other . We have no occasion to resort to distant times or remote countries , to learn the weakness and misery , the distracted and hopeless condition of a society composed of separate casts and mixed colors , among the members of which there is no feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and affection . We need only allude to the present state of the Spanish provinces , to place the subject in the strongest point of view . More sanguinary acts than those which have desolated many of those fine countries , for the last ten years , never disgraced humanity . And yet probably more blood has been shed and more devastation been caused by the mutual and bitter contests of rival parties , than by direct hostilities between them and the parent country . Sanguine persons among us likening their contest to our own , have been hoping and expecting year after year , that stable and efficient governments would soon be established to support their independence , ensure freedom , and maintain order and tranquility . These hopes have been as constantly disappointed . Faction has succeeded to faction , each as boisterous , as sanguinary , and as transient , as the one which preceded it . The principal cause , it appears to us , may be clearly traced to the marked distinction of ranks and colours . Europeans , Creoles , Indians , and Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the circumstances of their condition to regard each other with jealousy and aversion . // Among the individuals of a society thus composed , no feeling of respect , no permanent union of strength for common defence and support can exist . Though necessarily brought cotitinnally into contact , they can not coalesce . rilbey are separated by impassible barriers , by mutual and long cherished feelings of con*empt , detestation , and revenge . If harmony and strength are desirable objects in the formation of new and extensive states , reason and example concur in believing , that they must be formed by a free and unmingled race of men . If Missouri , and other states beyond the Mississippi are admitted into the Union , without the proposed restriction , a new and ext*sive market will be opened , affording an encouragement to the foreign slave-trade , with all its train of abuses , which no laws however severe , no administration however vigilant , can counteract . The clandestine trade is well known to be infinitely more cruel and barbarous , than that alioWe ( l by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and qualified . But the unprincipled and desperate smoggier , violating at the same time the laws of his country and of his conscience , is governed by no consideration but that of gain . The most obvious and effectual mode of breaking up the trade , is to cut off the demand for slaves . If this vast and remote country is once opened for their admission , it requires no extraordinary foresight to perceive , that the numberless ports , inlets , and bayous of Louisiana and the gulf of Mexico , unsettled arid unfrequented , will aff rd admission and shelter to the smugglers of slaves ; and which may thence be transported to tue promised land , without danger or interruption . Respecting the duty , the importance , and the ( lifficulty of breaking up the present clandestine trade , we regret that our limits will permit us to cite but a single passage from the eloquent and impressive charge of Judge Story . We eariiestly recommend the whole of this able and well timed production to the attention of our readers , as a faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear exposition of our duty as men , as citizens , and as christians , to oppose and destroy it . Having given an abstract of the numerous laws of the United States intended to punish and prevent the slave-trade and every branch and portion of it , the Hon. Judgo proceeds , thus , // Under such circumstances it might well be supposed that the slave-trade would in practice be extinguished ; - that virtuous inert would by their abhorrence stay its polluted march , and wicked men would be overawed by its potent punishment . But unfortunately the case is far otherwise . We have but too many melancholy proofs from unquestionable sources , that it is still carried on with all the implacable ferocity and insatiable rapacity of former times . Avarice has grown more subtle in its evasions ; and watches and seizes its prey with an appetite quickened rather than suppressed by its guilty vigils . American citizens are steeped *p to their very mouths ( 1 scarcely use too bold a figure ) in this stream of iniquity . They throng to the coasts of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling abroad " their cargoes of despair , " and sometimes bringing them into some of our southern ports , and there , under the firms of the law , defeating the purposes of the law itself , and legalizing their inhu* man but profitable adventures . ' p. 5 . There is another series Gf considerations of momentous weight in this question . The constitution permits three-fifths of the slaves to be counted in ascertaining the numbers by which representativ&amp; are to be apportioned and taxes assessed . The argurne ut * I%t the admission of slavery in the new states , arising from this rule , is fully displayed by Mr. King ; and the historical details connected with it , shewing the probable grounds upon which the rule itself was founded , are ariong the most valuable portions of Mr. King 's pamphlet . By this rule , a disproportionate power is granted to the states possessing slaves . Although , if the state of our internal taxation for the time to come is to resemble its state for the time past , the history of contracts could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceded for a consideration so nugatory , still this power is secured by the constitution , and the other states have no disposition to abridge it . But , ' says Mr. King , the extension of this dispropwti ; riate power to the new states *voidd be unjust and odious . ' Upon this l ) oint , and indeed upon every essential point , all the old states , it appears to us have a common interest . If the increase of power to Virginia , for instance , arising from the partial enumeration of slaves , is to be regarded as a privilege , is not that privilege proportionably diminished by exte*iding it to new states ? If Missouri is to become a burthen upon the Union must not Virginia bear her proportion of it ? We can not sufficiently // lament that in the proceedings in Congress , this point Was so hastily overlooked . We lament it , because we think this omission gave the subject an aspect which it ought not to wear , and seemed to make it a question between states , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from states where slavery is allowed , permitted their jealousies to get the start of their judgment ; and that they concluded , without sufficient ground , that an attempt to prohibit the introduction of slavery , into the new states , was an encroachment on their rights , We are firmly persuaded , however , that a free and impartial view of the subject will show that such apprehensions were unfounded , that the question is not one of local interest , and therefore ought not to awaken local jealousies . It was our intention , if our limits would permit , to have examined at some length a few of the objections , urged against the proposed restriction . One is , that the evils of slavery will be diminished by enlarging the sphere of its operation . This suggestion , we think , must have occurred in the heat of debate , and been thro*vn out with little examination . It reminds us of the original justification of the slave trade , on the ground that the condition of the negro is bettered by being transferred from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another is , that though slaves may be dispersed , their numbers will not thereby be increased. - The adaptation of the supply to the demand ; the necessary increase of population , black or white , it matters not , in proportion to the increase of the means of subsistence , though axioms in political economy as unquestionable as those of the mathematics , appear to have been x*hoIly overlooked by some of the advocates of the unlimited extension of slavery . A more serious objection is supposed to arise from the terms of the treaty between France and the United States , by which the province of Louisiana was ceded . If the United States have bound themselves by any stipulations upon this subject , however unwise , let them perform their engagements with good faith . But we are quite certain that the stipulation in question will bear no such construction . This article provides , " That the inhabitants of the territory shall be incorporated into the union of the United States , and admitted as soonas possible , according to the principles of the federal constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and immunities of citizens of the United States ; and in the mean time , they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty , property , and the religion which they profess. " ' p. 14 . All contracts should be construed according to the meaning and intent of the parties ; and this rule is peculiarly applicable to treaties , which embrace great interests , and which are not usually drawn with literal and technical precision . In ascertaining the intent and meaning , and consequently the true construction of a compact , it is of importance to consider who are the parties , and what are the objects of such contract . rrhe parties were France and the United States , and the articl7e is an engagement of the latter to the former , in favour of the inhabitants ' ofthe ceded territory . By necessary construction , if notliteral interpretation , this comprehends those persons o*ily , who were inhabitants at the time of the cession . It is idle to suppose that France would make stipulations in favour of the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she would have . any interest , or feel any solicitude res* pecting the future inhabitants , who should be placed there at the will , and under the authority of the United States . But the existing inhabitants were her subjects . To them she owed the duty of protection in the enjoyment of their liberty , property , and religion , a duty , from the discharge of which she was about to withdraw herself . It was therefore just and proper to require the United States , who were about to succeed her in the rights of sovereignty , to discharge the same duty . Supposing slaves to be intended under the general term , property , and supposing any of those inhabitants still to remain , and to hold slaves , the proposed restriction will not affi*ct hem , and therefore will not be repugnant to the treaty . Bit it may be said that the right to acquire slaves is intended by the treats , either as a rig ! *t of property , or as one of the rights of citizens of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire slaves , as distinguished from a right of proPerty in slaves already vested , is embraced under any general notion of rights of property or civil rights . Still less can a right to acquire slaves be recognized as a right of citizens of the United States . it is a privilege created or power allowed by local laws in particular states , and can not extend beyond them . It is manifest that the constitution and laws // of the United States grant no such right . This is proved beyond doubt by the acts establishing the states north-west of the Ohio . It was stipulated by the express condition of the grant of that territory , that it should be fc*rmed into states , and be admitted into the Union , **ith the same rights of freedom , sovereignty , and in(leI)endence , as the other states . ' They were so admitted conformably to this stipulation , yet on the express condition that slavery should be excluded . Nobody suggested that the stipulation had not been complied with , on the part of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the estimation of Congress , the prohibition of slavery in a state , or a provision , by which the power of acquiring slaves is annulled , is no breach of a compact stipulating that such state shall be maintained in the full enjoyment of its civil and political rights , and consequently , that the power of acquiring slaves is not recognized as a civil or political right . Shall a compact with France , afterwards made by the same government , have a different construction ? All compacts and tre4ies are to be carried into effect , agreeably to the meaning and intent of both parties . Let it ' be remembered that the executive , who negotiated and , the Senate , who ratified the treaty of Louisiana , had already concurred in an act , by which a construction had been put upon an engagement somewhat similar , in case of their own citizens . It is quite certain that neither the Executive nor Senate could have supposed that by the treaty in question , any such obligation could have been intended on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition on the part of a foreign power , and perhaps have given them a right , to interfere in the internal concerns and arrangements of the United States in regard to their own territory and their own citizens , which would have been repelled with indignation . But the article in question , whether we consider the particular terms or the obvious design of it , will admit no such construction ; and any attempt to force the proposed construction upon it , is an attempt to pervert it to a purpose , which was never in the contemplation of the parties . Still , however , if Congress has no constitutional power to restrain the further introduction of slavery into the new states , in the mode proposed , much and deeply as we deplore the evils of slavery , and earnestly as we have hoped that the present occasion might be taken to stop the further extension // 1820. of it , and confidently as we believe that the prohibition of slavery would contribute to the stability and prosperity of the states themselves , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to acknowledge that it ought not be done . We acknowledge , and we rejoice that the government of the United Statesis a government of limited*and enuinerated powers , and that any attempt to exceed those powers WoUI ( l be a dangerous encroachment on the rights of the states and the liberties of the people . We have no disposition , therefore , to urge Congress to take a sii*gle step beyond the clear and well defined limits of constitutional authority . But we think that they would dei*art as *videly from the direct path of their duty , by relinquishing or failing to execute the great powers entrusted to them , for the benefit of the whole people , for the common defence and general welfare , as they would by exceeding those powers . It is therefore quite as essential to ascertain the full extent , as it is to prescribe the exact limits of those powers . We are satisfied that an examination of the constitution , will lead to a firm conviction that the power in question is clear ly within the limits of constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property of the United States ; ' without laying great stress upon the authority given Congress to prevent the migration ' as well as the importation of slaves , after the year 1808 ; the following clauses in the constitution , contain a plain , express , and unqualified grant of power for this purpose ,  --  ' New states may he admitted by Congress into this Unioii ; but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state , nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned , as well as of Congress . ' - ' The Congress shall have po*vcr to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper , for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . ' The only limitation of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that intended to prevent the existing jurisdiction of states from being impaired , without their consent . In all other respects the * is large and nnqualifred , // made so no doubt with design , and with great fitness and propriety , because it was impossible for the constitution to foresee and provide for all the peculiar circumstances of each case which would require consideration ; these therefore have been very properly entrusted to Congress . The admission of a new state into the Union is , in effect , the formation of a new unkm , of a new I ) OlitiCal relation , of great importance , interest , and delicacy to both parties . The new state is admitted to a full participation in all the immunities and privileges of the Union , a voice in its legislation and government , an equal share in the lands , revenues , treasury , and public property of every description . The United States take upon themselves the duty of supporting and maintaining them in the enj*yment of these privileges , of affording them protection against insurrect ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extending to them the adnd istration of the federal judiciary , of performing to them all the duties , for which the general government was establislied over the old states . It never could be imagined that a new political relation would be created , out of which so many essential rIghts , duties , and obligations would arise , without some terms , conditions , and limitations , which would render such relation safe and beneficial for both parties . What then must be understood by the power of Congress to admit new states into the Union ? Not surely the mere ministerial act of receiving and registering the constitution of any collection of people , of whatever character , colour , or condition , who may happen to borderon the United States , or be embraced within its territorial limits by conquest or purchase . Should any collection of persons , amounting to thirty-five orforty thousand , happen to take a fancy to establish themselves at the Falls of the Missouri , the foot of the Rocky mountains , or the banks of the Columbia river , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , would contend that such persons would have a right to demand admission into the Union as a state , * ithout terms , or on their own terms . Congress must exercise its discretion and pass its judgment on all circumstances relative to the fitness and expediency of* admitting a new state , and determine on the whole , whether such proposed state is likely to be a useful member of the Union . The extent of its boundaries , its local position , its language , institutions , political character and condition* are // all to be weighed and considered . The increase of national strength and harmony are the great objects in admitting new states , and Congress would iii discharge the duties and exe* ejite the powers entrusted to them by the constitution , if they did not effectually provide for the security of these objects . Congress may admit new states , they may and must deliber* ate and decide the general question , whether such state shall he admitted ; and the power of deliberating and deciding on this question necessarily embraces the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may refuse as well as agree to admit . The admission of a new state may be regarded either as a Compact or as a grant . It is strictly and properly a com* pact , an argreement between parties capable of contracting , who know their respective rights , and who are free to enter into such compact or not , as their respective inclinations or interests may dictate . Either party may propose any rea sonable stipulation , which it may think necessary to its interest and security , to which the other may , or may not assent ; but if the other party chooses to assent , such provis .. ion becomes binding and obligatory , deriving its force , ' hike all contracts , from the mutual consent and agreement of the parties . It is urged that a stipulation like that in question , will diminish and impair the sovereign powers of the new state . But we can not perceive the force of this reasoning . May not any power , capable of contracting , enter into con* tracts which are binding and obligatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrain and control them ? If such contracting party happens to be a sovereign and independent power , do such obligation and restraint destroy or impair its sovereignty and independence ? Does any body imagine* that France and Spain are less sovereign and independent , because they have entered into compacts and treaties by which they- and their subjects are restrained from carrying on the slave trade within certain limits . Besides , the introduction of the term sovereignty is altogether gratuitous and unauthorized , an ( l serves only to embarrass instead of throwing light on the question . It is not intended that a new state is to be sovereign and independent , in any other sense , than that in which the other states are so To a certain extent , and with regard to certain objects they are sovereign . and in others they are controlled- by the // Jaii . Siwoery and the Missouri question . powers of the general government . The constitution merely authorizes Congress to admit new states without qualification . Those therefore who deny the constitutional power of Congress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining that the word state , by force of the term , embraces the power of introducing and continuing slavery9 and that if Missouri when admitted into the Union is pioioited fro&amp;n the exercise of this power , even by her own act , and *Tjf l* her own consent she may he a government , a dependency , a political community , but can not be a state . Tkose who argue so strongly against the danger of implied powers , are compelled to maintain , that the word state implies sovereignty , that sovereignty implies the power of permitting slavery without limit of time or place , and that those states , who are restained from the exercise of this power by their respective acts of admission on their own constitutions , are not states within the meaning of the constitution . Against such absurdities it is hardly possible seriouly to contend . We will add but a single rem ark , upon this point of soveeignty . If there is any one power more * ) ecuIially than any other an incident of sovereignty , it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction . Yet Congress have in many if not all instances , in* serted in the acts ad*nitting new states , prohibitions against taxing the lands of non-residents at higher rates than those of their own citizens . Similar provisions were certainly introduced in the act of Massachusetts , assenting to the separation of Maine , and must be adopted by Congress if that state is established . Yet in former instances , when such power of taxing has been restrained , no person ever questioned the power of Congress ; and we hope no one will q*iestion the sovereignty of the state of Maine upon similar grounds . It may perhaps place the subject in a little stronger light to consider it as a grant . The act of admitting a new state into the Union , is a grant on the l ) art of the United States , to the people of such new state , of *ery important powers and privileges* and even of valuable rights of property . The United States having a perfect right to make or withhold such grant , may make it upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grant is that of the power and privilege of forming and becoming a state ; and a prohibition of the further introduction of slavery is not // inconsistent with such grant , unless it can be shewn that under such prohibition it is impossible for the people of Mis .. souri to form and become a state . When made , it will be optional with the people of Missouri to accept or refuse . If they refuse it , the grant is of no effect , and the people still . remain under their territorial government ; in which case , the power of Congress is unquestionable . If they accept it , they take it subject to the condition and must be bound by it . In every point of view in which we have been able to view the subject , we think the consiitutional authority of Congress placed beyond all doubt . The power of assenting absolutely , necessarily implies that of assenting conditionally. rI*he power to enter into a compact , embraces the power of making ' any terms , stipulations , and conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of granting without restraint or limitation , necessarily comprehends the lesser power of granting the same thing with limitations . We think therefore , that we are completely justified in the position we have taken , that these two clauses in the constitution providing that Congress may admit new states into the Union , and authorizing them to make all laws necessary and proper fo into effect the powers vested in the general government , co*n a plain , adequate , and direct investment of Congress with the powers proposed to be exercised in the case of Missouri . We can not take our leave of the pamphlet of Mr. King , especially at a time when the important question considered in it is again before Congress , without expressing our profound and sincere regret that the seat in the Senate , which he has so long and so honourably filled , is now vacant . We can hardly think that the people of the powerful and enlight* cued state of New York * ill feel insensible to the honour of being represented by so accomplished a statesman . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any otlu*r state ; but we hope the people of New York will pardon us when they consider , that every state in the Union has an interest in the talents and services of an eminent and cx pe .. * rienced senator . The Senate of the United States is a body of great power , dignity , and importance , in which great talents are proportionably useful and conspicuous . We therefore earnestly hope that the legislature of New York , when the subject again comes before them , will magnanimously // relinquish all local attachments and resentments , connected with state politics , and with a single view to the general goQd , again place Mr. King in a situation wherelie is so eminently fitted to do honour to his own state , and promote the best interest of the Union . Meantime it is perhaps neeessary to correct ourselves , while we say , that the important question which we have been treating is again before Congress . Before the pages shall appear in l ) ul ) lic in which we have taken the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest against the extension of slavery over the continent of America , the sentence will perhaps have been passed , and the fate of millions of fellow men , it may he the tuture fortunes of this great republic will have been decided . When we think of these momentous consequences , we feel a solemnity of mind , before which all party questions , all the sophistry which lively talents can enlist in any cause , sink into the dust : and if it be not too late we would even now most earnestly implore heaven to send that same solemnity into the minds of all , *xhose voices are to settle this mighty question . It is with the most unaffected earnestness that we declare our opinion , that the day on which the Missouri question is decided in Congress , will he the most *til*y ii7**ory.
