MARY HOLLIS . AN ORIGINAL TALE . " I have been young , and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread . " NEW-YORK : PUBLISHED BY THE NEW-YORK UNITARIAN BOOK SOCIETY . PRINTED BY VAN PELT AND SPEAR . No. 95 Pearl-street. 1822 . Preliminaries Main text MARY HOLLIS . AN ORIGINAL TALE . MARY HOLLIS . Many persons , in the village of  --  , in Massachusetts , remember Mary Lowe , a diligent , ingenious little girl of a respectable family , who was left an orphan when quite young , with a very slender provision , which her guardians wisely expended , in obtaining for her a decent education and the tayloring trade . She went from house to house , eating her bread in singleness of heart . She was approved by the elderly and judicious , for her prudent , industrious , and quiet ways ; and she made herself the delight of all the children , by her obliging disposition and good humour . The little boys said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the older boys , who longed to be emancipated from the indignity of having their clothes made by a woman-taylor , were still conciliated by Mary 's gentle manners , and a little , too , by the smart look which she contrived to give to their apparel . I think I can see her now bending over her goose , and as it heavily trod the seams , singing some playful song to the little group around her ; and smiling and blushing as she caught the approving glances of the elders of the family . But poor Mary was not destined to glide down the stream of life , without experience of the storms that ruffle its current . She married William Hollis , and was , by a series of misfortunes , reduced from comfortable circumstances to penury . There was nothing extraordinary in her case . Every one has occasion to notice the swift destruction that comes upon a family , when the husband resigns himself to habits of intemperance . Intemperance leads , necessarily , to idleness . Health and strength disappear , and confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little difference , whether the unhappy slave of this vice has been accustomed to careful and diligent habits , or brought up to idleness ; whether born to fortune , or to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow . In one case the ruin may be nearer than in another , but in all cases , ruin is inevitable . It is not now my purpose to trace the steps of William Hollis , from the time when he was an industrious apprentice at the shoe-making trade . Who , that then saw him issue from his master 's dwelling on a Sunday morning , with the cheerful look of youth , the health and vigor of dawning manhood , neatly equipped for church , would have recognized him a few years after , returning from a tavern brawl on a Saturday night , to his much-enduring wife , and breaking on the quiet of his home , with the voice of cursing ! It was after one of those scenes of excess , which had , of late , become more frequent , that , with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own dwelling , he left his noisy companions . His house was at one extremity of the village , and , with a few other mean buildings around it , was usually occupied by its poorest inhabitants . A bye and narrow road led to it . William 's instinct had often guided him safely , but on this occasion he had drank more than usual , and after reeling on till he had nearly finished his way , the feeble ray of light that shot through the patched panes of his own window , caught his eyes , and to his cloudy vision , it seemed to dance from one side of the way to the other . He was cursing its uncertain aid , when he stumbled and fell senseless to the ground . The noise of his fall , accompanied by a loud groan , called one of his neighbours , Samuel Hill , to his assistance . Hill brought a lantern , and discovered that the poor creature was quite senseless . He had , in falling , hit his head against a large stone , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of a horseblock.  --  This compassionate neighbour called some others to his aid . They conveyed him in their arms to his wife . It was too common a circumstance for him to stay out late , to excite any alarm in her . She had closed the labours of the week , and by her neatness and exertion , given to her home the appearance of order and comfort , that betokens a preparation for the Lord 's day . Her eldest child , a girl of six years , was sitting on a little bench by the fire , reading aloud in the testament : two of the children were asleep in their bed , and a sick infant , lying in the arms of its mother , whose meek and care-worn countenance , as the light fell strongly upon it , from the bright flame of a pine knot , showed that her thoughts were divided between the troubles of this world , and the consolations of the word to which she was listening . At this moment the door opened , and disclosed to her neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They paused , for an instant , from a strong feeling of compassion and respect . The noise had called the attention of Mrs. Hollis .  --  Immediately she became pale as death , and uttered a deep groan ; then exerting a self-command , for which she was remarkable , she laid her sick baby beside her sleeping brothers , and telling the little girl to lay down beside her sister to keep her warm , she spread open her own bed , and asked the men to lay her husband in it . Alas ! this was not the first time he had been brought to her in a brutish condition . Mary had always avoided the sympathy of her neighbours : she had never been heard to speak of her husband 's vices , and some wondered , that Mary Hollis was so blind she could not see them . Others sneeringly observed , " there were none so blind as those that would not see . " But , when no eye saw , but His who pitieth all our sorrows , her tears flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be converted from the error of his ways , and that she might be sustained under the burthen of her sorrows . She was not like some , who , when they have prayed they may do their duty , are apt to think their duty is accomplished . Her prayers were used as the means of strength , and she felt , after communing with the Father of Spirits , that a ray of light marked the path of duty , through the day . William was the father of her children , and it was her incessant care to shield his faults from them . When he was sober , he was kind and affectionate to his children , and his wife , in the main ; and when he was intoxicated , Mary sought to remove his children from his sight . But , anxious as she was to hide the father 's vices , she never resorted to falsehood , for she knew she must not do evil that good might come . Her children were young and unsuspicious , therefore it was not difficult to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was saying , she should not need any further assistance , when as she drew the bed clothes over her husband , she saw that his pale face was stained with blood . " He is hurt ! " cried she . " To be sure he is , " said Hill , who had been hitherto awed into silence , by Mary 's unexpected calmness ; " and it is a wonder to me , if he comes to himself this night . Such a bruise as that , and on the temple too , is a pretty bad affair . " " Can one of you go for the Doctor , " said Mary in a trembling voice . Hill sent one of his companions , and dismissed the other , kindly offering himself to stay . He assisted Mary in applying such remedies as the house afforded , but they were without effect . The Doctor came . He examined the wound , and felt the patient 's pulse . " Nothing can be done , " said he . Poor Mary was , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she then exclaimed , " my poor husband ! could he but offer one prayer , could he but speak to me once more ! " She sunk on her knees by the side of the unhappy man . Little Sally , unaccustomed to see her mother in any agitation , uttered a shriek of terror . The infant , awakened by the confusion , moaned greviously , but Mary was insensible to every thing but the misery of her dying husband . She continued kneeling , holding William 's cold hand in hers , and pouring out her soul in prayers for him . In about an hour , his whole frame became convulsed , he rolled up his eyes , and extended his arms . It was the last struggle . Poor William closed his eyes forever , an early victim of intemperance . Tender mothers , faithful wives , solitary sufferers , may conceive of Mary 's misery . There were some who said " Mary Hollis professes to be a christian , and it does not become a christian to be so cast down . " Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , she could not mourn more . " But it was , precisely , because she was a christian , and , because her unhappy husband was not only , not the best , but was one for whom she must sorrow without hope , that she thus mourned  --  Mary dared not even hope , for her bible told her , " The drunkard hath not eternal life . " There was no good word of promise there , for the impenitent sinner . It was true , William had sometimes , after uncommon excess , and the suffering consequent thereupon , formed good resolutions and made solemn promises ; but perhaps the very next occasion of temptation would find him as weak and yielding as ever ; and Mary felt , that such penitence deepened the shade of his guilt . " Oh ! " she would say in the bitterness of her heart , " could any sinner look upon my wretched William and waste the precious hours of probation ! Oh ! that they could realize , that the destiny of ages depends upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sorrows , if she could have permitted them to prey on her mind ? The poor have a blessing in the necessity of labour , that outweighs many of the splendid favours , which they see , perhaps , with envy , in the scale of the rich . Mary had never lived to herself , and , for the first time in her life , this strong and overwhelming tide of grief bore away with resistless force , the claims of others , and made her forget , in the indulgence of her sorrow , the wants of the destitute little creatures around her . The day after the funeral of her husband , Mary was sitting in a stupor of grief from which she was roused , by the crying of one of the little boys . " Sally , " said she , " what does John cry for ? " " Mother , " replied the child , with a faultering voice , " John is hungry . The bread and meat Mr. Hill brought , was all finished yesterday , and we 've none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children , recalled the Mother to a sense of her duty . " Oh ! " said she , " I must feed these lambs , and with the help of God , I will feed them , with temporal and spiritual food . " She drew her children to her , and kneeling down , she dedicated herself and offspring to Him , who is the Husband of the widow , and the Father of the fatherless . " Her thoughts turned on her poor William , and for the first time , since the stroke had fallen on her , she heartily submitted to it , and was able to say with complete resignation , though not without agony . Thy will be done . ' She had laid her troubles at His feet , who careth for us , and in the service in which she was engaged , she found a peace which enabled her quietly to bear the yoke , that had seemed an intolerable burthen . She rose from her devotions , with her heart strengthened for duty . Any one , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her movements , must have thought she had heard the gracious words , Fear not , for I am with you . ' Immediate relief was necessary , and Mrs. Hollis had none of that pride , which sometimes makes people ashamed of their poverty , when it fails to impel them to those exertions which are necessary to escape from it . She sent her child to her neighbour Hill 's , to ask for a loaf of bread . It was freely given , but Mrs. Hill had not grace enough to restrain her tongue , as the door closed after little Sally . " There is no pride that can stand every thing . I have known the time , when Mary Hollis would rather starve to death , than to have asked for a piece of bread . I am sure I am sorry for her , but it is strange how much some folks must suffer , before they are humbled . Pride must have a fall , and it 's best it should :  --  not but what I feel for her ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hill 's husband was too much used to the talking of his wife to give much heed to it on common occasions , but he had tender feelings , and the sorrows of his neighbour had touched his heart . " Yes , " said he , " the Lord knows who needs it ; and though I do n't profess to read the Bible as much as you do , that says , he chasteneth whom he loveth ; and besides , Betsy , I 'm thinking that it is not easy always , to understand the ways of the Lord , nor safe nor charitable to explain his judgments . Does not the Saviour say judge not lest ye be judged , ' and how does he reprove his disciples when he says , of those eighteen men on whom the tower of Siloam fell , think ye they were sinners above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem ? " Betsy was checked for a moment ,  --  albeit unused to hear her husband quote the Bible ,  --  but collecting all her forces , " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a text here and there , but it takes grace to understand them . Now , John , do you believe any thing but pride could keep Mary Hollis out of her bed spinning and weaving till 12 o'clock by the light of the fire , just to get a piece out of the loom , to fit her children for Sunday school , when the Ladies ' charitable Society agreed to clothe all the poor children ? No , no , John , destruction is sure to come after pride , for Solomon says , The Lord will destroy the house of the proud . " " Yes , " said John , " and establish the border of the widow :  --  and a blessing , I believe , is in store for Mary Hollis . If every woman was like her , it would not take some hard days ' work for you and I to pay our poor 's tax . " This was an argument which had some weight with Mrs. Hill . " Far be it from me , " she said " to discourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people feel their situation . If Mary Hollis had been like other people , I should not blame her for working hard , but never could I get one word out of her about her troubles . She never owned that her husband drank ,  --  that is , never said any thing about it ; and many a time , when he had one of his frolics , I have been there , to have a little neighbour-like talk with her ,  --  to tell her , how much every body pitied her , and that such troubles were not sent upon her for nothing . She would say , that what troubles she had , it was easier for her to bear than to complain of ; and then she never failed to turn to talking about something else . Oh ! it is enough , to provoke a saint , to see any body so wilful . " John , certainly , did not think silence a provocation , nor his wife quite a saint , but his reply , which , perhaps , would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return of little Sally , who came to say " her mother would be obliged to Mr. Hill , to ask Mr. Germain ( the minister ) to call at her mother 's , and her mother would be glad to speak with Mrs. Hill . " Betsy Hill , mollified by the expectation of confidence , was not a little chagrined , when she found all Mrs. Hollis wished was to effect an exchange of commodities with her , to supply the present necessities of her children . She offered Mrs. Hill her best gown , the relict of better days , for some pork and potatoes . Betsy was not thought a hard-hearted woman , but no occasion ever tempted her to discredit her sense , by making a bad bargain ; and as selfishness is too apt to make us overvalue our own possessions , her bargains were not always strictly just . After a careful scrutiny of the gown , and many remarks upon the damages done by time , the present reduced price of goods , &c.; to all which , Mrs. Hollis listened patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties . It was a principle with Mary , never to beg , while she could by any exertion or self-denial , do without it ; but no one could more gratefully receive a kindness . The minister of the village , was , in the gospel sense , the overseer of his flock . His first duty he knew , was to minister to their spiritual wants ; but , that being done , he did not leave the rest undone . His benevolent heart was continually devising good , and his strong , practical mind , contriving some mode for its application . His wife was a fellow-worker with him , and the sobriety , industry and order of their household , were an excellent comment on the public preaching of the Pastor . No scoffer could ever say , " Mr. Germain , knew how to preach better than to practice . " No infidel could point you in derision to his family , as exemplifiying the impotence of the principles he taught ; but a numerous family , early inured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance , obedience and love , exhibited the blessedness of a well ordered household . His people , witnessing the effects of his wisdom , had confidence in it , and sought , in all cases of difficulty in their temporal affairs , his advice ; and many there were among them who referred the prosperity of their families to the salutary counsels of their beloved pastor . The good man had anticipated the wants of Mary , and was already on his way to her , when he met Hill . They naturally , fell into conversation on Mary 's embarrassments . Hill said , " that a lone woman as she was , and none of the strongest , she must put her children upon the town ;  --  that her husband , though he was bad enough , had contributed something to the support of his family , but if his wife had not been the best christian in the world , they could never have kept it together . " " Ah ! John , " said Mr. Germain , " I am glad to find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " " Certainly I do sir , if she be a real christian . " " Well , and what do you call a real christian ? " John was a little daunted , and hesitated , fearing , perhaps , that his definition might not be agreeable to the common ideas of the christian character , but his zealous admiration of Mary 's bright virtues , augmented , perhaps , by his involuntary setting them in contrast to the deep shades of his own rough mate , gave him courage to proceed . " Why , sir , I call a woman a christian , that is as patient as Job , and has full as many troubles ;  --  for what can be worse to one who fears and serves God as she does , than to have a drunken husband come staggering and swearing home ? I call a woman a christian , that works from morning till night , to get bread for her family , and is never heard to scold or mutter . I call a woman a christian , sir , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours that are always picking at her , and yet has never been known to notice or complain of it , though she feels it . I am certain of that ; for I remember her little girl came crying home from school one day , when I was there , and said her cousin Anne Mason , would not sit on the bench beside her , and said her mother told her to have nothing to say to Sally Hollis . I saw Mary 's cheek was the colour of scarlet , and the tear glistened in her eye , but it took her but a minute to come to herself ; and then she said , My dear child , your anger is almost as bad as Anne 's pride . Act well , and no good person will despise you , because you are poor . " " Oh , Mr. Germain ,  --  you said in your sermon , a meek spirit is worth all the riches of this world . " " But , " said Mr. Germain , willing further to try John 's estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You give Mary great praise , but you speak only of what is called morality . " " Mr. Germain , " exclaimed John , " I did not think to find you among them that despise morality . I know a great many people cry down morality , but to my mind , it stands to reason , that such morality as Mary Hollis ' must come from religion . It is obedience to the laws of God , made known to us by his Son . I do n't believe any thing but the grace of God can help any one through such a sea of troubles . Why , sir , it is as much of a miracle , if we could but see it in that light , as Peter 's walking on the sea ; and Mary would have sunk long ago , if her faith had not kept her up . It may be , sir , you think Mary is not a christian , because you do not see her at meeting so often as my wife , and some other women : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary is more in the way of her duty , keeping at home , working for her children , and setting an example that 's better than the catechism to them ;  --  and besides , sir , she does not forget other duties neither . Many 's the time that I have seen her , when I looked into her window as I passed by , kneeling with her little ones about her . Of a sabbath , she is always sure to be at meeting , and her children with her ; not kept at home , as some I know , because they have not smart clothes to wear there . Besides , Mr. Germain , Mary is a member of your church , can it be , that you do nt think her a christian ? " Mr. Germain certainly did think her a christian , and one of the highest order , and he answered John , that he looked upon her as an ensample to the whole flock , and that he was glad to find that he had such correct notions of christian duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the minister , and Mr. Germain kindly parted from him , shaking his hand , and telling him that he wished he could always preach as good a sermon as he had heard that morning . Mr. Germain found Mary composed . " The waters " he said to her , " have compassed you about , but have not overwhelmed you , my friend . " " No , sir , " she replied , " I have found a resting place : I know all is right ; and I feel , that as the eagle fluttereth over her young , ' so I , and my little ones , are gathered under the sheltering wings of Him who will not leave nor forsake us . I am a feeble instrument in his hands , of myself , quite insufficient for these things . But I have submitted to his rebuke , and I feel a strength made perfect in my weakness , for the duties that are before me . " Mary then entered into an explanation of her situation . She said , it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her husband had seen his fault he might have been free from any discouragement to reformation . She had thought it better to do without what seemed even necessary to the family , than incur a debt , where she could not see her way clear to pay it . If she had not , she could not have felt that she was strictly honest ; for what was it , but taking from others what she was not sure of being able to return . Some , she said , had blamed her for not soliciting charity .  --  She believed it was not pride that had withheld her ;  --  there were some who could not live without charity , and while she could she dared not encroach on their rights . She had not even a mite to give , and therefore she had felt more anxious not to take the portion from those more needy than herself . Her voice trembled as she proceeded to say , that she feared there was a bill against them at the tavern . She would thank Mr. Germain most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not " said she , " send my child to enquire .  --  I can not go myself . " She burst into tears . Mr. Germain assured her it should be attended to . Her husband 's work-benches and utensils , she hoped , would raise enough to discharge the debt . She had a cow ; but as there was no provision for it , that must be sold ,  --  that would bring something , but she feared not enough , with all that she could do , to carry her children through the long winter before them . Sally , she said , was nine years old , and , perhaps , her services in a family , as she was an industrious , handy child , might be thought an equivalent for her support . The three younger children she should endeavour to keep with her . Although Mr. Germain had a favourable opinion of Mary , he had not thought her capable of such energetic plans . She had a mild , quiet way with her , and he had fallen into a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather formed to suffer , than to act . He expressed with cordiality and paternal kindness , his approbation of all her plans , and left her with an assurance that he would immediately attend to her request . Mr. Germain was not one of those who satisfy themselves with intending to do good , and quiet their consciences with a few benevolent emotions . He remembered , that it was the servant who did the will of his Master , and not he who promised to do it , that was approved by him . There is a good maxim with notable housewives , " a stitch in time saves nine . " The same proportion may be observed in the economy of benevolence ;  --  there delay is often ruinous . Mr. Germain 's people often wondered that he who accomplished so much , should have so much leisure ; but those who wisely ceased to wonder that they might learn , observed a habit of method , which entered into all his arrangements , and one rule from which he was never known to deviate , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to-day . The past , he would say , has gone with its record to the Most High . We can not count upon an hour of the future ; the present is all we possess , and is a talent for which we must render our account . In obedience to his general rule , Mr. Germain went immediately to the tavern . He found the bar room empty . As he entered it , his eye was attracted by the chalked accounts , which were scrawled on its smoked and dirty wall . He soon detected poor William 's among them , and was so intent on ascertaining its amount , that he did not hear or heed the footsteps of a young man who entered and placed himself on the seat near him . As he finished the sad business , he heard adeep sigh , and turning , saw this man whose eye was eag erly fixed on him . He knew him , and knew the truth which his livid complexion and heavy eye proclaimed , that he was addicted to the destructive vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abodes of misery . " Young man , " said Mr. Germain , " this is a heavy score , but this can be wiped out . But who can now touch that account which is registered against the unhappy sinner in the great book ? Oh ! my friend , does not this hand-writing on the wall speak to your conscience ? When you yesterday , followed your companion to the silent , solitary grave , did no thought follow his spirit to the presence of the Judge ? Be admonished  --  use the day of reprieve  --  cast not away the mercy that is offered to you . Escape for thy life , look not behind thee . ' More than death awaits thee here ,  --  the destruction of soul and body in hell . " The conscience of the unhappy man was a wakened ; he covered his face with his hands and sobbed aloud . Mr. Germain was moved , " My Friend , " said he , " I trust these are tears of penitence , and that they will lead you back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare . You have a difficult task before you , but you are yet young . Steady resolution in the fear of God , will have the blessing of God . Abandon this haunt ,  --  forsake the seducing society of your companions , that you may not be a partaker of their evil deeds ; apply yourself , constantly , to your business , and seek your pleasure in your family . Oh ! what a feast will the gratitude of your good wife , and the prosperity of your little children be to you , after the husks you have fed on . " These were words spoken in season , and that was an hour never forgotten by the penitent . Mr. Germain visited him often , encouraging and confirming him in his good resolations . And when sorrow or disappointment has sometimes borne heavily on this good man ,  --  as who can escape it in this world ! his heart has been cheered , by the sight of the healthy cheerful countenance of the reformed man , as he passed him , at work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say to Mr. Germain , " that , I could persuade others to exchange the way of the transgressor which is hard indeed , for paths of perfect peace . " But to return to Mary 's business . Mr. Germain , found a purchaser for all the contents of William 's workshop , and their avails satisfied the tavern reckoning . He then went to lay Mary 's case before a benevolent Lady , to whose aid and advice he often had recourse , Mrs.  --  , suggested that a contribution might be easily obtained from the families in the neighbourhood , who well might afford , to spare enough from their fulness to save Mary the necessity of parting with her cow . A collection of provisions was accordingly made , and sent to her , and most thankfully received by Mary . A few days after , her neighbour , Mrs. Hill , called to see her . After sitting awhile , she said to Mrs. name=f336-019Page image - Page 018 . Hollis . " Folks say , you are agoing to put Sally out to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not " said Mrs. Hollis . " Well I told them so , I knew better ; I would starve to death , with my children , if I was you , before I would do it . To be sure , I have not got the pride that some people has ; but , my spirit is above that ; there is no knowing what we may be brought to , but I never can be brought to make my children wait upon any body . That 's proper negroes ' work , and it 's for that , the mark has been kept upon them , since it was put upon Cain , who , the Bible says , was the first of their race . " There were so many opinions and principles advanced in this out-pouring of Betsy Hill , that her mild neighbour hardly knew what to reply to first . She calmly replied , " I believe the Bible does not say , that the coloured people are descended from Cain , and I can not think , Mrs. Hill , that service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen fit to place among the poor of this world . " " But , " said Mrs. Hill , ( for she made great pretences to religion , and did not choose to appear negligent of its obligations ) " I think it is a very wicked thing for people to hold their head so high , that they ca n't sit down at the same table with their hired people .  --  A'nt they children of one Father in Heaven , and ha'nt they got to lie down in the dust together ? No , no , you will never make me believe it 's right to live out , where you must be prisoned up in a kitchen , and as like as not , have a negro eat in the same room with you . " Mary could not restrain a smile , at the inconsistency of her neighbour , who , with one breath proclaimed a law of perfect equality , and at the next , shrunk instinctively from being placed on a level with those that she deemed below her . She was , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Hill 's clamour . Her life was her argument , and , insensible , indeed , must that person have been , who was not touched by its eloquence . " You have , " said she , " perhaps mistaken me ; I did not decline Mrs. C  --  ' s offer on account of my child 's being there obliged to do the work , and fill the place of a servant . She must serve , and I hope she will , in all humility of mind . ' Mrs. C  --  has a large disorderly family , her kitchen is filled with servants who keep up a scene of riot and contention , the family live without any observance of religion .  --  Even the sabbath , with them , is not a day of rest and quiet . I can not expose my child to the dangers and temptations of such a family . Mrs. Martin has offered to take her . " " Mrs. Martin ! " exclaimed Sally Hill , " Mrs. C  --  for my money , for all Mrs. Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some persons would think her too strict ; but she is strict only in obliging her people to be diligent , orderly , neat , and regular . This is the yoke I wish my child to bear in her youth . " " Well , " said Betsy , " my advice has not been asked , and nobody is obliged to take it ; but I would as soon let one of my children walk through the fire to Moloch , as go to live with the Martins . Some folks call them religious , but I believe the scripture , it is impossible for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of Heaven . " " The scriptures say difficult , not impossible , " said Mary . " That 's all the same , for the matter of that , but I ca n't but wonder at you . I should think you 'd have more feeling for your child than to make a slave of her . The Martins have as many rules and regulations as kings and queens . Every night the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are out after , they may freeze to death , but the door must not be opened . Then , there is a long list of laws pasted over the kitchen fire place , that I saw with my own eyes , and there is a punishment put against every rule for the breaking it . " " And a reward , is there not , " said Mary , " for those who observe the laws ? " " I do n't know any thing about that . There may be , but who wants rewards from such tyrants ? Then , every night , after prayers , they are all told what to do the next day . I would as soon make a cart-horse of my child at once , as to have her driven day after day , without any mind of her own . All the girls she has brought up look like Quakers , they are dressed so plain . " " Yes , " said Mary , " and so comfortably . " " She can afford to make them comfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , " said Mary , " Mrs. Martin 's family is an example to every body , and I take it as a great favour from Him who has promised to be a Father to the fatherless , ' that my child is to be placed there .  --  She will have to work , but never beyond her years and strength ; and work I consider a blessing . How many children do we know that are kept at home by mothers , who are either too proud to put them out to service , ( for pride is in the cottage as well as in the palace , ) or else have not resolution to part with them , who are brought up in idleness . We have not employment for our children at home . A poor man has not land for his boys to work on , and we have not in our houses , wherewith to keep the girls busy .  --  The boys , now and then get a few hours ' work , an errand to do , or some little job ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seldom see children that are carried along in this way , that prosper in the world .
