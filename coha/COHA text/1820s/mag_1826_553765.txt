txt ART . IX. -. /llessage front the President of the United States , transmitting a Report from the Secretary of State , with Copies of the Correspondence with the Government of France , touching the Claims of american Citizens for Spoliations .. February , 1825 . IN a former number of this Journal , we presented our readers with a sketch of the history of the claims of American citizens on the governments of Naples and of Holland , and of the negotiations of the American government , to procure the liquidation and settlement of those claims . A lucid and instructive account of the claims of our citizens on the government of Denmark has been // published in a contemporary Journal. * We proceed therefore , in the pursuit of the plan originally formed by us , to the consideration of the claims of our citizens on the government of France . These claims , at present , form the subject of our most important controversy with foreign powers . We call it the most important , both because the amount of property involved in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversies of a similar kind , and because , on the nature of the settlement we may be enabled to make , with France , depends the nature of the settlement we may make with Naples , Holland , and Denmark . When we shall have successfully asserted our claims on France , we shall of course meet with no powerful obstacles , in obtaining justice from the secondary powers ; and till we have enforced our rights against the stronger , it would be beneath the dignity of our national character , to assume a lofty and coercive tone , towards the weaker . It may be necessary to inform some of the younger portion of our readers , precisely in what our claims on France had their origin . It is now twenty years , within a few months , since the famous Berlin decree was promulgated by Napoleon , at the city , whose name it bears . The alleged provocation of this decree was the blockade of the coasts of France and Holland , and of a part of Germany , by the British , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a time of war , a trade between the colonies of a belligerent and the mother country , not permitted by the belligerent , in time of peace . These pretensions of the British Government had been strenuously resisted by that of the United States , and formed part of the subjects of the protracted negotiations , first of Mr Monroe , and subsequently of that gentleman and Mr Pinkucy . If Napoleon ever entertained the expectation that the government of the United States would be able , throm*gh the mild medium of negotiation , to induce the British cabinet to relax from these pretensions , it was not long before he chose to adopt the more violent course of retaliation , and to take the matter into his own hands . Accordingly , on the twentyfirst of November , 1806 , the fbllowing decree was promulgated at Berlin , with a long preamble which we omit.t * Since published in a separate form by its author , the Hon. Caleb Cushing of Newburyport. j The preamble appears without the decree , in Wait 's State Pa* pers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are declared in a state of blockade . ART . II . All commerce and correspondence with the British islands are prohibited . In consequence , letters or packets addressed either to En* , land , or to an Englishman , or in the Engiis* language , shall not pass through the post office , and shall be seized . ART . III . Every subject of England , of what rank or condition soever , who shall be found in the countries occupied by our trool ) s , or by those of our allies , shall be made a prisoner of war . ART . IV . All magazines , merchandise , or property whatsoever , belonging to a subject of England , shall be declared lawful prize . ART . V. The trade in English merchandise is forbidden ; all merchandise belonging to England , or coming from its manufactories or colonies , is declared lawful prize . ART . VI . One half of the proceeds of the confiscation of the merchandise and property , declared good prize by the preceding articles , shall be applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the capture of merchant vessels , by English cruisers . ART . VII . No vessel coming directly from England or the English colonies , or having been there , since the publication of the present decree , shall be received into any port . ARr . VIII . Every vessel contravening the above clause , by means of a false declaration , shall be seized , and the vessel and cargo confiscated , as if they were English property . ART . IX . Our tribunal of prizes at Paris is charged with the definitive adjudication of all the controversies , which may arise within our empire , or in the countries occupied by the French army , relative to the execution of the present decree . Our tribunal of prizes at Milan shall be charged with the definitive adjudication of the said controversies , which may arise within the extent of our kingdom of Italy . ART . X. The present decree shall be communicated by our minist&amp;r of exterior relations , to the kings of Spain , of Naples , of Holland , and of Etruria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the victims of the injustice and barbarism of the English maritime laws . Our ministers of exterior relations , of war , of marine , of finances , of justice , and our postmasters general are charged , each in what concerns him , with the execution of this present decree . ' * // This decree , as appears on its face , though operating almost exclusively on American commerce , was ostensibly applicable to all nations . Some of its provisions are in direct violation of the law of nations , and of the provisions of the Convention of 1800 , then existing between America and France . It may be observed , however , that it subjected to confiscation only such merchandise as was British property , or of the manufacture or produce of Great Britain , or of her colonies . With respect to vessels coming from England , it went no further , than to declare that they should not be received into French ports , and such vessels were , with their cargoes , made liable to confiscation , only in case they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaratiou. * This decree remained for a considerable time comparatively inoperative . It drew from the British geverament , in the month of January following , a prohibition of the coasting trade from port to port in France , but it attracted , upon the whole , no great attention in America . During the first months after its promulgation , a number of American vessels arrived in France , which had been compelled , on their passage , either by stress of weather or by force , to put into English ports . The question of course arose in France , whether in virtue of the seventh article of the Berlin decree , such vessels were liable to seizure ; whether the article was aimed only at vessels , that should go voluntarily to England , or included also such as put in only , by what is called reldcheforc*e . The French ministers , not choosing to decide these questions at once , allowed the cargoes of vessels in this situation to be landed and deposited in the public stores , till the will of the Emperor should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consignees , on their giving bonds to refund the estimated value , in case of a final decree of condemnation . It was not till the fourth of September , 1807 , that the most rigorotis construction was given to the seventh article of the Berlin decree , by a circular of the Director General of the Customs ; and to this construction a retrospective force appears to have been given , over all the vessels and cargoes , which unfortunately had been awaiting a decision.t About the first of November , officially communicated to Congress from the department of State , February 19 , 1807 .

They shall continue to be rigorously in force , as long as that government does not return to the principle of the law of nations , which regulates the relations of civilized states in a state of war . The provisions of the present decree shall be abrogated and null in fact , as soon as the English abide again by the principles of the law of nations , which are also the principles of justice and honor . All our ministers are charged with the execution of the present decree , which shall be inserted in the bulletin of the laws . ' Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to all nations , the chief operation of 1 ) 0th was on the United States of America . In consequence of their provisions , an immense quantity of American property was captured and condemned . But these decrees were by no means the limit of the arbitrary and unjust policy pursued by France , toward the United States . There were other acts exclusively directed against our commerce , having the intention , as they had the effect , of sweeping the poor remnant of it from the ocean , exposed , as it was , beneath the frail protection of a pacific neutral , to the tremendous collision of the overgrown powers , that waged the great warfare of the civilized world , and affected to say to us T is dangerous when the weaker nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites . To meet the extraordinary state of things , that existed in the world , and to withdraw the American commerce from the grasp of the unprincipled policy of the belligerents , an embargo was laid on all the American ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This measure , designed to be not only one of preservation to our own citizens , but of coercion on the belligerents , was also followed up , by urgent remonstrances , addressed to both of them . They were of course ineffectual and worse than ineffectual , for they seemed to be received with derision . On the 17th of April , 1808 , a decree was published at the imperial head quarters of Bayonne , directing the seizure of all American vessels , now in the ports of France , or which may come into them hereafter . ' The alleged pretence of this decree was , that as , in consequence of the American embargo , no American vessel could be lawfully at sea , there was fair ground // of presumption that all American vessels navigating abroad , were doing it on British account , or in British connexion . This explanation , as ridiculous as it was inadequate and offensive , was in direct contradiction of the notorious fact , that almost every American vessel , which happened to be at sea , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner , * and also to the fact , that many American vessels had sailed in contravention of the embargo ; thereby , as was justly urged , by Mr Madison , in a despatch to General Armstrong , contravening our own laws , and incurring the penalties of those laws , but not denationalizing themselvcs , nor authorizing a seizure by a foreign power . So severe was the operation of the embargo , on the commercial and agricultural interests of the United States , and so ineffectual had it proved , as an instrument of coercion toward the belligerents , that , by a law of the 1st of March , 1809 , the act laying the embargo was repealed in respect to all countries except England and France . By the same law , usually called the Nonintercourse Law , the vessels and merchandise of both England and France were excluded from the American ports , after the twentieth of the following May . It was , however , provided by the same law , that if either France or Great Britain should so revoke or modify her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce of the United States , the commerdal intercourse off the United States should be renewed with the nation thus revoking or modifying its decrees . On the 29th of April , 1809 , this law was communicated by the American minister to the French government . No indication was given by the French government , that it was regarded as a hostile measure . Towards the end of this year , however , orders were given to seize all American vessels , in the ports of France or of countries occupied by the French armies ; and after a great many seizures had been made , in consequence of these orders , principally in the ports of Spain and Holland , an imperial decree was issued , bearing date at Rambonillet on the 23rd of March , 1810 , confirming the seizures just mentioned ; extending the principle of them to all American vessels , which should have entered France , or the dependent countries since May 20th , 1809 , and directing the product of the sales , to be paid into the // caisse d'amortissement . The pretence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by Mr Gallatin , * was the act of Congress of March 1st , 1809 , prohibiting the entry of British and French vessels into our ports . The iniquity of the Rambouillet decree was , that while the American law provided for the remission of the forfeiture , in any case , where the parties were ignorant of the law , the French decree was retrospective in its operation , and extended to American vessels , which had sailed a twelvemonth before its promulgation . Under these four general decrees , namely , of Berlin and Milan , of Bayonne and Rarnhouillet , and by various special orders , some of which were never formally communicated to our government , a vast quantity of American property was seized . This may he conveniently classed under two heads , presenting cases somewhat different in their aspect , although equally imperative in the claim for indemnity . The first class is that of property , which has never been condemned ; the second , that which underwent the formal adjudication of the prize courts , and was confiscated . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was directed in the resolution of the House of Representatives of the United States , moved by Mr Everett , that in the schedule to be reported by the Secretary of State , a discrimination should be made between the two classes . The first class of claims , that is , those for property which has never been condemned , embraces the vessels and cargoes burned at sea , and those sequestered in the ports of France and the dependent nations . We may dismiss the ease of the vessels and cargoes burned at sea , with a single observation of Mr Gallatin to the Duke of Richelieu , in his letter to that minister already cited . It is not necessary to make any observations on the destruction of vessels at sea , your Excellency having already intimated , that the government of France was disposed to make restitution for acts of that nature . ' The vessels and cargoes sequestered and not condemned , consist principally of such as arrived at Antwerp , in the beginning of 1807 , to the number of seven , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , by virtue of an order of government of May , 1810 ; of such as were seized at // St Sebastian toward the close of 1809 and in the beginning of 1810 , and which were sold in conformity to the Rambouillet decree ; and of fourteen vessels , which in the winter of 1809-10 , having been driven into Holland , were there seized , and , by virtue of a particular agreement between Holland and France , bearing date March 16th , 1810 , put at the disposition of France . In none of these cases was there either trial or condemnation . The vessels and cargoes were simply seized and sold by order of the government , for all whom it might concern , and the proceeds ( leposited in the public treasury , where in the eye of reason and public law they still remain ; and it is left to the government of France , in bestowing on the claimants the poor privilege of a trial , which they have never yet had , to decide whether the seizure was or was not rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course remain in the French treasury ; if not rightful , the French government , having had the use of a part of these funds for about twenty years , will probably think it time to restore them to their lawful owners . There is one consideration in reference to this sequestered property , which puts the claim to indemnity in a very strong light , and as such is justly stated by the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives , in a Report of May 24th , 1824 . It is this ; that the property was sequestered , in virtue of an imperial decree , under suspicion of being English property , and to afford an opportunity to ascertain whether it were English property , or bond fide American property . If the latter ( which it is now conceded to have been ) , it must of course be released . But granting it to be English , it must also hereleased , or paid for , tinder the fourth of the additional articles of the treaty of the 30th of May , 1814 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties stipulate to release all property put under sequestration , since the year 1792 . If therefore the property of our citizens had really been , what it was wrongfully pretended to be , as a ground of seizure at Antwerp , at St Sebastian , and in Holland , it must still have been paid for , hy the restored government of France , in virtue of the treaty of 1814 . It is well remarked , in reference to this position of the claim , by the Committee of Foreign Affairs , in the the report just alluded to , that a singular spectacle will be exhibited , if payment is denied when the motive of the seizure is shown to have been false , or should any doctrine of ' the present French government place the property of a neutral in a worse // situation than if it had belonged , as was suspected , to an enemy . Such doctrine can not be advanced by France , unless she intends to instruct other powers , that , in all future wars , in which she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prudent to be her enemy than her friend . ' There are one or two circumstances of peculiarity , in reference to the Antwerp sequestrations , which merit the attention of the reader , and have been justly deemed by the claimants and by the American government , to form a case deserving of a separate representation to the French b overnment , which they have , accordingly , more than once received . Among the numerous American vessels , which arrived in French ports in the year 1807 , prior to the 4th of September , when , as our readers will bear in mind , a rigorous extension was given to the Berlin decree , a considerable number entered the port of Antwerp , after having been compelled to touch in England . Of these vessels , seven came consigned to two American houses , namely , the Bordeaux packet , Helena , North America , and Diamond to the house of Ridgeway ; and the Perseverance , Hiram , and Mary to that of Parish . The consignees declined availing themselves of the option , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the cargoes , on entering into bond to abide the final decision of the Emperor . They preferred that the cargoes should remain in the custom house stores , subject to that decision . A severe scrutiny took place of the character of the property , which resulted in the satisfactory proof , that it was 1 ) onafide American . That fact , indeed , does not appear to have been questioned . It was , nevertheless , in virtue of imperial orders of the 29th of May , 1809 , and 4th of May , 1810 sold , for the benefit of all concerned , and the proceeds eventually paid into the French treasury , where , never having been accounted for , they still are . Now to show that the proceeds of this property are still rightfully due to the American claimants , we mention the following facts . The European consignees of numerous other American vessels , which arrived at Antwerp in the same season , with the seven mentioned , accepted the offer of the French authorities , entered into bonds , and received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were these bonds exacted by the imperial government ; in no case were steps taken to recover the penalty ; and in some cases , quoted by Mr Gallatin , they were formally cancelled , in favor of the consignees . This is an admission , on the part of the imperial government of France , that // there was no ground for the confiscation under its own decrees . Again , a small portion of the cargo of one of the seven vessels was taken by the consignee , and sold , and a bond given for its estimated value , and bonds were also given for some of the seven vessels themselves , that they might he sent away . None of these bonds were ever enforced . But perhaps a still more important fact is the following , that indemnity has actually been paid , by the restored government of France , for a considerable portion of one of these cargoes . A short time after the arrival of the vcssels , the house of Mr Parish sold to Messrs Fillietaz and Company , of Antwerp , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo of the ship Hiram . It being then confidently expected , that the merchandise would be delivered to the parties , the sale was absolute , and at the risk of Mr Fillietaz . He paid the purchase money , received a proper bill of sale , and thus became invested with all the rights of the original shipper , but without a guaranty from him or the consignees . Time cotton was , however , not delivered to him by the French custom house officers , but was sold at the same time and in the same manner , as the remainder of the cargoes , and for a sum exceeding four hundred thousand francs . The proceeds , undistinguished from those of the other cargoes , were , in the same manner , and under the same order , paid into the treasury of France . Now mark the difference . The American claimants , backed by all the urgency of their government , have for twenty years been soliciting the repayment of the funds in the treasury* of France , arising from the sale of their property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , as a subject or resident of Belgium , applied for indemnity to the mixed commission , appointed under the treaties and conventions of Paris . His claim was allowed , and placed in the first class of those liquidated , that of cautionments and deposits , and he has received , in payment , certificates of five per cent . consolidated French stock , amounting in principal to 495,760 francs , bearing interest from the 22nd of March , 1819 , together with 10,726 francs in specie for arrears of interest , after deducting the expenses of the commission and other charges. * So much better are the rights of a Belgian subject , than those of an American citizen ! Passing over many other reflections , on the subject of the // sequestered property , and of the vessels and cargoes burned at sea , we proceed to a few remarks on the cases of property condemned , in which we shall do little more , as we could not possibly do better , than follow the outline in Mr Gallatin 's excellent letter to the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , in the first place , to be observed , that cvery condemnation under the Bedin and Milan decrees , however regular in its forms , was an infraction of the convention of the 30th of September , 1800 , negotiated in the consulship of Napoleon , till the 31st of July , 1809 , when that convention expired by its own limitation . It was expressly stipulated in the twelfth , thirteenth , and fourteenth articles of that convention , that the citizens of either country might sail , with their ships and merchandise ( contraband goods excepted ) , from any port whatever to any port of the enemy of the other , and from a port of such enemy either to a neutral port or to another port of the enemy , unless such port should be actually blockaded ; that a vessel sailing for an enemy 's port , without knowing that the same was blockaded , should be turned away , and should not be detained , nor her cargo confiscated ; that implements and munitions of war should alone be considered contraband of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case of an enemy 's property on board the ships belonging to the citizens of either country In violation of all these stipulated rights and principles , the French decrees not only declared the British islands in a state of blockade , although it was not pretended that they were actually hlockade*i , but they made liable to capture and condemnation all American ( as well as all other neutral ) vessels , sailing on the high seas , from or to an English port , or even , which might have been visited by an English vessel , as well as every species of merchandise belonging to an English subject or of English origin . The plea of retaliation , which was not wholly unfounded in point of fact , could of course ftirnish France with no justification for violating the faith of treaties . The plea , that the encroachments of England on our neutral rights were not resisted , but were acquiesced in by the United States , was as offensive in spirit as it was false in fact . Nothing but the contemporaneous injuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of war against England , at least three years before it took place . In the next place , the vessels of the United States , which were condemned , under the Berlin and Milan decrees , were often condemned , by what were called imperial decisi*us , ' and // not by the acts of prize courts . This circunmtance , in substance , places these cases on a level with those not condemned at all . The law of nations guaranties a fair trial to the neutral , who is so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of a belligerent , under the pretence of violating the laws of war . Not only is this the right of the neutral by the law of nations , but it was expressly stipulated by the twentysecond article of the convention of 1800 . This convention remained in force till the end of July , 1809 . It was even a right under the imperial decrees themselves . But of twentyseven vessels condemned by imperial decisions of the kind alluded to , which had been reported to Mr Gallatin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention . Their condemnation by imperial decisions , ' was therefore a violation , not only of the law of nations , but of the provisions of the convention of 1800 , and of the Berlin and Milan decrees themselves . Further , in cases where a trial wa* nominally had , there were several , in which the decisions of the council of prizes took place , without the observance of those forms , intended to protect the interest of the neutral ; without giving the parties time to produce their evidence ; without an examination of the ship 's papers . By one decision of the Council of Prizes , dated the 10th of September , 1811 , six vessels are thus summarily condemned at once . Another iniquitous operation of the decrees and orders , above enumerated , was their retrospective force . This was expressly given to some of them , as for instance the Ramubonillet decree ; and that of Milan was also often made to act retrospectively . Vessels were condemned , not only which had sailed from America , before tidings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proclaimed . Such was the case of the Fame , belonging to a citizen of Boston , and made the subject of a memorial to the House of Representatives the last winter ; which sailed from Boston a few days only after the date of the Milan decree , bound to Marseilles , was spoken a few lea*ues off place , by an English frio was presently brought that gate , to by a French armed ship , and for having been thus spoken , was condemned . With reference to the memorable juggle of the repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees , great injustice was done to our citizens . It was announced by the French government to Mr Armstrong , and afterwards provided in a decree bearing date 28th of April , 1811 , that the Berlin and Milan decrees should be without operation , as respects American vessels , from the VOL . YXJIJ. - N0. 5 ; 3 // first of November , 1810 . Nevertheless , of vessels seized or captured before that day , but not decided upon , fortyeight were subsequently condemned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ txventynine before the twentyeighth of April , and nineteen after . In addition to all these circumstances , sever* 1 condemnations took pThce under frivolous pretexts , either after November 1st , 1810 ; or in cases not embraced in the general decrees ; on the ground of alleged irregularity in the certifkates of origin , or other ship 's papers ; suspected convoy by a British foi ce ; mutiny ; or intention to remit the proceeds of sales through England. * Such , in brief , is the nature of the acts , under which the claims of American citizens against the French government have their origin . We now proceed to relate ( and we must do it most briefly ) the history of the negotiations for indemnity , in which the government has been engaged , under all its administrations , since the time that the injuries were committed . In the general instructions given to Mr Barlow , on the twentysixth of July , 1811 , by Mr Monro. * , then Secretary of State , the first subject to which the attention of Mr Barlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is expected that her government will satisfy to their full extent , without delay . ' * In a letter of Mr Barlow to the duke of Bassano , of the tenth of November , 1811 , the restitution of the American property remaining in sequestration , and indemnity for that confiscated and consumed , were demanded by the American minister . An answer was returned to this letter , by the duke of Bassano , in a note dated December 27th , 1811 , in which no notice is taken of the subject of indemnities . Mr Barlow , immediately on the commencement of his negotiations , endeavored to bring the French government to the conclusion of a commercic 1 treaty . In his projet of the treaty , no provision was made for indemnity , and on this subject he thus expresses himself , in a letter to the Secretary of State , dated April 22d , 1812 . It really appeared to me , that the advantages of such a treaty as I have sketched , would be very great , and especially if it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indemnity for past spoliatioris should be heard , examined , and satisfied , which * Mr Gallatia 's Letter to the Duke of Richelieu , of the ninth of Noember. 1816. * Wait 's State Papers , viii , 324. // operation should precede the new treaty , or go hand in hand with it . This is a dull work , hard to begin , and difficult to pursue . I urged it a long time , without the effect even of an oral answer . But lately they have consented to give it a discussion , and the minister assures me that something shall be done , to silence the complaints , on principles that ought to be satisfactory . ' In his Message to Congress , in its extraordinary session of June , 1 812 , and on the first day of that month , Mr Madison , after recapitulating the causes of complaint against Great Britain , expresses himself in the following terms , on the subject of the causes of complaint against the other great power . I proceed to remark , that the communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with France , will have shown , that , since the revocation of her decrees as they violated the neutral rights of the United States , her government has authorized illegal captures by its privateers and public ships ; and that other outrages have been practised on our vessels and our citizens . It will have been seen also , that no indemnity had been provided , nor satisfactorily pledged , for the extensive spoliations committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the French government , against the property of our citizens , seized within the jurisdiction of France . I abstain , at this time , from recommending to the consideration of Congress definitive measures with respect to that nation , in the expectation that the result of unclosed discussions , between our minister plenipotentiary at Paris , and the French government , will speedily enable Congress to decide , with greater advantage , on the course due to the rights , the interests , and the honor of our country . ' On the eleventh of October , 1812 , the duke of Bassano invited Mr Barlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiations begun at Paris ; but the death of the American minister , on his journey through Poland , defeated the object of the invitation . On the twentyseventh of July , Mr Crawford informed the duke *of Bassano , then at Dresden , of his arrival in Paris as the successor of Mr Barlow ; but the absence of Napoleon , and the disastrous events of the war , prevented the prosecution of his mission . An ineffectual attempt was made by Mr Crawford to engage the French government in r*egotiation , in the month of December , 1813 ; and after this period the distracted state of affairs occasioned an entire cessation of all attempts to settle or even discuss our relations with France . // Peace was at length restored , and with it the edifying speciacle was exhibited to the world , of a desire , on the part of France , to discliar*e her vast arrears to the other nations of the earth . The United States maintained a modest and considerate distance , and kept aloof during the first rush Ibe indemnification . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it knew that a few years won Id put her in a condition to satisfiV all the just ( lemands on her treasury , and it took l ) leastlre in giVing a proof of patience in seeking redress , as it had given one of forbearance in enduring injuries . At length on the fifteenth of April , 1816 , Mr Gallatin was furnished with his general *nstrnctions as minister to France . fn these instructions , Mr Monroe , then Secretary of State , thus expresses himself on the subject in hand . Cherishing these sentiments toward the French nation , under all the governments that have existed there , it has not been less a cause of surprise than of regret , that a corresponding 4isposition has not at all times been entertained by the French government towards the United States . The history of the last ten years is replete with wrongs received from that government , for which no *us tiflabie pretext can be assigned . The property wrested , in that space of time , from our citizens , is of great value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were received under the administration of the late Emperor of France , on whom the demand of indemnity was incessantly made , while he was tn power . Under the sensibility thereby excited and the failure to obtain justice , the relations of the two countries were much affected . The disorder , which has of late existed in France , has prevented a repetition of the demand ; but now that the government appears to be settled , it is due to our citizens , who were so i*i*justly plundered , to present their claim anew to the French government . A gross sum will be received , in satisfaction of the whole claim , if the liquidation and payment of every claim founded on Just 1 ) riaciples , to be esiablished , can not be obtained . ' Mr Callatin was commissioned to negotiate a separate convention on the subject , in case the king of France should prefer mt mode of adjusting it . The investigations and researches necessary to present this important matter to the French government , in an imposing light , were necessarily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1816 , Mr Gallatin addressed a letter to // the Duke of Richelieu , in which the *ntire subject is spread out in a very masterly manner . To this letter we have already more than once referred . After briefly enumerating the decrees , under which the commerce of all neutral nations had suffered , and refuting the arguments , by which the French minister had sought , in previous conversations , to evade the necessity of indemnifying the citizens of the United States , ( arguments of too slight a texture to need our notice here , ) and after specifying those decrees exclusively confined to the United States , such as that of Bayonne , and that of Rambonillet , Mr Gallatin coiisiders the claims under the twofold distinction of those for property not condemned , and those for property condemned . We have already stated , principally from his satisfactory sketch , the considerations applying respectively to each . In conclusion , Mr Gallatin recommends to the French minister , the establishmont of a joint commission , or commissions , to examine and liquidate the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , for indemnity . Having on the twentysixth of December received no answer to this note , . Mr Gallatin requested an interview with the Duke of Richelieu , with a view to a personal explanation on the subject . After an interval of three weeks , the Duke of Richelieu appointed the twentieth of January for this purpose . The interview accordingly took place . In the despatches of Mr Gallatin the following brief account of it is given . I requested that he the Duke would proceed to state , what he had concluded to offer , in answer to the basis proposed in my note of the ninth of November . He said that his offer would fall very far short of our demands ; that he would not go beyond an indemnity for vessels burnt at sea , and for those the proceeds of which had been only sequestered and deposited in the caisse d'amortisscrnent . He added that he would make his proposal in writing , and that this would not be attended with much delay . ' To this suggestion , Mr Gallatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper ( which he could not promise ) to accept an indemnity for certain classes only of the claims , it was not to be construed into an abandonment of the other just demands of their citizens . This promise of the Duke of Richelieu to make a written proposal to Mr Gallatin was not kept . On the contrary , after a delay of about three months , Mr Gallatin was informed by the Duke that lie had determined not to make him a written proposal ; // and gave as the only reason for declining to enter upon the subject , that the claims of the European powers on France were of so frightful an amount , ' that the king 's ministers could not dare propose any augmentation of them , in the way of an indeinnity to the American claimants . Thus ended the first effort to obtain justice . It may be added , that in the month of July , 1817 , the Duke of Richelien stated to Mr Gallatin , ? That he wished it to be clearly understood , that the postponement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of them was considered as founded in justice ; that he was not authorized to commit his Majesty 's government , by any positive promise ; but that it was their intention to make an arrangement , for the discharge of our just demands , as soon as they were extricated from their present embarrassments . He still persiste&amp; however , in his former ground , that they could not at present recu*nise the debt , nor adust its amount . ' In announcing , in the month of April , 1818 , to the Chamber of Deputies , the conclusion of a convention of liquidation with foreign states , the Duke of Richelieu apprized the Chamber that , by this arrangement , France was liberated from all her obligations toward European powers . The adoption of this phraseology confirmed the hope that the claims of America were not intended to be shut out from eventual allowance . It was adopted in pursuance of a demand of Mr Gallatin to that effect . On the eleventh of February , 1819 , the negotiation was renewed by Mr Gallatin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , and in reference specifically to the Antwerp cases , which we have already described , and to which Mr Gallatin was directed particularly to call the attention of the French government . This he did , by transmitting to the Marquis Dessolle , then minister of foreign affairs , a memorial of Mr David Parish , the consignee of three of the vessels in question , backed by a brief but satisfactory statement from IMr Gallatin himself . No answer to the letter of Mr Gallatin appears among the documents , in the correspondence communicated to Congress in February , 1824 , but a letter was addressed to Mr Parish , by the Baron Louis , minister of finance , to whose department the memorial had been referred . This letter unfortunately furnishes proof , that the French minister , its author , had informed himself neither as to the provisions nor penalty of the Berlin decree , nor as to the mode , in which // the proceeds of the cargoes sequestered were disposed of . The fallacies in Baron Louis 's statement are indicated by Mr Gallatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of July , 1819 ; but it does not appear that the correspondence was farthtr pursued with the government of France at this juncture , and thus ended the second movement in this negotiation . In the summer of 1 S20 , a third vigorous effort was made by Mr Gallatin to bring the French government to a disposition to terminate this vexatious controversy , by an amicable arrangement . On the ninth of June , 181S , he had addressed to the Duke of Richelien a short note , inviting his attention to the cases of the Dolly and the Telegraph , two vessels which were burned at sea , in November and December , 1811 , by the French frigates , La M*duse and La Nyinphe , for alleged contravention of the Berlin and Milan decrees . The parties injured by these acts of violence appealed to the proper French tribunal. ; their remonstrance was seconded by Mr Barlow , and the suit was continued , in the regular order of procedure , till , in the commencement of the year 1820 , it was decided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision is such as would strike the American people with equal astonishment and indignation , could it be presented alone , in its naked deformity , to their notice . This ground is , that the cammanders of the French frigates could not know in November , 1811 , that the Berlin and Milan decrees were repealed , because this repeal took place by virtue of a decree bearing date indeed in March , 1811 , but first made public in May , 1812 . We pass over the effrontery , for we know not by what milder name to call it , of making the repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees to date from May , 1812 , when , notwithstanding the caprice and irregularity which marked the proceedings of the government of Napoleon on this subject , the whole tenure of the negotiations with France , at that period , shows that they were not merely in name but in fact revoked , as far as concerns American vessels , from November 1810 . We pass over this , because every thing else sinks into insignificance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , in 1820 , sanctions the burning of American vessels under the Berlin and Milan decrees . It is proper that the American people should definitively understand , that , beneath all the evasions and polite excuses* by which the French government , since the restoratioi , has parried the paYment of our claims . lies hid a determinatiQn // to enforce the validity and legality of the Berlin and Milan decrees . As is justly observed by Mr Gallatin , however , the right of the owners of the Dolly and Telegraph to indemnification does not rest on their establishing these decrees to be an infraction of the law of nations , or of treaty stipulations with the United States , but on the far simpler fact , that , at the time of the destruction of the vessels , these decrees had , as respects America , been revoked . This question is argued with great ability , in a letter of Mr Gallatin to the Baron Pasquier , minister of foreign affairs , dated the fifteenth of March , 1820 . This remonstrance the Baron took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of considering it , in his own capacity , as the organ of the political relations of the country . After this reference , we hear no more of it . In the summer of 1820 , another attempt was also made by Mr Gallatin , on the subject of the Antwerp cases . In a letter to the Baron Pasquier , of the ninth of May , 1820 , which has been already cited , in the course of this article , a brief history of those cases is given . No reply appears to this letter among the documents communicated to Congress in 1824 , and none , we presume , was ever made . On the thirtyfirst of October , 1821 , Mr Gallatin addressed the Baron Pasquier , on behalf of Mr Richard Faxon , a citizen of Boston , whose property was seized by the French at Santander , in 1812 , and whose appeal to the Board of Finances had lately been dismissed . No reply of the French government appears to this remonstrance . Meantime another change had taken place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the port folio of foreign affairs , being supposed more favorably inclined to our citizens , on the question of indemnity , Mr Gallatin addressed him on the tenth of January , 1822 , on the subject of the Antwerp cases . In this letter , from which we have derived the brief outline of these cases , given in the former part of these remarks , the American tnm*stcr pursues the discussion with a detail of facts , and an array of argument , truly imposing . lie concludes this masterly statement with the following dignified appeal . I beg leave to apply not only for that payment , but also for a speedy decision . The United States had , from the most friendly motives , yielded to the reluctance to take up the subject of American alaims , which was evinced by France in 1817 . The objection arising from the state of the finances and from the enor // mous amount of the demands pressing , at that time , on the resources of France , has now happily ceased to exist . Time amply sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim . The parties have already experienced most grievous losses , from the long detention of so large an amount of property . They should not be tortured by further vexatious delays . Justice when too tardy often fails of its object . When it is known , as in this case , that such is the nature of the claim , that it will be ultimately paid , intriguing speculators are never wanting , who will try to take advantage of the distance and of the necessities of the claimants , to purchase their rights at a depreciated rate . Such attempts , which even when not actually tainted , can never avoid a suspicion of corruption , it has been my duty to repel , and heretofore with success . I have told the parties to listen to no proposals , to reject all indirect interference ; that their claim was indisputable and must necessarily be allowed . We employ to attain that object no other but direct means , no weapons but those of argument . I trust that they will not have been used in vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Majesty 's high sense of justice , to those principles of good faith in discharging the obligations of the state , which in every instance , but that of the American claims , have uniformly distinguished his government . ' The manly and powerful argument , of which we have here j ) resented the closing sentences , seems to have had an effect on the mind of the Viscount Montinoreney . In a conference between that minister and Mr Gallatin , about a fortnight after the sending of this letter , the Viscount stated frankly , that , though he could not answer for his colleagues , he was himself struck with the justice of the claims , in the Antwerp cases , and regretted they had not been paid in 1819 . In this conference , Mr Gallatin mentioned what he calls an aggravating and most extravagant circumstance , ' and what we take the liberty to pronounce an unparalleled and most outrageous one , that notwithstanding his repeated applications to the government , during a period of six years , he had not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the applications , relative to injuries sustained under Bonaparte 's government , he had not only failed of obtaining redress , but he had not even been honored with an answer ! It is in the report of this interview , that we find the first mention , in the papers communicated to Congress in 18*4 , of the ommercial difficulties , existing between France and America , // as an obstacle to tile settlement of the claims for indemnity . A controversy , as our readers all doubtless remember , sprang up in 1817 , between the two governments , in consequence of a heavy tonnage duty imposed by the French government on foreign vessels entering the ports of France , and tile retaliatory duty laid on French vessels , in tile ports of the United States . The perplexed negotiation , growing out of this policy , was , at the instance of the French ministry , transferred from Paris to Washington , and there carried on between M. Hyde de Nenville and Mr Adams . This negotiation resulted in the convention of 1822 ; but shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occurred to the French ministry , all other pretexts for delay in the liquidation of the claims being exhausted , that a new one could be drawn from this commercial controversy . Accordingly in the conference between Mr Gallatin and the Viscount Montmorency just referred to , an intimation appears to have been given by the French minister , that the commercial dispute between the countries was a subject of more pressing importance , and ought to be first adjusted . Mr Gallatin very justly met this suggestion , by the remark , that the commercial arrangements of the two countries were a matter of convenience and policy , in which the parties were severally free to take what course their interest dictated ; while the indemnity was a matter of right , long prior in time , and totally distinct in character ; and that the claim of our citizens to justice ought not to be made contingent on any thing else . Firrding in the course of ' several conversations with the Viscount Montmorency , that , although that minister was apparently well disposed to the claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Gallatin asked the permission of the Viscount , to confer with M. de Vilhde , the minister of finance , on the subject . H* accordingly had an interview with M. de Villide on the twentysecond of April , 1822 . He found that the minister of finance had but a general knowledge of the facts of the case , and that he had not read Mr Gallatin 's elaborate exposition of the tenth of January , 1822 . But after stating the difficulties of a liquidation and payment of the claims , arising from the exhaustion of the country , he added , that the only way to render the payment palatable was , that it should be ac* companied by the grateful information that our commercial difficulties were arranged in a satisfactory manner . ' // On the third of May , 1822 , Mr Gallatin again addressed a short letter to the Viscount Moutmorency . We quote the first sentences of it . I had the honor on the tenth of January last , to address to your Excellency a note relative to the American cargoes sequestered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the honor to have with your Excellency on that subject , had led me to hope that there was a disposition to render a tardy justice to the claimants , the note still remains unanswered . It is my duty also to remind your Excellency , that all the fornzer notes , which I have had the honor to address to his Majesty 's ministers , either with respect to that reclamation or , generally , on the subject of the American claims , and particularly the note of the ninth of November , 1816 , have shared the same fate . That on a subject so important , no official answer should , for such a length of time , have been given to the earnest and repeated applications of a friendly power ; that where favors are not asked , but justice is demanded , there should have been such a tacit perseverance , in avoiding even to discuss the question , must be allowed to be a most uncommon proceeding in the intercourse between independent nations . ' On the eighteenth of the month , Mr Gallatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter dwelt principally on the subject of the mode , in which payment should be made for the claims , thereby seeming to admit , that they ought and should he paid . He added , however , that his colleagues in the council of ministers were unwilling to proceed , till they should hear from Washington , that the commercial difficulties were arranged . The same suggestions in substance formed the subject of an official note of some fifteen or twenty lines , dated on the first ofJune , 1822 , which was literally extorted from the Viscount Montmorency , by the importunity of Mr Gallatin . To this note of the Viscount , Mr Gallatin replied in a cogent letter , setting forth the incongruity of the two subjects thus forced into connexion hy the French government . The tenor of the letter may be inferred from the following pithy observation , at its commencement . It is satisfactory to find that the unfavorable suggestions heretofore made on that subject the American claims are no longer alluded to , and that the only reason assigned for its postponement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected no less from the justice of his Majetty 's government . But this new delay is as // vexatious , as unexpected ; and the grounds on which it is placed appear to be altogether untenable . ' At length , in the summer of 1822 , the convention was concluded at Washington . On the seventeenth of August , Mr Gallatin reminded the Viscount Montmorency of this fact , and on the thirtyfii'st following , itiade tile same intimation to M. de Vill*le . Now then , no doubt , the long deferred hope is to be fulfilled ; now tile property of the American citizen , which has hill for sixteen years in the treasury of France , xviii be paid back to its languishing owners ; now , at least , the French government will condescend to engage in tile discussion of the subject . Let us hear M. de Vill*le on the subject , then filling provisionally the ministry of foreign affairs . I had yesterday , ' says Mr Gallatin , in a letter to the Secretary of State of the twentyfourth of September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of our claims . He expressed his wish that a general arrangement might take place , embracing all the subjects of discussion , between the two countries . He stated those to be , tile reclamations of the United States for spoliations on their trade ; those of France , on account of Beaumarchais ' claim ; and of the vessels captured on the coast of Africa ; and the question arising under the Louisiana treaty ; and asked whether I was prepared to negotiate upon all these points ? I answered that I was ready to discuss them all , but that I must object to nniting the Louisiana question to that of claims for indemnity , as they were essentially distinct ; and as I thought , after all that had passed , we had a right to expect that no further obstacle should be thrown in the way of the discussion of our claims , by connecting it with subjects foreign to them . ' On the sixth of November , M. de Vilhie addressed a letter to Mr Gallatin , formally proposing to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries , especially in what concerns the duties received in Lonisiana on the Frencll comnlerc* , contrary to the tenor of the eighth article of the treaty of cession . ' To this proIJosal Mr Gallatin replied in a few days , in a vigorous remonstrance , setting forth the injustice of delaying still ion 6er the settlement of private claims , acknowledged to be just , and so long and injuriously postponed , by connecting the question of their liquidation , with this newly started political controversy . rro this remonstrance , M. de Vilhle returned a peremp // tory answer , insisting on a joint negotiation , on all the subjects in controversy . Mr Gaflatin , in making known this fact to the Secretary of State , remarks ; The object is too obvious , to require any comments , on my part , and this final decision leaves inn no other course , than to refer the whole to my Government . ' And here , as a new , serious , and unexpected obstacle was thrown in the way of the claimants , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the pretension on the part of the French government , from which this obstacle arises . By the eighth article of the convention ceding Louisiana to the United States , it was stipulated that the ships of France should for ever be treated upon the footing of the most favored nation , in the ports of Louisiana . In consequence of the liberal proffer , made by the United States , to all governments , that may choose to accept it , the vessels of certain foreign nations , particularly Great Britain , are now treated in the ports of the United States , including those of Louisiana among the rest , on the same footing as American vessels , in consideration , that American vessels are treated in the ports of those nations , respectively , on the same footing as their own vessels . Although France is not one of the nations , that chooses to reciprocate this policy , she nevertheless requires that French vessels should , by virtue of the eighth article of the Louisiana convention , be treated in the ports of Louisiana on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without allowing , on her part , the consideration or reciprocal condition , on which those vessels are thus treated . This is the French claim . The justice of this claim of course depends on the understanding of what is implied in the most favored nation . ' The United States contend , that the right to be treated on the footing of the most favored nation , ' when not otherwise defined , and when expressed only in those words , is the right of being entitled to that treatment , gratuitously , if such nation enjoys it gratuitously , and on paying the same equivalent , if it has been granted in consideration of an equivalent . The article can have no other meaning , for this single and satisfactory reason , that , if French vessels were allowed to receive gratuitously the same treatment , which those of certain other nations purchase by an equivalent , the French would be treated not as the most favored nation , but more favorably than any other . In fact , it is incorrect , in the use of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a favor . which is mere matter of reciprocity , lb* // which an equivalent has been paid , which is no more a matter of favor than any other bargain . Such is the substance of the controversy relative to the interpretation of the eighth article of the Louisiana cession , and with which the French ministry deem it consistent with honor and good faith to clog the liquidation of private claims , which are allowed to be founded in justice . The French ministry , having at the close of 1822 , again undergone a change , Mr Gallatin , on the twentyseventh of February , 1823 , addressed a letter to the Viscount de Chateaubriand , now the minister for foreign affairs , in which the unreasonableness of this new ground of delay is ably stated ; and this letter closes the correspondence on this subject , communicated to Congress in 1824 , and is the last that proceeded from the pen of Mr Gallatin in the negotiation . It may not be improper to observe , that the records of our diplomacy do not contain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , than those of Mr Gallatin . The negotiation was taken up by Mr Sheldon , the American Charge d'Affaires , after the departure of Mr Gallatin , and by Mr Brown , our present minister to Paris , at the point where it was dropped by Mr Gallatin . Their correspondence with the French ministry was communicated to the House of Representatives in December , 1824 . Our limits do not permit us to give an analysis of it . In a collection of documents transmitted to Congress in February , 1825 , containing the correspondence of Mr Adams with M. Hyde de Neuville , on the subject of this eighth article , is a letter of Mr Brown to the Secretary of State , containing an account of a conference with the new minister for foreign affairs , the Baron Damas . The Baron gives the usual reason for not then entering on the subject , that he had been so short a time in office , that he did not know its merits . We rejoice that a plea , so little creditable to the executive functionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers of our own . The subsequent efforts of Mr Brown have been attended with no happier effects than those made by Mr. Gallatin , in the conduct of the negotiation . To enter at large into the discussion of the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty would carry us beyond our limits . We will therefore close this article , with a few general reflections . The claims on France are highly important , in reference to the amount of property involved in them . This amount has no doubt been much exaggerated ; our own opinion of it has fluc* // tuated , as various data for forming an estimate , have , at different times , suggested themselves to us . We have seen it carried as high as fifty millions , and brought as low as eight . A part of this diversity no doubt arises from different principles of making the appraisal . By one , the value of a vessel and cargo is estimated at what would have been their worth at a good market , and interest is computed on this amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually destroyed , without interest . Under the Florida treaty , losses , we believe , to the amount of about forty millions were stated to the commissioners , and a little over five millions were allowed by them . While the amount fairly due to our citizens from France is unquestionably very great , it is their interest not unduly to swell it . Secondly , we observe that the payment of these claims is due to the national honor . Those acts , which form the groundwork of the claims , were also gross invasions of national right and high handed outrages upon us , as an independent people . Had not the other belligerent , by the same outrages , connected with injuries more keenly irritating , led the government to select her first , the treatment we had experienced from France would unquestionably have resulted in a war . There were many of those most decided in the policy of war with England , who would have been equally willing to declare war against France ; and it was perhaps the unanimous sense of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . War was declared against England ; and by that extreme remedy , our accounts against that country were wiped out . The injuries done us by France , injuries not merely involving the loss of a vast amount of property , but touching the national honor so nearly and deeply , as to be acknowledged on all sides to he a just cause of war , are as yet unatoned for . It is true , the government of France has changed hands ; and this circumstance produces a very different state of feeling on the subject , and somewhat modifies the question as to remedy . But if the restored government refuses to make reparation for the injuries of its predecessor , if it excepts us , as it has hitherto done , from the compensation it has made to all other states , in the like circumstances ; if it even refuses to allow to our merchants , citizens of a state always friendly , those claims for sequestered property , which had it been that of the enemy would have been restored or paid for ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the oppressive decrees , in cases not till now adjudicated , then // we say , the present government of France sanctions and adopts the policy of Napoleon , and the question of redress remains what it would have been , had he continued to reign . The payment by France of the claims of our merchants would he no unexampled stretch of liberality , but an act of justice , such as was promptly rendered by England in 1796 , and extorted from Spain , by the late Florida treaty . That entire province , territorially of immense value to the United States , was ceded to us , principally as an indemnity for our merchants . Under the commission in England for liquidating the claims of our merchants , subsequent to the conclusion of Jay 's treaty , twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling , or nearly five millions and a half of dollars , were allowed and paid . These precedents would take away all appearance of submission from the act of the French government , in satisfying the claims of American citizens ; and we really see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected from her , than from Spain and En gland . Finally , we apprehend a mistaken impression prevails , in this country , as to the plea , on which France evades this act of justice . We believe it to be the common opinion , that the present government of France claims not to be bound to make reparation for the acts of the late government . Though it is true that loose suggestions to this effect , were at first dropped by the French ministers , going rather to the hardness of the case than the want of obligation , yet we can not find that this plea was ever seriously and formally insisted upon . On the contrary , different parts of the claim have been allowed to be just , by snccessive French ministers ; and no part distinctly maintained not to be so . The Duke of Richelien was willing to make compensation for vessels destroyed at sea , and the Visconnt Moutmorency thought the Antwerp claimants entitled to indemnification . There is some appearance of an attempt to maintain the validity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly he dissipated , on a very short illustration of their inconsistency with the provisions of the convention of 1800 , and with the principles of the law of nations . And even should their validity be maintained by France ( admitted by the United States it never *vi11 be ) , the number of cases fairly and regularly condemned under them , is the smallest part of those , for which compensation is asked . The greatest havoc took place , under their retrospective interpretation , under the decrees of Bayonne and // Rambonillet , and by means of extrajudicial acts of the government . But any general pretension , that tl ) e present government of France is not bound by the acts of the former government is effectually abandoned , in setting up the very cause of delay which now impedes the liquidation of the claims . Advantages claimed by France , and refused by the United States , under the Lousiana treaty , are made the pretence of withholding indemniGeation from our citizens . Now the acquisition of Louisiana from Spain , and its cession to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province fommed no part of France , when the Bourbons were forced to le*ive the throne . Its acquisition and its transfer were so*eiy the work of Napoleon . How then could the government of France insist pertinaciously on the enjoyment of privileges alleged to be secured to it by one of his acts ; and pretend to hold itself not responsible for others . No such pretension is , in fact , set up ; and in the words of the President of the United States , at the opening of the last session of Congress , the justice of these claims has not been , as it can not be , denied . ' The first plea of the French government was for time . France was stated to be overwhelmed , by the pres* sure of the late enemies of Napoleon . The United States generously forbore to press their demands , till the European powers had asked all they wished , and obtained all they asked . We then modestly put in our pretensions , and were told there was a tonnage question , which must first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We again mentioned the claims , and were required first to adjust the eighth article of the Louisiana convention . And in this posture the matter now stands . We undertake not to foresee with what success negotiation can be any further pursued on this subject . Our own opinion has long been that Congress alone can negotiate upon it , and that in a more operative way than the exchange of diplomatic notcs . We rely , however , on the prudence and spirit of the Executive , amil doubt not the honor of the country , and the rights of our fellow citizens , will be duly and effectually asserted . Meantime it would appear , that a serious consideration of the subject is contemplated by Congress . The resolution , adopted by the House of Representatives towards the close of the last session , invites the citizens of the United States to report a statement of their claims on all foreign governments to the ( lepartVOL . XxImI .. - NO. 5*3. // tnent of State , and requires that department to submit to the House at its next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have been thus reported . With such a statement before Congress and the people , we apprehend it will not be . easy to refrain from some ehergetic steps for procuring redress .
