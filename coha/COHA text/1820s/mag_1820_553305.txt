ART . XIX. - LiJfr and Letters , together with poetical and i*iiscellaneous pieces of the late William Person , a student of Harvard University . Cambridge : Hilliard &amp; Metcalf. 1820. pp. 252 , l2mo . WE took tip this volume without much expectation of pleasure or instruction . The life of a young man , cut off iii the midst of his pupillage , seemed to promise little else than tales of the school and play-ground . Indications of early genius there might he , and examples of docility and diligence fit for other youth to imitate . But that there should be any thing in which the generality of adult readers would take much interest , or any thing of consequence enought to justify the publication , we could hardly suppose . I'lie lives of merely literary men have sometimes bccii thought to be too barren and monotonous . What then should be said of the life of one , who had not finished his preparatory course , nor even advanced far enough to make choice of a profession ? Nor did we build much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contained in the volume . Considered as the compositions of a learner , they might be entitled to great praise ; they might be such as would be rea ( h with surprize and delight at a school examination ; they might even be much more than this , and discover a mind always far in advance of the stage which it had reached in education . Bitt ; after all , was it to be expected that they could be any thing more than exercises , designed to strengthen and prepare the faculties for future and more serious cx-ertions ? These were our thoughts , and , as we were not promiseil a story of a prodigy , of an admirable Crichton , or a Barretici ' , it may well be supposed that we did not begin to read with any great hope that our time was to be well employed . It has proved otherwise , however ; and if it be useful and profitable , as it certainly is , to old as well as young , to contemplate virtuous resolution struggling with difficulties , pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Providence only could sustain , and at last arriving at the end which at first seemed unattainable ; if manly strength of character , united with the finest sensibility , may deserve and reward attention , we may safely recommend this book to all who take delight in seeing the affections and the moral // qualities called into action , and can love and admire excellence under whatever circumstances , and at whatever age it may appear . rllere is something of a romantic and mysterious interest blended with the history of this extraordinary youth ; in consequence of his having been one of those who , by the fault of their parents , come lawlessly into life . It too often happens that the innocent offspring , in such a case , is made to hear the evil and disgrace , while the guilty parties remain concealed , and as the writer of this memoir well remarks , to avoid disgrace and degradation , do what renders them worthy of a punishment still more severe . ' Person , it seems , was deserted by both his parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in December , 1 T93*and in the October following was placed in a respectable family in Andover . Four or five years afterwards he was put to school under a private teacher in that place , with whom he made rapid progress in the studies proper to that age .. He was anxious , as it was natural he should be , to know the names and abode of his parents ; but his inquiries were evaded , and he was left in that state of suspense , the painfulness of which , to a susceptible mind , may well be imagined . To be an orphan is misery enough . But to be ignorant of the authors of our being , to be uncertain whether they are among the dead or the living , near us and often seen and conversed with , or far off and studiously shunning our sight , to feel alive and unconnected amidst the mighty throng of men ; and to have no object whereon filial tenderness may expend itself ; this must indeed bring keen anguish to the soul of him , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil at Phillips Academy , in one of those melancholy hours , of which we may well suppose there were many in a life like his , thus describes his grief , in reply to the supposed inquiry of a compassionate stranger : Stranger , why that face of grief ? Why those tears , that ask relief ? Is thy heart by anguish torn Art thou left alone to mourn ? - .. Kind inquirer , I would tell thee All the woes , which have befel me ; But the tale would tend to weary ; // Thou hast told it in thy query . Thus briefly let my griefs be known. - In the world I 'm left alone ; No kind father to protect me , No fond mother to direct me , Sister , brother , all denied me Can aught of deeper woe betide me ? . - p. 12 . In the following ' anecdote we have another proof that the want of the i ) arental relation was ever painfully present to his mind , or that at least the slightest circumstance could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Providence , at which time it will be recollected he was about eight years old , he walked by the side of a gentleman into a neighbouring church-yard . While they were looking at the grave-stones and epitaphs , he said to his companion , " If I were to die , who would there be to erect a monument to my memory  --  and if they did , what would they put upon it ? " He paused for a moment , and added , " William Person , the son of -- -.nobody. " ' p. 44 . But let it not be supposed that he was so ungrateful as tG cherish these dark and gloomy feelings . His prevailing disposition was cheerfulness . His virtues gained him many friends , whose kindness seems to have touched his very soul . On every o casion , * lien his path * as thus brightened by a gleam of sunshine , his heart burst forth in thankfulness , first to that God , of whose constant providence he had a strong and animating conviction , and then to the friends whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not forbear here , though somewhat in anticipation of the narrative , to i , tro*uce an affecting incident in his college life , alike lionourable to his class-mates and to himself . He had returned to Cambridge , after being employed during the winter " acatiori as a schoolmaster , in a state of such embarrassment as to make it necessary that he should leave college , and abandon the pursuits and hopes , which lie had followed thus far with the most flattering success . ' His feelings at this trying moment , and the uiieXl ) ectetl relief afforded by the generosity of his fellow-students , may best be described in his own words . We quote from a letter to a friend in Providence . // All my flattering prospects vanished in an instant ; I saw my . self sinking under the wretchedness of po ' *erty and disappointed emulation . ' Still 1 did not murmur , nor cast one reflection against the hand that oppressed me . Divine Providence saw fit that thus it should be , and I submitted , conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do right ; and though I saw no other way but to abandon the course I had hitherto so successfully pursued , yet I did not ( listrust his grace . I expressed my feelings to no one , but my contenance sufficiently indicated my unhappiness . One evening after supper I came into my room as usual , and found several of my class-mates assembled there with my chum . I sat ( lown with them , and we all joined conversation . After some time spent in social freedom , they all retired together , and left me alone . This , as you will see directly , was done design . edly . I drew up thetable , ( in which our books were laid , near to the fire , and leaning my head upon my hand . sat ruminating on my unhappy situation , till the college clock summoned me to study . My next lesson was in Livy . I found my book laid , as if inadvertently , under some larger ones . Upon opening to the spot where my lesson began , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first sight I thought it might contain some difficult question in algebra , some enigma3 ot poetical pun , which are frequently left about to try our ingenuity in answering them but judge my feelings when , on opening it , I found it contained a one hundred dollar bill on the State Bank , Boston , and these lines " Mr. W. Person ,  --  Dear Sir , " Permit a iaumber of your friends to present you the inclosed , as a small proof that brilliancy of talent , ( which alone sometimes generates envy , ) when united to amiability of disposition , invariably gains esteem . " It is impossible to describe the successive emotions of surprize , gratitude , and joy , which this splndid and unexpected favour occasioned : It chased away my ( 1esponde*Ice and restored my usual vivacity , and in the fulness of my heart . 1 pun red out the purest elfusions of gratitude to that Almighty power . whose providence has always been my safeguard and support , and who brought me into those trying circumstances that he n'ight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me . How true it is that " the Lord will not forsake those who put their trust in him ! " Here is an ample supply for all my present necessities , an ( I as for the future , they are yet unknown . Upon inquiry , I learned that a number of my wealthy classmates , having become acquainted with my circumstances , my re* // cent disappointment , and my necessity of leaving college in consequence , kindly contributed from their abundance to furnish me with the means of continuing here . A young man by the name of R*** , from Charleston , S. C. , whose superiority of talent justly gives him the first rank in our class , was the principal agent in procuring this donation , and by his means it was conveyed to me in the manner before described . To him theretore as the rep resentative for himself and fellow-donors , I immediately addressed a billet , coritaing the " simple expression of my gratitude. as a sincere though inadequate return for their distinguished liberality ; rendered still more acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its application , " together with such encomiums and remarks as justice requIred and my feelings at that time dictated . This was answered in terms the most friendly and flattering . I have been thus explicit , that you might have some idea of my present circumstances as they are , and that you might rejoice with me in my prosperity . ' pp. 33-37 . We are now to state very succinctly by what course of events Person became a member of Harvard University . In 1801 , he was taken from Andover by two gentlemen , one of whom he did not see after reaching Boston , and the other he accompanied to Providence , and became a resident in his family , as an apprentice for learning the tanner 's trade . When he left Andover , he was told , that he should return in a fortnight . This piece of deception was probably thought necessary . oti account of his strong attachment to the family in which he resided ; an attachment , which seems hardly to have lessened in the long interval which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that event , he describes this journey in a manner , which shews how deeply every circumstance had been imprinted on his mind . The piece is too long to quote , but in the conclusion lie thus speaks of his past occupations , and the prospects , which were then opening upon him . At six o'clock P. M. I arrived at Providence . To this succeeded a tedious , long , and unremitted apprenticeship ; and the promised fortnight was protracted to thirteen years ! But I dwelt in the bosom of a worthy family , and am cheered by the consciousness of having served my master faithfully ; and nra blessed with the satisfaction of knowing , that am beloved by his family ; and possessed with a strong hope of yet enjoying the ac. // complishment of my wishes ; of being agreeable to myself , and useful to my country ; and to crown all , I am restored to Andover ! ' p. 9 . We are told , that during his residence at Providence , his fidelity and diligence in business were most exemplary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conversation singularly amiable and attractive . ' He seems , indeed , to have there found a home , an ( 1 to have been cordially adopted into a family circle , where a kindness almost parental made him forget awhile his loneliness . In his letters from Andover and Cambridge , he always speaks in terms of the warmest affection and gratitude of his friends at Bloomsgrove , the name given to his residence at Providence . Bloomsgrov e , Providence , names which never occur to me , without calling up the most agreeable sensations-scenes of childhood and of youth , where I have passed so many happy hours , where I have lived so long and loved so sincerely ' - .. - abodes too of those friends , to whom , if to any , I look for continued affection-for continued parental fondness and solicitude , and with whom I yet hope often to mingle in the social circle-places and friends endeared to me by such ties , can I ever forget ? ' p. 127 . And again , March 17 , 1817 . Every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite my tenderest interest . Never does my heart glow with such warm affection , and tender sensibility as when moved by reflecting on this beloved and to me endeared spot . T is then all the sympathies of my soul expand , and in one fond embrace , encircle all its dear inhabitants , its friends , its cares , its pleasures and its sorrows . And such reflection is always produced by the perusal of your letters ; and while tracing in these the successive demonstrations of your affection and solicitude , I feel the nearest approximati&amp;n to the pleasures of consanguinity , and almost forget that I am an orphan . ' pp. 31 , 32 . His ardour for study never abated . His evenings , during his apprenticeship , were as Thithfully devoted to his own improvement , as his hours of daylight were to the duties of his employment . ' An inclination so strong and decided was riot to be overcome . By agreement , he was released from his apprenticeship one year sooner than usual . He then returned to Andover . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we can oniy allow ourselves to transcribe what relates to his feelings on revisiting the scenes of his earliest childhood . I had an additional motive in visiting this place . Andover . It was here I first learned that I was mortal . It was here I passed my infantile years . Here were spent my happiest hours of childish gaiety. 1'l , ose blissful seasons were engrossed by salutary study and playful diversions with my fellow school-mates . Unconscious of the future , I rambled , laughed , and sung , nor knew of evil . Ever grateful will be the recollection ofthese youthful scenes-ever dear to me this favoured villa , and dearer still its worthy inhabitants . Indescribable were my feelings , at again beholding t ! iem . My sensations were not unlike those of an exile restored to his native country after long and many years of sorrow and despimndency ! Thirteen years had done but little to obliterate the incidents of childhood or their connexions ; an ( l the former involuntarily revived in my memory to assist in identifying the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , for the fist seven years of my life , I found a home . Its venerable inmates , with the exception of one . were still living . By them 1 was cordially received and made paternally welcome . ' p. 20 . He remained at Andover , enjoying the benefit of the liberal provision made in Phillips Academy for the support of charity scholars , till he was prepared for Harvard University , where he was admitted in August , 181 6 . He soon acquired great reputath ) n as a scholar , and applied himself to study with a diligence too great for his constitution . At the close of his freshman year ( July 27 , 1817 , ) he thus writes to his friends at Providence . One year of my college life has almost passed , and yet I hardly feel wonted to the spot . I can scarcely realize that I am a Cambridge student . How swift is the flight of time ! Indeed at every successive period of my reflection upon it , the most striking peculiarity I note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flitted away like meteors of the night , and the golden hours of youth , which constitute the most important and interesting scene of life , are swiftly passing to their exit ! Old age will soon succeed , and then life 's little drama close forever ! he period of our existence is well compared to " a span , " " the dream of a night , " " a shadow , " " a vapour which appeareth for a moment , and then vanisheth away . " // T*venty-three years of the little space allotted me , are already numbered and finished . The last three or four of these , the interval between this and the time I lived with you , have been so rapid in their transit , that it seems scarcely possible they could form such a portion of my lift ' . The scenes and circumstances of my apprenticeship are as fresh in my memory , as if they occurreil but yeskrday , and the forms and features ot my friends and associates at that period , I trace with almost visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later date , are still less prominent in my recollection . With seeming surprise , therefore , I ask myself the question , " Am I , who was so recently an illiterate mechanic , already the subject of three years ' continued study ? Have I advanced so far as to be a Cambridge student ? " surely not the time , but the change of place and employment only give reality to the fact . ' pp. 133 , 134 . The spring vacation of 1818 he employed in studying chemistry . The beginning of the term loutid him in a very low state of health , and he reluctantly obtained leave of absence . He went to Aiidover , in the hope , that a short residence there would restore him . But , ' says his biographer , it was now too late ; and no medicine , nor change of place Coul ( l restore a frame , worn out by intense study , and hastened in its decay by the agonies of an aspiring mind struggling under the pressure of poverty* ' Sick and feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make one last effort for satisfying the impatient desire , which lie had ever felt , to know his parents , and the story ' of his birth . His mairitenance , until the time of his apprenticeship , had been paid for by a gentleman residing at a ( list ance of about sixty miles , who professed himself to be acting as the friend of ' ! iis father . Repeated but unsuccessful applications had been made to this gentleman by Person , and by his friends at his request , for the information , which he so anxiously desired . He now resolved to urge his request in person , and for this purpose he undertook and accomplished a journey into New Hampshire . The interview was granted , and upon his pressing his inquiries in the most determined manner , declaring that lie would not go till he was satisfied , he vas told the name of his mother , which be is not known , ' says his biographer , to have disclosed , ' and some l ) aI'ticulals of her person and history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received no answer to his questions respecting his father . He // was kindly and hospitably entertained by the gentleman , to whom he applied , and not only liberally assisted for the present , but dismissed with a promise of a future provision for his clothing and maintenance while at college . This promise was punctually perfovmed , but the relief came too late . Person survived this visit but a few weeks . On his return to Cambridge , he was unable to perform his college duties , and continued daily to decline , though tenderly watched and nursed in the house of a friend , till the lith of Octoher 1818 , when lie expired . His death was as gentle as his life . No wild and tumultuous passions disturbed the holy calm of either . ' It is some solace to our grief for those , whose lives have been long and eminently useful , that the good they have done lives after them . There are numberless memorials of the genius and worth of truly excellent men , which remind us continually that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly be said to have died . The form oi ' their existence only seems to he changed . It was the mind that we valued and that is still seen reforming , instructing , delighting mankind . But when the lot of death falls upon a young man , who has given proof of generous ambition supported by uncommon powers , we feel that we have sustained a loss of unknown extent . There is full room for the imagination to weary itself in tracing that future , which now can never be . What we before anticipated we lament , as if we had actually possesse ( l it . We think little of the accidents , which might have occasioned a more painful disappointment than even death . If we had before any doubts , they vanish now ; and we think ourselves certainly deprived of what we had only a distant and uncertain prospect of enjoying . But this disposition is proportioned to the nearness of our interest and the degree in which it is peculiar . The mother , mourning for a beloved child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every virtue , which a parent 's heart could wish . The soldier , disappointed of a battle , never doubts , that he should have returned from the field covered with glory . The merchant , whose ship is driven back by tempests , counts up his gains , and deplores his hard fortune in the loss of them no less than if they had already made a part of his store . When , on the other hand , it is the promised scholar , divine or statesman , whose expected public services death // forbids us longer to look for , there is little liveliness of regret in any , but those who feel the warmth of personal affection . Others , however well assured of the reasonableness of the hopes , which had been f*rmed , consider themselves as only remotely concerned in the event . Had he been long the object of their trust and confidence , had they been accustomed to rely on him in times of danger , had they experienced the benefit of his instructions or his benevolent labours , gratitude would claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave with a heavy heart . The aged patriot or philanthropist may have done all that in reason he could be expected to do . Every talent , he possessed , may have produced some useful and lasting effect . We may be deprived of nothing but the sight of a form , venerable by age , and worn out with exertion . Still , there is a feeling , superior to interest and calculation , which fills us with melancholy , and a oppressive grief when such an one is gathered to an honourable tomb . The world is not so ungrateful as many would represent it . Envy and jealousy may oppress and obscure while living , but the fault is sure to be redeemed , in a succeeding generation , by an ample measure of honour and fame . A public sorrow for the dead must be earned by being really useful . The promise of being so may cause some regret in those , who are thoroughly persuaded that the promise would have been performed . But it is a cold and interested sorrow , very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes over one , whose life has been a common blessing . Those , however , who have diligently employed even a few years in laying a foundation for future usefulness , have not lived in vain . A faithful narrative of their patient , persevering labour , their zeal in seeking all valuable knowledge , and their praiseworthy desire of excellence , may excite and direct others . Such narratives , too , make even strangers feel something of the same interest , to which we have just alluded , as belonging to those , who are bound to the deceased by some peculiar tie . It is one of the principal uses of biography , that , by exhibiting the common occupations , thoughts , feelings , designs , attachments , and aversions of the subject of it , it infuses the feelings of private and personal friendship into every reader . Hence the aid , which this sort of writing derives from familiar letters , coming warm from the heart , and artlessly disclosing the inmost workings of the soul and // fOct. the affections . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lents of a life from such letters . The hero tells his own story . We seem to live and converse with him , and thus acquire that familiar acquaintance , which makes every fact important , that has any infl*ence on his happiness . The letters contained in this volume9 though comprising a short period , not much enlivened by adventures , can hardly fail to give a lively and pleasing impression of the writer 's mind . Some of them are the letters of a very young man , but of one remarkable for malurity of understanding , and placed in Circumstances , which command our sympathy . We witness the gradual progress of his reason ; we see it expandim*g and acquiring strength . We see him snifering poverty and privation , anti disease , yet still applying himself to study , with Uhibelihg resolution . We see him surrounded by the most discouraging difficulties , yet still maintaiiiing. for the most part , an unbroken cheerfulness . At one time , ' he says in a letter to a friend , I look forward to the termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation ; at anotner , a thousand difficult ; es intrude and oppose my passage to the " temple of science . " Hope and perseverance , however , still keep uppermost ; and , strengthened and encouraged by the Pxercise of these princil ) les , I may struggle through the rough road of poverty and trial , and finally obtain my destined object . ' ( p. 89 . ) In a subsequemit letter , written soon after attaining the age of twenty-one , he complains of the difficulty of shaking off boyish habits ; but as a proof that he had his serious moments , he adds an ode to Contemplation , from which we select th' following lines : Shew me the green , delightful bower , Where friendship passed the happy hour , While pure , its little realm ; Show me the hills , the trees , and fields , The plants and flowers the garden yields , And venerable elm . Nor here abate thy fancied course , But inward fly with filial force , And search the lov 'd domain ; O'er every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here lives a friend , And such will e'er remain ! " // 0 happy Thought ! 0 heavenly power ! That thus can charm the lonely hour , And soothe my pensive breast ! Be thou , Imagination , near , For absent joYs . Io thou appear , And lull my cares to rest pp. 9* , 93 . There are several poetical piec*y in this volume , some of a light and others of a gra*er ca*t . They discover , in general , a good taste and a facility of expression . Most of them were written before lie went to Cambridge . Had he lived , it is probable lie would before long have ceased to cultivate this talent ; for it is evi ( lent , that he was not destined to acquire fame as a poet . We shall insert but one fu:ther specimen of his poetry . It is an ode to Reflection , written at Providence , May 1817* . The sun in the west is slowly descending , And ( lay 's lucid visions recede troin our view , While night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness anew . How sweet is it then to indulge recollection , To prove the kind bondage of nemory 's chain ; The present forego , and in fond retrospection Live over the scenes of our childhood again . The sun of our life , how bright at its rising ! Unotscured by a cloud it darted its ray ! And in lustre , to youth 's ardeiit hope most enticing , Portended a brilliant and peace-ruling day ! 1-low sweet was our friendship , how pure were our pleasures* How fond our attachments in youth 's glowing age ! Untaught to succumb to adversity 's pressures , Or feel the keen blastings of envy and rage . How Fancy 's bland visions conspired to invite us , And joy in prospective perennial held But alas ! her illusions soon ceased to delight us , And dark disappointment her radiance veiled . Now tossed on the billows of life 's troubled ocean , While hope faintly beams on each sorrow-fraught wave , We wait for that rest to succeed the commotion , I ' Which heaven preludes in the sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer this work as possessing any important claims to the attention of the literary world . It is modest and unpretending , and taken for what it l ) rofesses to be , the history of a youth of amiable and excellent character , of extraordiuary powers of mind , and animated by an irrepressible zeal for knowledge and usefulness , we trust it will not be found barren of amusement or profit . We may sum up the history of Person iLi ' his own words- ' a poor inechanic , wholly destitute of pecuniary means to assist himself , without parents or friends to aid him , unfavoured by any efficient patronage , and going too among strangers , sought an education ; succeeded ; has actually passed its first stage , and is commencing its second , in the first literary institution in the country ! Never let one despair of success in a similar enterprize hereafter ! '
