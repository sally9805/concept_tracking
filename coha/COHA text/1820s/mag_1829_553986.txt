txt ART . VLI. -1 . Poems ; by the Author of Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse . ' Boston . S. 0 . Goodrich. 1828. 2 . Guido , a Tale ; Sketches from history , and other Poems . By IANTHE . New York . G. &amp; C. Carvill. 1828 . OUR readers may perhaps recollect the essentials of a gentleman , as given by the dancing and music master , in Moli*re 's Burgeois Gentilbomme . ' La philosophic , ' says the latter , est qucique chose ; mais la musique , monsieur , la musique . ' La musique et la danse , ' responds the maitre * danser , Ia niusique et la danse , c'est l* tout cc qu'il faut . ' Most , we imagine , who have attempted to define poetry , have fallen into an error similar to that of these worthy professors , namely , that of mistaking a part for the whole , of giving a single one of its qualities , as its only essential and peculiar attribute . To talk of the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and that prose , as it is sometimes talked of , seems to us to be using words to little profit . The only proper mode of defining it , is to describe it . It is not distinguished by a single characteristic merely , but by several ; and of two or three of these , from their importance in their various relations , notwithstanding so much has already been written upon them , we are induced to speak more at large . // 221 Schiller somewhere accounts for the emotion excited by the history of some perilous adventure or hair-breadth escape , by our identifying ourselves , for the moment , with those of whom we read . When this is not done , we are not moved ; for emotion is grounded on a sort of blind consciousness of similar danger . The history of a criminal , for example , through the several stages of guilt and punishment , excites the little emotion which it does , from the impossibility of making ourselves one with him . He is a being of another race ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeys different laws . Therefore , although his fate may make our brain ( liZZy , it does not stir the heart . Extend this idea , make it universal , instead of particular , and we arrive at one of the constituent parts of true poetry . Poetry is not only a description of outward forms and actions , and inward feelings ; it not only presents the magic mirror , in which we may behold the silent procession of the present and the past , as it issues out of one gloomy arch to vanish away through another ; but by the spell which it casts over us , it makes us present and busy in the scenes which are described . As we read , we are scarce conscious of our own personal and peculiar existence , but seem to have exchanged feelings , and resolves , and sympathies with the author , or the actors in his drama . We are no longer sitting alone and solitary , but are one of the nine and twenty who in a compagnie toward Canterbury wolden ride ' ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-weed rent from its fastenings , and tost on the waves ; we are pricking over the plain by the side of Una ; we fold our mantle , regally to fall . ' In short , changing the words of Schiller a little , and giving them a more universal application , we would say , that one quality essential to poetry , is that which makes the reader feel as the poet , or as the persons through whom he speaks . It must possess the power of enchanting us away from the present and the real , into an ideal world ; and of making us move in that world , as we do in the land of dreams , feeling , except from some occasional fits of returning consciousness , as if the shadows of the imagination had a positive and substantial existence But this is not all . Poetry deals with man 's higher and better nature . It springs from the still chambers of the soul , and its object is the enlargement of the soul in all things which are worthy of an immoital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , or of the changeful spirit of man , must // be made subservient , or , whatever else they may be , they will not be poetry . It has been called a creation . It is so in this sense . Itwidens the circle in which man is imprisoned by his imperfections . It purifies , it exalts , it ennobles . In its highest sense , it is the evolution , under appropriate forms , of perfect purity , loveliness , and power ; of a perfection which indeed exists not here , but of which the mind , in some of its more blessed moments , may obtain partial glimpses . Indeed , we might almost say , that it is the representation , or rather the embodying , of the attributes of God himself , for the simple reason that he has , and alone has , centered within himself perfect beauty and perfect sublimity . Uniting , then , the two qualities which we deem most essential , we should esteem that the highest poetry , which unfolded moral excellence in its greatest amplitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this expansion of being , in the highest possible degree , to the reader 's own nature . The poet may not he able to paint perfection , nor could the attributes of Deity , even if mortal could grasp them , be brought forward in their abstract truth ; for they must be developed under sensible images . If , for example , they be made to inhere in man , they can not be unfolded in that awful holiness in which they exist in him to whom they are but modes of being , lest the truth which meets the sensual eye be violated . As long as they abide with earth , they must necessarily be infected with the wavering and taint of mortality . All the efforts of the poet will enable him , in his descriptions , to attain only to an approximation to perfection . But he must strive for this . The tendency of what he writes must be to advance men towards perfection . That this quality is essential to all poetry , we believe not merely from theory , but also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most universally admired , which have lived through ages , and been on the tongues of all nations , are distinguished by it . We have said that there is nothing perfectly sublime or beauliful , but the attributes of Deity ; that there is nothing which we admire , or love , or reverence , but the perfections or the reflex of the perfections of that Secret One ; and that everything really poetical will impress at least some one of these more deeply upon the heart Examine instances , and this becomes more and more apparent War is the perpetual theme of song , and there is in it , indeed , a poetry fearfully // and terribly sublime . But it is not in the extinction of human life . Simple cold-blooded , malignant murder is revolting . All the mechanical parts of a battle might be described , warhorns might be blown , and men hewn down ,  --  but if this were the whole of a battle , not a poetical emotion would ever be excited by it . But in the struggle and storm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quiet moments hides the deeper workings of the mind , and this it is that makes it the subject of the highest poetry . In the hands of the poet , this strife of matter becomes a talisman to call into being the sublimest energies of the soul ,  --  energies which are awaked from their slumber only by the operation of some such mighty and exciting cause . If the writer can infuse such a living spirit into his description , that corresponding energies may be roused up in our own minds , then is he a poet . If he effect not this , he is a mere annalist . The conception of the character of Shakspeare 's Richard the Third is sublhne . But in what does this sublimity consist ? In its strangeness or novelty ? In his desperate and terrific villany ? No ; in neither of these . The conflict and oppositions of the viler passions , are but means used to exhibit in a stronger light the true poetry of the character ; and this lies in the ceaseless and untiring energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , and uncontrollable , to be turned aside by any opposition , or stayed by any barrier . This is the portion of moral excellence here developed ; this clings to the memory when everything else of the play is forgotten , and lies at the bottom of our admiration of the poet 's power . To be sure its object in this particular case is most criminal but separate this immutability of purpose from the object towards which it is directed , and you have , not in its infinitude , but to a certain extent , an attribute of the Deity himself . So also is it with external nature . The steep and battlemented cliff , with its sunless caverns ; the ocean for ever roaring and rolling onwards ; the soundless depths of the silent skies ; the cataract , notching its centuries in the eternal rocks , ' or the gentler show of a spring or summer landscape ,  --  become poetical by exercising a similar influence on the moral man . Whilst the mind is filled with the conception of such scenes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of association which hind it down to the frivolities and vain circumstance of the present , drop off ; it returns back to its simplicity ; the voice that tells of its true glory is no longer drowned in earthly tumult , and // its enfranchised tendencies may soar up free and strong . The effect of such descriptions may be comparatively weak from the less direct mode in which they act ; but there is one thing connected with them which seems worth observing , and that is , that they always possess a healthful moral tendency . The heart of man may become corrupted , so that it can not give back the image of Him after whom it was fashioned ; but nature can not undergo the degrading processes to which man is subject . It is pure and fresh from the hands of God , and will hardly bear even association with moral deformity ; and consequently how enlightened soever may be the mind , it can feel such scenes only in proportion to its purity . No one can take delight in them , whose heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined from the grossness of sensual appetites . The representations which poetry gives of the perfections of our moral nature may be presented under any form , under that of the ballad or the epic , of the rushing and panting pindaric , or the humbler song . The strong contrasts of vice and crime may be employed ; the clamorings of the viler passions may be alloxved ; ambition may build , selfishness may undermine , bloodthirstiness may destroy ; but all this is for the sake of a contrast that shall display in more vividness and truth that which is the highest and most true . Let not these be esteemed the essence , the su6stra*um of poetry . If they be , the temple may be built , the altar raised , billows of incense may rise from the swinging censers , the massive valves of the inmost adyta may be flung open , and the maddening and prophetic vapor curl up about the tripod , but the oracle that issues thence is a lying one . The glare and inflaming odors , the pageantry and magnificence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not always ; and with the belief in the oracle , must the credit of the shrine decay . The voice of poetry must come from the inmost and holiest sanctuary of truth . Indeed , if it be not one and the same with truth , if it be informed with any spirit save that which purifies and exalts , so far as this is the case , it has within itself a principle to work its destruction . A single generation may listen to the outpourings of a perverted mind , but a series of generations , never . By them , the true will be separated from the untrue , that which is instinct with trustworthy hopes and aspirations from the philosophy which is false and degrading , by an infallibility which can not be questioned . If the view which we have taken of the subject be correct , // 225 then is the education both of mind and heart , to which the poet must subject himself , a thinb of no slight moment . For what does he undertake ? Nothingless , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill his race with the worthiest sentiments and emotions of which humanity is capable . And whence are these to come ? If it be a law of our nature , that we can not by any words make others comprehend what we ourselves have never comprehended , or feel what we ourselves have never felt , then surely they must be transfused from his own soul . He must he above his race , if he would raise them . If he would make their hearts swell with new and strange emotions , they must first dwell in his own heart in all their vividness and intensity . It is 1 ) 0 common man , but one more loftily endowed and dwelling apart , *a l ) rophet of the living God alone ,  --  that can bow himself upon the dead clay and breathe into it the breath of life and the quickening spirit . It were not an unavailing task , to call to remembrance the ideas which the great masters of song have themselves entertained and expressed of the c1 ' racter and acquirements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retainin all the simplicity and easy and confidincr faith of childhood ; g impatient , impetuous , and full of life , with the blood ever runniag races through his veins , yet ever under the guidance of Reason , not cold and pale as she is wont to be painted , but wise with an earnest wisdom , and warm with the glow and the *freshness of a better clime . Such have the members of that ancient brotherhood , whose own tones have come echoing down to us through the abyss and silence of the ages , loved to picture the poet . And following the hints which they have given us , we may go still - farther , and sketch what they seem to have thought that he should propose to himself to become . He must be skilled in human nature , and not only must he be familiar with the spoken word and the visible act , but with that philosophy according to which these are regulated . He must ponder deeply the motives of the heart , and be able by a quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cherish his imagination and cultivate his taste by a careful study of all those , whose works give evidence that they felt within them the strivings of the diviner mind ; not to imitate , but to gain directions which may guide him to those guarded and enchanted fountains of inspiration from whenee they thertiselves have drawn . He must be learned in all , the branches of human k // his mind maybe full of associations . He must become master of the most copious vocabulary , that copia verborum , not less important to the poet than to the orator ; and not only take pains to acquire command of words , but he must study into their powers , and busy himself in learning all those reflected hues and shades of meaning , with which they have been tinged by association , as if they had been dipt in the warm flush of a rainy sunset ' ; for this is the distinguishing peculiarity of a poetic dialect , that its words not only suggest the single and immediate idea to the mind , but come linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anxious labor must be to cultivate his own heart , to cleanse it from all the taints which it too easily acquires by coming in contact with the world , and to bring it back to its primitive and unsophisticated state . He must strive earnestly to purify his imagination ; to fill his mind with noble desires and motives ; to shut out every debasing influence ; to divest himself of every selfish , local , or party prejudice ; to become , in truth and in deed , a citizen of the world ; to ennoble and expand his heart till it become a great sea , which shall gather tribute from the fountains of the whole earth , to purify and again give back their contributions in the shower and the fruitful dew . He i*nust strive to make himself perfect in all good and wise and great things , and to become a living example of that perfection upon which his soul 's eye should be for ever fixed . Thus educated , those restless yearnings of the spirit , those unquenchable desires , ever thirsting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real moving power that impels the true poet forward , will be left free to act ; and those high instincts haunting the eternal mind , a presence that will not be put by , ' will find for themselves a tongue and a ready utterance . There is nothing in the nature of poetry that could lead one to suppose that its flame should burn less high in this country than in any other . On the contrary , everything appears favorable to its cultivation . Nursed amidst the grandest exhibitions of nature , bred amongst a race enterprising and energetic to a proverb , free as the very gales of heaven , and conscious of it , and rejoicing in it with the joy of a child ,  --  one unacquainted with the truth could hardly dream that amidst all this life and energy and freedom , so few should have appeared to do honor to themselves or their country . There are living amongst us , we well know , those who have obtained a deserved reputation ; but we are only repeating what has been said many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation rests more on what they have shown themselves capable of doing , than upon what they have done . They have wasted their powers too much upon performances at the celebrations of literary societies or the pages of Magazines or Souvenirs ; on things to be praised for a day , to meet with an affectionate reception into newspaper corners , and then to be crushed under the weight of the like productions with which the next year labors . Our most able men have done just enough to show that they have within them an exhaustless mine of treasure ; they have exhibited a few specimens from it to the world , and then have ceased working it . We have entered into the discussion of the nature of poetry , so that we might more clearly expose the cause which , it seems to us , has contributed more than any other to its present state among us . This cause is imitation , a fault so manifestly prevalent in almost all which is Th*iied from the American press , that instead of attempting to show it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it must necessarily exert upon the poet . In what we have to say upon this topic , we would not be misunderstood . We use the term in its popular sense . A man may , and indeed does , form his character from the imitation of a thousand different models , and his mind is moulded by the action of other minds . But so long as he pours out in their natural direction , those thoughts which , from whatever source they may have been primarily derived , have now become mingled up with the fountain of his own thoughts , and blended with and colored by his habitual feelings , he is original . He is an imitator when he is induced to follow some model in a path which , considering his present habits of mind and acquisitions , would not be the one in which he would naturally go , if he were under no foreign guidance . If what we have said be correct ; if poetry be indeed nothing but the beautiful , the fit , the true , developed more strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the contrast of opposites ,  --  now impersonated as in the dramas of Shakspeare , now given forth in a more abstract form as in the high and impassioned aspirations of Wordsworth ; if the perfection of the moral nature be the foundation of the whole edifice ; i4 in short , the true rank of a poem is to be determined by a comparison of the strength , truth , and enlargement of the views of moral being finally evolved by poetic machinery , with what is infinite , true , and unchanging ; -. then all imitation is for- // *PhflC1tC ( *fl Poems . bidden , for , from the very nature of the case , it must flow from the writer 's own heart . He must make himself familiar with the lights and shades of human character . He may learn the words and diction of another , and accustom himself to their modes of presenting their thoughts . But when he has done this , all that he has acquired , is the means of exhibiting more powerfully truths which lie deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the statue is called forth from the block . It is the form in which the spirit is to be presented , not the spirit itself . This must exist in himself , a constituent portion of his being , or to him it exists nowhere . He who copies another must always give a false copy , so long as he goes no farther than externals . He who ' would truly imitate Wordsworth or Byron , must possess a mind not only capable of appreciating their minds , but one which possesses all the depth and capacity of theirs . The ultimate source of all poetry must be the writer s own mind ; it is a copy of it as affected by different circumstances , and he can not give a poetic being to truths which have not first dwelt there . Could one born blind describe to you the magnificence and grandeur of our inland forests , as they sink and swell far away over valley and mountain ? Can he bring it up before the mind , as if you yourself were standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glancing like a heavy sea , and bearing in your ears the smothered roar that rose up from within the solitudes of the great wilderness ? And can it be more easy , can it be possible , for him who has never felt them , to portray the excellences and perfections of moral being ? the pure and disinterested love , the enduring and unwavering self-sacrifice , the lofty purpose , the high resolve , the infinite and inexplicable longing , reaching for ever onward and still farther onward ? If , for a moment , he leave the guide in whose footsteps he has followed , he loses himself ; and the most superficial , the most ignorant , the most debased even , will see the continued stumbling and exaggeration , and feel that all those nicer touches which distinguish truth and a feeling of truth are wanting . Again ; there are no two minds alike . Whatever they might have been originally , they become as different as their modes of education , as the scenes among which they have been bred , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as different as the influences by which they have been surrounded . With such a difference of character , it is absurd to suppose that the volume of their their . thoughts should flow in // 229 th' same channel . Style is artificiul ; it is easily changed , or at least admits of it to a great extent . But the mind , although to a certain degree , in its more superficial and as yet unfixed parts , it may be changed on occasion , can not have its whole substance fused and remoulded into another form at a moment 's warning . The germ , that began to unfold at the first moment of life , and which has sprung up and through years of sunshine and of storm grown into the rigidity and determined structure of a great tree , may have its branches trimmed and pruned away , and by cultivation may be freshened into a more luxuriant beauty ; but its roots and trunk are fixed , and their bent can not be entirely or easily altered . From the individual differences of minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of f ) Oetry , it follows that an essential imitation can scarcely exist . It may extend to mere words and style , but if it extend no farther it must always be seen . For there is a correspondence between style and thought . We recognise it in the simplicity of thought and simplicity of expression in Addison , between the clumsy but gigantic strength of Johnson 's mind and the elephant march of his style . The want of this correspondence , if not seen , is felt by all . There is no way of disguising it . The same dazzle may be reflected from the ripples of the shallow brook and the waves of the fathomless sea ; both may be restless and noisy , but there is not an ear so dull as not to perceive at once the difference between the sudden and asthmatic turbulences of the former and the deep rolling of the latter 's tides over their ocean floor . ' Neither can the little rivulet of thought that tinkles and trickles through a common mind , ever be mistaken for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned genius . The danger of imitation is then obvious . Whether the poet send out a rude and ill-bred progeny of his own imaginations clad in vestments purloined from the sons of kings , or lead to the muster the thoughts of others , manacled by his narrow conception of them , and their free motion tortured and cramped by his narrower vocabulary , this want of correspondence can hardly fail of being perceived . And even if it be not , the effect will hardly be better . The reader will be attended by a feeling , which this want will inevitably create , that there is a lack of sincerity in the implied professions which are made . There is a tenderness , an earnestness , a vitality , in truth and true feeling , which can never be mistaken , and for the absence of which nothing can compensate ; whilst the manner in which such writings // are produced is utterly inconsistent with any strnng emotion . And when the reader begins to *ispect that the poet is attempting to make him weep by a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain instead of struggling up warm and free from the heart , be they ever so loud or burning , the echoes of his own heart will cease to give hack answers . He ceases to be moved , for he is not compelled to believe that the poet was moved . There is another power which characterizes the true poet with a more marked distinctness perhaps than any other , but it is one that can not exist in connexion with imitation . We mean that concentrating power of the imagination , by which he is enabled by a single hint , a line , a word , a sketch the most slight and rapid , to make palpable to the mind 's eye the whole of a magnificent vision . He but touches the key-note , and our whole souls tremble with the long chorus of harmony that bursts spontaneously upon it . Let us read as long as we will , he is always new . Every line , every word is a spell at whose utterance the doors of a long gallery of glorious pictures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes and hearts with images , which shall dwell there not only for the moment but for ever . But the show of the imitator consists of a single picture which is scarcely seen before it vanishes away into forgetfulness . The one speaks to the eye alone , the other not only to the eye , but the heart . The excellepce of the one consists solely in what he says ; that of the other in discovering and laying open to yourself a pathway to an untrodlen land - of wonders . He is not only a poet himself , but he make his reader one also . He endows him for the moment with the gift of intuition , of prophecy , of creation . The one presents to you a wrought statue , marble , cold , and dead ; the other a form , living , breathing , and trembling with passion . The writings of the one are the full grown and muscular man , moving stately and strong with the self-moving power of his own free will ; those of the other are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may trace the outline of the man indeed , but find nothing of the fulness and life of the well knit frame which gave it existence . We have spoken thus fully of imitation , because we conceive that it has exerted a more deadening influence upon our poetry than anything else , and it is important that its influence should be duly appreciated . The peculiar tendency to it manifested by our poets , has its origin , we imagine , in the too great admi // 231 ration of the English writers of the present day , which exists amongst the reading public , and which can endure nothing that is not colored by their peculiarities . There are many authors in the English tongue , whom we can neither admire nor study too much ; and whatever of vigor and grandeur they may im- part to the mind , there is little danger of their infusing a spirit of imitation into any one who studies them as he ought . But the fact that almost all that does honor to our language has had its birth in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything that comes thence . Not only do we admire , as they should be admired , her Bacons and Taylors , her Miltons and Shakspeares ,  --  the authors who have passed through their century of probation and not been found wanting ,  --  .  --  but we how down and worship with a foolish idolatry whatever idol of the day the unsteady voice of the multitude may please to install . We have indeed shaken off her civil yoke , but we hug yet closer and closer the chains of intellectual bondage . We have broken our manacles , to wear the name Of freedom , graven on a heavier chain . ' Some poet by a lucky hit captivates the changeling populace . He is puffed in thejournals , he is trumpeted in the reviews , and so true is it that distance lends enchantment to the view , ' that , when it has reached our shores , we receive this contemporary praise of a contemporary writer with an undoubting trust , as if it were the voice of many succeeding generations deciding the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him with a far more deep and wholesale admiration than fashion can make an Englishman do . To use the illustration of another , the object at which we gaze acquires an unnatural magnitude by being seen through the mists of the Atlantic . This feeling of undoubting admiration of what , for the time being , is admired on the other side of the water , is shared in some degree by our poets . And , besides that whatever one admires he almost unconsciously imitates , the imitator of the fashionable model of the day may win a sort of respectability at an easy price . His path is already marked out for him , and the obstacles that encounter a first discoverer have been removed ; whilst he who would cut his way into an undiscovered country arid people it with his own peculiar imaginations , has a thousand difilculties to overcome . He must expect often to fail in his attempts ; his iiipward longings and aspirations will be often baf // fled and beat back ; and if , after all his toil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world have all gathered to behold some one whom they have lifted into the triumphal car , and the surest way of drawing any eyes upon himself is to mingle with the long line of imitatQrs who swell out the procession . And the certainty of a little present notice is too often sufficient to overbalance the uncertainty of a future and lasting fame . But this time-serving is most unworthy of the poet . Let him remember that when Rome goes out to do honor to her returning mighty one , the multitude may indeed cast their eyes on the Dacian slave that follows iii the train of the victor , but he is looked on only as a slave and a trophy . His presence there may do honor to his conqueror , but not to himself . There is another fault in the greater proportion of our poetry , and one which we imagine is in a great measure occasioned by the habits of which we have been speaking . We refer to the attention which is given to single points , sentences , exl ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . It would seem sometimes as if it were the sole object of the poet to collect together all the elegancies and prettinesses of language , and that whilst he was thus stringing pearls , ' he had forgotten that these alone are but insignificant things in a true poem .. His great end should be , not solely nor chiefly to bring before the mind pleasant associati6ns and images and allusions , but something far hjgher ,  --  to unfold to the mental vision , and to stamp upon the heart , the sublimest truths of moral and intellectual being . All these single parts are necessary ; they should sustain and support each other ; they are the stone of which the building is reared , and should be touched with a Grecian chisel and ornamented with Grecian art . We might compare a poem to the path which winds up about a solitary hill that overlooks an extend *d country . As we ascend step by step , the prospect gradually expands and opens itself on the eye , and now we view this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ad higher , the scene is enlarged , until at length we gain the summit , when suddenly the whole field of vision bursts upon us in all its vastness and beauty . If the slopes of the hill be green with springing grass , and the sl*adows of the scattered trees be thick , and the running waters gush up into their sandy basins and play down through the gullies and gorges of the hill , the pleasure of the ascent will be much increased . But the pleasure of as * . cending would be but scant , if there were nothing but these V // beauties scattered along the path , and no broad and commanding view of a pleasant land to lure us up . So it is with a poem ; - it is not enough that chance flowers should be ever bursting up along the way , but when we have finished the reading of it , the impress of some great i*ea , or worthy sentiment , should be left deep in the heart . Our remarks have not been directed against the poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our poets . On the other hand , we think the author of the first volume on our list is remarkably free from it . She has too much strength , too much of real fervency and unity of feeling , and her thoughts flow in too distinct and determinate a channel of their own , ever to blend with those of others , in the way which those of a successful imitator must . She everywhere discovers , too , a far more than common knowledge of human nature ; not of its mere superficial exhibitions , but of its inmost and best attributes . In a word , and we esteem it no small praise , she possesses the heart and mind of a true poet . But notwithstanding this , we confess that the volume is uot one that we take peculiar pleasure in commenting on ; not because it is not a good one , and far better than most of those which appear from our press , but because we feel assured that it is not such a one as its author is capable of producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of which it is made up , which we could conscientiously quote as fair specimens of what we believe her real powers to be . The great fault is , the want of finish . One can hardly read a piece in the volume , without feeling in his very soul , that it is the result*of strong and natural emotion ; but there are many times when he will feel that the writer has failed of conveying all of it , as it existed in her own breast , to that of the reader . Some little thing is wanting ; or a line in bad taste breaks in on the onward flow of the illusion ; or an idea , which apparently has no necessary connexion with the subject , draws away the mind from the leading idea , and this in almost every case is evidently the result of carelessness . They are the chance flourishes , full of strains of exquisite melody , yet interrupted by many a false note , which the musician flings off the keys in a moment of inspiration , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volume , where that fundamental law of all things , that the ef*ects described , shall be the legitimate ones of the causes introtroduced , is transgressed ; *. - when the poet could hardly have VOL. xxIx. - No. 64. 30 // felt that complete identity with the characters , and presence in the situations described , which always must be felt by one who would speak words of truth and power , sufficient to deceive the reader into a like feeling of sameness . In the Funeral of the Osage Warrior , ' for example , we can hardly suppose that the writer had forgotten everything unconnected with the subject , and delivered herself up solely to the influence of the causes brought into view . But in a hook made up of a multitude of different pieces , on a multitude of different subjects , all this , and much more than we here find , was to be expected . Notwithstanding its faults , passages of great beauty and truth are everywhere scattered th*ough the volume ; so much so that we are afraid that our remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them of the highest encouragement . The author 's faults , or what seem to us to be her faults , we have stated fully and strongly ; had they arisen from any lack of power , we should have said nothing of them . But they do not ; whilst the thoughts and feelings everywhere expressed , are too valuable not to make us earnestly desire that the community should feel them , as she is capable of making them felt . Instead of descending to minute criticism , we shall lay before our readers some extracts taken almost at random . The first that we make , is from a piece entitled Tomb of Cecilia Metella . ' The closing paragraph is very fine . But thou hast left no trace On history 's tablet , and in vain we ask These voiceless stones of thee . Was hoarded wealth Thine idol , like thy husband 's ? - didst thou vaunt His venal honors , and exalt the power Of the triumvir , in thy purple robes , Presiding at his feasts , till Rome was sick Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy Penates breathe the matron prayer With trembling for his sake ?  --  or in the grief Of solitary widowhood , deplore His breathless bosom pierced by Parthian darts ? - There is no record on these mighty walls Of thy lost deeds . Even thy sarcophagus Is rifled , and the golden urn where slept Thy mouldering ashes , proved but fitting bribe For the rapacious hand . Thy scatterd dust , How doth it differ from the household slave 's ? // Who neath thy bidding at the distaff wrought , Or bent with sterner toil , in ponderous vase , Brought the cool Marcian waters , or perchance Through sinuous mazes of embroidery 's art Guided the weary needle . But in vain We stand communing with the faithless tomb That cast thee forth. - The strong cemented rock Lays claim to immortality ,  --  but dust , Man 's dust , must yield each element a part , To pay creation 's loan , nor can he cling To the brief memory of a shadowy race , Save through his deeds . 0 Wonian , nurse of Man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the drear pyramid ; - enshrine thyself Amid thy buried virtues , in the heart Of him who loves thee ; make thy monument The graces of thine offspring , and the thanks Of all who mourn . So shalt thou miss the pomp Of this world 's triumph , and thy noteless tomb Be glorious in the resurrection morn. * Our next extract has all the antique quaintness and richness of our elder poets . Whether it be that the tinge of conceit gives more prominence to the associated thought , that the seeming rudeness of the setting makes the richness of the jewel more apparent , or from some other cause , we know not ; but to us there is often an exceeding beauty in pieces of this description . It seems as if the poet , after having in vain striven , by every other mode , to give utterance to the fulness of his feelings , were at length forced by despair , in part but to express That exceeding comeliness Which his fancy doth so strike , To borrow language of dislike .

There was a tint of rose On check and lip ; he touched the veins with ice , And the rose faded. - Forth from those blue eyes // There spake a wishful tenderness ,  --  a doubt Whether to grieve or sleep , which Innocence Alone can wear . With ruthless haste he bound The silken fringes of their curtaining lids For ever. - There had been a murmuring sound With which the babe would claim its mother 's ear , Charming her even to tears. - The spoiler set flis seal of silence .  --  but there breathed a smile So fixed and holy from that marble brow ,  - -  Death gazed and left it there ; - he dared not steal The signet-ring of heaven. * There is much beauty too in the lines , To an Absent Child .

' The greatest merit of the volume , as we have before inti*-mated , consists in single paragraphs , and thoughts which we may everywhere find beautifully expressed , and most tender and elevated in sentiment . Of such passages we might make extracts without number . But we have room for only one more . It is from The Pilgrims .

Long , with straining eye They watched the lessening speck. - Heard ye no shriek Of anguish , when that bitter loneliness Sank down into their bosoms ? No ! they turn Back to their dreary , famished huts , and pray ! Pray ,  --  and the ills which haunt this transient life Fade into air . Up in each girded breast There sprang a rooted and mysterious strength , A loftiness ,  --  to face the world in arms , To strip the pomp from sceptres , and to lay Upon the sacred altar , the warm blood Of slain affections , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume before us is also by a lady , and is likewise made up of a number of short poems . They belong chiefly to that class , if indeed there be any such class , whose office is simply and solely to please . The burden of most of them , is tried love , love militant , and love triumphant . He who should look into them hoping to see a strong light thrown down into the deep places of human nature , or to find glimpses of a high and far philosophy , would be disappointed ; but if he would relieve himself of heavy thoughts , or pleasure himself of a summer afternoon with dreams in which youth loves to revel , he will find them well fitted for his purpose . Most of them are such lays as the troubadour might have composed for his courtly and gallant audience , and are made to be sung amidst the garden shadows by moonlight , underneath a sky for ever blue , and when the fragrant wind is throbbing with the pulses of a perpetual and invisible music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of poetry . It does not raise the soul aloft , infusing into it the sterner and sublimer sentiments , but it wins it away from the din and dust of the world , and lulls it into a delicious rest . There are passions and feelings in the human heart , deeper than the love which romance pictures forth . They lie cloistered and apart in its inmost cells , and grow unseen into strength . They are the life of man 's life , and the strength of his strength ; the most deeply cherished and hoarded of all ; but whatever influence they may exert on his actions , they are feelings which he gives not forth willingly in words to the world , even if he himself fully understand them . When , therefore , he finds them embodied in the creation of the poet , he is ready to be acted upon in the most powerful manner . He has yearned for sympathy , as man always must in whatever he himself feels strongly , and has found it . His soul leaps with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  the poet has given a direction and voice to his emotions , and they throng up reinless and masterless to the outlet , like the struggle of many waters . He whose power reaches to these feelings , and who can call them forth from their hiding-places , exercises the most despotic sway over man ,  --  more despotic from their very unfitness to be the subject of the road-side talk . But this power , and clear-sighted knowledge of the human heart , are rarely possessed , and it is well perhaps that they are not . There are many times in which we can read with delight an Italian love tale , when a drama , even of Shakspeare , would be a weariness and a fever . These poems do not belong to that higher class of which we have been speaking ; but they do not on that account fail of being very beautiful , and for many readers , no doubt , may possess a higher interest than those . We shall make one or two extracts , and , if we had room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reader 's and our own account . In general , there is a great equality throughout the volume . The characteristics are almost everywhere the same ; the same gentleness , tenderness , easy versification , and tinge of romance . The poem , from which the book derives its name , is a simple , short , and well told story . It is of two brothers of a noble family , the elder of whom , Guido , is feeble and sickly , possessing not the form that ladies love to look on and to charm , ' and unfit for all warlike exercises , but gifted with intellect and genius ; whilst Julio , the younger brother , the // cherished one of his mother , and the pride of his father , is skilled in all knightly feats and attainments , and fitted equally to grace the camp or the court . Guido falls in love with Floranthe , hut she , although she looks upon him with a most sisterly regard , has given her heart to the younger brother . Guido discovers at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ne'er bestow her hand On one whose wealth was but his battle-brand . ' Whatever it may cost himself , he resolves not to prevent their happiness ; and so he enters a monastery , leaving titles , estates , and her whom he had loved , to his more fortunate brother . The descriptions of the two brothers , of the awakening and gradual growth of Guido 's love , and other parts of the poem , are very finely done ; but taking them from their connexion , as well as the analyzing of such a story , is somewhat like tearing a flower in pieces to show its beauty . We think the following lines from The Mother , ' possess much beauty . Her tall graceful form Was bending o'er him , and one round white arm Supported his fair head , while her hand prest Her bosom , as she feared that he might start To feel the quickened pulses of her heart . Yet still she drew him nearer to her breast Almost unconsciously . At length , he woke , And the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle murmurings of a brook Along its pebbly channel . ' p. 101 . Oh ! but to watch the infant as he lies Pillowed upon his mother 's breast ; his eyes Fixed on her face , as if his only light On earth beamed from that face with fondness bright ; Or to gaze on him sleeping , while his cheek Moves with her heart 's glad throbbings that bespeak Feeling too full for words ; to see him break The silken chains of slumber and awake All light and beauty , while he lisps her name Mother ! ' although his childish lips can frame No other sound-oh ! who , with joy like this Could ask from Heaven a deeper , dearer bliss ? ' p. 103. // somewhat different character from most of the pieces in the volume .

But , called by God , From home and friends my willing steps I turned ; Led by the light that in my spirit burned , Strange lands I trod ; And lo ! new worlds uncurtained by my hand Before th ' admiring East in pristine beauty stand . And what was given To recompense the many nameless toils That won my king a new-found empire 's spoils ?

' pp. 66-69 . We must here close our extracts ; but , before we leave the subject , we can not hut express the pleasure and the pride we // 241 feel in the productions of our fair country-women . So much have they cultivated it of late , that they seem almost to have taken possession of the whole domain of light literature , as if it were theirs by a peculiar and exclusive right . Novels and poems are continually coming from their pens ; and , what is of far higher consequence , there is a heartiness , a sincere and Unsophistical naturalness and tenderness in most of them , that has by no means characterized all the writings of the same class , from female pens in past times . We hope that , in this respect , they may go on as they have begun .                    @
