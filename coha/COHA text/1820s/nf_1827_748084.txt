txt /q/ Chairman . WILLIAM HALES , Secretary . Boston , November 30 , 1827. /z/ Your Committee beg leave to report , that in the duty assigned them they have thought proper to confine their attention , ( as the best means of accomplishing the end of their appointment , ) to an examination of the claims of the Manufacturers , to the contemplated increase of the duties on woollens , and the effects which may be expected to . follow , on the attainment of that object . We are not unmindful , that what we are about to say , may lay us open to those charges , which are constantly made , either directly or by implication , agailfst all the opponents of the prohibitory system , as enemies to domestic industry , * hostile to the " American System , " as influenced by a spirit of faction towards the government and f " united with others in endeavours to defeat the re-election of the present chief Magistrate . " We shall not however be deterred on that account , from expressing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do nothing more , of rescuing ourselves from the imputation of being classed among the supporters of an unwise and unjust policy . We deny however in the most distinct and unreserved manner any such motives , which may be attributed to us . The subject we are about to discuss , has in reality no connection whatever , with the question to which we have alluded , and we regret , that party men for purposes of their own , and in utter disregard to the interests of their immediate constituents , and still more so , to the national peace and welfare , should have mingled them together . The success or failure of the candidate for the Presidency , may be of great moment to the country , and still greater , to those partizans whose political fortunes are depending on that event ; but to the nation at large , the evil or the good , which may arise out of the choice of the one , or the rejection of the other , can only be of a temporary and limited importance compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole foreign and domestic policy turns , and which may , in its consequences , affect the stability and happiness of the union , , for aa ; es to come . W r e know there are many , who , agreeing with us , , in our general views of the subject , will say we over-rate its impor- * Boston Circular Committee Woollen Manufacturers .

We deny also , any thing like hostility to the manufacturing interests . It would indeed evince a most extraordinary degree of folly , if any one in this quarter , should entertain such a sentiment towards an interest , which in all its branches involves such a vast amount of capital and labour , as to affect the welfare of every man in the community , whatever may be his condition , or circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such feelings should exist , in a committee , part of whom are themselves manufacturers , and they again representing an assembly containing some of the most wealthy and intelligent of that class . It is not then so much a question of being friendly or unfriendly to manufactures , as a question of resisting absurd and unjust expedients for promoting them . We not only disavow all unfriendly feelings to manufactures , but we profess not to yield to the most zealous of their advocates , in an estimate of the benefits which may be anticipated from their extension and success . 3JLe consider them as furnishing one of the great staple employments forme skill , capital and labour of New England , standing at this moment second in importance to agriculture , but prospectively of still greater consequence ; and of all the various branches of them , we deem that of woollens the most advantageous , first , because of its magnitude again , because in comparison with cottons and many others , it depends more on manual labour , of which compared with other sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it promotes the growth of a staple , peculiarly suited to the soil of New England . It is on that very account , we are desirous of seeing this manufacture placed on a solid and permanent footing to see it extend and flourish , not however by legislative contrivances , but by that increase of skill and capital , which we are fast attaining , and the want of which , as we conceive , now constitutes the only obstacle to its success , under a lower duty than it now enjoys . We repeat , we desire most earnestly , that woollen and all other manufactures may succeed , not by violent unwholesome stimulants , which serve rather to exhaust , than nourish them , not by a system of excessive and unjust taxation , which many of the most intelligent manufacturers themselves neither think just nor necessary , but by such reasonable encouragement as will be cheerfully borne , in those sections of the country not immediately benefitted by them . We are anxious to see manufactures placed on that ground , which will cause them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of industry , and like them to rest on the skill and industry of those who are engaged in those pursuits , and not on governmental bounties , which impose heavy burdens on one portion of the nation , for the benefit of another , and which will serve to make the very name of domestic manufactures , hateful to those on whom we must chiefly depend for their consumption , and support . This then is a question of national policy , and stands disconnected in our minds , from all considerations of parties . It has no relation to the great question , which now divides the country , and must be argued and settled on its own merits , without reference to any thing but the general welfare . It is , as all must admit , a question of great moment in itself , more especially to the poor and middling ranks , as affecting essentially the cost of one of the first necessaries of life next in value and importance to bread itself ; but of far greater consequence , as leading to the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only at variance with that liberal and sound policy , coeval with our national existence , and under which we flourished in the most unexampled degree , but wholly inconsistent with the principles of our free constitution . The avowed object of the woollen manufacturers as evinced in their memorials and other publications , and as still more forcibly manifested in the tariff which passed the House of Representatives , the last Session of Congress , is to protect themselves by a tax of from 38 per cent to 139 per cent , on the nation at large , against all foreign competition . The injustice of such pretensions , is so obvious , that it seems needless to comment on them ; and the woollen manufacturers themselves were so much alive to this in other cases , that with an inconsistency frequently exhibited by men , eager in pursuit of their own interests , and regardless of those of all others , that at the very moment , they were calling for this enormous duty in their own favour , they resisted a small addition on hemp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their own , and which , with the required increase , would then have stood at less rates of duties , than woollens now enjoy . This fact is on record , and has been remarked upon , at various meetings , held for the promotion of manufactures , since the adjournment of congress , and by men , who were themselves friendly to further protecting duties . We believe the wool-growers themselves , whose interests the manufacturers affect so much anxiety to promote , have no better reason to be satisfied with ) their treatment ; at least , that portion of them , who are acquainted with the views and proceedings , of their representatives in Congress . That the interests of the sheep farmer were abandoned , has been asserted by Mr. Buchanan , Mr. Stevenson , and other members of Congress , some of whom were friendly to further protecting duties , and this has been confirmed by the public declarations of some of the most intelligent men extensively engaged in that branch of agriculture , and indeed , must be apparent to every one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not however be understood , that we advocate more duties on Wool or any other articles ; our object is to show the exclusive spirit which governs the movements of the woollen manufacturers . The language they hold while seeking to obtain the aid of other manufacturers , is , " prohibit all articles which can be procured at home ; " but the application of this principle , they would confine to their own benefit . We are aware , that the woollen manufacturers have had the address to identify in appearance , their interests with those of the manufacturing classes generally ; but those who have attended to their proceedings as well as professions , must , we think , be convinced , that it is as much for the advantage of all other manufacturers , to resist the pretensions of this favoured body , as it is for the farmer , merchant , mechanic , labourer and citizens generally , whose interests will all be deeply injured , by yielding to their demands . The supporters and partizans of the prohibitory policy have , as it is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour , by circulating a great number of publications , and filling , for twelve months past , nearly all the newspapers of New England , with the most exaggerated statements , and plausible arguments , read and repeated , in town and county meetings , in conventions , in congress and elsewhere , and urged , we must say with a zeal and violence , uncommon in men conscious of a just cause , while on the other hand , very little has been done in this quarter , to place the merits of the case fairly before the public , disembarrassed of those fallacies and misrepresentations , with which its artful advocates have surrounded it . Your Committee have read with much attention , those memorials , speeches , essays and other publications on the subject which appeared most worthy of notice , and submit their remarks on such statements and arguments , as have the strongest bearing on the question , and on which the Woollen Manufacturers themselves , appear chiefly to rely , for the support of their extravagant , and as appears to us , unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the British manufacturers , with the advantage of larger capitals , more perfect machinery , lower price of labour and materials , and a greater experience and skill , are enabled to undersell them , notwithstanding the protecting charges of 57 per cent which they now enjoy against foreign importations ; and they in consequence , ask for a further increase of duty , which would carry the rate to an average perhaps of 80 per cent , and make the whole protecting charges 99 per cent . If what is here alleged be true , to the extent they would ' have us infer , there can not be imagined any stronger arguments , against engaging in a competition so entirely hopeless ; and the manufacturers who must generally have been as well acquainted with all these circumstances ten years ago , as they now are , have shewn an unwarrantable degree of imprudence , in extending their business from ten millions to forty millions of dollars , as they assert they have done , since 1816. /z/ While however the Committee are ready to admit , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of this branch of business was effected principally by high duties , or if we may judge from experience , that the present rate of 38 per cent is necessary to their existence and success . Without going back to the early history of our country , the Committefi find on reference to official reports that the average export of woollens from England to the United States from 1790 to 1794 , was 1377,951 2 5 , or 6,124,228 dollars , which with the then moderate duty of five per cent , and the other charges , would perhaps make the cost to the consumers 7,500,000 dollars . Our population within those periods , averaged 4,500,000 , and allowing the consumption at six dollars a head , the whole amount consumed , would be 27,000,000 dollars , of which only 7,500,000 were foreign cloths . There may have been a small importation from the rest of Europe , but certainly less than the amount of British woollens re-exported . Thus it appears , that under the tariff of 1790 , imposing a duty of five percent , , subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , twelve and a half and fifteen per cent , we manufactured with certainly much less skill , and not one fifth of our present wealth , three quarters of all the woollens we consumed . This was not done by incorporated companies , with capitals of a quarter or half a million of dollars , but by small manufacturers , and industrious farmers , who made no complaints of the want of protecting duties , in those hours of leisure , which could be spared from the more active labours of the field . We have then very satisfactory evidence , that this important manufacture is in no danger of going to decay , even should we return to the former system of moderate duties . That the woollen manufacturers in common , with many others , are now in a less prosperous condition than heretofore , must be a matter of regret to all of us , but this neither furnishes a claim to a further protecting duty , nor proves the necessity of it . If they have lost by their business within the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all peculiar ? Have not the agricultural , the mercantile and shipping interests been distressed also ? Their losses have not probably exceeded those of other classes , and they have arisen generally from the same causes imprudence , and want of skill ; and in part perhaps from those revulsions in trade , which no sagacity can foresee , and no prudence entirely guard against . If the woollen manufacturers have had more than a common share of the evils incident to all enterprises , may they not more justly be attributed to that sudden and enormous extension of their business , occasioned partly perhaps by former gains , but principally by the injudicious augmentation of duty in 1824 , than by any want of sufficient protecting duty ? The remedy is , a return to a more prudent and skilful manage- /z/ ment , such as others are compelled to adopt , and not the increase ol a bounty , which already imposes too heavy a burden on the nation . We have no apprehension that this great and interesting branch of manufactures , which existed and increased under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys , and under much less favourable circumstances in other respects , furnished three quarters of all the woollens we consumed , is exposed to any of the dangers , its overzealous advocates imagine . SECTION 2 . The woollen manufacturers assert , that by the alteration in the tariff of 1824 , which was intended to afford them additional protection , they lost more by the increased duty on wool , than they gained by the increased duty on woollens , and thus the object of the law as regarded them was defeated . They also give us to infer from many of their memorials and other publications , that the high duty on wool counter-balances in a great degree the duties on woollens . This they appear to put forth as one of their strong points , and as in some measure affording them a claim on the justice of the government for more duties , and from their representation of it , have gained many supporters among the most intelligent and disinterested portion of the community . An examination into facts , will prove its incorrectness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30th September 1825 , that the import of woollens for 1825 , amounted to 10,876,873 dollars ; paying duties to the amount of 3,660,755 dollars . By the same document , it appears that the cost of wool imported was 569,476 dollars , and the duty on it 179,091 dollars ; of this amount , 85,127 1-2 dollars , is the increased duty under the tariff of 1824 . There is no means of ascertaining exactly the portion of duties on woollens occasioned by the new tariff , but as there was an addition of from 8 1-3 per cent to 25 per cent on more than two-thirds of our importation , it will be within bounds to take it atone fifth of the whole duty , making 732,151 dollars . Thus it is clearly proved , that for the increased duty on wool imposed in 1824 , and of which they complain so much , there was an increased duty on woollens of more than eight times the extent ; the whole duty on wool which they represent as almost balancing the duty on woollens , being only 179,091 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real truth is , as will appear more fully hereafter , we require very little wool from abroad , and the amount , small as it was in 1825 , is still less in 1826 ; having as has been stated in debates on the subject , fallen to 449,725 dollars . Here is a plain statement founded on documents accessible to every one . We beg leave to call on those who feel an interest in the subject , to give it a strict examination , and more especially the too confiding wool-grower , who has been prevailed upon to advocate the prohibitory system under the delusive hope that he is to share equally in its benefits , with the manufacturer . For the small advan- /z/ tage he now gains , the sheep farmer pays under the existing tariff thirty-eight dollars on every one hundred dollars worth of woollens he uses ; and uader the contemplated one , it will be more than double . SECTION 3 . The manufacturers complain of the great disadvantage they labour under , in being obliged to use so large a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy duty . Some of them dealing in general terms , leave it to be inferred , that from one quarter to one half the material which is used , is foreign . The Providence Memorial , an authority we refer to , because it will be respected by the manufacturers , is more precise , and that we may not be accused of unfairness , we quote their own words . " The price of domestic wool , having been very considerably enhanced by the operation of the increased duty upon imported wool , and the former having proved sufficient to supply only one half the quantity required for the mills now in operation , the manufacturers of the United States have been labouring under great disadvantages , in competition with the manufacturers of foreign countries . " What were the motives which could induce men selected we presume for their intelligence and character to publish an assertion so much aj variance with facts , is not our business to decide ; we hope however it was from ignorance of the subject on which they undertook to enlighten our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of this statement , supported as it is , by many other publications , has been to mislead the public mind , and to draw to the support of the manufacturers ' pretensions , many who would otherwise have joined in resisting them . The Committee find on referring to the before named document , that the amount of wool imported in 1825 was 569,476 dollars , of which 53,550 dollars having paid the 15 per cent duty , must have cost 10 cents a pound or under , and the balance must have been in wool costing above that price . The low duty wool comes chiefly from Turkey , the North of Europe , and South America . The finer qualities from Spain , Portugal , England and Germany . Assuming the cost of the low wool at S cents , ) fifiQ . , , 53,550 would purchase , paying 15 per ct . duty , J Assuming the finer sorts at 60 cents per pound , $515,926 would purchase , paying 30 per cent #@# 859,877 Ibs. duty , ) Total number of pounds as estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is impossible to ascertain in any other way than the one we have adopted , the quantity . The low wool can not vary ten per cent from our estimate , one way er the other , and if we have over or under-valued that and the fine sorts , /z/ the quantity may vary 1'rorn 300,000 to 400,000 pounds ; but this can be of little importance in the whole quantity in question ; we shall say then that from the Custom House returns , the import of foreign wool could not not have been less than a million and a quarter of pounds- , nor more than 2,000,000 pounds for 1825 . And if we judge by the cost , must have been something less in 1826 . This however would depend on what proportion of it cost 10 cents per pound and under . To estimate the quantity of domestic wool , is more a matter of conjecture , yet there are data , and we will take them chiefly from such authorities as will be most likely to command the confidence of the manufacturers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is estimated by Mr. Niles at 15,000,000 , and in this Mr. Davis , member of congress , and others versed in the subject , agree . Pitkin reckoned the number in 1816 at from 12 to 15,000,000 ; now if we estimate the average produce of each sheep 2 1-2 pounds , they give 37,500,000 pounds ; to which add the imported , and we have 39 to 40,000,000 pounds for our annual consumption . As a corroboration of this estimate , we find Mr. Mallary , Chairman of the Committee on Manufactures , and some other members of congress , stated the consumption of wool to be 40,000,000 pounds , and valued it at about 11,000,000 dollars . The consumption in Great Britain has been stated by Mr. Huskisson at 160,000,000 pounds . The Committee believe 40,000,000 too low an estimate , but they are willing to admit it , to avoid all appearance of exaggeration . If then , we are correct in our statements , and the most important items are susceptible of arithmetical demonstrations , there result the following important inferences. 1 . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands by domestic wool ; and that the imported sorts , are all or nearly all , either inferior or superior to the home raised qualities , and consequently do not come much in competition with them ; and can not therefore as has been asserted , have much effect in regulating the prices of the domestic wool . 2 . That the proportion of foreign wool as compared with the domestic used by the manufacturers , is only about 4 or 5 per cent , instead of 25 to 50 per cent as they have represented , and that consequently , the dearness of foreign wool does not bear heavy on them , and can not be justly considered as among the principal causes of their failure . 3 . That the wool growers having already possession of the home market , to nearly the full extent of what is consumed , they can not be benefitted materially by any further duties on wool . While on the other hand , they now pay a heavy tax of 38 per cent on all the cloths they consume , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent on fine , and 139 per cent on the inferior qualities ; thus /z/ imposing a tax increasing not in proportion to the wealth , but to the poverty of the consumer . 4 . That admitting the whole quantity of wool consumed to be imported , the protecting duties which the manufacturer would then pay on wool , as compared with the protecting duties they now receive on woollens , would stand thus : The duties are nominally 15 and 30 per cent ; in fact , 17 and 34 per cent , the average 25 1-2 per cent ; but as the principal amount of what is consumed pays the high duty , it may perhaps be correct , to call the average duty 28 per cent . The cost of foreign wool , such as we use , is estimated by Mr. Davis , Mr. Everett and others , in their elaborate arguments in favour of the prohibitory duties on woollens , at 20 cents a pound . The quantity consumed being as supposed 40,000,000 pounds ; the duty at 28 per cent on wool costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The consumption of woollens , has been estimated by Mr. Barney and other manufacturing authorities , at from 80 to 100,000,000 dol-V lars per annum . In England it has been estimated by Low at about 10 dollars a head for the whole population . Our population is estimated by the manufacturers at 12,500,000 . We reduce it to 12,000,000 , and call the consumption 6 dollars a head , which is 72,000,000 dollars . The duty nominally 33 1-3 , in fact 38 per cent , on the amount thus consumed , is 27,360,000 dollars . There can be no fallacy in this calculation , or in the principles on which it is founded , and we would again call the attention of the wool-growers , whose capital engaged in the raising of sheep , is allowed by Mr. Mallary , Mr. Davis and others , to be equal to the manufacturing capital , to an examination of the subject , that they may have still further proof how much they have deceived themselves , in supposing they shared equally the benefit of the heavy tax now imposed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they demand that this tax be doubled , and offer a small addition to the duty on wool , to take effect at such distant periods , as would enable the manufacturer to supply himself for years , with the comparatively small quantity he may require . SECTION 4 . Another ground assumed by the manufacturers for a new tariff and increased duties , was , frauds that were practised on the revenue . In various publications , coming from the leading advocates of this interest , the importers were charged with fraud , and the revenue officers with unfaithfulness and incornpetency. * Mr. Dwight , member of congress from Berkshire , asserted in a speech as reported in the National Intelligencer , that " the object of the bill and the minimums contained in it , he would again repeat , was to in- * " The public appraisers , though sworn tft perform their duty , and having power to add to ( he invoice prices , v. henever in their opinion , the goods are invoiced lower than the actual cost , arc believed to be in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular of the woollens committee , November 11. 1826 , /z/ sure a faithful collection of the rates of duty , which were imposed by the law of 1824 : The manufacturers asked no more . " Mr. Davis , member of congress from Worcester County , in a speech reported also in the National Intelligencer , makes the following assertion . " The law of J824 , gave a duty of 33 1-3 per cent on imported fabrics , and it was doubtless the design of government , it should operate as a clear protective duty , but half or nearly that amount , has been taken away by the modification of the British tariff , and the other half is evaded . " We select the speeches of these gentlemen , because they are among the most able advocates of the prohibitory system , and residing as they do in the midst of the manufacturers , they may be supposed to know their views , and will therefore be held by them as good authorities . These are serious chatges to bring against a numerous and respectable class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when some of those who had been the most active in circulating them were challenged for their proofs , it was answered , " the manufacturers invent no accusations ; they adopt common rumour . " That these accusations were founded on common rumour , or something worse , was indeed the prevailing belief ; but slight as was the foundation on which they rested , they found a credulous supporter in the Secretary of the Treasury , who with very honest intentions , as we believe , has been an instrument in the hands of other men less disinterested than himself , in building up a system , favourable to the interests of a few , but hostile to the general welfare . An investigation was made by his order , as indeed was proper , believing as he did , that there must be some foundation for the charges , and it resulted as is well known , in a refutation of the rumoured accusations . That there may be fraudulent importations of woollens the committee do not pretend to disbelieve , but not to an extent which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , than of cottons , silks , and other goods of which no complaints were made , or if made , were not listened to . If however the manufacturers were sincere , ' it was reasonable to suppose , they would have introduced into their bill , which passed the House of Representatives last winter , some provisions to guard against the frauds of which they complained . So far from this however , the amendments , offered in order to effect that object by varirious members , and among others Mr. Cambreleng , the active , intelligent and persevering opponent of the prohibitory system , were all rejected by the friends of the bill . To avoid the appearance of such gross inconsistency , the advocates of the bill , contended that this purpose would be obtained and frauds prevented by the singular and novel method of a specific duty on the arbitrary valuation of the square yard , instead of the simple and established one of ad valorem duties on the real cost . An examination of the bill as it actually passed , will show at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lessened or guarded against . /z/ The second minimum provides , that all goods costing more than 40 cents , and not exceeding 1 50 cents per square yard shall be considered as costing 150 cents , and pay duty on that sum . In this class , is included the principal part of the low priced cloths , used chiefly by the poor and middling classes . Under this deceptive section a cloth costing 40 cents the yard , would pay as at present 38 per cent , but if costing 41 cents , would be valued at 150 cents , and pay 57 cents a yard , or 139 per cent . Thus an importer by diminishing the cost of his goods 1 cent in a yard , would save 101 per cent in the duties . To raise the duties from 38 to 139 per cent , averaging perhaps on whole importations 80 per cent , and to construct the law so ingeniously as to offer a temptation of 101 per cent by only altering the cost of an article one cent a yard , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill with the most extensive frauds , is the method which the woollen manufacturers adopted to guard the revenue against frauds and smuggling ! ! We appeal to all candid men , whether in this instance the conduct of the manufacturers is not directly at issue with their professions , and their complaints against merchants and Custom-House officers , a mere pretence , to cover their real design , of imposing an enormous tax on the nation to promote their individual interests ? SECTION 5 . Another favourite doctrine of the woollen manufacturers is , that they employ domestic labour and capital , and afford an increased demand for agricultural products ; as if the same could not be said of all the other great branches of business , which the prohibitory system is calculated so deeply to injure . Do not the cultivators of wheat , cotton and tobacco , the manufacturers of ships , houses , and all others engaged in the mechanic arts , employ domestic labour and capital ? Is commerce and navigation , and the other arts and professions , carried on , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merit of this , as something peculiar to the manufacturers of woollens , or any other manufacturers ? Nay further : Do not the spinners and weavers in England , when they furnish us with cloths ; employ American industry and capital ? How do we get these goods ? Do they come to us without payment ? Even the most extravagant of the manufacturers , when enumerating their complaints against their competitors , say that the importers of foreign goods get at least half price for them . If then we pay for our imported goods , it must be with the produce of domestic industry or something which is exchanged for it . But say our opponents the British will not take American produce , at least not that of New England . There is a reason for this , which we should think would occur to any man familiar with our trade , which is , that we have nothing to sell Europeans , which they can not get cheaper elsewhere . New England has for a long time been a manufacturing people , and that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protecting system . But is the trade of the nation to be estimated by what is pas- /z/ sing in one small section of it , even if this includes some of the middle states . ? The question is , what are the exports from the United States ? On turning to the official list for 1825 , we find the export of domestic produce to he 66,944,745 dollars , of which 40,372,987 v. dollars went to Great Britain and her colonies , principally the former ; and 32,590,643 dollars in foreign articles ; every dollar of which was purchased with domestic produce ; making in all , 99,535,388 . The amount would have been much larger , had we adhered to the system of moderate duties , under which we flourished so much , from the adoption of the constitution till the protecting policy was established . When pressed with those facts , so contrary to their representations , they endeavour to evade the force of them , by anticipating the period when Europeans will cease to be our customers ; but as this event must in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth reasoning about ; when however it does come , we shall cease to have the means of importing woollens , and the manufacturers being relieved from that competition they now so much deplore , will then effect in a natural way what they now seek to accomplish by an artificial and unjust system of legislation . We had supposed , if there was any one maxim in political economy , and legislation , on which all sensible men agreed , it was the folly and injustice of governments attempting to control or influence the occupations of men by bounties and special privileges granted to those engaged in particular pursuits , or as Mr. Webster has expressed it , " for his own part he had supposed , the restrictions on trade and commerce , in order to benefit particular classes of manufacturers , were now very generally understood to be mischievous and inconsistent with just notions of political economy . " This principle is so self-evident , that no man of sense and reflection , would venture to call it in question , or recommend a departure from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest and intelligent men often evince , when earnestly desirous of promoting their own interests . Let us , however , now examine this claim upon the footing on which the manufacturers would place it . 1st . As to the labour and capital employed . 2d . As to the increased consumption of agricultural produce . We do not profess to have the means of forming any thing like a correct judgment of the number of persons , or the amount of capital , engaged in this branch of business , but we are willing on this and other occasions , to take the facts from such persons , as the manufacturers themselves deem most favourable to their views . Mr. Davis , member of congress , says , " it is computed from the best information that can be obtained , that a capital equal to 40 or " 50,000,000 of dollars , is invested in the manufacture of woollens , and that a population of 60 to 70,000 persons , is employed directly in the business , and 20 to 30,000 more indirectly ; and Mr. Mallary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result was that the agricultural interests had at least 40,000,000 of dollars involved in this question , and the manufacturers 40,000,000 of dollars more ; " and we observe these statements are confirmed by other intelligent men on the same side . With regard to the number of persons engaged , we apprehend they have understated their own case ; we should venture to double them at least . We have before proved that three quarters of all the woollens we consumed were made at home by small manufacturers , in a household way , when the duties were only five per cent , and when we possessed much less skill and capital than we now have ; and by men who by strict economy , and a proper knowledge of their business , found it sufficiently profitable without calling for heavy taxes for their support . The protecting system of high duties , can not then add more than one fourth to the number of persons who would be otherwise employed , even if we made all our woollens at home ; we should then according to their estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if we were to return to the former rates of 5 per cent duty . The employment then of 25,000 persons , and 20,000,000 of dollars , is the immense benefit which is held up to the nation , as a compensation for a tax more than equal to the whole national expenditure , and which we are called upon to double , and the establishment of which will lead to an entire system of prohibitions affecting most injuriously the welfare of the country . It seems incredible that men of any reflection should put forth an argument which , if it could be sustained on correct principles , leads to such an unimportant result , as the question of employing , in a nation of 12,000,000 people , 25,000 persons , and 20,000,000 dollars of capital . Will any man of common intelligence , pretend there can be any want of demand for labour and capital , in a country like this ? There certainly is not in this community . The woollen manufacturers themselves , have complained , that the scarcity of capital , and high price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there was any want of employment , we should see its effects in the fall of wages ; but so far from wages having declined , taking into consideration the fall of provisions , and all other means of living , labour was never , at any period , better paid than it now is ; and there would be no diminution in the price of it , if every one of the 25,000 persons , added to the manufacturing population , by the protecting system , was thrown out of employment . To them it might , for a short time , be an inconvenience , but they would soon find some other pursuit equally advantageous . It is not the labourer who is to profit by this system of monopoly . It can make no difference to him whether he pursues a business , which requires a tax of eighty per cent , on the consumer to support , or in any of the common occupations of the country of a /z/ less favoured character . The pay of the workmen will be regulated by wages of labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high duties are the proprietors of the manufacturing establishments . As to the employment of capital , if there is no want of demand for it here , still less is there , in other sections of the Union , where it is less abundant . In fact it is too notorious not to be within the observation of every one , that the public projects of great utility , now in progress , or in contemplation , require more capital than can be procured in this , or any other quarter of the United States . In a country where land can be had from 1 to 20 dollars an acre under a stable government , and with an enterprising , and intelligent population like ours , labour and capital will never lie unemployed , nor go without their proper reward . It may be a question in what particular way they shall be employed , but they will not in any event require legislative controul or direction . If manufacturers do not want labourers , there is a never failing resource in agriculture , and without undervaluing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however often insisted upon , that farmers are not as happy , and as useful as manufacturers , especially as they call for no national bounties for their encouragement and support . As to the increased consumption , we have all seen the most imposing statements of imports into New-England of various products . It would be wholly impracticable to go into that detail necessary to ' answer all that has been said on this subject ; we will however take the most important article , flour ; of which our opponents say , 629,000 barrels were imported into New England in 1825 . One might imagine , from their representations , that the whole was for the consumption of the woollen manufacturers , for although they use general terms , their reasonings are commonly bottomed on their own interests . But New England contains above 1,500,000 inhabitants , besides which a considerable portion of the 629,000 barrels of flour is re-exported . Now we have shown that three quarters of the woollen manufacturers have succeeded under a duty of five per cent , and of course are not dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers , occasioned by the prohibitory duties , to 25,000 . Why then talk of the consumption of 629,000 barrels of flour in New England , in connection with this branch of manufactures , when the whole number of woollen manufacturers are but 100,000 , and only one fourth of them added to the former number by the increase of duties , and these too , residing in various sections of the Union , and consequently not half of them New-England consumers of flour . The utter insignificance of this argument which has been so often addressed to the agriculturists of the middle states , will be more striking , when it is considered that the consumption of wheat-flour for the whole Union , if we take the rate allowed for Great Britain , can not be /z/ less than 11,000,000 barrels . Now according to that estimate the whole number of woollen manufacturers , reckoned by Mr. Davis and others , at 100,000 , would consume 91,666 barrels , of which one fourth , or 22,916 barrels , depend on the protecting system . The wheat-growers then have gained an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption is 11,000,000 and the export demand about l , 000,000 , in ordinary years , and more occasion- ally , according to the state of the crops in foreign countries . But is there no advantage in this . ? Yes , we do not deny that even so small an increased demand is of some value to the farmers , but how is it obtained ? By an annual tax of 38 per cent on 72,000,000 of dollars worth of woollens , amounting to 27,360,000 , of which , as we shall hereafter see , nearly the whole goes into the pockets of the manufacturers ; and of this immense tax , probably at least one fifth part is paid by the growers of wheat , and we are called upon to double it . This is placing the subject in a strong light , but we are reasoning from their own data , and if they are correct , the conclusion we come to is inevitable . We have , it will be perceived , been examining the claims of the manufacturers to an increase of duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and increasing the consumption of agricultural produce , according to their own representations of the case . It is our purpose now , to show that effects , the very reverse of these , will be the result of the prohibitory system . What is it the woollen manufacturers affirm ? Why that woollen goods can be made so much cheaper in England , that after the payment of thirty-eight per cent duty , and all the other charges , making together fifty-seven per cent , as to undersell their manufactures . The whole charges on the importation of woollens are fifty-seven per cent , which on - 72,000,000 dollars amounts to 41,040,000 dollars ; this sum must be incurred on foreign goods , before they can be brought into competition with the home-made . The duty , at 38 per cent comes to 27,360,000 , of this the duties on our two last years ' average importation about 9,000,000 dollars , amounting to 3,420,000 less the expenses of collecting , goes into the public chess for revenue ; the balance 23,940,000 is so much bounty paid to the woollen manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our markets foreign woollens . The manufacturers not only say , this tax is insufficient for their protection , but that it must be doubled , and would reconcile the nation to its endurance , by holding up the idea that among other advantages of their business , they afford increased employment to domestic labour and capital . If any sensible men , whose interests are not promoted by this doctrine , have been induced to give it their sanction , it is from want of due attention to the subject . The fallacy lies in supposing this capital and labour would not be employed but for the woollen . manufacturers , but this we deny , as they themselves do in fact by declaring in their petitions , speeches , &e.; that among the most important causes of their want of success , are to be numbered the scarcity of one and the dearness of the other . The incorrect notions which prevail respecting the injurious effects of importing foreign goods , arise chiefly from neglecting to keep in mind this established principle , that if we buy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we buy . If we import foreign goods , we must export domestic ones to pay for them ; it is therefore certain , that by every importation of foreign goods , we create just so much demand for domestic goods , which must be sent abroad in payment for them . These are plain and self-evident truths , which no man , familiar with commerce , and who has reflected on the subject , will deny . We will state a case , which may explain and enforce our meaning . We consume perhaps 2,000,000 gallons of wine , purchased abroad in exchange say for provisions and lumber , which we will suppose requires the labour of 10,000 men , and a capital of 10,000,000 dollars to produce ; and that this foreign wine can be afforded to the consumer , allowing the usual rate of profit to the importer , and after the payment of 30 cents a gallon to government , at 100 cents per gallon . We will then imagine , that in conformity with the new system of excluding all articles which can be produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woollens , that foreign wines should be prohibited ; and that the 10,000 persons , and 10,000,000 dollars formerly employed in producing the provisions and lumber , are transferred to the making of wine , which can not be afforded , after an allowance of the same wages of labour and profits which they earned in their former employments , under 2 dollars per gallon . What then would be the effect of this operation ? The exclusion of foreign wines would certainly create new employment for 10,000 persons , and 10,000,000 capital , but the same capital and labour would be taken from other occupations ; at the same time government would lose their 600,000 dollars revenue , and the consumers pay 2,000,000 dollars , more than they formerly did for their wine ; while on the other hand , the winegrowers , and their capital would not earn more than they did in the occupations from which they had been withdrawn . As a nation , we should be 2,600,000 dollars poorer at the end of every year , than if we had continued to import wine . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continued to be engaged in raising provisions , and lumber , the result would have been produce enough to purchase the 2,000,000 gallons of wine , and a surplus , which would have sold for 2,600,000 dollars . This is a practical illustration of the effects of the high duty , or prohibitory system . It does not give an increased employment to domestic labour and capital ; it merely turns them from a direction ivhere they were profitable , to one where they are less so . This is what is often called , though falsely so , " the American System . " /z/ The capital employed in raising wine at an expense of 2,600,000 dollars more than it can be imported for , is termed by them , the true system of promoting national welfare , and productive labour , while the same capital and labour employed in raising provisions and labour to exchange for foreign wines , is stigmatized , as unproductive foreign trade , which every patriot should labour to destroy , and by legislative regulations , if it can not be done by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to woollens . If we imported more than we now do , there would be less labour and capital employed at home in that branch of industry , but they would still be employed in some other business , more suited to our condition , and we should thus have so much larger amounts of produce to export , to pay for the imported woollens ; and if we imported the whole we consumed , the annual saving ( provided they can be imported 38 per cent cheaper than they can be made ) would be 23,940,000 dollars , which is the tax we now pay yearly , to keep down foreign competition . Now if this annual tax , paid for the benefit of the manufacturers , was so much clear gain to them , it would only be a transfer of 23,940,000 from the 11,900,000 consumers , who do not participate in its benefits , to the 90 or 100,000 persons which Mr. Davis says are engaged in the manufacturing of woollens . In that case , as a nation we should not be the poorer ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits of business , or as much as the same capital and labour engaged in other branches of industry would earn , ( and they declare they make less ) then we say , the 23,900,000 is the annual loss the nation sustains by the woollen business ; or in other words , the accumulation of national capital is 23,940,000 dollars a year less than it would be , if the woollen capital was employed in agriculture , Commerce , the mechanic arts , or in any other way affording the average profits of business , and we imported our woollens instead of making them . " Here then , " to use the words of one of the advocates of the system we are opposing , " is a strong case fairly made out , and no more connected with the principles of political economy , than with metaphysics ! ! It is then mathematically true , that if we can import woollens 38 per cent cheaper than we can make them , ( and the manufacturers say we can 80 per cent ) the consumers pay an annual tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally true , that if with all this bounty , the manufacture of woollens does not yield any thing more than the ordinary returns of capital and labour ( and the manufacturers say it does much less ) then we not only pay this immense tax to the woollen manufacturers , but there is so much annual loss to the national income . We contend therefore , that the principles on which the woollen manufacturers rest their claim for more duties , are altogether fallacious , and that a resistance of it will not be followed by a diminution of demand for labour or capital , nor lessen the consumption of agricultural /z/ . produce . On the other hand , the committee maintain , that the effect of even a continuance of the present duty of 38 per cent on woollens , ( if they can be imported so much cheaper from abroad ) is to diminish the accumulation of national wealth , to the annual amount of 23,940,000 dollars ; and thus by decreasing the fund on which labour must depend , lessen the demand for American labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Let us now proceed to the examination of another assertion on which the woollen manufacturers appear to rest with the utmost confidence ; that is , that the effect of excessive duties , is , to make goods come cheaper to the consumer , or as Mr. Niles expressVes it , " all articles protected are cheaper , because of that protection . " To enforce the belief of this maxim , they instance the decline in the prices of cotton manufactures , since the high duties imposed on them by the tariff of IS 16 . This is one of those fallacies which has been so boldly , and so often repeated , as to impose , not only on great numbers really desirous of coming at the truth , but even on many of those who invented it . To say that the effect of a duty , averaging perhaps when imposed 50 or 60 per cent on coarse goods , established for the avowed purpose , and as necessary to keep down foreign competition , raised subsequently , because of the insufficiency of the tariff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of this excessive duty , foreign importations still continue . To say that the effect of such a measure has been to lower the price of domestic goods , carries on the face of it , such a manifest contradiction and absurdity , that it requires great confidence in our reflecting readers , to believe such a declaration was ever made . We will therefore give a statement from the address of the Pennsylvania Society , issued to promote the Harrisburg Convention , and at whose summons it was convened , for the purpose of forming a new tariff , for the adoption of the next Congress . " It is assumed that protecting duties on the importation of foreign manufactures , greatly enhance the prices , and of course impose an oppressive tax on the consumer . Nothing can be more foreign from the fact . Hamilton exposed the fallacy of this notion , above 30 years ago . " With regard to the authority of this great man which has been so much abused by the advocates of the prohibitory system , we shall not now interrupt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty established , under the first tariff on cotton and woollen goods , was five per cent , and the addition which Hamilton recommended in his celebrated report , was 21-2 per cent on cottons , making 7 1-2 , and nothing on woollens , except 2 1-2 per cent on carpeting , and on that article because it was considered a luxury . The cotton manufacturers now have 29 to 90 per cent , and even 100 per cent . And the manufacturers of woollens having now 38 per cent , demand an increase of 39 to 139 per cent ; averaging 80 per cent . So much does this enlightened statesman , whom they af. ' feet to consider on their side , differ from the men we are opposing , in their notions of protection . /z/ " The case of coarse cottons with us , ( continue the addressers , ) on which the duties are prohibitory , may here also be referred to , as a striking corroboration of this theory . They are now sold at half the price they bore when imported , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a difference of 75 percent in favour of the American consumer . Had no other instance ever occurred here , this alone would be sufficient to settle the question without appeal . " This statement involves two propositions : 1st , That domestic cotton goods have fallen 75 per cent since 1816 ; or in other words , that cloths " then selling at 25 cents , can now be had at six and one quarter cents per yard ; 2d , That this reduction has been caused by the high duties imposed by the tariff of 1816 . That the first is incorrect in point of fact , no one will , we presume , deny ; but is of no importance as respects the argument , and we merely notice it to shew with what caution we should receive statements from men , who make such assertions with the most fearless indifference on their part as to the effect they must have on their characters , and as appears to us , with the utmost contempt for the knowledge and understandings of those , to whom they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse goods are 40 to 50 per cent cheaper than when the tariff of 1816 was imposed , but it can not fail to strike every one as a most illogical inference , that they are , necessarily so , because of that tariff . Where are the reasons to shew that the tariff was the cause of decline in price ? JVbne have ever been offered . The real question at issue is , not whether coarse cotton goods are cheaper than in 1816 , but whether they are lower than they would have been , had the duty continued at 15 per cent , the rate which they paid before the protecting system was established , instead of 60 to 100 per cent , which coarse goods now pay . To prove the affirmative of this proposition , that is , that cotton goods are cheaper because of the tariff of 1816 , which is , what they are bound to do , they should at least shew that such descriptions of goods are no longer imported , in any considerable quantities , nor that they would be imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise , their position must be abandoned . What then is the fact ? Have coarse cotton goods ceased to be imported ? Fortunately we here have proofs to rest upon , which no one can dispute . On reference to the official list of imports , going back as far as the statistical tables , we find the importations of cotton goods , excluding nankins and all others , except plain white , and printed and coloured , were as follows : /z/ Now taking the duty on fine and coarse goods to average 45 per cent , and calling the other charges 20 per cent , making 65 per cent , /z/ the last year 's importations , without allowing any profit , must have sold for $18,209,463 . We have then incontrovertible evidence , that the amount of imported cotton goods is very large , and has been , on the increase down to the year 1825 , and that too in a greater ratio , than this statement shows , because the fall in the price necessarily increases the quantity . It should also be noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 1-4 cents the yard , and as goods , then costing 20 cents , can now be had at 12 to 14 cents , and pay 7 1-2 cents , therate of duty is nearly doubled on very low goods , and very much increasr ed on all sorts falling under the minimum valuation . We are aware , that , enormous as the duty now is on Cotton goods , the importation is rapidly diminishing , and will probably cease altogether , within a few years , except of some fancy articles , which our manufacturers have not yet commenced manufacturing ; but this only proves that British manufactures may be excluded by duties of 60 to 100 per cent , and not that the domestic goods would undersell them , if the duty was carried back to 15 per cent . Notwithstanding the excessive rates now imposed , we do continue importing , and we have now before us statements from some of the most intelligent importers , supported by the testimony of others , and confirmed by the personal observation of the committee , proving the rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , and affording a fair profit , to be 70 to 90 per cent . ; on other descriptions of Cotton goods , to be of 40 to 60 per cent . If then , in 1825 , we imported Cotton goods , which without any allowance for profit , must have sold for upwards of 18,000,000 dollars , of which several millions charged at S to 15 cents a yard , paying 7 1-2 cents the yard , or 50 to 90 per cent , duty , and a larger amount costing 15 to 20 cents , on which the duty was 38 to 50 per cent , does it not follow , that under a moderate duty of 15 per cent , or even 25 to 30 per cent , we should have imported a much larger quantity ? and is not the conclusion irresistible , that if coarse goods have fallen since 1816 , they would have fallen still lower , had the duties not have been raised , and the market been left more open to a competition , with the cheaper fabrics of Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the price of domestic cotton fabrics ? For several years the demand for cotton goods exceeded the supply ; consequently prices were high and profits great , which in time produced an excess , and lowered the prices , not only to the lowest rate of living profit , but for a time much lower , to the ruin of vast numbers engaged in this branch of business , both in this country and in England . This state of things , however , could only be temporary ; but the permanent causes of the fall in cotton goods , are improvements in machinery , increased skill of the manufacturers , reduction in wages , and above all , as applied to the coarse goods , the decline in the raw material , ( which constitutes 1-3 of their cost ) from 28 and 30 cents , to 10 or 12 cents per pound . /z/ The same causes have operated in England , and produced similar effects ; cotton goods have fallen as much there , as here . The only evidence our opponents have ever furnished , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the assertion that we undersell British cotton goods in foreign markets . The committee quote from Mr. Tibbits ' address , ( an authority which appears to be much relied upon by the manufacturers ) the following statement relating to j this subject . " The country is not only supplied , but overflowing the demand at home ; it has at this time become a great , if not the surest article for exportation , which we have . The coarse cotton cloths of this country now have the preference in the South American markets over the cloths of England , made for like purposes ; and they bid fair to supplant them in all foreign markets , where cloths of both countries Jind admittance and a market . " Mr. Niles , in one of his Registers says , " But what are the effects of the Tariff ? Virginia obtains cotton goods cheaper than ever she did , and the nabobs of Waltham are rivalled in many places , so that the whole manufacture is reduced to the lowest point of profit , that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every foreign market , at which our goods ' are . received on the same terms as their own . These unquestionable facts are worth a whole library of speculations , apply them as you will . " The same assertion has been made by other writers , and pretty generally believed . The reader would naturally suppose from what is here advanced , that we exported domestic cloths , to an immense amount , and more particularly to the South American markets . There has never been any separate account kept of the export of cottons at the Custom House , till 1826 , and on referring to the Treasury report that year , which we have received since commencing this report , we find our whole exports amount to 77,595,322 dollars , of which domestic cotton goods amounted to 1,138,125 dollars ; of this amount 711,959 dollars went to Mexico and other parts of South America , in which we include the whole continent . By an official list of exports from England for 1825 , the committee find the amount of cotton goods exported was in that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to 150,895,000 dol- #@# " lars . What proportion of these goods went to Mexico and South America , we had no means of ascertaining precisely ; but as the whole export of British manufactures from England to these countries , was upwards of 40,000,000 dollars , and as considerable quantities went indirectly from the British West Indies , and other Colonies , there can not be a doubt , that an amount of at least 25,000,000 dollars in British cotton manufactures , reached Mexico and South America . Our export of domestic cottons is generally understood to have been greater in 1826 , than in any former year , yet on comparing it with the British , it is about two thirds of a per cent , of the amount they exported . This then is the progress we have made since 1816 , " in supplanting the British in all foreign markets . " /z/ We do however it seems , export cotton goods , but it supposes a greater degree of ignorance , than can well be imagined , in men who have undertaken to enlighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude , that so small an operation , proves that we can undersell the British in foreign markets . It is well known that in such a various and extensive trade as we carry on , there are many markets where assorted cargoes are required , and they must be made up of both foreign and domestic goods , even though they may cost more than in the countries where those , or similar articles are produced . As evidence of this , we re-exported in 1825 , of European linens , imported at a cost of 15 to 20 percent , to the amount of 2,433,625 dollars ; yet no one acquainted with trade , would infer from that , our ability to undersell the same articles going direct from the places where they are made , to the markets to which we exported linens . This is now the case and always has been , with many of the articles which we import from all quarters of the world . But our re-exportation of cotton goods will be more to the point . From the Custom House returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton goods , principally , or all British , for 1825 , amounted to 1,810,591 dollars , of which 1,106,214 dollars went to Mexico and other ports in South America ; and that in 1826 , the export was 1,714,783 dollars , of which 901,849 dollars went to the same places , besides further shipments which went direct from Europe to those countries . We think this is a just view of the case , and such as will convince every reasonable man , that no satisfactory evidence has been furnished to shew that we can undersell the British in any markets ; indeed nothing can be more absurd , than to pretend we can , while we levy a duty of 50 to 90 per cent , on those very kind of goods , in which we most excel , in order to keep British goods out of our markets , and which are still to be increased , if the woollen manufacturers prevail . While then to make up assorted cargoes , we export nearly 2,000,000 dollars of British goods , brought here at an expense of 20 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export a few of our own goods , even though at higher prices than they would have cost in England . The South American markets are proverbial for their great and sudden fluctuations , which may cause these shipments sometimes to be profitable , but it is within the knowledge of this committee that they are often times unprofitable . This however is no disparagement to our characters , as manufacturers . The British have the low quality material , as cheap as we have , and can work it , as we have been informed , to much more advantage ; while for the better qualities , they do not give more than 7 1-2 per cent , over what the New England manufacturers pay , which really has no bearing in the cost of goods , while this article is so low . If a British manufacturer paid 15 per cent more for his material , than our manufacturers , the difference even in the heaviest cloths of 3 yards to a pound , and taking the cotton at 12 cents a pound , would /z/ only be 3-5ths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while on the middling goods of 5 yards to a pound , it would diminish to 3-Sths of a cent , and in the finest goods , it would only be from l-6th to l-4th of a cent a yard . It is often held up as a reason why we should excel our competitors eventually , if not now , in this manufacture , that we raise the raw material within our own country , but it does in fact cost at least half as much to transport it from the cotton states , to New England , as it does to Great Britain ; but if it cost even 50 per cent more in England , we have shewn that it would not materially affect the cost of the manufactured article . The principal elements in the value of cotton goods at the present cost of the material , are capital and labour , in which our competitors very much excel us . It has been stated by Mr. Huskisson in parliament , ( and we can not have a better authority , ) that of 32,000,000 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain in 1824 ; he ascertained on inquiry , that 26,000,000 pounds sterling , or about four-fifths were profits and labour . Now as any addition they pay over our manufacturers for the material , is of such little importance , capital so abundant as to be at half the rate it is worth here ; and wages are reduced to the lowest minimum of existence , to bread and water merely , is it surprising that they should afford cotton and all other manufactures so much lower than they can be made with us ? Ought it to be considered by us as a subject of regret , that we can not rival England in her manufactures ? Manufactures are forced upon England by her circumstances . She has a ' limited territory and a population so dense , that they must be employed in that way or perish . Do we envy her condition in that respect ? If you can contract the population of this country within the same space they occupy in Great Britain , and prevent their emigration , we shall then have land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low wages , a spirit of competition , which nothing can bring forth but necessity ; and all the other attendant circumstances , which enable the British manufacturers to excel ours . Situated as the two nations now are , they might as well contend with us , in the cultivation of tobacco on lands which would rent in England for four or five times as much as they could be purchased for in Virginia or Kentucky . The climate and soil are as well suited to its culture as they are in France , where acting upon the " American system , " they raise it at about three or four times the expense we could furnish it of a much belter quality . It is true that in the coarse fabrics , where the material makes up more of the value , and the labour less , we come nearer to the British , but in those we are behind them , and shall always be until we make some near approach to Great Britain in density of population , accumulation of wealth and low wages . Why then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at not equalling Great Britain , in a business , in which her advantages over us , grow out of circumstances we should not desire to be placed /z/ in ? Our population and capital are not idle , and never will be . It is true , that our opponents tell us that foreign nations will not take our produce . We answer that not a dollar 's worth of produce ever perished for want of either a foreign or a home market ; one or the other we have always had , and that is all which the public welfare requires . If the woollen manufacturers believed in their own maxim " that high duties make goods come cheaper , " why is it they have been complaining for years past , against the duty on wool , when we have proved from their own admissions , and Custom House documents , that the whole quantity of foreign wool used is only 4 or 5 per cent of the consumption ; and the whole amount of duties on wool , under the increased rates of 1824 , was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,660,755 dollars ? If the cotton manufacturers believed that the effect of high duties , imposed by the Tariff of 1816 , had been to make goods come cheaper to the consumers , it is admitting that the duties down to 15 per cent , are inoperative , and therefore unnecessary ; yet in 1824 , the most prosperous period of manufacturing , as indicated by their dividends of 10 to 20 per cent , and sales of stock , at 20 to 50 per cent advance , they came forward , with petitions complaining of the interference of foreign goods , and insufficient profits ; and obtained an increased duty of 1 1-4 cents the yard , on that particular description of goods , which we can manufacture to the most advantage , thus making an addition to the former rate of from 5 to 15 per cent . The committee would add further , that so far are the cotton manufacturers from being contented with the present duties on cottons , enormous as they are , that some of those most largely interested in this branch of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rates , both on cottons and woollens , much lower than they now are as unnecessary and inexpedient , and " tending to favour great capitalists , rather than personal industry , or the owners of small capitals , " " to encourage the practice of smuggling , " and to have a " tendency to diminish the industry , impede the prosperity , and corrupt the morals of the people , " are at this time , giving the woollen manufacturers a most cordial support , with a view , as is reasonably inferred , and as we have been informed , to obtain their aid in sustaining a call for more duties on coarse cotton goods . The committee have gone into a detail , which they fear will be considered unnecessary by some , and tedious to all , because they believe the notion they are combatting has misled and corrupted the public mind , more than any of the numerous fallacies and misrepresentations in circulation . We ask all candid and impartial inquirers , to examine the facts we have adduced , and our reasonings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have shewn , in the first place , that cotton goods , have fallen since 1816 not in consequence of the Tariff , /z/ but in spite of it ; and secondly , that we are supported in this conclusion by the conduct of the cotton manufacturers themselves , in calling for more duties in 1824 , and from the efforts making to obtain , at the ensuing session of Congress , still higher rates . Before we terminate this part of our labours , the committee wish it to be understood , that in speaking of woollen and cotton manufactures , they do not mean all of them : we . know there are some of the former who admit they are doing well under the existing Tariff ; and others , who , if they do not succeed , attribute their failure to a deficiency of skill and experience , a difficulty which is every day diminishing . They believe fully that they shall eventually succeed , and at any rate have the honesty to avow , that a business which requires more than the 57 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys , ) is not suited to the interests of the nation . As to the cotton manufacturers , it is well known , that a large number , embracing the most respectable and intelligent portion in this quarter , have disapproved , and many of them , resisted the additions made to the rates imposed by the Tariff of 1816 ; and some have always " ' contended , that those were too high . They predicted , that the consequences of such alterations would be , to disaffect , and disgust the whole country , such rates of duty being higher than were either just or necessary ; and at the same time injure the regular established manufacturer , who engaging in the business , as a permanent profession , and not upon speculation , was satisfied with the Tariff of 1S1G ; and ruin others , who might be induced , under the additional stimulus afforded by the Tariff of 1824 , to rush into a business they did not understand , and had not the means of pursuing , had they understood it . The events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions . The woollen manufacturers have also suffered by an imprudent enlargement of their concerns . According to their own statements they extended them in the course of 9 years from 10,000,000 dollars to 40,000,000 of dollars ; stimulated no doubt , in a great degree , by the augmentation of duty in 1824 ; and such , many apprehend , will be the effect of the proposed increase from 38 to 80 per cent . Some few extensive manufacturers , who may have adventured very largely , will perhaps be gainers by the increased value , which such a bounty will give to that kind of property , and availing themselves of the speculations which will follow , to dispose of their stock , they will be enriched ; while on the other hand , the majority of the manufacturers , will be injuriously affected , as were the cotton manufacturers by the alteration of the Tariff in 1824 ; and as they may be again by the increase of duty , which is contemplated at the ensuing session of Congress . This honourable conduct on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own true interests , and at the same time a just regard for the national welfare , instead of being viewed in its proper light by the advocates of the prohibitory system , /z/ was spoken of by Mr. Niles in the following terms , " I well remember it was haughtily and harshly said that the Tariff would render the great state of Virginia , tributary to Rhode Island ; and at the very moment when the capitalists of Waltham in Massachusetts , &tc.; &.C.,; were opposing the Tariff , that monopoly might rest with them ; " and again by Mr. Tibbits , to whom we have before referred , as one of the most distinguished writers in favour of the " American System , " and a member of the Harrisburg Convention ; " It is maintained by some of the oldest and most forward manufacturers , that manufactures do not require further protection . It is with difficulty , this opinion can be reconciled , with pure intentions . In the absence of all necessary proof , we are led to attribute it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his numerous essays , has expressed himself much to the same effect . These gentlemen have written and published more upon the prohibitory , or as they term it , " the American System , " than all its other advocates united ; and we observe their statements and opinions are always referred to , with the utmost respect and deference , by all those who are disposed to carry matters to extremes . We have quoted these remarks , not with a wish to disturb the harmony which prevails between those gentlemen and the manufacturers generally , but to show how much at variance they are in their notions of protection , with some of the manufacturers among us , who from their great success , may be supposed to understand their own interests , at least as well as these theorists , who have undertaken to direct them . However well intended may be the speculations of these writers , it is evident that the most intelligent , practical manufacturers , in this quarter , do not agree with them , and disclaim their opinions and views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do them a serious injury . They no doubt unite with all reasonable men in thinking that the greatest dangers , and the only ones the manufacturers now have to encounter , arise from the interference of mistaken and over-zealous advocates , who seem neither to understand what protection manufactures require , nor indeed even what they now enjoy . SECTION 7 . Another prevailing argument in favour of restriction and non-importation is , that Europeans do not take our produce freely , and at any rate that domestic exports being chiefly from the Southern sections , are of very little benefit to the Northern States . Some apply this on the one hand to the trade between Great Britain and the Northern States , others , more generally , to the whole foreign trade of the United States . When the desired effect is to bring odium on a rival manufacturing nation , England is alluded to ; but when the object is to excite Northern prejudices against Southern interests and Southern rights , the smallness of our exports from the Eastern and middle States to Europe generally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now select as we have before done , quotations from such authorities as are held in the greatest respect by the advocates of the exclusive policy . /z/ From Mr. H. G. Otis ' speech at the Boston Woollens Convention , in June , we take the following . " The British system in particular , is equivalent to a total prohibition upon the produce of this part of the country . The revised tariff will show , that they admit only what it is impossible lor us to introduce in competition with their own produce and fabrics . While they take nothing from us , they seem to have enjoyed the prescriptive usage ( which many of our citizens are willing to countenance , ) of supplying us with all we want , from hats to shoes , and of manufacturing for us all things down to a hob-nail . " Again ; " without manufactures we must come to want every thing , and can pay for nothing . Thus commerce and agriculture must sink together , like two fond sisters in a gradual decline , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take almost nothing which your soil produces . " Mr. Tibbits hi his address says ; " It is found that foreign countries subsist very well without any , or hut a small proportion of our agricultural productions , and the most of them are absolutely refused admittance under severe penalties . " Mr. Stewart , member of congress from Pennsylvania , observes ; " We are told , we must buy from Great Britain , that she may buy from us . How is this matter ? Great Britain buy of us ! ! What does she buy from the Northern and Middle States ? Sir , nothing . Great Britain from whom we bought in 1825 , upwards of 42,000,000 dollars of merchandize , 10,632,000 dollars of wool and woollens , took in exchange of the agricultural produce of all the States north of the Potomac and Ohio , an amount less than 500 dollars ! / " From the Pennsylvania address , we extract the following : " The domestic exports of the United States , in 1796 , were about 33,000,000 , exclusive of cotton and tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 23,982,473 dollars ; our population in 1796 , was about 4,750,000 . It is now about 12,500,000 . Thus while it has nearly trebled , the exports of all the articles produced by about 10,000,000 of our population , have diminished one third ; although the export of manufactures has increased four-fold . " We have , we believe , embraced in these extracts the substance of what they found their arguments upon , and we understand from what is here advanced , and the general tenor of their publications , that they mean to sustain the following points : 1st . That foreign countries generally , take but a small proport'ion of our agricultural products . 2nd . That according to Mr. Otis , and others , the British system is equivalent to a total prohibition of the produce of this part of the country ; and that she , ( Great Britain , ) continues to supply us with all we want , from the most important , to the most inconsiderable article . 3d . That in 1825 , we purchased of Great Britain 42,000,000 dol- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 500 dollars in agricultural produce of all the States north of the Potomac. 4th . That the domestic exports from the United States , in 179G , excluding tobacco and cotton , were about 33,000,000 of dollars . In 1S25 , excluding those articles , only 23,982,473 dollars . 5th . That however large the exportation of domestic produce to England and elsewhere , it is , comparatively speaking , of very little advantage to the northern section of the Union , as the various productions of which it is composed , are chiefly of the growth of the Southern States , and that this should reconcile the latter to the prohibitory system , even though it should be burdensome . In answer to the 1st , there is no doubt that the quantity of agricultural produce exported is small compared with what is consumed at home , and this must be the case in all countries ; but it is in reference to our export trade generally for past years , that this assertion is made . It is then so far from being true , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , viz : 66,944,745 dollars , in domestic productions , of which , only 5,729,797 dollars were in manufactures , and those were chiefly such as receive the least protection from the tariff of 1816 . To this amount must be added 32,590,643 dollars , export of foreign goods , which having been prov , cured in exchange for domestic produce not only gives the same employment to American labour and capital , that a like amount of woollen manufactures does , but a still further one to mechanics , merchants , labourers and navigators , engaged in the transportation of it , and that too , instead of imposing an enormous taxation on the consumers , as the restrictive system does , affording a great revenue to the nation . The benefits also of this foreign trade , instead of being confined to 100,000 proprietors of factories , is distributed to millions , throughout all the various sections of the Union . The exports of 1826 , have fallen off to 53,055,710 dollars of domestic , and 24,539,612 dollars of foreign articles , making a deficiency , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen in part from the great decline in price of some of our staples , but still more from the operation of the non-importation system , which by excluding such articles as foreigners have to give us in exchange for our produce , narrows down their means of purchasing it . We are told by Mr. Tibbits , " if a nation can not pay , or in other words can not export , it can not import ; if it can export but little , it can import but little ; in the long run its exports must be equal to its imports , and its imports must be equal to its exports . " And by Mr. Otis in his convention speech , " imports in the long run , can not exceed exports , " and of course exports can not in the long run , exceed imports ; and thus as Mr. Otis continues , " the farmer being deprived of the foreign market , will raise no more than what is required for his own subsistence . " Nothing can be more true . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , prohibit the exportation of our domestic produce , because we deprive foreign nations on whom we depend for its consumption , of the means of paying for it ; and yet the men who are the most active in establishing this system , complain that our export trade diminishes ! ! In regard to the first declaration in the second point , so far is it from being true , that we find on reference to the Custom-House report for 1825 , the exports offish , flour , candles , lumber , ashes , flaxseed , hides , tallow and other Northern articles direct to Great Britain , amounted to about 1,200,000 dollars , and to the British Colonies , 4,213,478 dollars ; in all 5,413,478 dollars ; 5,000,000 of dollars of which was no doubt produced " north of the Potomac , " which seems to be the utmost limit of that export trade , which the supporters of the " American System " regard with any favour . The exports of similar articles to the same places in 1826 , somewhat exceed this amount . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in the aggregate , an export for 1826 , to the British Colonies alone , from the whole o the United States , an amount of 4,798,765 dollars , of which less than 2 per cent was carried in British ships ; and employed 102,000 tons shipping in transporting these productions , we are now deprived of ; and it is so we think in retaliation of our anti-commercial and prohibitory system , imposing on the average , three times at least as much duty on such manufactures as Great Britain must rely upon to barter for our produce , as she does on such productions as are best suited to the circumstances and interests of this nation to raise and export . It is for the interest of Great Britain , and conformable to her new commercial policy , to have the trade between this country and her colonies , an open one . She tendered this trade to us on such terms as met her own views , and although for a time declined by us , we afterwards acceded to . Why then does she recede from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Gallatin , has assigned no reasons for his refusal ; he could not urge the one which we think prevailed on his-tnind , because it did not belong to the discussion in which he was engaged ; as we have an unquestionable right to regulate or destroy our commerce by legislation , or in any other way most suitable to the wisdom of our Government . It is however incumbent on the men now in power in England , to regulate their commercial system in regard to the United States , in conformity to such laws as we may enact in regard to our intercourse with them . Mr. Huskisson on removing many of the various restrictions on trade and navigation , has always held out as a compensation to those who imagined their interests suffered by his reforms , that he would either keep open foreign markets for the shipping and manufactures of Great Britain , or retaliate by closing the trade with England and her possessions , against those nations who would not reciprocate the liberal principles he acted upon . /z/ This is the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude the manufactures of England , exclude our produce and shipping , or forfeit his pledge to the nation . This result may perhaps of all others , be the most desirable , not to the manufacturers generally , but to that portion of them who are so selfish as to wish , or so short sighted as to expect , to sustain their interests , while they stand in opposition to those of the whole nation ; and still more to a class of politicians , who having no concern in manufactures themselves , and evincing an entire disregard to the bad consequences they may ultimately bring on those interests , which they affect to promote , are converting a question of national policy to party purposes ; and dazzled by those visions of political greatness , which play before their minds , are ready to undermine any established institutions , however useful , and subvert any of those great and sacred principles , on which our national peace and welfare depend , so that they may gratify their ungovernable and mischievous ambition . Those politicians ( of whose sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves have reason to doubt , since the most active and ambitious of them , only 3 or 4 years ago , when the duties were on woollens and cottons much lower than they now are , were equally zealous on the other side , ) omit no possible opportunity , of instilling , through reviews , newspapers , addresses , and every other avenue of communication with the nation , the worst prejudices against foreign trade , those engaged in it , and the nations with whom we have the largest transactions , and that too in a community where two thirds of the people are dependent on it for their daily bread . In answer to Mr Otis ' second assertion , " that Great Britain continues to supply us with all we want from the most important to the most inconsiderable article , " we do not mean to take his words in a strict literal sense , but if the terms he uses mean any thing , it is that we still rely almost entirely on Great Britain for the various manufactures we consume , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ? The committee find on examination , that the average of our importations of all sorts of goods from Great Britain in 1825 and 1826 was 31,422,617 dollars , from which an amount exceeding 2,000,000 dollars was . re-exported , leaving an amount of manufactured and unmanufactured articles for consumption of about 29,500,000 dollars . Now the whole amount of manufactures consumed in the United States , taken at a low estimate of 30 dollars a head would be 360,000,000 dollars. * Thus the proportion expended in Great Britain for manufactures , and all other articles , as compared with our expenditures at home would be something less than a twelfth part . These perhaps to the advocates of the new system , may appear as slight mistakes , as indeed they are , compared with some we have already exposed , and others we have yet to correct . /z/ We point them out however , not as of any importance in our view of the subject , for we are not among ; those who deem it a misfortune to the country , to buy goods abroad at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we apprehend such are the opinions of most men who do not share in the profits of manufacturing , and even of the most intelligent portion of those who do . Our main object then , in examining many of the statements we have answered , is to show how little reliance can be placed on the arguments of our opponents , even if founded on sound principles , since the statements on which they rest , are so entirely at issue with probabilities and facts . We have not quoted thus freely , from Mr. Otis ' speech , without having read it , with that attention , we are disposed to give to every thing coming from so eminent a man , and even imagining , that we might find arguments in it strong enough for our own conversion . We however see nothing in it to change our opinions . That foreign trade is derogatory to the character and injurious to the interests of a great nation that dear goods made at home , are better than cheap ones from abroad that capital and labour can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it is patriotic to tax the many for the benefit of the few . That it is just to aid by legislation , manufactures which do not succeed without it . That we ought to sell to other nations , but never to buy from them ; and finally , that it is wise to have good theories but still wiser to act on bad ones are we have long since known , fundamental principles , among the advocates of the " American System . " It is however somewhat new , and still more extraordinary , that these ancient and venerable maxims , sprung from the darkest ages of ignorance and despotism , and whose best apology Mr. Webster has said , ( in one of his admirable speeches against the system , ) " will be found in that sluggish and unenlightened state of society , in which they were established , " should , after having been driven from every enlightened corner of the world , take their last refuge here , and find what they have not done before for 50 years , a statesman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their defence . It is however most consolatory to us , and as we think , a very satisfactory evidence of the weakness of their cause and the strength of our own to see that even one of the most ingenious defenders of the system , has not been able to find any sounder arguments for its support , than the dullest mind engaged in it . In answer to the 3d point we say , that if it was meant , to discuss the trade between Great Britain and the States , " south of the Potomac , " they should have balanced the exports of that section against the imports to that section ; instead of which , the effect of their way of stating it , is to induce the belief , that while the Southern States had almost the entire advantage of the export trade with England , the manufacturing States were consumers of all the British imports , which to the party their arguments are addressed , is considered a great evil . We have already shewn from Custom House documents , that in 1825 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern productions , and 4,213,478 dollars to her Colonies , which no one can deny is equally beneficial . The amount exported in 1826 , rather exceeded those sums . It is impossible from the returns , to ascertain exactly the origin of each article , as these geographical distinctions , which formerly were of no importance , have not been attended to at the Treasury , in making up the reports ; but any practical man , will see on reference to the list , that at least 5,000,000 dollars must have been produced north of the Potomac . How does this coincide with Mr. Stewart 's assertion , which has gone through some hundreds of editions , that only jive hundred dollars , northern produce , was exported in 1825 ? We leave our readers to make their own reflections on such gross misrepresentations . It will be said perhaps , that in stating our export at 500 dollars only , Great Britain was intended , in which case , there would only have been an error of 1,199,500 dollars ; but England and her Colonies , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as imports from Great Britain , include the imports from England and all her Colonies . The fourth proposition taken from the Pennsylvania address is so ingeniously expressed , as either to conceal their own meaning , or mislead the public mind . If the intention was to show the comparative exports of 1796 and 1825 , why leave out the two principal articles , Cotton and Tobacco ? What would be said of the fairness of a writer , who in undertaking to give an account of the export trade of Cuba , should leave out Coffee and Sugars ? The reader is left to infer , that our domestic exports were above 40 per cent , more in 1796 than in 1825 , and thus an appeal is made ( by exhibiting this great falling off in our export trade ) to those prejudices against our foreign commerce , which forms an important part of the plan of our opponents . Let us now give an actual statement of the exports of these two years . In 1796 , our domestic exports they say , were $33,000,000 Add tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,106,729 Ibs. cotton , worth about $2,000,000 $7,000,000 /z/ Exports of domestic produce in /z/ Add excluded articles , Tobacco , $6,115,623 Do . Cotton , 36,846,649 42,962,272 $66,944,745 /z/ It appears then , that balancing the omissions of 1796 against the omissions of 1825 , they have left out of the latter year the amount of $33,962,272 . Here then is a statement coming from a society of men , who are among the principal founders and promoters of the new system , issuing their circulars , assembling conventions to make tariffs for the government , and undertaking to direct the public mind , and the national legislature upon the most important subject which can come before them ; who , in giving an account of the most valuable branch of our commerce , leave out 33,962,272 dollars , or more than half the amount . We are aware it may be said by some of their apologists , that if they omitted cotton and tobacco in 1796 , they did the same in 1825 , but this does not equalize their statement , because at the former period the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter it was our principal staple . We admit , however , that considering the increase of wealth and population since 1796 , our exports are much less than might be expected , and this is owing principally to the effects of our system of high duties . " Exports ( as we are told by Mr. Tibbits ) must be equal to imports . " If we diminish the consumption of manufactures and produce of foreign nations by excessive and prohibitory duties , we diminish their means of purchasing and consuming the produce of our country . There is indeed another way of accounting for this blind and deceptive statement we have been examining , and it is what we have before adverted to ; the determination of the party we are opposing , to throw out of the case all the exports of the southern or " plantation states " ( as they are termed ) either as comparatively speaking unimportant to our national welfare , or at any rate as not contributing to the prosperity of the northern and middle states j and this indeed embraces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make out their case , the most laboured and plausible estimates have been circulated , contrasting the small amount of exports from the manufacturing , compared with the more agricultural states . The gross inaccuracy of some of those , coming too from their most respectable advocates , has already been exposed . But if they had been correct in their statements and proved that not a dollar 's worth of produce had been shipped for 20 or a hundred years , north of the Potomac , it would not by any means follow that it would he just or expedient to tax and destroy the trade of those sections , whose situation and circumstances enabled them to export ; nor would it prove , what our opponents have taken infinite pains to have believed , that we do not participate , and that too , in a very high degree , in the advantages of this so much envied export trade . Will our opponents pretend to say , that a foreign trade is not beneficial to any of the states , but such as can furnish from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such was in fact the case , /z/ one quarter of the Union would be excluded from its advantages . There are at least some five or six states , whose principal staples never reached the shores of Europe , and never will perhaps , till the tides of the Atlantic flow to the foot of the Alleganies . What is it , we would inquire , which prevents our enjoying in common with the southern states the advantage of their great agricultural staples ? Is it distance or difficulty of communication ? This certainly can not be the case , for New-York is much nearer to Virginia , than we are to some of the manufacturing states , and New England generally , can communicate with the Carolines , much sooner and at less expense than with Ohio , or many parts of Pennsylvania and New-York ; yet no one will deny the advantages we derive from their agricultural productions . Why then draw a line at the Potomac , as if the country beyond that had a distinct interest from the northern sections ? Why array the northern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were not the same nation , and the advantages peculiar to each were not shared in common ? " Are not the lines already drawn ( says one of their advocates ) and is it not whether freemen or slaves , whether white men or black men , shall rule the destinies of this country ? " Such are the distinctions , and such the language made use of by many of the party we are resisting , towards the people of those sections of the country , who in common with a large majority here , reprobate the prohibitory system . We have before observed that New England , and such of the middle states as are likely for the next 50 years to share with her in the business of manufacturing for other states , are already comparatively populous , employed extensively in commerce and manufactures , and of course consumers of their own productions to an extent , which under any circumstances , not only affords us little for export , but obliges us to be large importers for our own consumption ; and this has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labour however have not been , and are not now idle , and if we may judge from the superior degree of comfort , and wealth enjoyed here , over the " plantation states , " they are employed in a more profitable way . We are then , compared with the southern and western sections , a commercial , navigating , manufacturing people , and consuming more than we raise , we must depend for our agricultural exports on those sections , which are less populous , and entirely dependant on agriculture ; while they leave to us the benefit of transporting their produce , and take from us largely the various products of our industry . We have no means of ascertaining precisely , as we have before observed , the origin of all our exports , but it is conceded that a very large proportion of our domestic articles , varying from year to year from three fifths to three quarters of the whole amount , are the produce of the southern states ; but whether more or less , is of no importance in our view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we share with them in the advantages of this trade . /z/ We certainly will not undertake , nor would it be possible , to point out , the exact measure of benefit enjoyed by us , in the results of southern labour . We will however select the principal commodity , and by tracing in a general way the course which it takes , endeavour to illustrate our meaning . The last crop of cotton , or all which was brought to the various sea-ports for exportation , is ascertained to be about 970,000 bales . The whole of this , whether sent to Europe or consumed at home , must be transported by sea . About 375,000 bales have been , or will be sent to the northern ports , commencing from 30th of September , 1826 , and ending 30th of September , 1827 ; of which about 250,000 bales , will be re-exported to Europe . From New-York alone 205,975 bales had been re-shipped between the 1st of October , and the 1st of August . The residue goes direct to Europe , from the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three farthings to one penny sterling , occasionally higher or lower . That which is re-shipped from the northern ports , pays a half penny per pound , occasionally a little lower ; but as this also pays a freight from the south , it will be within bounds to say , that the whole crop of cotton pays a freight on the average of three farthings or 1 1-2 cents the pound . All that is sent coastwise , goes in American vessels . Of the portion shipped to Europe , perhaps a tenth goes in foreign vessels , such being about the proportion of foreign to American vessels , engaged in our commerce for the years 1825 and 1826 , Now taking the crop at 970,000 bales , and allowing 340lbs. to a bale , gives 329,800,000 pounds , and the freight at 1 1-2 cents amounts to 4,947,000 dollars . The other charges on cotton are commissions , shipping charges on what is brought to the north , interest on northern capital for 6 to 10 months , employed in transporting it , and premium of insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole crop , valued at 9 cents per pound is 29 , 682 , 000 dollars . These charges amount to 1,484,100 dollars , and added to the freight is 6,431,100 dollars , nine tenths of the amount of which is distributed among American ship owners , merchants , labourers , capitalists , mechanics and citizens generally , and not as in the woollen business , to 90 or 100,000 persons , but to several millions . Of the shipping employed , if we take the table of tonnage for 1826 , nearly one half would belong to New-York and Massachusetts , one eighth to Maine , and about seven eighths of the whole to states north of the Potomac , or the manufacturing states , according to the distinctions now made . We here have a statement , and certainly not an over-charged one , of the direct benefit the northern states receive , and for the transport chiefly , of a staple of which the gross value on the plantations is only 29,682,000 dollars , and a deduction of 1 1-2 cents a pound for bagging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would reduce the amount to 24,735,000 dollars . If then we allow one tenth of these charges to foreigners , and one eighth of what remains to shipping owned south of the Potomac , there /z/ would remain about 5,000,000 of dollars ( on a staple worth only 24,735,000 dollars ) which goes to the direct support of the northern states . Let us now see what becomes of the proceeds of this cotton . The 374,000 bales sent to the Northern ports are principally , if not entirely paid for , by the produce and manufactures of the Northern States , or with foreign goods purchased in exchange for Northern productions . This fact may not come within the observation or knowledge of all our readers , but we appeal with the greatest confidence to the merchants generally , more especially those of New York , through whose hands most of this trade passes , to confirm the correctness of our assertion . We inquire still further , what becomes of the proceeds of that part of the crop which goes direct from the South to Europe ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , in payment for Southern debts incurred by the purchase of Northern produce and manufactures . If what we have stated is true , and no one can deny that it is so , will it still be said or believed , even by those who persist in saying it , that the cotton planters of the South do not promote the employment of Northern capital and labour , and that we do not participate with them in the benefits of their exports ? If such was not the case , what has become of the 400,000,000 dollars or more , proceeds of cotton , for the last 30 years ? Have the planters invested it in bank stock or national securities ? It is well known that they hold very little of either . Much of these earnings have no doubt been expended in the improvement and extension of their estates , but a far greater amount has been distributed in the Northern sections , and could we trace it through all its channels , no small portion of it would be found in the purses of those wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system which will injure and disaffect their best customers . What we have said of cotton applies equally to tobacco , rice , naval stores , and all the Southern and Western staples . There can not be a day 's useful labour performed in those sections , in which we do not share with them in its benefits . To think otherwise implies total ignorance of the nature of trade , and of our connexion with the Southern States . We are told , however , with a great deal of emphasis , that the consumption of cotton is immensely promoted by the new system . How so ? Would not the material manufactured here be used for similar purposes , by those foreign manufacturers who would furnish us with goods ? No one can deny this , and we say to a greater extent , if foreign goods come cheaper , and for a most obvious reason , that the lower the article the greater the consumption . So far then are the cotton planters from being benefited by the tarirTof 1816 , that besides paying a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of it has been to lessen the consumption of their staple , on /z/ which 2,000,000 of people mainly depend for subsistence , instead of the 300,000 persons which Mr. Davis , and other authorities affirm , comprehend the whole number engaged , both in manufactures of cotton and wool . Burdensome , however , as has been that measure , the cotton planters have borne it . They have not , we believe , ever sent in a petition against it , nor even against the additions since made after the law was altered . It is against still further encroachments , they are now contending . Again , it is asserted by Mr. Everett in his Convention speech , " that as far as our domestic cottons take the place of India goods , their manufacture is a clear addition to the demand for American cotton ; " leaving it to be inferred by this sentence , and what preceded , that the high duties imposed in 1816 had forced India cotton goods out of use . In the first place , if this was true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no moment whatever . Our average consumption of India cotton goods , for 10 years before the protecting tariff of 1816 passed , did not exceed 8400 bales a year . The quantity of cotton they required could not have exceeded 12 or 14,000 bales , which in a crop of 970,000 , or even 500,000 bales , has no influence whatever . Jn the next place , the expulsion of India cotton goods has no more to do with the tariff of 1816 , than the question of the North-West passage or perpetual motion . Cotton manufactures of all sorts have been so much lower in England than in India for 10 years past , as to form one of the principal exports from that country to all parts of Asin , to a much greater amount than we now consume of those fabrics . No cottons made in India could have been imported here without loss , hac that tariff never been passed , nor at this lime with a bounty o/20 per cent , it is therefore the great decline of goods in England which has forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System . " Our opponents again contend , that Southern interests have an equivalent in the prohibitory duties in favour of their staples ; snvff , tobacco and cotton . On the latter 3 cents a pound , which Mr. Carey says , " is 35 to 50 per cent , and actually prohibitory ; " and adds , " he x trusts no man of honour will deny it . " What men of honour will deny or affirm , is not the business of this committee to say . It is the argument founded on this statement which we are to consider , and we beg leave to call the attention of our readers to it , as coming from a man whom the advocates of non-importation and non-exportation profess to look up to as one of the principal founders of the " American System , " and in whose and Mr. Niles ' publications , we have seen most of those statements and reasonings , which have been so often brought forward , and repeated in conventions , in congress , and elsewhere . The duty on tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cotton for 25 years , and when first imposed in 1790 , it was not a protecting duty , for the cultivation had hardly commenced . It was a duty for revenue , and a very moderate one , since as the price it then bore , 30 to 33 cents a pound , it amounted to only 10 pelcent . The making of snuff , we apprehend , is more beneficial to the Northern manufacturer than to the Southern planter , and if not , it is too insignificant to be of any importance in such a question as this . We will , however , venture to say , that the Virginians will not only surrender all the profit , but pay for all the snuff used in this country since the date of their charter , for a few years of their portion of the woollen tax . To talk of protecting the interests of the south , by duties on articles which are notoriously cheaper there than in any section of the globe , must appear to every one as it does to this committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of New England think , if in reply to complaints against a heavy tax imposed on the nation to promote the culture of tobacco and cotton at the south , they should be told by the people of those states , that " congress had for their benefit , imposed a high duty on the importation of codfish and lumber from France , and England ? " It strikes the committee that such an answer would appear something like a sarcasm , and we should conceive that a statesman who treated the business in this manner , evinced either a gross ignorance of his subject or a most insulting levity . Yet this is the language , and such the arguments used by the statesmen and economists whom we are opposing , to reconcile southern people to an unequal , unjust and burdensome taxation , and when they are restive under it , they complain of their irritability . To those who have read with attention the numerous publications of the advocates of the ' ; protecting system , " nothing can be more striking and offensive , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , southern feelings , and southern rights . This must be a cause of regret to all reflecting men ; for whatever zeal may be felt on the one handler indifference on the other , among our own citizens , it should be considered that this is not a mere abstract question , unimportant in its effects , and when once determined may be expected to subside into that state of quietness and oblivion which many others do . It is a question involving in its consequences our whole foreign and domestic policy , and whether settled in favour of one party or the other , there will be sufficient causes of animosity , without those constant appeals to sectional prejudices , from which the worst effects can not fail to flow . The southern production , however , on which most stress has been laid , is the article of brown sugar , on which Mr Carey says , there has been imposed " the exorbitant duty of 3 cents a pound , equal to 75 per cent to 100 per cent , for the protection of the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at the present low price of sugar , the duty is very considerably less than is represented ; it would not average over 60 per cent . In the next place , so far from being levied " for the benefit of the rich planter of Louisiana , " it was established at 2 1-2 cents a pound , before ive acquired possession of that country . The duty was not imposed for protection , but for revenue , and did not amount , at the price sugar then bore , to more than 25 per cent . In 18 12 when the war duties were laid , it was , with other rates , doubled , making 5 cents a pound . In 1816 , when our system was changed from moderate duties for revenue , to what is called the " protecting system , " what did congress do in reference to this article ? They lowered the rate to 3 cents a pound , leaving only an addition of 1-2 a cent a pound ; while they raised the duties on cotton goods on an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the woollen manufactures a duty of nominally 25 , really 29 per cent , instead of the former rate , previous to war duties being established , of 15 per cent , and subsequently raised it to 38 per cent , which the manufacturers contend must still further be advanced from 38 to 139 per cent , averaging perhaps 80 per cent . It should be borne in mind , that in April 1816 , when the Tariff passed , the prices of brown muscovado sugars , exclusive of duty , averaged 10 to 12 cents , making the duty 25 to 33 1-3 per cent , according to the qualities of the article . Thus it appears that since Louisiana was admitted into the Union , government has added 1-2 a cent a pound to duty of 2 1-2 cents , " to protect the rich planter , " while woollens have since that lime been raised from 12 1-2 to 38 per cent , and cottons to 4 or 5 times the rate they then paid . We will now estimate the whole protecting duty paid on sugars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the duty operates in the case of sugars as in woollens , to increase the cost to the consumers , by the amount of duties paid . The consumption of brown sugar similar to the Louisiana , may be about 45,000,000 pounds , of which 25,000,000 pounds are raised in Louisiana ; the whole duty is 1,350,000 dollars ; of this sum 750,000 dollars , being 3 cents a pound on all which is raised at home , goes to the Louisiana planters , and 600,000 dollars being the duty on what is actually imported , goes into the public chest for revenue , of which we all share the benefit . The amount of woollens consumed in the United States is 72,000,000 - dollars , on which the duty at 38 per cent amounts to 27 ' , 360,000 dollars . The average importation for 1825 and 1826 is 9,000,000 dollars , the duty on which is 3,420,000 dollars ; of the protecting duties on woollens 3,420,000 dollars , go into the treasury of the United States as revenue , and the balance , 23,940,000 dollars , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the woollen manufacturers ; yet all their memorials go upon the assumption , that very little has been done in favour of the woollen manufactures . /z/ It would appear then , that on comparing the bounty received by " the wealthy planters of Louisiana , " with the bounty paid to the woollen manufacturers , that the former receive 750,000 dollars , and the latter 23,910,000 dollars . The number of manufacturers , we are informed by Mr. Davis , and other good authorities , are from 90 to 100,000 , directly the United States were made at home , when the duty was but five per cent , and that no complaints were made of want of protection , it will be admitted by candid men , that this tax is levied that we may support 25,000 additional manufacturers . Of the number of persons dependant on the cultivation of sugar , we have no very accurate means of judging , but we should imagine the number could not be fewer than 25 or 80,000 persons . As some of our opponents may be inclined from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle on which it is estimated , we will give them some of their most valued authorities to shew that they have sanctioned its correctness . In a speech of Mr. Davis , on the woollens bill , in referring to the burden imposed in the manufactures by the high duty on wool , he observes " It is no answer to this view of the subject , to say that a large portion of the wool used here is purchased of our farmers ; for as long as wool is imported , the foreign article will regulate the price , and when American wool of equal quality falls below it , importations will cease , " and Mr. Carey in one of his essays , discussing the same subject , affirms , " this operates most oppressively on the manufacturers , as the quantity of wool produced in this country , notwithstanding a great increase of late , is inadequate to the demand , and they are obliged to depend much on foreign supplies ; and it has been justly observed , " that the price of the domestic article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle has also been fully recognized by Mr. Everett in his convention speech , and by many others who have been equally zealous in advocating the non-importation system . We will cite still another authority , for the satisfaction of the doubtful . It is from the report of Alexander Hamilton , whom our opponents have affected to rank among the supporters of their policy , though as we shall hereafter show , without the least reason . In a discussion upon the nature and effects of protecting duties he says , " They evidently amount to a virtual bounty on domestic fabrics , since by enhancing the charges on foreign articles , they enable the national manufacturers to undersell all their foreign competitors . " And such is the operation of the duty on woollens , and all other duties imposed on importations . When the duties are sufficiently moderate to permit the importation of foreign goods , such duties go into the public purse , for the benefit of all , they then operate like any other taxes , and though the manufacturers benefit by them , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , it must be in some other ; but when /z/ duties are so high as to prevent importations , the tax is still paid by the nation , but instead of going into the general fund , it goes into the pockets of the manufacturers ; and this is one of the necessary consequences , though by no means the most injurious , of the " American System . " We beg it may not be understood from any thing we have said , that we are arguing in favor or in defence of the sugar duty . We readily admit it is too high , and that if this staple continues at its present low price , the rate should be lowered , and we have no doubt the Louisiana planters will agree to this , when the Tariff shall undergo that revision , which the national welfare so much requires . These geographical distinctions , these comparisons of southern and nothern trade , this balancing the pretensions of woollen manufacturers against the rights and interests of all other classes , is a most unpleasant task to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a few hundred men , powerful we admit for their wealth and talents , having a deep interest at stake , and influencing some thousands of others , who are interested in a less degree , aided and stimulated by other able and ambitious men , acting from considerations equally selfish and personal , choose to identify their private and particular interests with those of the public , ( against whose welfare their system must operate , ) and to assume the name and authority of the 5 or 6,000,000 people of the eastern and middle states , and to represent them as favourable to what we consider their impolitic and unjust schemes , we are bound in duty to ourselves , to deny all participation in their opinions and views . It certainly can not be denied , that at this moment there is an appearance of indifference and acquiescence on the part of the public , to the designs of this party , but we err very much in our estimate of the good sense and good principles of this part of the nation , if when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this policy which have been displayed in its establishment and promotion . We say , we are very much mistaken , if when that lime arrives , there is not , we will not say as great a proportion , but as large a number opposed to it on this side of the Potomac , as on the other . We conclude this division of our report , . with expressing our belief that all impartial men who may examine our statements and our arguments , will agree that we have in the first place , proved the incorrectness of the facts on which our opponents rely for the establishment of their positions , and in the next , if we admit them to be true , no such consequences would flow from them as they would have us believe . SECTION 8 . Another reason alleged by the woollen-manufacturers for an increase of duty is , that a reduction of certain duties on wool and other articles used in the manufacture of cloths , amounting to 1G2-3 per cent , was made by the British government subsequently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by /z/ which the intention of that law was defeated , and that Congress is bound in justice to give at least such an addition to the present rate , as will equal these taxes , from which the British manufacturers have been relieved . That we may do no injustice to the party we are opposing , we pursue the plan we at first adopted , of selecting the statements and arguments we are attempting to refute , from the most respectable and best known supporters of the prohibitory system . Mr. Lawrence , one of the most intelligent woollen manufacturers , and a member of the Harrisburg Convention , in a speech at the Boston Woollens Convention , held in June , in speaking of the tariff of 1824 , states , " the British duty on wool was at that time six pence the pound , but no sooner did the British government hear of this act of the Congress of the United Stales , than they reduced the duty on wool to one penny the pound , and subsequently the coarser kinds to an half-penny a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress , made during last winter , we extract the following : " At the time when the tariff of 1824 went into operation , all the wool imported into England was subject to , and paid a duty of six pence a pound ; by a subsequent modification of her tariff , this was reduced to 1 penny a pound on all wool costing over one shilling a pound . Mr. Everett , in his speech at the Boston Woollens Convention in June , inquires , " why should we allow the British Parliament to repeal the law which we have passed for the protection of our farmers ? " " In 1824 , " continues Mr. Everett , " the American Congress saw fit to give the farmer the benefit of a progressively increasing duty , rising to 30 per cent on imported wool . The British Government immediately thinks fit to lower the duty on wool 44 per cent 5 " and again , " taking 20 cents per pound to be the average price of the kind in question , the duty upon it after these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction it was 48 per cent . The manufacturer in England has consequently received an advantage of 44 per cent on his wool . But the wool is estimated to be about a third part of the cloth , consequently the manufacturer has gained 14 2-3 per cent in the fabric of his article , by the reduction of the duty on wool . " There were also other alterations of duties on rape seed , olive oil , logwood and indigo . " The amount , " says Mr. Everett , " of all these , and some other reductions , was stated by Mr. Huskisson , at from 1 to 2 per cent on , the manufacture . I believe it is nearer twice that amount . Taking it however at 2 per cent , in addition to the 14 2-3 per cent already mentioned , it reduces the effective duty in this country on foreign woollens to 16 2-3 per cent , that is , just one half . " The argument founded on this statement , has been urged with much ingenuity and force , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twelve months before , in various other meetings , and in memorials , speeches , essays , &c.; and with an earnestness /z/ which evinced the strong reliance the manufacturers placed upon it . They have not indeed been mistaken in their estimate of its effect , for nothing we believe has made so deep an impression in their favour . If our readers , however , will give us their attention , we hope to convince them that this is a delusion , which like many others on this subject , owes its success entirely to the indolence , or indifference of those who having the means of detecting its unsoundness , allow it to pass without examination ; or perhaps still more to the confidence the public are disposed to place in the authority and understandings of those who have chosen to give it currency . A reference to the extracts , and a consideration of the speeches from which we have taken them , will show that they mean to assert the following propositions : 1st . That the British Government reduced the duties on wool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent to , the passing of the tariff law of 1824 , and with a view of defeating the provisions of that law . 2dly . That our Government is pledged in good faith , to give the woollen manufacturers such an addition to the present rate of duty , as will equal the taxes of which the British manufacturers have been relieved by their Government . 3dly . That these reductions referred to , diminish the cost of woollen manufactures in England 162-3 per cent . In regard to the first , it appears manifest from what is here advanced , and the general scope of the speeches to which we refer , that our opponents would have us believe , that the British Government on hearing of the passage of the tariff of 1824 , had from a spirit of hostility towards our manufactures , made sudden alterations in their system of duties , to enable their manufacturers still to undersell ours , and thus to countervail the benefit of the increased duty granted by our Government in 1824 ; or to use the words of Mr. Everett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress for the protection of American industry . " The effect of these representations , is , in the first place , to establish a claim on the justice of our Government , to make good to the manufacturers what was intended to be given them by the tariff of 1824 ; and in the second , to excite a spirit of hostility towards a rival manufacturing nation , standing in the way of the woollen manufacturers . Our objections to these statements are , in thefirst place , thatthey evince a very bad temperf * " Unless the American people think it just and fair , that the laws passed by the American Congress for the protection of American industry , stiould be repealed by the Britisli Parliament , and that for the purpose of securing the supply of our market , to the British manufacturer to the end of time , it was the duty of Congress to counteract this movement . " . Everett 's Speech . t " Believing , of course , Uiat there is no wish to single it out , ( the manufacture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . f or unfriendly legislation at home , I can not sit still , and see the gigantic arm of Government stretched out across the Atlantic , avoioedly to crush it . " Everet ' s Speech . /z/ towards a nation , with whom our commercial transactions are of greater magnitude , and greater value to us , not only than those with any other nation , but than with all Europe besides ; and in the next , that they are founded on an entire misrepresentation of facts . The real truth with respect to the duty of six pence a pound on British wool , as stated by Mr. Robinson , ( Chancellor of the Exchequer , ) is , " that it did not exist till 1819 , for up to that time it had only been one penny the pound , and it was imposed not as a duty of protection , but of revenue . " " These duties were not the established practice , but an innovation on the established practice of our ancestors . " Petitions for its repeal were sent in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed from year to year , to reduce it to its former rate , but were resisted till 1824 , when the necessities of the nation , no longer rendering it indispensable , it was , with the duties on some other articles , reduced . The alteration of the duty on wool was then , only returning to their former system . It was no doubt a relief to the manufacturers and still more to the consumers , but it was done without any particular reference to our tariff , and the measure would unquestionably have been adopted , had no change taken place in our duties . In the various debates from time to time on the subject of this tax , and that of the manufacture of woollens , the importance of supplying the United States with coarse woollens is dwelt upon by one speaker , but it was the competition with the continental manufacturers , which all the *advocatesfor reduction had chiefly in view , and not those of the United States . Indeed when it is considered that the annual product of this branch of manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present exchange 220,500,000 dollars , and that our imports for the last year , of all sorts of British woollens , is only 7,014,984 dollars , of which a considerable amount was re-exported , the loss of this market can not be deemed of such vital importance , as many persons imagine . Great Britain no doubt places a due value upon our purchases of her manufactures , but we must not overrate their importance . Under the present enormous duties imposed on her staples , amounting to 3 or 4 times as much as she levies on ours , we shall soon reduce our imports , so as to render what little amount we may require of no importance whatever . This indeed is the natural effect of the " American System , " and such is the result to which we are fast approaching . Having shown that the repeal of the wool duty - was petitioned for , four years before the passing of the tariff of 1824 , let us now compare the date of that law with the passage of the British act redu- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the U. States , we find the tariff act dated 22d of May , 1824 , while the act reducinsjthe duty on wool passed 1 80 to 20 in the house of commons 2 1 st of May , 1824 . How then can it be said that a law petitioned for in 1820 , which passed 21st May , 1824 , ( 30 or 40 days before the passage of our law was known in England ) could have been enacted subsequently to , in consequence of , and with a view of defeating the provisions of a law passed in this country on the 19th , and signed 22d of May of the same year ? We repeat again , the repeal of the wool duty in England , had no reference , and could have had none , to the passage of the tariff of 1824 . There is too the most ample evidence in the Parliamentary debates from 1819 to 1824 , ( to which we refer our readers ) that this measure had not the smallest connexion in the minds of the British ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to our own woollen manufactures , oor in the minds of the manufacturers who petitioned for it . Here then are the facts utterly disproving the assertions on which the strongest argument in favour of the pretensions of the woollen manufacturers is founded . But it will perhaps be said that the British act , if not passed subsequently to the alteration of our tariff , was enacted with the knowledge or belief that such a measure would be adopted . As we have before shewn , the repeal of the duty on wool ( which was but a return to its former rate ) was petitioned for four years before our tariff passed , and as to the Parliament anticipating that such a law would pass , there is not the slightest ground for that supposition , as the measure was unexpected even here , till it actually became a law . Parties were so nearly balanced as stated by Mr. Stevenson in the debate in Congress , on the tariff last winter , " that the house was equally divided on the woollen question , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also confirmed by a senator of New-York , who voted for the bill . The main question passed the house by 107 to 102 , and to a third reading in the senate by 25 to 22 . It is also worthy of note , that it was perfectly well understood in Congress , while the tariff of 1824 was under discussion , that an act was before the British Parliament for this reduction of the duty on wool , and that it would probably become a law . They were reminded of it both in the senate and the house by several members , and among others , by Mr. Webster , in the following words , " while I am upon this subject , I would notice the recent proposition of the English Parliament , to establish the tax on imported wool . " On such an occasion it might seem ungrateful in the committee , were they to pass this name , without offering their sincere tribute of thanks , for the manly efforts made by this intelligent statesman , to resist a system , founded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ignorance , partiality and violence ; " and they most earnestly recommend the various speeches made by him in Congress , and /z/ elsewhere , as containing the soundest and most convincing arguments against its impolicy , absurdity and injustice . In answering the assertions on which the arguments of our opponents are chiefly founded , we have dealt with them , as the cause of truth required ; we would not , however , have it inferred that we mean to impute to the worthy men who made them any deliberate design of imposing false statements on the public . We presume they took the facts from others . We can not , however , but express our regret , that gentlemen , who from their talents and stations , are held up as guides to public opinion , and as founders of a new policy , should not look for information to more correct or purer sources . In answer to the second head , we reply , that if the supporters of the contemplated Tariff mean to rest their right to an increase of duties on woollens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the duty given them in 1824 , by an act passed in England in consequence of , and subsequent to that law , and with a view of defeating its provisions , we say we have furnished indisputable proofs , that such a claim is unfounded and can not be sustained on that ground . If , on the other hand , they mean to maintain , as Mr. Everett has done , " that the principle on which it ( the Tariff of 1824 ) was formed , was to enable each article as manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article imported , " we apprehend , that independent of all other considerations , such a principle would subject our legislature to insuperable difficulties . Let us examine some of the consequences to which it must inevitably lead . What is it they contend for in the case of woollens ? Why , that taxes to the amount of 16 2-3 per cent , having been removed from the British manufacturer , an equal amount must be imposed on the American consumer , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If then the taxes removed by the British government had amounted to 50 or 100 per cent. , our manufacturers would have been entitled to 50 or 100 per cent , more duty , and soon to an unlimited extent . We will now imagine , what has indeed often occurred in those periods of ignorance and injustice , to which we are frequently referred by our opponents for precedents , that the British government , in order to sustain a favourite branch of industry , should grant a bounty of 30 or 40 per cent on all woollpns exported to the United States for 50 years . Such a measure however foolish and inexpedient on the part of England , could not fail of being advantageous to us as a nation , though it might be fatal to our woollen manufacturers . But if Mr. Everett 's principle is acted upon , a corresponding change must be made in our laws , and our own consumers taxed precisely in the ratio in which foreigners are relieved from taxation . It may be said this is an extravagant case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not till the return of those ages of darkness when such systems originated ; certainly not during the lives of the enlightened /z/ and politic statesmen who now rule in England . It is however precisely the course recommended to , and which has in fact been adopted by our government . In such a case as we have supposed , Great Britain might be obliged to pay perhaps 8 or 10,000,000 of dollars a year on the extended importation we should make under such a bounty . This is a large sum , but what is it to the tax of 27,360,000 dollars we now pay , and which , if our opponents succeed , is to be doubled ? We will now suppose that Congress had granted at the last session , the 16 2-3 per cent duty which Mr. Everett affirms the woollen manufacturers have a right to ; and that before the termination of the ensuing session , we should have information that the poor tax of 30,000,000 dollars a year had been assumed by the British government ; our Congress could not in such an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what the British manufacturer had been relieved by that measure . Having satisfied this demand , we should then hear of the contemplated modification of the corn laws having passed , ( and that such a measure will pass the next year , there can be no question , ) we should then be called upon for a further increase of duties . The alteration alluded to , would it has been estimated , lower the price of all sorts of grain used in Great Britain three shillings a quarter , which on 48,000,000 quarters consumed , would amount , at the current exchange to 35,360,000 dollars per annum , and afford a vastly greater relief to woollen manufacturers , than they could have gained by the reduction of the duty on wool , as we shall hereafter show . And thus in case of any improvements in machinery , a decline in the rate of interest or in wages , or any other circumstance lessening the cost of woollens , our manufacturers would have an equal claim to still further duties , since according to Mr. Everett , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same articles as imported . " If however the principle is a correct one , it must be extended to cotton goods , glass , hard ware , iron , linens , and every other article which can be imported from England in competition with our domestic manufactures , and not only from England , but from every other quarter of the world . Still further , keeping this principle in view , this government would be bound to make corresponding reductions in our Tariff , in case new taxes should be imposed on any foreign manufactures which when imported into this country could come into competition with our domestic manufactures . Mr. Everett complains of the British government " having laid its hand on our statute book , and taking half the duty imposed by the Tariff law of 1824 . " What then would be our condition , if the principle he advocates was once adopted . ? We should have to regulate our movements not only by British legislation , but by all the fluctuations which might occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come in competition with our own . We are not now rea- /z/ soning on extravagant and improbable suppositions , but upon the natural and necessary course of events , some of which we know must happen . The principle we are contending against , needs only to be examined and traced to its practical consequences , to shew not only its unsoundness , but its utter impracticability ; to say nothing of the monstrous notion it involves , that every burden removed from the manufacturing population in Europe , should be transferred to us , and for what ? Why , that a certain amount of capital and labour may be devoted to the making of goods , which in the case of woollens , the manufacturers admit , ( by the duty of 80 per cent they require for their protection , ) may be had for little more than half the money elsewhere . In other words , and it can not be too often repeated , if woollens can be imported 38 per cent cheaper than they can be made at home , ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pay under the existing duty , an annual tax of 27,360,000 dollars to sustain the woollen manufactures ; or to bring it home to our individual interests , every family which expends 100 dollars in woollen cloths , pays a tax of 38 dollars to the manufacturers ; and if the contemplated Tariff passes , they will amount from 38 to 139 per cent , increasing according to the coarseness of the goods , so that the tax on the consumer will rise , not in proportion to his wealth , but his poverty . While noticing the enormous amount of this tax , which the manufacturers themselves seem to think so lightly of , when they reproach us with resisting their efforts to double it , we will notice an objection to our estimate , on account of its largeness ; as if the magnitude of an evil was any argument against its existence . Why is it , they ask , if such a large amount as 27,360,000 dollars is paid to sustain the woollen manufacturers , that there should be so much distress among them ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in the business . We might answer this question , by proposing another . Why is it that a vessel discharging ten gallons , and receiving but eight in the same time , becomes exhausted f We think it does not require the mind of a magician to comprehend the reason ; to apply this illustration to the case of the manufacturers , we say if they do not grow rich under the present duty , it is because they expend more than they receive . The fallacy which conceals the deception , lies in supposing that when a duty or a tax is levied for the benefit of manufactures , it not only goes into thepockets of the manufacturers , but remains there . To illustrate more fully our meaning , we will imagine , that a supply of all the woollens we require , may be imported from Europe at four dollars a head , which for 12,000,000 persons would amount to 48,000,000 dollars , and that the same quantity would cost the domestic manufacturer 8 dollars a head , or 96,000,000 dollars ; but owing to foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to obtain 6 dollars a head , or 72,000,000 dollars . It is clear in this instance , we should pay 24,000,000 dollars more for our domestic goods than foreign goods would cost , and yet the American manufacturers lose 24,000,000 dollars . Here then is a case in which the consumer pays 50 per cent more for his clothing than it could be imported for , and at the same time the favoured manufacturer loses annually 25 per cent on the whole amount he manufactures . This is one of the evils of the forcing system . We may go on , taxing the nation more than our whole annual expenditure , to promote the success of only one article , and not only fail of that object , but ruin those who receive this immense bounty ; and this , according to the statements which have been published , is the present alleged condition of the woollen manufacturers , who , though enjoy* ing the benefit of a protecting tax of 27,360,000 dollars , insist upon it they shall be ruined , unless it is doubled . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the term " monopolist , " as applied to them . They contend that the public can not suffer , at least for a long time , from the effects of a monopoly , because competition will soon reduce goods to their proper level . We admit that if woollens or any other goods are in consequence of prohibition , or what is the same thing , prohibitory duties , above their natural price , the stimulus of high profits , will in time bring down the rates , and thus the injury and injustice to the consumers would be but temporary ; but this would not secure them against the effects of monopoly , as regards foreign competition . Let us present a case which will explain our meaning . We will suppose the foreign manufacturer can supply woollens at four dollars per head , or 48,000,000 dollars ; and that the domestic one requires eight dollars per head , or 96,000,000 dollars a year , to afford the usual profits of trade ; but that owing to a want of competition , he is enabled to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his great gains , by inducing others to engage in the business , would bring back the price to the ordinary profits of manufacturing ; but would that compensate for having the foreign article excluded , which could be imported for four dollars per head , or 48,000,000 dollars per annum cheaper ? Does not the domestic manufacturer then enjoy the monopoly of the home market , against the foreign ? No one we think will deny that he does , nor can any one justly refuse to the woollen manufacturer , who insists upon 80 per cent duty , to secure himself against foreign competition , the appellation of a monopolist . Our opponents object also to the term prohibition , but we can not comprehend with what propriety , since any rates of duty which will not enable the domestic articles to undersell the foreign , will be wholly inconsistent with the spirit of the " American System , " as explained by its founders and ablest commentators . A duty which /z/ conies a particle short of this , can be of no advantage to the monopolists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers , ivhether the law prohibits woollens , or only imposes such duties as will prevent their importation . Let us now proceed to the third allegation , and admitting , for the sake of argument , the truth of the first assumption , that the British Government lowered their duties on wool , in consequence of , and subsequently to , the passing of our tariff , and with the intention of defeating its object ; and the justice and practicability of the second , i. e. the right of the woollen manufacturers , for such an addition to the present rate of duty , as would equal the taxes removed from the British manufacturers . The question then is , what do those reductions amount to ? They are estimated by Mr. Everett and Mr. Davis , at 16 2-3 percent . Now as the former of these two statesmen appears to us to rest the claim of the manufacturers to any further increase of duties , mainly , if not wholly , on the ground of this countervailing act of the British legislature , and the latter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue laws , they were bound to give some evidence beyond their mere assertions , of the correctness of the data on which their estimate is founded . In making this observation , however , the committee do not hesitate to say , that as far as their veracity is concerned , they should not fail to place the most perfect reliance on statements founded on their own researches , and which they should affirm to be true ; but after the gross mistakes we have pointed out , it would , we conceive , be evincing an excessive degree of credulity , if we allowed any thing to pass , without examination . We must suppose , that on this , as on other occasions adverted to , they took their facts from men less disinterested than themselves , and we shall again shew how little reliance can be placed on their correctness . To establish the 16 2-3 per cent , the following assumptions are made : 1st . That the average cost of wool imported into England is 20 cents the pound , and consequently a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would amount to 44 per cent . 2d . That the cost of wool is about one third of the value of manufactured woollens . 3d . That a reduction of duty on the particular kinds of wool in question , affected the value of all wool used in England , in the fabrication of such cloths as are imported from that country , in competition with ours . 4th . That the reduction of duties on logwood , rape-seed , oil , indigo , and some other articles , amounted to 2 per cent . Our first object then , is to show the cost of the wool imported into England , and we think the best evidence the nature of the case admits , is to be found in the Parliamentary debates from 1819 , when the duty on wool was imposed , to 1824 , when it was reduced . The /z/ question excited a good deal of attention , and having been discussed by some of the most intelligent members , we may reasonably suppose that all the facts bearing on the case came out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the cost of the wool Abroad was essential , to know the extent of the tax . Mr. Robinson , ( Lord Goderich ) Chancellor of the Exchequer , in a debate on petitions fora repeal of the wool tax in 1820 , states , " of the imported wools , two thirds were of fine qualities from Saxony and Spain , and it was not supposed the duty in question had any effect on them . " There were , however , some sorts ( but not of so inferior quality as much of the British wool ) on which the duty was considered burdensome . We make the following extract from Mr. Robertson 's speech , to show the cost of the inferior wools imported , on which only the duty had an important bearing . Mr. R. is quoted by Mr. Everett as an authority to be relied upon . In the debate on the repeal of the duty in 1824 , he observes , " wools at from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. were formerly imported from different countries in Europe , to the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article of the most general consumption . The existing duty on . the importation of these wools , almost amounted to a prohibition . " Again , " when to this difference in the price of labour , was added the duty on importation of 20 to 25 per cent. , he would ask , whether it was possible for the manufacturers of this country to compete with the manufacturers of the continent ? " This statement is confirmed by Mr. Wilson , an eminent merchant and member of Parliament , who estimates the duty at 25 to 30 per cent . Uniting , then , these estimates , the duty would be 25 per cent . Here , then , is the testimony of two intelligent men , and strengthened by that of others in the same debates , all of whom were desirous of removing burdens from the manufacturing and commercial interests , and willing therefore to estimate the duty at its highest rate , and the most they could make of it was 25 per cent. * By mistaking the kind of wool , in question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrating its cost one half , our opponents have estimated the duty 44 per cent , instead of 25 per cent , at which it was rated by British merchants and manufacturers . It should be here remarked that only about one third of the imported wool was of this description ; the remainder costing high prices was not much affected by the duty . The whole import of foreign wool , taking the average of five years before the duty was laid , was only 17,000,000 pounds , as stated in the debates by Mr. Western , an agricultural member . * As an evidence that we have not under-estimated the duty on wool in England , previous to its repeal , we make the following- extract from the Providence Memorial , published in November , 1826 : " Previous to the adoption of the late Tariff , there existed a duty of 20 per cent , upon the importation of wool into England . " It will be noticed that we have allowed 2-5 per cent . /z/ Of this import about 5,000,000 pounds , as stated by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low qualities . It is true , that in the year after the duty on wool was reduced to its old rate , there was an increased import of wool in England , as there was of everything else , during 1825 , but it was upon speculation , and sold at an immense loss to the importers . In 1826 the import had fallen to 15,996,425 pounds , which is something below what had formerly been the average . The whole consumption in England , as we have before mentioned , is 160,000,000 pounds . It may be well to remark in this place , that Mr. Robertson , M. P. in the speech from which Mr. Everett has given extracts , to prove that the British government had lowered the duty on wool , subsequently to , in consequence of , and with the view of defeating the object of the Tariff " of 1824 , speaks expressly in the extract we have given , of the importance of enabling the British to undersell the continental manufacturers . Nothing is said about American manufacturers , nor anything , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate , can furnish the slightest ground , ' that any of the speakers had them in view . So that had not our opponents been entirely wrong in the fact with regard to the passage of the wool duty act , the inference which they drew from it , as to the motives of the British government , could not have been sustained by anything which passed in the debate to which Mr. Everett referred . We beg leave to call the attention of our readers to this circumstance as denoting that disposition , on the part of some of the leading advocates for monopoly and non-importation , to which we have before adverted , ( and which has manifested itself in most of their publications ) to excite a spirit of jealousy and enmity towards Great Britain as a rival manufacturing nation , which can not fail to hasten that non-intercourse with her , which it is the interest of our opponents to obtain. * We now corne to the second assumption , which is that wool constitutes a third part of the value of manufactured goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , because those are the ones that come in competition with ours . Here again we must recur to British authorities . Mr. Curwen , an intelligent member of Parliament from a manufacturing district , in a debate on this subject , stated that , " wool when manufactured , on an average may be esteemed at least seven times the value of the raw material . " Lord Milton , member for Yorkshire , who takes an active part in all de- *Extract from Mr. Tibbit 's Address . " The acts of England in refusing to takejl he agricultural productions of the middle and eastern states , in exchange for her manufactures , ought to be considered , by us , in the light of friendly and paternal admonition . " Again , u I should consider it a great misfortune , if England should withdraw this monitory adiiice , and again admit our bread stuffs , provisions and raw materials . It would have a tendency to prevent us for a longtime from rising- to that solid and permanent elevation , to which by her policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very soon attain by proper management . " /z/ bates on this subject , and is considered a good authority , says in t speech on the wool question , " cloth made of imported wool was worth five times the cost of the material . " The difference between these two valuations may have arisen from Mr. Curwen 's referring to the average of all goods made in England , and Lord Milton to that particular description made of foreign wool . It would be satisfactory to know the proportion in our domestic goods , but the committee have not been able to obtain such information as they could rely upon . From our inquiries , we should say something more than a quarter of the value of the cloth . The material in our manufactures would form a larger portion of the value than it does in England , because we make a larger proportion of heavy and lowpriced cloths , in which the colours and labour are less expensive than in the fine and more highly finished fabrics of England . It is , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we require , and we shall take it at one fifth , instead of one third , as allowed by Mr. Everett . Let us now apply these corrections to the calculations under examination . Our opponents by valuing wool at 20 cents the pound , which cost two shillings sterling , make the duty 44 per cent ; and assuming one third the value of cloth to be in the wool , estimate the saving to the British manufacturer 14 2-3 per ct . We have furnished very satisfactory evidence from those persons in England , who were most desirous of obtaining the repeal of this duty , and disposed therefore to exaggerate its amount , that it was only 25 per cent . We have also shewn that in England , wool was considered as one seventh of the average cost of the manufacture , and one fifth of the cost of those goods made of their imported wool . If then we take the duty at 25 per cent , and allow one fifth of the value of the cloth to be in the material , the saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remind the reader , goes upon the idea , that all the wool used in England , was affected 25 per cent by the repealed duty on 17,000,000 pounds , their average import , whereas only 5 , 000,000 pounds were of the low qualities , on which the duty had a material bearing . And this brings us to the third point ; in answering which , we shall show what was thought in England by statesmen and manufacturers , as to the effect which the measure we are discussing really had on their woollen manufactures . The imposition of the duty in 1819 , as we have before stated , was intended wholly as a measure of revenue . The amount of this duty was only valued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at 350,000 . Mr. Huskisson , president of the board of trade , stated in the debate , that " the tax was so small , that it could not be expected to affect manufactures . Besides our exports were principally of the coarse and home-grown wool , which was not touched by this tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the debates , and proved by the British list of imports , the manufacturers required very little wool from abroad , and only some particular qualities , not much grown in Eng- /z/ land . Most sorts were cheaper in England than on the continent , and at the very moment when the manufacturers called for the repeal of the import duty , they clamoured against the removal of the prohibition , which prevented the export of British wools , because they were unwilling their rival manufacturers on the continent , should profit by their cheapness . The prohibition was , however , removed , and a duty of one penny the pound substituted on exportation , by the very act lowering the duty on foreign wool . It appeared doubtful from the petitions and debates , that balancing the advantage of a reduction of the import duty on foreign wool , against the disadvantage of allowing an export of British wool , whether the manufacturers would gain or lose by the measure . We quote from Mr. Robinson 's ( Lord Goderich ) speech . " Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial to them , than the removal of the restrictions would be injurious , and were desirous that the matter should be left where it was , and that no alteration should be made . The majority , however , thought it would be advantageous to accede to the proposed compromise , that the duty on wool should be repealed , and a free export of wool allowed . " This was repeated by Mr. Huskisson in another debate , in the following words : " He was confident the manufacturers themselves must think the monopoly of British wool was a boon to them , far more than any adequate loss arising from the tax . " We have now before us the best means it is possible to obtain , of ascertaining how much this reduction of five pence half penny the pound , on the small quantity of 17,000,000 pounds of imported wool , of which less than one third was of the low cost , paying 25 per cent duty , really affected the cost of woollens . We have before shown , that allowing all the wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the duty bore materially , and that it was consequently enhanced 25 per cent , the saving to the manufacturers by a reduction of five pence half penny , would only amount to 5 per ct . in the cost of their cloths ; but the consumption in England is 160,000,000 pounds , the average consumption of foreign 17,000,000 pounds , of which only 5,000,000 pounds were of such qualities as paid a high duty . Now if we connect this small import of wool with the well known fact , that most sorts of wool are cheaper in England than elsewhere , and with the declarations of the manufacturers , that they doubted whether they should not lose as much by the export of British wool , as they would gain by the reduction of the duty on the foreign wool , the fair inference is , that the repeal of the duty had little or no effect on the cost of woollens generally , though it might have had some bearing on particular kinds of fabrics , in which the foreign wool was principally used : but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , however , admit what is far from being probable , that two fifths of the 160,000,000 pounds of wool used in England , or 64,000,000 pounds , will have /z/ been reduced 25 per cent in the cost to the manufacturers , and in that case the saving to the British manufacturer by the reduction of the wool duty , would amount to 2 per cent , and this indeed on the aggregate value of woollens , would be about 4 1-2 millions of dollars . We now come to the last item in the examination of the estimate of 16 2-3 per cent , i. e. the reduction of the duties on indigo , logwood , rape-seed , and olive oil , and some other articles not mentioned , for all of which 2 per cent is allowed . As usual , our opponents offer no evidence , nothing beyond their loose assertions . They qXiote Mr. Huskisson as allowing 1 or 2 per cent , but at the same time discredit their only authority , by stating their belief that it is more than twice the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so highly of the fairness and accuracy of that able statesman , that they would rely on his calculations , with the greatest confidence ; but it is evident he had made none . We quote from the speech to which Mr. Everett refers ' ; " be the charge upon woollen cloths , for instance , only 1 or 2 per cent , even this small addition , with the present open competition with the foreign market , may turn the scale against us , and ought therefore to be abandoned . " It is here very evident , that Mr. Huskisson speaks only in general terms , of the importance of making the smallest savings in the cost of woollen cloths , but does not mean to state what may be the precise amount of the duties under discussion . On reference to the various articles in the British tariff , alluded to by our opponents , we find the reduction on indigo to be one penny the pound , about 1 per cent of its value ; logwood 4s. 8d. per ton , or about 2 1-2 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subsequently to 10s. per last ; olive oil from 15 13s. to 7 per ton . It will be noticed , the most valuable article was only reduced 1 per cent . The consumption of indigo may perhaps be about 2,000,000 pounds , and if we allow half of it for cloths , the reduction on it would amount only to 18,578 dollars , and 2 1-2 per cent on the logwood consumed in cloths , could not exceed 2 or 3,000 dollars . What might have been the savings on the seed and oil , we have no means of judging , but if we suppose them to be to the extent 500,000 dollars , the whole amount gained by the manufacturers , would be but 520,000 dollars , on a branch of business estimated to produce 220,500,000 dollars , or about one quarter of 1 per cent ; but as there are still some other articles not mentioned , we will call the whole savings an half per cent . It appears then that the whole sum gained by the manufacturers , by the repeal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not exceed 2 1-2 per cent , instead of 16 2-3 per cent , as contended for by Mr. Everett , and others who have so often argued upon this statement . The existing duty on woollens is not 33 1-3 per cent , as stated almost universally by our opponents , but 38 per cent , from which deduct the 2 1-2 per cent , " repealed by the gigantic arm of the British Government , " and /z/ there still remains 35 1-2 per cent . We are aware it may be said , that the estimates on which the calculations of the committee are founded are in some measure conjectural ; this , however , must necessarily be the case in all such matters , but it can not be denied that we have taken our information from the best sources , and have given the authorities , that those who doubt , may examine for them-selves* In conclusion , we say we have offered in answer to the first proposition , undeniable proofs that the British Government did not reduce the duty on wool as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tariff of 1824 , and with a view of defeating its provisions ; and secondly , that admitting the truth of the first proposition , we think the principle they would maintain in the second , unjust and impracticable ; and lastly , that allowing the manufacturers had a claim , equal to the taxes of which the British manufacturers have been relieved by the reductions referred to , the most which can be made of it is 2 1-2 per cent , which would still leave the protective duty 35 1-2 per cent , or an annual tax on the nation of 25,560,600 dollars . The protective charges would be 54 1-2 per ct , amounting to 39,240,000 dollars , which must be paid by the importers of foreign cloths , before they can meet the domestic manufacturer in his own market , and yet the nation is called upon to double it . The committee have one more remark to make , and they close this part of their report . It has already been observed that Mr. Everett appears to rest the claims of the manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countervailing act of Great Britain , reducing the charges on wool and other articles 16 2-3 per cent , and Mr. Davis in his speech , says , " the duty q/ " 33 1-3 percent tf fully enforced , as was intended when the law was passed , would as effectually exclude the low priced woollens as 100 per cent . " It would seem then that all which these two zealous advocates of the woollen manufacturers could ask for , consistently with their own arguments and professions , would be an addition of 16 2-3 per cent to 33 1-3 , ( which they supposed was the established rate , ) making 50 per cent , and for some new provisions in the revenue laws , to guard against smuggling . If such really were their views , why . we would ask , did they vote with a party , who not only resisted all attempts to amend the revenue laws , but passed a bill , which offered to a class of men , * ( charged by Mr. Davis as having defrauded the government of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making 101 per cent , by altering the cost of an article one cent in the yard ? * " The law of 1824 , gave a duty of 33 1-3 per cent on imported fabrics , and it was doubtless the design of the Government , that it should operate as a clear protective duty ; but half or nearly that amount has been taken away by the modification of the British tariff , and the other half is evaded . " Davis* Speech on the Tariff . . National Intelligencer. /z/ Again , if they thought 50 per cent all the duty which the manufacturers were entitled to , why did they vote for a bill giving rates of duty of 38 and J 39 per cent , and so strangely , and so unjustly contrived , as to fall with the greatest weight on those , who could least afford to bear them . ? We leave it to the candour of our readers , to say , ifitisnotat least a sign of both the weakness and injustice of the cause , against which we are contending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SKCTIOM 9th . There is another reason frequently adduced , in favour of the exclusive and prohibitory system ; oltener perhaps by its apologists , than its authors and more zealous supporters , viz : That Congress having once granted high rates of duty , and thus encouraged the establishment of woollen manufactures , it is incumbent on the nation to maintain , if not to increase them . There are indeed many fair minded men who are ready to concede , that the existing duties on both cottons and woollens , are too high for the general good , and yet they uphold them on the ground that the public faith , is pledged for their continuance . We might reply to this , by saying that the protective system , which imposes heavy and unequal burdens on the country , for the promotion of particular interests in opposition to the general welfare , was manifestly an innovation upon our long established policy of a more liberal and just character ; and that its introduction was an encroachment upon those equal rights and privileges , guaranteed by a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , then , is pledged to anything , it is to return to that . system of free trade , which we have almost entirely abandoned . Waiving , however , any further discussion of this point , let us examine the claims of our opponents upon the public faith , on . the most favourable grounds they themselves can pretend to place them . It will not , we suppose , be contended that if one Congress should pass a law , wrong in principle , or unjust in its operation , that it would not be justifiable and praiseworthy in a succeeding one to repeal it . It will not , we trust , be maintained , even by the most extravagant and deluded zealot of the " American System , " that because Congress once did wrong , they should never do right , but go on in error and injustice , and make a bad system perpetual . If there are any , however , who would assert such a principle , they can be no subjects for reasoning , and any arguments addressed to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to admit that when laws have been passed , affording special encouragement to certain branches of industry , and large in vestments - of capital have been made on the faith of those laws , that it would be wrong in government to make any sudden or great alterations in the laws , deeply affecting those interests , in cases where the effects as regards the public welfare could be in the least /z/ doubtful ; sod we go still farther , and say , the nation is bound , under those circumstances , to sustain a. considerable loss , or else to compensate the sufferers , rather than make such changes as would injure a class of men who had been stimulated to particular employments by governmental bounties . This obligation , however , on the part of the nation , involves , we think , a counter one on the part of the protected class , to abstain from pressing their demands too far . because they might happen to have the power so to do , and to be satisfied with the terms on which their privileged interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woollen manufacturers , and try their claims to a continuance or an increase of the present enormous duties , on the principles here laid down . In the year 1816 , at the expiration of the war duties , which like all others down to that period , were imposed expressly for rerenue , and without any particular reference to the promotion of domestic manufactures , ( though that was the unavoidable effect of them ) it became necessary to establish a new Tariff . The various branches of manufactures which sprung up or were extended in consequence of the war , were presented to the consideration of government in the most imposing manner , and with a vast deal of exaggeration as to their extent and importance to the country ; and after a struggle between those who were for adhering to the principles of free trade , and the advocates for the restrictive and prohibitory policy , the latter prevailed , and an entire new system , called the protective system , was established . Congress , after a mature consideration of the various interests concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each , consistent with what was due to the national welfare . The duty on woollens , as originally established , was 5 per cent. , but was extended at various times to 12 1-2 per cent. , solely koweverfor pvrposes of revenue , and the proceeds pledged for the payment of the national debt . In 1804 , a further addition of 2 1-2 per cent , was made , called the Mediterranean fund , for the purposes of supporting the wars against the Barbary powers , making 1 5 per cent , and at this rate it stood till 1812 , when it was advanced to 1-2 per cent. ; still however entirely as a measure of revenue , rendered absolutely necessary by the expenses of the war with Great Britain , but limited by the act , to twelve months after the expiration of the war , when it would have fallen back to 12 1-2 per cent , unless the Mediterranean duty , which was also a temporary one , should have been continued by a special act of Congress ; in which case the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on cotton goods . Down to this period of 1816 , the protecting system had no existence . The very important , and it may now perhaps be said dangerous power , granted by the Constitution to impose duties on foreign goods , was considered as a qualified one , " to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , " for what : " to pay the debts , and provide /z/ for the common defence and general welfare of the United States , " and not , as is now contended by some of the violent partizans of this system , to enact laws with the avowed purpose of preventing importations , and thus by destroying our best , and we might almost say , our only source of revenue , and lessen the means of national defence , and by building up individual and sectional interests at the expense of all others , endanger the national stability , and diminish the public welfare . That domestic manufactures were protected and encouraged by those duties is true , but that was an incidental effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue , and it was so understood by all parties at the time they were established , nor could the various augmentations of duties have been made upon any other principles . At the adoption of the protective system , the duty on woollens was fixed at a nominal rate of 25 per cent. , equal to 29 per cent , and to fall in three years to 20 per cent . It was very naturally supposed by the legislature , that a branch of manufactures , which in the infancy of the nation , when we were without capital and possessed of infinitely less skill than we now have , succeeded under a duty of 5 per cent , to such an extent as to supply three quarters of all the cloths we consumed , could not fail of still further and of complete success , under a duty of five times that amount . Here , then , was a compromise between the nation on the one hand and the woollen manufacturers on the other , to which each was bound to conform ; if there was an obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a reciprocal one on the part of the latter to be contented with it ; or at any rate to refrain from imposing on the country any additional burdens . It could never have been intended that the manufacturers should call from time to time for such an addition to the rates as they might deem necessary , or , as Mr. Everett contends , " would enable each article manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article as imported . " This would have been substantially a guarantee against all foreign competition , now and hereafter , whatever it might cost us , whether 25 per cent , or 200 per cent . The utter absurdity and immorality of this principle has already been exposed , and if there are any credulous enough to believe that such a system can prevail , it is time they were warned that it is one of those illusions which we trust can never be realized , one of those pretensions which can never be maintained . Congress then having gone as far as in their wisdom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manufacturers , before they ventured upon a new and to them untried business , to ascertain if the given encouragement was sufficient to enable them to succeed , not to plunge extensively into it , without the requisite experience , capital and skill , and then , failing of success , caU upon the nation for still further bounties , and after having obtained them to the extent of 27,360,000 dollars a year , insist upon this enormous tax being doubled for the benefit , too , according to their own calculation , of only 100,000 persons , three quarters of whom , we have proved , succeeded under a duty of 5 per cent . The protecting system of 1S16 having gone into operation , and all the leading interests of the nation accommodated to it , the manufacturers , whose concerns were so much benefitied by i r , at the expense of the general welfare , were , we should think , the last who tuuld have violated the compact on which it was founded . How stand the facts ? Did the national party make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never heard of a single remonstrance or petition against it . They submitted quietly to a most burdensome taxation on cottons , woollens , glass , and many other articles , with an expectation ; no doubt , that they should not be called upon for any further increase . What , on the other hand , was the conduct of the woollen manufacturers ? Soon after the passage of the tariff of 1816 , tin- obtained j a repeal of that part of the law which lowered the cln ; y in three years from 25 to 20 per cent . This was submitted to . What next ? In 1819 and 1820 , they made vigorous efforts for a further increase of duties , complaining of losses , and ut the same time enlarging their establishments , though they were fairly warned by many of those who had been friendly to the establishment of the protecting system , but at the same time were desirous of limiting its extent , that no more duties would be granted . Mr. Lowndes , of South Carolina , who had voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given as high duties as the country could bear , observed in a debate in 1820 , on an application for an increase of duties , " they suggest no standard by which the sufficiency of the encouragement they proposed could be tested , and promise therefore no limitation to the burden which might be imposed on the country ; " and closed by saying " He believed the bill under consideration to be injurious to the government , oppressive to the people , and dangerous to the stability of the manufacturing industry . " This is the judgment of one ol the most enlightened and virtuous statesmen that ever adorned any legislature , and one of the last services he rendered his country was to leave on record his condemnation of a system founded on principles of injustice , which no man could hold in greater abhorrence than this distinguished and lamented patriot , and yet his reputation has been most unjustly assailed by his being repeatedly ranked among the supporters of the prohibitory and exclusive system . From Mr. H. G. Otis 's Speech in Congress in 1820 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a manifesto of tiie disposition of a committee , and of one branch of the legislature , to listen to the claim of the manufacturers for a bounty of 5,000,000 dollars in the outset . Let other classes of the community the farmer , the mer- /z/ ehant , the mechanic , be heard upon the question , before the irrevocable sanction was given to the system . " If it was correct to oppose manufacturers who demanded a bounty of 5,000,000 dollars , in 1820 , is it reasonable to support the pretensions of woollen manufacturers in 1827 , who receive a bounty of 27 , 360 , 000 dollars , and require it to be doubled ? Mr. Silsbee , who in 1820 was in Congress , admonished the manufacturers " that , though friendly to manufacturing establishments , and disposed to afford that interest every aid and encouragement that could be given consistently with a due regard to the great interests of the nation , he would not at a time of general depression , consent to build up any one interest of the country upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Webster , among other arguments against the whole system , made the following statement in reference to ivoollen , and cotton goods : " The duties as they now stand , ( viz. 25 per cent on woollens , ) afford great protection , and in some cases extraordinary bounties to our manufacturers . It was thought complete satisfaction had been given at the time , by the law of 1 8 1 6 , which had yet again been altered most materially in favour of the manufacturers of woollen and cotton cloths . By that law , the duty on those articles was put at 25 per cent , but was to be diminished to 20 per cent , after 3 years . By a subsequent act this was altered , and the duty kept at the highest rate . " Again ; " The duty of 6 1-4 cents on coarse cotton goods , costing ? 1-2 cents , was 83 per cent ; this was in addition to the cost of importation . This is so much bounty to the . home manufacturers . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that both government and the country would resist all attempts to ma-ke new , frequent and great changes in the nature of property ; in the occupations and pursuits of men , and in the means of living . " These legislators spoke the sentiments of the national party , including the most intelligent portion of the manufacturers in this quarter , who considered the country was bound by the compact of 1816 , to sustain the burdens which then existed , but to resist any additions to them . Having been defeated in this attempt to extend the system of bounties , and prohibitions , one would imagine they would have taken warning , and lessened their concerns , had they been unprofitable ; so far from this , that having been stimulated by the advantages they had gained over the public interests , they persevered in their efforts , ( the complaints of losses slill keeping pace with the extension of their work ? , ) till 1824 , when they succeeded in obtaining an addition of 8 1-3 per cent to the former duty , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This measure was resisted by a large majority of the New England delegation , and from Maine , New Hampshire , and Massachusetts , the states most largely engaged in this branch of business , and where its interests and its wants are best understood , the new tariff had but one vote from each in its favour . - Here then was another violation on the part of the manufacturers , of that implied understanding on which the protective system was first estahlished . Notwithstanding this second alteration , making the duty 13 1-3 per cent more than the permanent rate , given by the tariff of 1816 , and the fact that this last measure was carried against the wishes and opinions of those manufacturing States , which comprised the most numerous and intelligent class of manufacturers , and by only a plurality of five in the House , and three in the Senate , the nation submitted quietly to this further encroachment on its rights and interests . No attempts were made in any quarter to disturb the tariff . The manufacturers , however , very naturally perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much endurance on the other , conceived it was only necessary to make claims , in order to have them granted . They still continued their complaints of the hostility of the national party to manufacturers , and of the patriotic sacrifices they themselves were making to improve and extend an useful branch of industry , and what is more remarkable in men who had been for so long a course of time pursuing an unsuccessful occupation , they had increased their manufacturing capital , as stated in most of their memorials and speeches , in the short space of 8 years , from 10,000,000 to the enormous sum of 40 or 50,000,000 dollars . This vast accession of capital , from men who are supposed to understand their own interests , to a branch of business which has been so long cried down as a losing one , certainly looked somewhat inconsistent with the complaints which the manufacturers were making , of a want of sufficient protecting duties . These representations , however , drew in many to the support of the views of the manufacturers , and in 1827 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire prohibition , an increase , which carried the rates from 38 to 232 per cent , and actually got a bill through the House of Representatives , giving them 38 to 139 percent , averaging perhaps 80 per cent ; and rising , as we have before repeated , on the consumer , not in proportion to his means , but his want of them . This last application for increased duties was made too at a time , when it must have been apparent to the manufacturers , that the operation of the tariff of 1824 , had actually much diminished the importation of foreign woollens , except for such articles as are not yet attempted by our manufacturers . In 1825 the import of foreign woollens was 10,876,873 dollars . In 1826 the amount had declined to 7,886,826 dollars , from which deduct re-exportation 441,382 dollars , leaves 7,445,444 dollars . Our whole consumption is 72,000,000 dollars , so that our importation is reduced to about one tenth of our consumption , and the proportion under the present heavy duty will decline every year ; notwithstanding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements of the overwhelming consignments from England , to the entire ruin of the domestic manufacturer . Mr. Otis complains , " that while the British take nothing from tie , they seem t /z/ have enjoyed the prescriptive usage , ( which many of our citizens art willing to countenance , ) of supplying us with all we want , from hats to shoes , and of manufacturing for us all things down to a hob-nail . " The language of the Pennsylvania address , is , that " the American manufacturer of wool is so far depressed , by the great quantity of English woollens brought into the country , that he can not continue the business , unless the original intention of the tariff be carried into effect , by the enactment of an additional duty , to countervail the advantage given to the English manufacturer , by the reduction of the duty on the importation of foreign wool . We can not but express our disappointment , that men to whom we can not impute intentional misrepresentation , should yet , probably from want of sufficient examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , as we think , proved to be either much exaggerated , or entirely unfounded , nor can we conceal our regret that those eminent statesmen , who have stood forth as the able and vigorous champions of the national interest , by which we mean a policy comprehending all the branches of domestic industry , should have thought it incumbent on them to support , in opposition to their former views , * one branch only , at the expense of all the others . If the secession of so many respectable men from our side , to that of our opponents , may at first be thought to have an unfavourable bearing upon the cause we advocate , their change does not , as we think , indicate a correspondent change in the minds of their constituents generally , upon this important subject ; nor does it lessen the force of those facts and arguments which formerly carried conviction , at least to the minds of those to whom they were addressed , against the system which these respectable men are now supposed to uphold . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have not unfrequently been challenged for our reasons for not following their example . We should be glad , however , before we take that step , to hear what we have often seen in vain asked for , the arguments by which they themselves were converted ; and if they are strong enough to overturn those by which they formerly converted others , we will venture to say , all difference in opinion upon this subject , will be forever at an end . Without meaning to impugn the motives of those gentlemen , may we not suppose that it is the position in which they stand to this question which has changed , rather than the facts and principles , on * It may be proper to remark , that among those who voted for the extravagant tariff bill , which passed the House last winter , there were some members of our delegation , from whose speeches we hav quoted arguments in support of our own views , and others who formerly voted against the whole system of restrictions , bounties , and prohibitions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened spirit of the age . These statesmen in 1820 and 1824 , declared any addition to the duty which then existed of 25 per cent on woollens , as unnecessary and unjust , while in 1827 , when the rate was 38 per cent , they thought it right to support a bill which established rates of duties from 38 to 139 per cent , averaging at least 80 per cent on our aggregate importations. which their former opinions were founded ? Can not we imagine there were other objects not necessarily connected with this subject , but unhappily considered by them as dependant on it , which might lead them to sustain a measure not in accordance with their former views , for the sake of securing other measures , which they might deem of much greater importance to the general welfare ? Shall we not consider it as one of those unfortunate emergencies , to which public men are sometimes driven , when they feel compelled to abandon one great public interest , for the maintenance of another ? For ourselves , we are disposed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have in general filled the stations they occupy with so much credit to themselves , and so much advantage to their constituents . If such then be the real state of the case , no inferences unfavourable to the cause they formerly supported , can be drawn from this single act , and more especially as it was unaccompanied by any disclaimer of former , or any avowal of new opinions . Can it not therefore be fairly inferred , whatever appearances may indicate , that the most our opponents can boast of is , that they have the votes of our former friends on their side , while the arguments they have furnished , are still on ours . We have thus given a history of the conduct of the two parlies engaged in this cause ; showing a patient endurance of the most enormous taxation on the one hand , and an unreasonable selfishness on the other ; yet the suffering party have been assailed in the most offensive terms , with enmity to manufacturers , a want of common patriotism , partiality for foreign interests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter dated July 4th , 1827 , all who oppose the restrictive system are charged with a factious opposition to government . " Jill who are opposed to the American System , all who are opposed to internal improvements , are now united tvifh others in the endeavour to defeat the election of the present Chief Magistrate , and to elevate another individual . " Again in one of his speeches upon the Tariff , as reported in the National Intelligencer " The predilection , of the Essex Junto for foreign trade , and for British fabrics , is unconquerable . " And the Boston Woollens Committee in their circular dated November 11 , 1826 , observed , " it is not now a question between different American interests , but one between Americans and Englishmen / " The Pennsylvania State Convention declare " that there is still lingering in our sea ports a remnant of foreign influence , added to the home-bred prejudices of the plantation interests against all manufacturing establishments . " From Mr. Tibbit 's Essay published April , 1827 , we extract the following : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become discouraged , perhaps ruined , and driven from all further attempts ; they are therefore and thereby about as effectually destroyed as they would have been , or could . have been , by any other means whatever , direct or indirect . But who /z/ is it that has destroyed them ? To whom is their destruction and death to be attributed ' ? Who is the murderer ? Who is it that imposes restraints upon artificers and manufacturers in this country ? Certainly the English manufacturer is not to be blamed . " And again " Who is it that imposes restraints upon artificers and manufacturers , and prevents their number from increasing in this country ? Is it not this sensitive shipping interest of ours , which has thus far been carefully nursed at the expense of the land , even the very men for whom , rather than their vessels should not have the freight of our lumber , meal and meat to the British West Indies , we submit that it shall remain at home and rot ? Is it not to those sugar-planters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have protections at the expense of the Northern States of more than 50 per cent . ; and the frightful stories scattered about the country , and told to us farmers by our petulant shipping gentlemen , and those wonderful wise Sheffield and Birmingham pedlars , and chambers of Commerce , through the medium of the National Gazette , the American and Evening Post , are all deceptive trumpery , of which we do not believe a single word . " From one of the publications of Mr. Carey we take the following : " Is it then fair , is it liberal , is it generous , is it just , for the merchants to unite as a solid phalanx , from Maine to Savannah , to oppose every attempt to afford relief to their fellow citizens , however acute their distress , however intense their sufferings ? " From Mr. Everett 's Speech at the Boston Woollens Convention we make this quotation : " There was a time , and not long ago , when not merely an indifference , but a positive unfavourable impression was felt in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruption of morals and prostration of health of the over-working and under-feeding of the British factories , ( accounts in themselves too true I fear ) were repeated with a kind of melancholy relish . " We select these from innumerable other charges and imputations in circulation , equally gross and unfounded , not with a view of refuting them , ( that not coming within the object of this committee ) but merely to show what means even some of the most respectable advocates of the " American System " resort to , in order to stir up the prejudices and passions of their followers against their opponents , and to bring obloquy upon all those who would aid in protecting the national interests against the pretensions , we will not say of the manufacturers , but against that combination , partly political and partly manufacturing , ( all of them advocating the same cause , but from different motives , and having different ends in view , ) who are supporting a course of policy which , even should they succeed in establishing , can not be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt , be most destructive to the whole manufacturing interests of the nation , and more especially to those of the New England States . But Mr. Tibbits , from whom we have before quoted , would have as /z/ infer that it is the " sensitive shipping interest , " on whose account " we submit that our produce shall remain on hand and rot , " who have been desirous that the reasonable offer of Great Britain in regard to the Colonial trade should have been rejected ; that the " sensitive shipping interest " wished to destroy such an advantageous branch of commerce , and thus were solicitous to injure their own interests . A misrepresentation so unfounded and absurd , we should hardly have commented on , had it not been countenanced by some eminent partisans of the restrictive policy , whom we have cited . Now what is the fact with regard to the shipping employed in the Colonial trade ? We find on reference to the official list of exports for 1826 , that the amount of domestic produce only , exported to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which only 474,560 dollars was in foreign skips . Thus it appears that the " sensitive shipping interest " had all the advantages from this trade which it was susceptible of affording , and the able men who more immediately represented their interests in Congress made great , though unsuccessful efforts for retaining it on the terms which it was at one time offered to our government , but were defeated in those attempts , chiefly by men who are among the most zealous advocates of the non-exportation and non-importation system . How then can it be charged upon the shipping interests , that the country has lost this extremely valuable branch of commerce ? A great deal of pains has been taken by diplomatists and partizan politicians , ail of them distinguished for their hostility to commerce , as interfering with the complete establishment of the " American System , " to divert the public mind from the true state of this important question . An elaborate writer upon the subject , in a long essay which has lately been published , has gone back to the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that Mr. Huskisson and other English ministers were not sincere in their offers of the Colonial trade on the terms which we once rejected , but afterwards offered to accept . If the ingenious writer had given us a history of the Roman invasion of that country , it would have been quite as much to the purpose . Why connect the navigation act and the support of the principles of that act with the name of a statesman whose fame is foundd OTi his overthrow of those principles on which that act and the whole series of restrictive measures which followed it , were mainly founded ? The enlightened men who are now at the head of affairs in England , have no particular reverence for " Navigation Acts , or Long Parliaments . " Their efforts for a long time have been directed to the destruction of the Commercial codes which originated in those days ; and we believe the only admirers now left of those venerable laws , are the advocates of the " American System . " As regards the colonial question , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms offered by Great Britain , afterwards proposed to the British government to accede to them . /z/ Why was this offer on our part refused by the British ministers f There were no circumstances to render the trade between the United States and her colonies less valuable to great Britain in 1826 , than it was at the time they offered us the trade . What then was the reason ? We say there is strong presumptive evidence , that it was the extension and operation of our prohibitory system which led to this result . The loss of a trade which took off upwards of four and a half millions of domestic produce , employed in 1826 , 102,000 tons of shipping in the direct voyages , and 20,000 tons more river and coasting craft to furnish those cargoes ; comprehending the use in all those various operations of near 11,000,000 dollars of capital , may be considered among the first fruits , as regards our foreign trade , of the " American system . " This commerce was extremely valuable to New England , as most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,000 seamen it employed , nearly all were northern men . It was too , a growing trade . The amount of exports since 1823 , had increased upwards of three-fold , the tonnage had risen from 32,000 to 102,000 , since 1821 , and could we have retained it on the extremely favourable terms we had unfortunately rejected , it would , in the course of a few years , have been next to the direct trade with England , the most extensive and profitable branch of our foreign commerce . We deny then , that it is the fault of the merchants of the United States , that the colonial trade has been lost to the nation . It is the first act of that commercial warfare which is the necessary effect of our prohibitory policy , and it must be extended to every branch of commerce , not only with England , but every other nation whose manufactures or productions , may interfere with the private interests of the supporters of the restrictive system . To return to our subject ; we say if there was any pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers by a continuance of the tariff of 1816 , they have honourably redeemed it ; they have even exceeded this , by submitting to the various additions which have from time to time been made to it ; while on the other hand , the woollen manufacturers have repeatedly violated theirs ; and if we can judge from the past , will do so again , should they prevail in the contest in which we are now engaged . The bill which passed the House last winter , imposing duties of from 38 to 139 per cent , enormous as they are , did not , we understand , satisfy the expectations of all ; the more general wish appears to be , to carry up the rate at once to absolute prohibition , be that what it may . At the Boston Woollens Convention , Mr. Lawrence declared , that the manufacturers " wanted protection ; it mattered not whether it was 50 or 150 per cent , so long as it was protection . " The Pennsylvania Convention says ; " We must countervail foreign manufactures in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ We except none " And Mr. Everett , although he argues for 50 per cent , voted for 38 to 139 per cent ; and if that is not sufficient , we must go to the point of prohibition , since as he observes , " The principle on which the tariff of 1824 was framed , of course , was to enable each article as manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article as imported . " Here then we have a disclosure from some of the most active leaders of the party we are opposing , manufacturers , politicians , and political economists , of the true spirit of the " American system . ' ' /2/j entire prohibition by duties of every thing which can be manufactured at home , be the rate 50 or 150 per cent , or as much as u will enable each article manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article as iu.ported . " Notwithstanding , however , the tone of authority these gentlemen assume as guardians of the manufacturing interests generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their various branches , including some of the most intelligent of the woollen manufacturers , will reject the doctrine they advance , as not only incompatible with their notions of what is just , but what is expedient . We do not say this unadvisedly , but from our own knowledge of its truth . We admit that they may be considered as representing the views of the woollen manufacturers generally , and of the much deceived wool-grower , who will , however , at no distant day , find in what an unprofitable alliance he has been engaged . We are then on the subject of pledges , fairly at issue with the woollen manufacturers , and as they have kept no faith with the nation , may it not be justly said , that the compact of 1816 , on which the protecting system rested , is dissolved ? How then can Mr. Everett , who is a national legislator , and bound to stand impartially at least , between the private vievfte of the woollen manufacturers , and the interests of his national constituents , say " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on the doctrines of political economy , but on the plighted faith of the nation ? " Why not complain of the violated faith of the manufacturers , of which we have furnished such ample proofs ? But unreasonable as has been the conduct of some of the manufacturers , and burdensome as are the taxes now levied for their support , we do not believe the nation is disposed to disturb the tariff and lessen the protection they now enjoy ; but should the woollen manufacturers persist in their demands , and thus increase the excitement now existing , is it not to be expected , that when the other party do obtain the ascendancy , they will not only reduce the rates on woollens , but also on glass , nails , hats , cottons , and other articles , which are of vast importance , and * Mr. Pearce , member of Congress for Rhode Island , at a dinner given him lately at Troy , Mass , affirms , " The time will soon arrive when all the citizens of this country will be convinced they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiU see the necessity of maJyng protection , prohibition . " /z/ are protected by very heavy duties ? Is it not to be feared , as Mr. Webster has told us , that " there may come a moment of strong reaction , and if no moderation be shown in laying on duties , there may be as little scruple in taking them off . " This is the crisis to which the committee apprehend we are now tending , and which , if possible , they are anxious to avert . It does indeed seem incredible , that reflecting men , however much their judgments may be affected by the deep interest they may have involved in the question , when they consider how small a number are really interested in sustaining the protecting system , compared with those who would gain by its abandonment , should not themselves see the danger of pressing such unreasonable claims on the nation . We entreat the most zealous and the most sanguine to look at the state of parties as they stood last winter , and consider that a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would place them at the mercy of their opponents , who , if successful , would feel in some measure compelled , by the conduct of the manufacturers , to carry back the rates to what they formerly were , before the establishment of the protective system . We would ask if the woollen manufacturers can hope to maintain a system , if they succeed in establishing it , which is so directly in opposition to the interests of the nation in general ? Will an intelligent and enterprising people quietly submit to a policy which narrows down the market for . their produce abroad , and imposes a tax even for one article , greater than the whole national expenditure ? We appeal then to all rational and prudent manufacturers whether it is not better , even upon the most selfish principles , to join with us in resisting any further augmentation of duties , than hazard in case of failure the loss of part of what they now enjoy ; or if successful , increase the dissatisfaction and odium which already exists against the whole system of non-importation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a most ruinous re-action . SECTION 10th . Much has been said by the advocates of monopoly and restriction about the usefulness of manufacturers , and of their surprise and regret that other classes should entertain hostile feelings against them , and of the right and duty of government to protect manufacturing industry . We make the following extract from the Pennsylvania Woollens Convention Address : " An eminent citizen , lately elected governor of an influential state , has succeeded to convince the legislature of that state , that it may question the right as well as the wisdom of Congress to concern itself with manufactures ; " Again " We hold it to be the constitutional obligation of the government to establish and preserve manufactures as much as commerce or agriculture ; to protect the industry of the work-shop as much as that of the counting house ; and to encourage all the means of a people 's prosperity . " With regard to the usefulness of woollen manufactures in common with ajl others , and the duty of govern- /z/ ment to protect and encourage every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken to prove what no one denies ; nor can it be said with any truth , that manufacturing property has notin common with all other kinds , such protection as the laws of the land can afford it . Why then do the woollen manufacturers talk of the protection of their interests , as if they were not already protected ? The question then , is not about the usefulness or the protection of manufactures . The question is , whether it is wise or just to tax 11,900,000 persons 27,360,000 dollars a year to promote the interests of 100,000 persons , three quarters of whom formerly succeeded very well without it ; and having imposed such a tax , whether it is wise and just to double it ? In spite of all the newly invented terms , and all the sophistry which has been used by politicians and manufacturers , to lead off the public mind from the true merits of this question , this is the point to which it must at last come . Let it be kept in mind , that every dollar which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much tax paid by the nation to the manufacturers , for which no equivalent is received in return ; and that if woollen manufacturers do not make more than the ordinary profits of trade , ( and they say they make less ) there is a loss to the country of $23,940,000 per annum . Notwithstanding this mathematical truth which must be familiar to the minds of thousands of this intelligent class , the National parly are charged in no gentle terms , by numerous essayists , pamphleteers and orators , with hostility to woollen manufactures . Having already burdened our report with many extracts to show the charges against the National party , of a hostile disposition to manufactures , we shall content ourselves with giving but few more . From an address of the Honorable Andrew Stewart , M. C. delivered within a short time , to his constituents in Pennsylvania , we extract the following : " Shall we co-operate with those who are endeavouring to build up and sustain manufacturing institutions among us , or unite with Great Britain , and the cotton and tobacco planters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true and plain state of the question , and every man can decide it for himself . " Again , after having stated that Great Britain prohibits the importation of our agricultural produce " Shall we unite with the South in these attempts to destroy us7 Shall we , the farmers of Pennsylvania , assist to ruin the only markets we have left , to gratify Southern ambition or British cupidity ? " A respectable editor , to whose paper we are indebted for this extract , accompanies the address of which this forms a part , with the following remark : " We shall close this notice with a pretty long extract , in which Mr. Stewart displays his accustomed research , and strength in matters of fact . " Now if our readers will turn to the 7th section of our report , they will see that this is the same gentleman who asserted , that in 1825 Great Britain took from the Northern and Middle States nothing , and only 500 dollars of all the /z/ States north of the Ohio and Potomac ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , that we sent that year upwards of 1,200,000 dollars to Great Britain , and more than 4,000,000 dollars to her colonies . We can assure our readers , that the other " strong facts " which this honourable legislator publishes , have about as slender a foundation as the one we have just noticed , and the charges and imputations against cotton and tobacco planters , by whom he no doubt means all who are opposed to the restrictive policy , are equally unfounded . What are the complaints of our opponents against the people of the South and West ? That they resist the woollens tax of 23,940,000 dollars , imposed for the benefit of 100,000 persons ? If they mean to assert this , nothing can be more untrue . They never , after it passed , uttered a murmur against it . It is in opposition to the doubling this enormous tax , which they are now contending against , and for which they are denounced by Mr. Tibbits and many of the leading men of his party , as has been before shown . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject . We ask them to reflect upon the imputations cast upon them by their own leaders , and they will be at no loss to see the reasons . To talk then of hostility of the nation to manufactures , " after the immense taxes they have paid for their support , is worse than folly ; and the Southern statesmen themselves , on the introduction of the protective system in 1816 , acted in the most liberal manner , by giving their support to duties which they knew must operate against their constituents , and to the advantage of the manufacturing States . Without the aid of Barbour , Calhoun , Crawford , Lowndes , and others , the tariff of 1816 could never have been established ; but it is most unjust to the merits of those gentlemen , who were willing to give 20 per cent on woollens , ( which was four times the rate originally established , ) to charge them and their constituents with hostility to manufactures , because they opposed a duty of 80 per cent . The conduct of the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole vote from Missouri , Indiana , Illinois and Kentucky , was in favour of the tariff as it then passed . In 1827 , a majority was against the tariff as then proposed . There is also a great change in Pennsylvania . She gave all her votes but one for the tariff of 1824 , but gave , as we believe , six or seven against the tariff bill of 1827 . In Kentucky , of the six members who voted for the tariff bill of 1827 , four have lost their elections , so that instead of having the whole delegation in favour of the protective system as in 1824 , all but two are now opposed to it . They have become disaffected to the whole system , and to those politicians who have been the most instrumental in supporting it ; not from any want of good will to the manufacturing interests , but from a determination not to see the peace and welfare of the union disturbed , for the sake of wearing woollens made at home , at nearly /z/ double the cost we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the agricultural productions of the country . We have before had occasion , in repelling the charges of hostility made by our opponents against the Southern States , to notice the conduct of some of their prominent statesmen , in regard to the manufacturing interests . We have now to notice a very unfair advantage which has been taken of this liberal feeling , to class them among the advocates of the exclusive non-importation and non-exportation system . We quote the following from the address of the Pennsylvania Woollens Convention , held 27th June , 1827 , signed by Mr. C. I. Ingersoll , Matthew Carey , and other gentlemen equally distinguished for their hostility to free trade , and their devotion to the " American system . " " Whenever this subject has been treated in Congress , both its constitutionality and policy have been conceded . The votes of the much lamented Mr. Lowndes , and of the present Vice President of the United States , with those of many other eminent statesmen of the South , are recorded in their favour . " With regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the committee to say any thing more , than that by the casting vote he gave against the tariff of 1827 , he became the chief instrument in saving the country , and more especially the manufacturers from the many evils which would certainly have resulted from that pernicious and impolitic bill ; and for which he is entitled to the gratitude of the nation . We have already given some extracts from Mr. Lowndes ' speeches , which show what were his opinions of the " American system . " We furnish another from a speech made in 1820 , on the application of the woollen and cotton manufacturers for increased duties ; " He believed there was no nation in the world , which , in proportion to its income , paid so great a bounty to its manufacturers , as the United States . " Let the reader bear in mind , who it is that is speaking ; one of the most intelligent , sincere and prudent statesmen , thai ever graced our national assembly . Let him keep in mind too , that the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . We take great satisfaction in quoting the opinions of this venerated man ; first , to clear his reputation from those imputations , which our opponents have attempted to cast upon it . And again , that we may avail ourselves of the authority of one of the wisest and best men our country has produced . The virtues of his pure and elevated mind , were not geographical . He did not measure the rights of men by the sections in which they happened to reside ; nor ask when a wrong was intended , whether those who were the objects of it lived on the " north , or the south side of the Potomac , " " in the plantation , or manufacturing States . " If an encroachment was made on the rights of the nation , he never stooped to inquire , before he would join in resisting it , whether it originated in the North or in the South . Of his regard for Northern interests , he gave frequent proofs , by his continual and efficiefit efforts . w forjthe support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the extension of our commerce , and for the manufacturing States , by hit support to the tariff c/1816 ; but he lived long enough to see that his liberal conduct was not duly appreciated by the manufacturers ; on the contrary , that they continued to make further demands for protection , which he did his utmost to resist . The principles of this much lamented man , did not shift with his pecuniary , or his political interests ; they were founded on an immutable basis which nothing could shake . There was a singleness of heart , and a firmness of principle about him , which inspired the whole nation with the most unlimited confidence in his goodness and integrity . Mr. Lowndes did not go to the national legislature tied down by pledges to manufacturers , merchants or planters ; HE , REPRESENTED HIS COUNTRY . A free , unpledged national legislator , and he would have scorned to have been there , on any other terms . But integrity and impartiality were not the only qualifications of the late William Lowndes ; he brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , well stored with facts , and entertaining as he did , the most comprehensive and statesman-like views , he was qualified in an eminent degree , to decide correctly upon all great questions of national policy , and on subjects connected with commerce and manufactures in their various relations , no man in the assembly in which he sat , was his superior . That Mr. Lowndes was opposed to the whole system against which we are contending , we have offered the most undeniable testimony ; and as far as the authority of names ought to influence our opinions on this subject , is there any statesman whose guidance we can more safely follow ? And will not every one who loves his country , and is anxious for her welfare , be influenced by the authority and example of such a man ? We say then , that the nation , and every portion of it , has given abundant evidence , of not only their good will towards the manufacturing interests , but of their partiality to them , and that their importance to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other interests , has always been duly appreciated . For ourselves , as New England men , we think it difficult to over-rate their value . We have all the requisites for success , in almost all the various branches . We are , by our habits and disposition , and still more by our necessities , led to them as a means of support . The very barrenness of our soil , ( a pre-eminence no other section can dispute with us , ) compels us as it were , to be a manufacturing and commercial people . We have been a commercial people from the first settlement of the country , and were a manufacturing one , to a great extent , at least a century before the protective system was established . It may be doubted , if there is in any quarter of the world , England excepted , an equal number of persons , operating with the same capital , which produces a larger amount of manufactures than the State of Massachusetts . We /z/ of course do not speak in reference to cottons or woollens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too much impatience to realize the utmost extent and perfection of this species of employment , by legislative enactments , and high bounties , instead of waiting for the natural effects of increased experience and skill , and a greater accumulation of capital , all of which we are fast acquiring , and the want of which , now constitutes the only obstacle to our complete success . We repeat then , that the only dangers the manufacturers have to apprehend , arise from the insidious attachment of politicians , who , feeling no interest in their permanent success , use them as a means of attaining their ambitious views ; or , of short-sighted manufacturers , who are putting forth pretensions which will make the whole class they affect to represent , so odious to the nation , that ultimately , they will lose part of the protection they now enjoy . SECTION llth . We have endeavoured to show , and we hope with success , that there never has been any hostility in any portion of the nation to manufactures , and that too much has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion . There are , however , many leading writers and politicians among our opponents , who treat this question in such a way , as to induce us to believe , that if by a forced construction of the constitution , the general government could go still further than they have , no other evidence need be required of the justice and policy of the restrictive system carried to its utmost limits . " It is constitutional , and therefore politic and just . " Let us then examine the grounds on which the advocates of the exclusive system would justify and prove its constitutionality . We will take the statement of their case , from Mr. Tibbits , as being one of the authorities held by our opponents , in the greatest repute , for his accuracy and knowledge . " Protection to manufactures is further objected to , on the ground that Congress is not authorized by the constitution to give that protection , by increased duties or prohibitions ; nor to cherish and elevate one branch , where that elevation or protection may prejudice another branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping and importing branches already established , and in successful operation . " " The power has ubquestionably been given to Congress , to lay and collect taxes , and to establish imports ; to regulate the trade with foreign powers among the several States , and with the Indian tribes . Another important function conferred upon Congress , is , to provide for the public defence and for the general welfare . " The same ground has been taken by Mr. Carey , Mr. Niles , and other equally distinguished men of that party . We understand them to maintain that the general powers granted to Congress , by the constitution , " to raise revenue , to regulate trade , and provide for the public defence and general welfare ; " can , with a fair interpretation of that instrument , be construed into a right on the part of Congress , to pass /z/ such laws , ( which to use the very phrase of Mr. TibbitsJ may cherish and elevate one branch , where that elevation and protection may prejudice another branch of business , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course to lessen very much our exports , and thus in fact , instead of regulating , to materially diminish both trade and revenue ; and the further effect of which , ( as regards the article of woollens , ) is to burden one of the first necessaries of life , with an annual tax of 23,940,000 dollars a year ; to lessen the annual accumulation of national wealth to the like amount , and thus most essentially to impair the general welfare . This is the position taken by Mr. Everett , when he says , " the tariff of 1824 was framed , to enable each article as manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article as imported . " And by Mr. Lawrence , when he contends , that " we want protection ; it mattered not whether it was 50 or 150 per cent , so long as it was protection . " And by the Pennsylvania Woollens Convention , " we must " they say " countervail foreign manufactures in favour of all such as can be advantageously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that the power of regulating trade and raising revenue , implies the right of making such laws , as can not accomplish the purposes for which they were made , without destroying both revenue and trade ; and to conceive that the power of legislating for the general welfare , can be justly exercised in such a way , as to violate individual rights , and injure the general welfare , will not , we think , accord with the notions usually entertained of the spirit and purpose of the American constitution . Such a novel , and to most of us startling doctrine as this , should , we think , in order to have that currency its advocates desire , be supported by something like argument , which we have , however , in vain looked for , in the numerous speeches , essays , reviews , agricultural addresses , treasury reports , sermons , and other publications of the advocates of the " American System . " Our opponents appear to rely for the support of their new and ingenious definition of constitutional power , entirely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it no difficult task to obtain them . If in any of the messages of Presidents , reports from Departments of State , debates in Congress , or the writings of any distinguished or popular statesman , they can find some general expressions about the " benefit of manufactures , " " the advantage of promoting new branches of trade , " the " employment of domestic industry , " or of the " necessity of imposing duties for revenue , " &c.; &c.; the authors , without the least regard to the general scope of their publications , or the avowed object of them , are at once set down as the supporters of the " American System ; " and as having sanctioned the most absurd and unjust schemes , of the wildest advocate for the system of restrictions . We again refer to the Pennsylvania address , as a document coming from some of the principal founders of the " American System , " so and circulated as an able exposition of the principles of the new policy . As this manifesto is signed by Mr. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , ( and probably the only eminent one who would countenance the new constitutional doctrine as laid down by the gentlemen from whom we have just quoted , ) it is to be presumed , that we here have the most able defence of it , which our opponents can make . " So far , " say they , " as regards manufactures , the right of Congress to protect them in that mode , was not only admitted in the first Congress , but strenuously advocated by the most distinguished members of that body , Madison , Ames , Fitzsimmons , &c.; many of whom were members of the convention , that framed the constitution . " And to prove that these and other distinguished men , some of whom they name , upheld by their votes , the principle of prohibition , they cite the preamble , " to the first act for raising a revenue by impost , passed July 4th , 1789 , headed Whereas , it is necessary for the support of government , for the discharge of the debts of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties be laid on goods , wares and merchandize imported . " Here then is one of the authorities , which , in lieu of argument , is to prove that Mr. Madison and other eminent statesmen , were in favour of the system they advocate . To see what support can be obtained from this act , to which they refer , in favour of the protecting system , we must see what the makers of it meant by that term . The sense in which our opponents use protection , is , to slop the importation of all foreign goods which can interfere with such as can be made at home . On reference to the tariff of 1789 , we find the duties on woollen and cotton goods 5 per cent . The existing duty on cotton goods varies from 29 to 90 or 100 per cent ; on woollens 38 per cent , and the bill which passed the House last winter proposed an increase of from 38 to 139 per cent , increasing on the consumer , not in proportion to his wealth , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the tariff which the Harrisburg Convention have made for the next Congress , the rates on both articles are so much increased , as to shut out all further importations . On comparing the rates of duty imposed in 1789 , with the existing ones , and with the contemplated rates of our opponents , they will seethe correspondence between the notions then , and now entertained , of protecting duties . The difference will , however , appear more striking by a comparison of the ad valorem duties on the whole importations of 1789 and 1790 , and 1825 . Of the 24,341,624 dollars , imported in the two former years , 21,742,291 paid 5 per cent duty , ) . 2,591,752 aid 7 P l-2 and 10 per cent duty , #@# " fif* 7,581 paid 12 1-2 and 15 per cent duty , ) Of the imports of 1825 , the report from the Treasury affords /z/ no means of ascertaining the exact rates on all the ad valorem articles . The leading ones are : Cotton Goods 29 to 90 per cent . Woollens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent . Linens - 29 per cent . Hard Ware - 29 per cent . Glass Ware - 34 per cent . Straw Hats , Caps , &c.; T 58 per cent . There were some other articles paying 25 down to 12 1-2 per cent , but as more than half were cotton , woollen and silk goods , and a large portion of the others which paid 25 to 30 per j , cent , the average the committee believe can not be less than 35 to 40 per cent , and under the Harrisburg , or the contemplated tariff , the duties on cottons will be raised considerably , and on woollens the average may be 120 to 150 per cent . For instance , cloths costing 50 cents or under , a square yard , pay 40 per cent , on a valuation of 50 cents a yard . Cloths costing over 50 cents , and not exceeding $2 50 a square yard , to pay a duty on $2 50 a square yard . Cloths costing over $2 50 a square yard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty on $4 a square yard . Cloths costing over $4 a square yard , and not exceeding $6 a square yard , to pay a duty on $6 a yard . Cloths costing over $6 a square yard , to pay on whatever they may cost . It should be noticed that the duty , though nominally 40 per cent , is in fact 46 per cent . Thus cloths costing 51 cents a yard , pay 46 per cent on $2 50 , or 115 cents , equal to 225 per cent on the cost . 251 cents a yard , pay 46 per cent on 3 73 per cent on the cost . 401 cents a yard , pay 46 per cent on 68 per cent on the cost . 600 and over , pay 46 per cent on what they cost , equal to 46 per ct . on the cost . To these rates 5 per cent is to be added after the 30th June , 1829 , and five per cent more after the 30th June , 1830. * Most of the goods consumed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 73 per cent , while the high cost goods would pay but 46 per cent ; and this , as we have before observed , was the case in the bill which passed the House last winter ; we have too in this tariff , * In 1830 , these rates , by the addition of 10 per cent , will be increased one fourth , making ... 281 per cent , 91 per cent , 85 per cent , 57 1-2 per cent . /z/ much greater temptations than ever , " to the dishonest importers , " who have been charged with evading revenue , to the extent of one half under the existing duty. * In the Harrisburg tariff , an importer by altering his invoice one cent a yard , may save 179 per cent in the duties . We have gone into these details , which we know will be tedious to our readers , to show what different meanings are attached to the word protection . The Congress of 1789 considered 5 per cent on woollens as much as was due to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 80 per cent , at the last session , and mean to call for 120 per cent at4he ensuing one . We say then that the Congress of 1789 , had no intention of prohibiting woollens , or even of imposing such duties as would diminish their consumption , and thus by lessening revenue , defeat the object for which the law was passed . If those who had brought forward this act , had paid the least attention to its sense , and to the obvious intention of the makers of it , they would have seen by the very words they have quoted , that the main and indeed sole object of it was , to raise revenue for the support of government , and the discharge of the debts of the United States ; protection to manufactures was altogether secondary and incidental , and may be said to be rather one of its beneficial effects associated with the others , to reconcile the nation to a system of taxation . It is perfectly absurd to suppose any other interpretation can be given to the intentions of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it implies a most strange perversion of mind in those expounders of constitutional law , to imagine that men who voted for a duty of 5 percent , imposed avowedly for revenue , would vote for a bill imposing 80 per cent , and still more one for 120 per cent , for the declared purpose of ' prohibition , and thus destroying revenue , or that they would sanction the principles of a system , the object of /z/ * We notice in some late discussions , in the newspapers , that the principle adopted by us of estimating the duties under the Harrisburg tariff , has been objected to . It is contended for instance , that goods costing 51 cents , and not exceeding $2 50 , will pay 40 per cent , or 100 cents , equal to 196 per cent on the cost . Whereas , we have estimated the rate as an ad valorem duly , which would make it 44 percent , to which add 2 per cent for duty on shipping charges , is 46 per cent , making the duty on cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 115 cents , or 225 1-2 per cent . This we conceive is the true construction of the memorial which proposes that " goods costing over 50 cents , and not exceeding $250 per square yard , should be taken and deemed to have cost $2 50 a yard , and 40 per cent ad valorem to be charged thereon . " A law made in conformity to the memorial , would not , we apprehend , admit of any other construction , and we are the more confident in this , because the duties on the tariff bill which passed the House of Representatives lastwinter , were in the debates estimated by several of the speakers in that way , and not objected to . But it can be of very little consequence whether Congress construe the intention of the memorialists one way or the other . The existing duties have reduced our importation of woollens for last year down to 7,886,826 dollars , of which 441,382 dollars exported , leaves for consumption 7,445,444 dollars , or a little over one tenth part of all we consume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harrisburg Convention , would as effectually exclude woollens , as the enormous rates for which they have petitioned . /z/ which is to destroy all foreign trade , and the effect of which is to impose burdensome taxation on the nation at large , to promote the views of one particular class . Again , from the same address ; " in addition to these strong facts , General Washington , who had been President of the Convention , in his message of 1796 , particularly recommended to Congress the encouragement of manufactures ; " and there follows an extract from his speech . " Congress have repeatedly , and not without success , directed their attention to the encouragement of manufactures . The object is of too much importance not to insure a continuance of their efforts in every way that shall appear eligible . Ought our country to remain dependant on foreign supply , precarious , because liable to be interrupted ? If the necessary article should in this mode cost more in time of peace , will not the security and independence thence arising , form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson 's message of December 1802 is to the same effect , and furnish the following extract : " To cultivate peace , and maintain commerce and navigation in all their lawful enterprises , to foster our fisheries as nurseries of navigation , and for the nurture of man , and to protect the manufactures adapted to our circumstances , are the landmarks by which to guide ourselves in all our proceedings . " " Mr. Madison and Mr. Monroe , in their messages uniformly held the same doctrine . " We have here all the proofs which have been adduced by Mr. Ingersoll and others , to show that Washington and Jefferson were in favour of monopolies , and exclusive systems . Their language is open to the understandings of all men , and what is the inference ? Why , that they were friendly to commerce , navigation and manufactures , and ready to do all they could for their protection and promotion . Do they not connect in all their communications , manufactures with commerce , navigation , and the general welfare of the nation ? Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great interests of the country shall be sacrificed to them ? For this is the doctrine of our opponents . Their system goes to the destruction of commerce and navigation , and the injuring the general welfare . To know the measure of protection , which they considered due to them , consistent with the general welfare , we must look to the stale of the tariff under their administrations . In 1789 , the duties on woollen manufactures were 5 per cent , subsequently increased to 7 1-2 , under which rates they increased and flourished to such an extent as to supply three quarters of all we consumed , and no complaints were heard of a want of protecting duties . During Mr. Adams ' Presidency , the rates on cottons and woollens were advanced to 12 1-2 per cent , to which 2 1-2 per cent was added , under Mr. Jefferson 's administration , to meet the expenses of war with the Barbary powers . All these additions were expressly for revenue , and not a word said about protecting systems . /z/ As to what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , it was incumbent on them , and in conformity to usage , to notice manufactures in common with all the leading interests of the country , and to have said less , would have implied a gross neglect of duty , but it discovers a singular misapprehension of the characters and understandings of these patriotic and intelligent statesmen , to imagine that either of them would recommend or countenance the policy we are resisting , so entirely at variance as it is with that free and liberal system under which the country had flourished during their administrations . As to Mr. Madison , the use which our opponents have made of his name , to gain converts and support to their principles , has compelled him to disavow publicly his acquiescence in their notions . " I must observe also , " he says , " that though it is true that I have spoken of the power of Congress , in its enlarged sense , over commerce as a primary and known object in forming the Constitution , the language of the statement is inaccurate , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire resources of the country . " What is the inference ? Why , that Mr. Madison did not consider that Congress had an " indefinite power over the entire resources of the country . " What is it our opponents contend for ? Why , that Congress , under certain powers in the Constitution to lay imposts for revenue , regulate trade , and to provide for the general welfare , have the right to pass laws , the obvious effect of which is to diminish and destroy trade , and the inevitable consequences of which will be to impose an enormous taxation on the nation at large for the benefit of a few , to annihilate revenue , and thus to impair the general welfare . Now what is this but the exercise of an indefinite and unlimited power over the resources of the country ? This is the spirit of the " American System , " and will its advocates find any thing in Mr. Madison 's writings* to justify the principles on which it is founded ? With regard to Mr. Monroe 's opinions , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in IS22 , under the title of " Views of the President of the United States on the Subjects of Internal Improvements ; " in which he defines ihose powers of the Constitution , under which our opponents look for the support of their principles . There is nothing in that disquisition , which can give the least countenance to the advocates of unlimited powers of Congress , to the supporters of the " American System . " That the advocates of restriction and prohibition should pretend to rank Mr. Jefferson on their side , is the more remarkable , because he * " He hdd it to be one of Ike truths most demonstrable , that commercial shackles , in general , were impolitic and unjust . It was his opinion , that if industry and labour were suffered to take their own course , they would find their proper objects . He believed that the national interests were not more promoted by these restrictions than vere those of individuals . The same was the case between different parts of the same community , and between one nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hostile to forcing manufactures by bounties and prohibitions , as being a resort to unjust contrivances for their support , but he considered that it would be , for a long time to come , the interest of this country to exchange freely the products of our soil for the manufactures of Europe , both as a matter of pecuniary benefit , and at the same time as more conducive to the health , morals and happiness of the nation . These opinions were expressed in various publications , and at different periods of his life , and he remained steadfast to them to the very close of his existence . But of all the authorities adduced in favour of monopoly and prohibition , the most unwarrantable use has been made of the name and writings of Alexander Hamilton , of which we have already produced one striking instance in the 5th division of this report . The source on which our opponents rely for the opinions of this illustrious man , is his celebrated report on manufactures , which we regret is not more generally read , that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system which the author of that paper would have been one of the first to condemn . 1st. on account of its injustice ; and 2ndly , because of its tendency to injure , instead of promoting manufactures . Shortly after the adoption of our constitution , Hamilton was placed by Washington at the head of the financial department of the government . In that situation , it became part of his official duty to present reports on the various great interests of the nation , which he accordingly did one on public credit ; another on a national bank ; one on a mint , and a fourth on manufactures . In the last , he went into a detailed and minute exposition of the advantages of manufactures ; the facilities we had of carrying them on , and the best means of promoting them ; not , however , confining himself entirely to manufactures , but extending his remarks to agricultural products ; such as grain , cotton , hemp , flax , &c.; See. ; also to the best means of inland transportation , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imposts on some articles and bounties on others , which he considered virtually the same as imposts . Now , though there are some doctrines and some expedients for the encouragement of manufactures , which would never have found admission to his report , had the writer lived in the present advanced state of political economy , and when the statesmen of the old world are acting upon more liberal and enlightened principles , still there is not a line nor an opinion in it , from which it can be inferred , that he would for an instant have sanctioned the policy or principles of the system we are opposing . Hamilton found the country without revenue and without credit ; a government new and unsettled , and in the minds of many , there was a want of confidence in its strength and durability . The revolution had left the nation poor , and when Hamilton made up his reports , the public debt was upwards of 54,000,000 dollars a sum equal in our present increased wealth and population , to 500,000,000 dollars which /z/ latter sum can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the period of which we are speaking . We were without the means of paying even the interest on this debt , and the current expenses of the year . The very existence of the government , seemed at that moment to depend on the establishment of the public credit on a firm and lasting foundation . Hamilton was called upon to create and organise a revenue system . The main object of his report on manufactures , was to support his previous one on public credit , by holding out all the collatteral advantages of the new and increased duties proposed in the latter ; and to call the attention of government to other suitable objects of impost , that the nation might become the more reconciled to the necessity of further taxation ; and at the same time , in connexion with the other reports , to define and strengthen some of the powers of the general government , which were at that moment distrusted , or not well understood . Pressing , however , as were the wants of government , one can not but admire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various articles . The leading principle he adopted , and which all will admit is the fair one , was to impose high rates on superfluities , and low ones on the necessaries of life . Accordingly on teas , sugars , coffee , wines and spirits , deemed luxuries in those days , the duties were high ; while on cottons and woollens , without which we can not exist , they were low . The principle now acted upon by the advocates of the " American System , " is to put the highest duties on some of the first necessaries of life , and to increase those rates according to the coarseness of the articles . That Hamilton was friendly to manufactures as being next to agriculture and commerce , the leading interests of the country , there is evidence enough , and what other statesman is there of any eminence , of which the same may not be said ? That he contended for the right in Congress to impose duties for revenue , the effect of which would be to encourage and promote manufactures is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commend him for it ? It , is the abuse of this power , when carried to such extremes as to prohibit imports , and consequently lessen our export trade , destroy revenue , burden one part of the nation with heavy taxes for the benefit of another , which constitutes the wrong , and which we contend is neither in accordance with the spirit or letter of a constitution , which was intended to guarantee equal laws , equal rights , as well as equal burdens , to all who live under it . But , say our opponents , Hamilton supported the doctrine of protection . Now this is one of those terms which the advocates of restriction have found it convenient to explain in a sense , the very opposite to what its true meaning imports . We have seen that their protection means prohibition and destruction , to both revenue and trade , and enormous taxation to support the views of particular indi- /z/ viduals at the expense of the nation ; but to know in what sense Hamilton used it , we will refer , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time Hamilton drew up his report , the duties on ad valorem goods , as we have before shown , averaged 5 1-2 per cent. ; to some of the articles , he recommends additions of 2 1-2 per cent . The duty on cotton goods was 5 per cent. , to which he suggested an increase of 2 1-2 per cent . On woollens , which he says " from specimens in his hands , had already attained a very considerable degree of perfection , and which he was most anxious to cherish and bring to maturity , " he recommends " no addition to the 5 per cent , they then enjoyed , except 2 1-2 per cent , on carpets and carpeting , which he thinks will not be objected to , on account of the nature of the articles " being considered as luxuries . " By what process of reasoning , then , can it be inferred that this able statesman , who , in a most elaborate report , drawn up with a view to revenue , as well as the promotion of manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duty as they ought to receive , consistent with the general welfare , would be favourable to the present high rates , and still more , that he would sanction the policy or constitutionality of laws proposed avowedly for their prohibition ? We will now give a few extracts from the report , which will futv nish more positive evidence of his entire disagreement with our opponents . Speaking of the policy of encouraging manufactures by high duties on rival articles from abroad , he says " This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufactures ; but in general it is only fit to be employed when a manufacture has made such a progress , and is in so many hands , as to insure a due competition , and an adequate supply on reasonable terms . " Here then is one of the passages , which is relied upon as making most strongly in favour of high duties . What , then , are the circumstances under which Hamilton recommends high duties ? " When a manufacture has made such a progress as to insure competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we have already shown that in 1790 we manufactured upwards of three quarters of all the woollens we consumed , and the report admits that " they had arrived to a very considerable degree of perfection , and that the writer of it was anxious to cherish , and bring them to maturity , " and consequently they had attained that condition , on which prohibitory or high duties were justifiable ; still Hamilton would give only 5 per cent , which he deemed sufficient to bring the homo fabric to still greater maturity ; considering , no doubt , that any further protection would be subjecting the nation to a heavier burden than was expedient or just . We see then most clearly , the difference between Hamilton 's ideas of protection , and those of the supporters of the present system , and that , too , upon an obvious construction of a passage considered by them as most favourable to their views . Again " It would deserve /z/ attention , however , in the employment of this species of encouragement in the United States , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances which might he deemed eligible , that the great distance of this country from Europe , imposes very heavy charges on all the fabrics which are brought from thence , amounting to from 15 to 30 per cent , on their value , according to their bulk . " Thus under his duty of 5 per cent , the other charges might have been 16 to 17 per cent , making in all 21 to 22 per cent , which he deemed ample encouragement for woollens . The existing duty is 38 per cent , and the other charges 19 per cent , making 57 per cent , which an importer must pay , before he can meet the domestic manufacturer in the home market . The Harrisburg duty is at least 120 per cent , which , adding the 19 per cent , for expenses of importation , will make the average charges on foreign woollens 139 per cent , but on coarse ones , they will be from 175 per cent , to 200 per cent . ! ! ! Again " The continuance of bounties on manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a presumption would arise in such case , that there were natural and inherent impediments to success . But in new undertakings they are justifiable , as they are oftentimes necessary . " We have here another view of his idea of protecting duties ; and let us apply his reasoning to the case of woollens . The manufacture of woollens , ( an article which , as a mean of existence , stands next in importance to food ) is certainly among the oldest in the country ; and , according to Hamilton 's doctrine , if it has not succeeded under protecting duties of 5 to 38 per cent , it should be considered as one of those undertakings to which " there are natural and inherent impediments , which would render a continuance of the already existing bounty , as of questionable policy . " This reflection goes upon that sound , elementary principle of political economy , which is now universally admitted , that those manufactures which need the least protection , are best suited to our existing condition , and most conducive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained by great bounties , are shown by that very circumstance , to be least adapted to our character and situation , and therefore injurious to the general welfare . We give one more extract from this report , and we have done . In speaking again of protecting duties , he observes : " The propriety of this species of encouragement need not be dwelt upon , as it is not only a clear result from the numerous topics which have been suggested , but is sanctioned by the laws of the United States , in a variety of instances ; it has the additional recommendation of being a resource of revenue . " This passage affords a further explanation of Hamilton 's notion of protecting dutiee , and evinces most clearly , that so far from his considering them as an instrument of monopoly to build up the interests of one class to the prejudice of all the others , that he looked to them as a source of revenue , and as a means of promoting the general good . /z/ We could multiply quotations , were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader to the report itself , and if he will give it that attentive consideration which so comprehensive and profound an essay merits ; taking into view also the circumstances under which it was written , and the objects the writer had most at heart , he . will , we are certain , rise from its perusal with the same entire conviction we have done , that there is nothing he has said , which can afford the least support to the doctrines we are resisting ; indeed it would be extraordinary , if a man of Hamilton 's strong , discerning , and just mind , and of his liberal and patriotic views , could for an instant uphold those narrow , impolitic , and unjust principles , on which the prohibitory and exclusive policy is founded . Having examined the authorities on which our opponents seem to rely the most confidently , to support the justice and constitutionality of their principles , we will now exhibit other authorities , which go to sustain opposite views of the case . The eminent citizen , referred to by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened legislatures of the Union of the unconstitutionally as well as folly of the prohibitory system , is Mr . Giles , and those who have any recollection of the character he sustained in Congress during the early part of Mr. Jefferson 's administration , when he was one of the principal supporters of the government , against as able an opposition as any administration ever encountered , will not doubt his qualifications to form an opinion upon any subject connected with the laws and constitution of the country . To deny the pre-eminent talents and knowledge of a man who could contend successfully in debates upon the most difficult and abstract questions , with the Griswolds and Bayards of the day , would not only be uncandid , but ridiculous . To the opinion of this experienced and enlightened statesman , we could add those of other public men , distinguished for talents and character , but it would perhaps be objected to them , as it has been to Mr. Giles and others , that from the relation in which they happened to stand to the contest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations . It is , however , not only an unreasonable , but a very inconsistent objection , because it is notorious , that the opinions of most of them were expressed and acted upon , before the question referred to existed , and it is equally well known that the candidate who is held up for the presidency by those gentlemen and their constituents , has given the prohibitory policy a more open and efficient support , than the person who is supported for the same office in those sections , where the exclusive system is now chiefly maintained . These , however , are political mysteries with which we have no concern ; nor should we again have adverted to them , but to show the gross inconsistencies of the partizans of the " American System . " It will not , we presume , be pretended by our opponents , after the /z/ extracts from his works , which they have published , to prove that Jefferson was favourable to their views , that they can object to his authority . We proceed then to lay before our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his confidential friends , the year after the tariffof 1824 went into operation , by which the duties on various articles were raised , and on woollens from 29 to 38 per cent . " Under the power " says Mr. Jefferson , " to regulate commerce , they assume indefinitely that also over agriculture and manufactures ; and called it regulation too , to take the earnings of one of those branches of industry , and that too the most depressed , and put them into the pockets of the others , the most flourishing of all . Under the authority to establish post roads , they claim that of cutting down mountains for the construction of roads , of digging canals , and aided by a little sophistry on the words " general ivelfare , " a right to do not only the acts to effect that , which are specifically enumerated and permitted , but whatever they shall think or pretend will be for the general welfare . And what is our resource for the preservation of the constitution ? Reason and argument ? You might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The representatives chosen by ourselves , they are joined in the combination , some from incorrect views of government , some from corrupt ones , sufficient voting together to outnumber the sound parts , and with majorities of only 1 , 2 , 3 , bold enough to go forward in defiance . Are we then to stand at arms ? No ! That must be the last resource , not to be thought of until much longer and greater sufferings . If every infraction of a compact of so many parties , is to be resisted at once , as a dissolution of it , none can ever be formed which would last one year . We must have patience and long endurance then , with our brethren , while under delusion . Give them time for reflection and experience of consequences ; keep ourselves in a situation to profit by the chapter of accidents , and separate from our companions only when the sole alternatives left , are the dissolution of our union with them , OR SUBMISSION TO A GOVERNMENT WITHOUT LIMITATION OF POWERS . Between these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAN BE NO HESITATION , but in the meanwhile the States should be watchful to note every material usurpation on their rights , to denounce them as they occur in the most peremptory terms , to protest against them , as wrongs to which our present submission shall be considered , not as acknowledgments or precedents of rights , but as temporary yielding to the lesser evil , until their accumulation shall outweigh that of separation . " We entreat most earnestly , that our readers , to whatever party they may belong , would not pass this passage in our report , without giving it that deep consideration which it merits . We here behold a venerable and experienced statesman , who loved his country , understood her interests , and was solicitous for her future welfare ; wholly unconnected with parties , having nothing to fear from the one , or to hope from the /z/ other ; disengaged as it were from this world , and standing on the confines of the other , and anxious to render his last service to his country , pronouncing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system we are opposing . He denounces it as unjust , unconstitutional , and as inevitably leading , if persisted in , to a dissolution of the Union , and a separation 01 the States , and even recommends that alternative , as more tolerable than the evils which would grow out of a submission to a policy , so ruinous to the peace and welfare of the nation . Solemn and impressive as this denunciation is , it serves rather to deepen a former , than create any new conviction in our minds , of Jefferson 's disapprobation of the principles which have so unjustly been imputed to him . The sentiments here expressed , are conformable to Mr. Jefferson 's well known opinions upon subjects of this nature , and are in proper keeping with the whole tenor of his life and character , and could we appeal personally , to Washington , Hamilton , and Ames , upon the merits of the prohibitory system , we should have from them , also , the same sentence of reprobation against it , which Mr. Jefferson has just pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had succeeded in imposing on the nation the belief that the acts and opinions of Mr. Jefferson would sanction the prohibitory policy , should feel disturbed at the appearance of a letter which placed them and their cause , in such an awkward predicament , and that consequently they would endeavour to evade , or lessen its force . Accordingly , both the author of the communication and the gentleman to whom it is addressed , have been assailed by the friends of the " American System , " with the most abusive terms ; but the reasons which have been given to discredit the opinions it contains , are so extraordinary , that we will state them in the words which our opponents themselves employ , in their remarks upon Mr. Jefferson 's letter . We find the various objections to Mr. Jefferson 's opinions embraced in the following extracts from the remarks of the editor of the National Gazette , of Philadelphia , and Richmond Whig , in Virginia . The editor of the former , in speaking of the opinions expressed by Mr. Jefferson in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised his judgment independently , and studied the questions thoroughly and impartially , he would have been far from adopting , or at least uttering with freedom and confidence " The editor of the Whig remarks " We now ask which opinions deserve our confidence most ? Those which were expressed by Mr. Jefferson , when in the vigour of life and public usefulness , which were published to the world , and enforced by his great authority as President of the United States , or the opinions of the same Mr. Jefferson , delivered at the advanced age of 82 years , under the weight of infirmity and private embarrassments , and communicated in a private and /z/ confidential letter , which he had no expectation would ever be revealed . " The motives which induced Mr. Giles to publish this letter ought not to affect our confidence in the opinions of Mr. Jefferson , but so far from conceiving this a blameable act , we think Mr. Giles , as a friend to Mr. Jefferson , was bound so to do . A party interested in building up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very improperly , as we have before shown , quote Mr. Jefferson as supporting their views and proceedings . His friends justly considering such a charge as injurious to his character and fame , publish such an explicit declaration of his opinions , as they think must remove from the minds of every one , so blasting an imputation . What could be more natural ? What more praiseworthy f The objections to Mr. Jefferson 's opinions are , that he was not a man of sincere and independent mind ; that the opinions , as one of them expresses himself , were " uttered with freedom and confidence ; " or as the other , " communicated in a private and confidential letter " and lastly , that " they were delivered at the advanced age of 82 . " The charges of insincerity and want of independence , we never heard brought against Mr. Jefferson in the most violent and intolerant days of political warfare ; we presume that no persons who ever knew Mr. Jefferson 's character , will for a moment give the least credit to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidential letter , " we should not think , under any circumstances , would lessen our belief in it ; more especially , if like our opponents , we considered the writer wanting in sincerity and independence . We had supposed if political men had two sets of opinions , that the " private and confidential " were the most to be relied upon . We come now to his age . We admit that no man 's opinion , upon a new and difficult subject is to be entirely relied upon at that advanced period ; but this was not a new question to Mr. Jefferson , and as the editor truly says , " it was at the age of 82 he delivered this opinion . " It was formed early in life , and never forsaken . We of course do not mean that the identical points discussed in the letter to Mr. Giles , were at an early period presented to him , but the general princples on which the system was founded , and its consequences were familiar to him , and he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents might as well , therefore , object his age to the re-affirmation of a proposition in arithmetic which had been familiar to him from his youth . As to his former opinions , he never entertained any other on the question we are discussing , than the one expressed in the letter to Mr. Giles . In the letter to Mr. Austin , cited by the editor of the Whig , he expresses himself friendly to manufactures , as he had done before in his messages , and we have shown to what an extent he deemed it proper to go for their promotion ; but it is one thing to give such an honest support to man- /z/ ufactures , as is compatible with a just regard to the public welfare , and another to be friendly to a system which is injurious to all the rest of the nation , and may finally ruin the manufacturers themselves . Another great statesman , claimed by Mr. Carey and others , as in favour of the forcing system , is Franklin ; but with how little truth , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Princes of Europe , of late , from an opinion of the advantage to arise by producing all commodities and manufactures within ( heir own dominions , so as to diminish or render useless their importations , have endeavoured to entice workmen from other countries , by high salaries , privileges , &tc.; Many persons pretending to be skilled in various great manufactures , imagining that America must be in want of them , and that the Congress would be disposed to imitate the Princes above mentioned , have proposed to go over , on condition of having their passages paid , lands given , salaries appointed , exclusive privileges for terms of years , &,c.; Such persons , on reading the articles of confederation , will find that Congress have no power committed to them , or money put into their hands for such purposes , and that if any such encouragement is given , it must be by the government of some separate State . " Again ; " And when the governments have been solicited to support such schemes by encouragements , in money , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been generally refused , on this principle , that if the country is ripe for the manufacture , it maybe carried on by private persons to advantage . ; and if not , it is a folly to think of forcing nature . Great establishments of manufacture , require great numbers of the poor to do the work for small wages ; those poor are to be found in Europe , but will not be found in America , till the lands are all taken up and cultivated , and the excess of the people who can not get land , ivant employment . " Is there any thing here to support the wisdom , the justice , or constitutionality of the prohibitory , non-importation , non-exportation , " American System ? " We will now present our readers with some of the resolutions , appended to an able report of a committee , appointed at a general meeting of the citizens of Boston , August 1820 . The committee consisted of the following persons : William Gray , Daniel Webster , George Hallet , James Perkins , Nathan Appleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josiah Knapp , Nathaniel Goddard , Joseph Sewall , Isaac Winslow , Benjamin Rich , Jonathan Phillips , Winslow Lewis , Israel Thorndike , Jr . Lot Wheelwright , Thos . Wigglesworth , William Shirnmin , " Caleb Loring , John . Cotton , Thomas W. Ward , Samuel A. Welles , John Parker , William Harris , George Bond , William Sturgis. /z/ It will be admitted by all those acquainted with the pursuits and characters of those gentlemen , that it is a fair and able representation of the various interests of the country . " RESOLVED ; That no objection ought ever to be made to any amount of taxes , equally apportioned and imposed for the purpose of raising revenue necessary for the support of government ; but that taxes imposed on the people for the sole benefit of any one class of men , are equally inconsistent with the principles of our constitution and with sound policy . " " RESOLVED ; That high bounties on such domestic manufactures as are principally benefitted by that tariff , favour great capitalists rather thanpersonalindustry , oi'ie owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive its tendency to promote national industry . " " RESOLVED ; That the imposition of duties , which are enormous , and deemed by a large portion of the people to be unequal and unjust , is dangerous , as it encourages the practice of smuggling . " " RESOLVED ; That in our opinion , the proposed tariff and the principles on which it is avowedly founded , would if adopted , have a tendency , however different may be the motives of those who recommend them , to diminish the industry , impede the prosperity , and corrupt the morals of the people . " " RESOLVED ; That we are equally incapable of discovering its beneficial effects on agriculture , since the obvious consequence of its adoption , would be , that the farmer must give more than he now does . for all he buys , and receive less for all he sells . " These positions were sustained by facts and arguments which satisfied the meeting held on the 2nd of October , 1820 , of their correctness , and they were unanimously adopted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , the duties on all but very fine cotton goods were considerably less than they now are , and that woollens which then paid 29 per cent , now pay 38 per cent . The Harrisburg tariff calls for a very great increase of duties on coloured and printed cotton goods , which made up near five-sevenths of the whole importation of cotton goods in 1826 . On coarse woollens the maximum is fixed at 225 per cent , to be increased in 1830 one fourth , making 281 per cent ; on fine goods 46 per cent , to be increased in 1830 to 57 1-2 per cent . This we believe is to be one of the established maxims of the " American System , " viz. The coarser the goods , the higher the duties , because they interfere more than the fine ones with our own fabrics . It may be well also to remark , that among the committee , and at the meeting which adopted the resolutions , were many gentlemen , who , by their wealth , talents and enterprise , have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various manufactures , and more particularly cottons and woollens , and as it is within the knowledge of the committee , that many of these persons have since greatly extended their concerns , it is reasonably inferred , /z/ that they either considered the former duties sufficient , or at any rate , as high as it was right for the government to impose ; and we believe such are the opinions still entertained by those who best understand the manufacturing interests . We say then , that the language of these resolutions bear us out in the doctrine we are attempting by authorities and arguments to support , " that taxes imposed on the people , not with a view to revenue , but for the sole benefit of any one class of men , are inconsistent with the principles of our constitution , and with sound policy . " Such were the opinions and declarations of the most intelligent manufacturers in this quarter , when the duties on cottons were much less than they now enjoy , and still less than what they are rated at in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 per cent ; they now enjoy 38 per cent , and are to be raised on an average , ( if the Harrisburg tariff is adopted , ) first to 120 per cent , and finally to 150 per cent ! ! ! The following extracts are from the memorial to Congress , of a general meeting of merchants from the principal cities in the United States , held in Philadelphia , November , 1820 , with a view to oppose those additions made to the tariff in 1824 . " Once admit , that Congress may use thepower of taxing imports ad-libitum , for any other purpose but that of revenue , and you give them in reality , the power to say to the citizens of these United States , you must devote yourselves to agriculture , commerce or manufactures , not as you may happen to be inclined , but according to our sovereign will and pleasure . Let it never be forgotten , that the question now about to be determined , is not so much what may be beneficial to manufactures , as whether government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury both of the agricultural and commercial classes * ? Whether the constitutional provisions against taxing exports , can be rendered in a great measure nugatory , by diminishing at pleasure , the value of our exportable commodities , through the instrumentality of a tax upon imports ? And finally , whether the direction and employment of individual capital , are matters to be regulated and controlled by individual choice , or by the will of the national legislature ? " " That where such duties are imposed to foster the particular interests of any class , who pay no part thereof , those duties must necessarily come out of the pockets of all the other classes in the community , and are in direct violation of that fundamental maxim , " not to tax the many for the benefit of the few . " These doctrines were not thought unsound in this quarter by manufacturers generally , nor any other classes ; nor are they , we trust , at this moment , except by a very limited number of persons . The following extract is the closing paragraph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any further increase of duties . That memorial contained probably the clearest and most comprehensive statement and defence of the advantages of a free /z/ trade , and the evils and injustice of the " American System , " which was presented to Government on that occasion . It was well tinderstood at the time , to come from the mind of one of our most learned and accomplished men , whose profession , united with the advantage ofa long residence in a manufacturing and commercial community , made him familiar with all the leading interests of the country , and enabled him to decide correctly and impartially upon the encouragement each might require , or might deserve , with due reference to the rights and interests of the nation . " Upon the whole , the memorialists would respectfully state their unequivocal opinion , that all the measures to which they have alluded , are calculated to impair our naval strength and glory ; to injure our most profitable commerce ; to diminish in an alarming degree the public revenue ; to promote unjustifiable speculation ; to enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of the nation into the hands of a few capitalists , to the exclusion of the industrious and enterprising of other classes ; to introduce general distress among commercial artizans and agriculturalists ; to aggravate the present distress of the other classes of the community ; to provoke and extend an undue appetite for fraud and smuggling ; and in fine , to destroy many of the great objects for which the constitution of the United States was originally framed and adopted . " * We do not mean to say that the author of this powerful and eloquent memorial , of which we have just given a portion , meant to give any opinion on the point we are more particularly discussing , it might have appeared improper to him so to do , standing in the offi- * " Nothing can be more obvious , than that many of the manufacturers and their friends are attempting- by fallacious statements , founded on an interested policy , or a misguided zeal , or very short-sighted views , to up-root some of the fundamental principles of our revenue policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most lucrative branches of commerce ; branches which alone enable us to contend with success against the monopoly and the competition of foreign nations " . Salem Memorial . " The memorialists most sincerely believe that is is a sound political maxim , that the more free trade is , and the more widely it circulates , the more sure will be its prosperity , and that of the nation ; every restriction which is not indispensable for purposes of revenue , is a shoal , which will impede its progress , and not unfrequently jeopard its security . " Salem Memorial . " It is not a little remarkable too , that those attempts to which the memorialists allude , are not only repugnant to those maxims of free trade , which the United States have hitherto so forcibly and perseveringly contended for , as the sure foundation of national prosperity ; but they are pressed upon us at a moment , when the statesmen of the old world , in admiration of Ike success of our policy , are relaxing the vigour of their own gystems , andyielding themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted by a free interchange of commodities , upon the principles of perfect reciprocity . " Salem Memorial . " The cotton and woollen trade is already loaded with 20 and 25 per cent duties , and if there be added the freight and charges upon importation , the domestic manufacturers have now an encouragement , or a profit , of 30 to 35 per cent more than the European manufacturers possess , if the same articles can be manufactured as cheap at home as abroad . " " Why should the farmer , and the planter , and the merchant , and the labouring classes of the community , be taxed for the necessaries of life , a sum equal to more than one quarter part of the whole expenditures on these objects , that the manufacturer* may put this sum into their own pockets ? " Salem Memorial . /z/ cial relation which he does to the government ; but he has shown in the most convincing manner , the inexpediency and injustice of the whole system we are opposing . We have one more authority , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parties , for though it must be admitted that the gentleman to whom we are indebted for it , has dealt most severely with the " American System , " yet our opponents can not deny that he has also been friendly to manufacturers , more especially the manufacturers of woollens ; and at any rate , all will agree that his opinions are to be respected . The following is an extract of a speech made by Mr. Webster , at Faneuil Hall , 2d October , 1820 , on the adoption of the report arid resolutions ofthe Boston Committee , to which we have before adverted . " There is a power in names ; and those who had pressed the tariffon Congress and on the country , had represented it as immediately , and almost exclusively connected with domestic industry , and national independence . In his opinion , no measure could prove more injurious to the industry of the country , and nothing was more fanciful than the opinion , that national independence rendered such a measure necessary . He certainly thought it might be doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and intention ofthe constitution , in exercising a power to control essentially the pursuits and occupations of individuals , in their private concerns ; a power to force great and sudden changes , both of occupation and property , upon individuals , not as incidental to the exercise of any other power , but as a substantial and direct power . If such changes were wrought incidentally only , and were the necessary consequence of such impost as Congress for the leading purpose of revenue should enact , then they could not be complained of . But he doubted whether Congress fairly possessed the power of turning the incident into the principal ; and instead of leaving manufactures to the protection of such laws as should be passed with a primary regard to revenue , of enacting laws , with the avowed object of giving a preference to particular manufactures , wilh an entire disregard to all the considerations of revenue ; and instead of laying such imposts as would best answer the purpose of raising revenue , with the least burden on the public ; carrying the impost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that the increase of duty will diminish the amount of revenue raised . " These were the sentiments of Mr. Webster , when there was a question of raising the duties on cotton goods from rates much less than all but very fine ones , now enjoy . The import of cotton goods from all quarters for 1826 , after deducting the amount re-exported , is 5,601,961 dollars , of which 4,024,344 dollars , were coloured and printed . These goods now pay 7 1-2 cents a square yard , which may perhaps average 50 per cent. , and by the Harrisburg Tariff , they are to pay 10 cents , for the /z/ avowed purpose of excluding them . Our importation of the greatest staple of trade and consumption , next to woollens , will then be reduced tol , 577,6 ! 7 dollars , which was the amount of white cottons imported for consumption in 1826 . The woollen manufacturers ' Tariff of 1827 , called for an average duty on woollens of 80 per cent . ; but that not being sufficiently encouraging for the " American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 1-2 to 281 per cent . It is impossible to say exactly what it may average , nor is it of any importance , for nothing can be imported under it , except the finest cloths which pay the duty of 57 1-2 per cent. , nor indeed can they be imported when our manufacturers turn their attention to goods of that description . Here then it must be admitted we have arrived at that point of prohibition , which Mr. Lawrence , Mr. Everett , Mr. Niles , Mr. Carey , and other distinguished leaders of the prohibitory party , say is essential to their purposes , and to the national welfare . Mr. Webster 's opinion , as to the constitutionality of the prohibitory system , is expressed with that caution , which so important a question merits , and habitual , we suppose , to a man who must be conscious of the great influence he exercises over the public mind . It is not for us to put a construction upon it different from what he might have intended . We see no ambiguity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to take them according to their fair import , and in connexion with the resolutions and report before mentioned , which he had previously sanctioned , and we apprehend there can be no doubt on the mind of any one , what his opinion really was . If , however , there were any doubts on the mind of Mr. Webster , and they rested on the question whether the rales of duty had then reached that point , when they must necessarily produce those bad effects which he describes we must conclude those doubts would be removed , when the rates in question are from 80 to 150 per cent . ; still more , when the evident object of the advocates of the system , is to prohibit foreign importations . We believe that the opinions expressed by Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Giles , Mr. Webster , and other distinguished legislators , are held in common by all men of sound and enlightened views , who look at the subject with an eye of impartiality , divested of those sectional , political , and personal considerations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ; and that they all equally condemn the impolicy , injustice , and unconstitutionality of those principles against which we are contending , when carried to the extremes , which our opponents seem determined to carry them . We had forgotten one other authority , which we fear however our opponents , from their manner of treating their own case and the understandings of their followers , can have very little reverence for . We mean , the authority of common sense . We would appeal then to the common sense of every fair and unprejudiced mind , whether it comports with their notions of justice and constitutionality , for Congress to avail itself of powers granted for certain ends , and those ends , such as would conduce to the general welfare to accomplish other purposes , for which those powers were never intended , the certain effect of which is to destroy trade , and the inevitable consequences an almost entire loss of revenue a heavy taxation of the many for the benefit of the few an interruption of our commercial intercourse with the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness of the nation If , however , the government really does possess such powers , and we can suppose that there ever would be a Congress assembled determined to exercise them in the way our opponents recommend , then we say , that , that sacred instrument , we call a Constitution , has not those virtues we once imagined it to possess ; and we fear , should the time ever arrive , when it is exposed to such a trial , that it can no longer answer the purposes for which it was intended . SECTION 12th . Another plausible argument in favor of the prohibitory system and against foreign trade , and which is very much dwelt upon , even by some very intelligent men , is , the dignity and advantage of being independent of foreign nations . Mr. Clay observes in one of his speeches on the Tariff in 1820 : " The independence of my country , on all foreign states , as respects a supply of all foreign wants , has ever been with me a favorite object . " That this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our apprehensions , it is totally misapplied . It is founded on a strange misapprehension of the term independence . What is independence , but the means of providing for our own support ? Now the tendency of commerce , whether foreign or domestic , is , not to lessen , but to increase those means . If this is true as regards the intercourse between sections , states , towns and individuals , it is equally so with regard to nations ; and if it was otherwise , it is manifest , that commerce would cease to exist , without the aid of legislative expedients , as no intercourse could be of long continuance , which was not mutually beneficial . But , say our opponents , " it is a badge of dependance , unworthy of a free and great nation . " We answer , that this is a sentiment worthy of a slavish , unenlightened and barbarous nation , and to no other should it ever be addressed . There is no question of dignity involved in our foreign trade , more than there is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one considers the inhabitants of the south as derogating from their characters in exchanging their produce for our manufactures , nor is there any abatement of our own self-respect , in buying from them what their soil and climate can best afford , in return for the results of our industry . We should entertain the same views in regard to our intercourse with foreign nations . It is an affair of mutual convenience , and sought for equally by both parties . It is founded on reciprocal wants and reciprocal benefits . Is it not so , too , in respect to what some term national dependence ? We exchange with various foreign nations , such superfluities as we have to spare , for what they have to give in return , and which we may happen to want . What we receive is paid for in equivalents , which cancel the obligation , and make the dependance mutual . Where then is that loss of dignity and independence , which those terms , in the sense our opponents use them , would imply ? We grant there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inconvenient and dangerous : such as too great reliance on them for munitions of war , and other means of self-defence ; and still more , if we were to depend on them for bread stuffs , provisions and other means of existence , to such an extent , as on any interruption of the usual intercourse , might expose us to great sufferings . But in the commercial relations which we have with all the world , our situation is precisely the reverse of this . We supply raw materials and provisions , and rather create in others that sort of dependance which it is prudent to avoid , than take any risk of being exposed to it ourselves . Our situation has never been such within the memory of any one now living , that a total non-intercourse with the rest of the world , would have deprived us of the necessaries , and hardly even of the superfluities of life . No nation on earth can be more favourably situated than this , in being beyond the reach of those evils which may arise from the derangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this view of our situation must be to all reflecting men , our opponents are making incessant appeals to the national prejudices , national pride , and national fears , of the disgrace we now incur , and the sufferings we may be liable to , from foreign dependance . The only event which can interrupt our intercourse with foreign nations , to any inconvenient degree , is a war with Great Britain . This has happened twice , and the first time at a period when we were , comparatively speaking , in a helpless situation ; yet we survived all the evils incident to that state . But it was during the last war with Great Britain , our opponents pretend to say we experienced the greatest inconveniences and sufferings , and we refer to the Pennsylvania Address for the most distressing instance we have yet seen , in proof of their assertion . " The attempts to establish the woollen manufactures , during the first 20 years of the operation of our government , had so wholly failed , that in the year 1812 , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amount of 6,000 dollars , so that the Secretary of War applied to Congress to repeal the non-intercourse law , to enable us to procure them from Great Britain . As to the assertion li that all attempts to establish woollen manufactures during the first 20 years of our government , " we have already shown its incorrectness by proving that we supplied three- /z/ fourths of our consumption as far back as 1790 , and that the manufacture had then attained a considerable degree of perfection , as we are told by Hamilton , in an extract from his report , given in our last section . Of the fact of the 6,000 dollars worth of blankets , so much wanted , we can not doubt , since we have so often seen it repeated in the speeches , memorials , and essays of the leading advocates of the non-importation system , and always as illustrating in the most striking and affecting manner , the dangers and sufferings which this nation had actually been exposed to , by her foreign dependance . Let us examine this extraordinary fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000,000 dollars of woollens , 3-4 of which were made at home , distressed for want of 6,000 dollars worth of blankets ! ! Now , it would , we think , be rating the spirit of our countrymen very low , to suppose that a requisition upon the patriotism of any of our large cities , would not have procured 6,000 dollars worth of blankets in six hours , without disturbing the comfort of one of their citizens ; and it would be putting the industry and skill of our manufacturers still lower , not to believe that in as many weeks , they could have furnished 600,000 dollars more , from materials of both cotton and wool , which we then had , and always shall have , in the greatest abundance . But was there no other way to escape from this alarming emergency ? What were the difficulties which stood in the way of our relief ? Why , they themselves tell us , that we had only to repeal our own non-intercourse laws , and our very enemy would send us blankets by ship loads ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was undignified and unpatriotic . We do not see it in that point of view . It might be unwise to make laws which stand in the way of our own interests , but it certainly would not be unpatriotic to repeal them . We are afraid our readers may think we are trifling with the subject , but we can assure them , the statement we have just examined , contains the strongest argument which the historical researches of our opponents for 200 years , have yet furnished , to prove the dangers incident to a dependance on " foreign supplies . " But were the interruptions to commerce more frequent , and more serious in their effects , than any we are now liable to suffer , yet it would not be wise to forego the immense benefits we enjoy from a free trade , for the short periods in which those difficulties might exist . We are told to be sure , by Mr. Otis , in his Woollens Convention Speech , that " the ordinary relations of the nations of the world , are those of wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ordinary condition is pestilence and famine ? It would be just as wise to regulate our commercial policy upon the latter contingencies , as the former . If there is any truth in history , the ordinary relations of nations , are peace and commerce ; the exceptions , commercial restrictions , prohibitions , non-intercourse with foreign nations , foreign wars and civil dissensions ; and such we apprehend , will be the end of /z/ the " American System , " falsely so termed , should it unhappily ever prevail . But Mr. Clay is not consistent with himself . In a speech made at Pittsburg , in June , he observes , " if , as I hope , our system is preserved and improved , I will now hazard the prediction , that in less than 20 years , the value of our exported manufactures , will exceed in amount , that of all the exports of raw produce from this country . " Of the extravagance of such a prophecy , we think there can be but one opinion , and so little is it believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Harrisburg Convention , men chosen , as it is well known , for their knowledge and experience , and praised for their disinterestedness and moderation , have just decided , that cottons will not succeed without an addition of 20 or 30 per cent on such kinds as are chiefly imported ; and woollens can not flourish without duties of 46 to 225 per cent , to rise hereafter 57 1-2 to 281 per cent , reserving to themselves the right , we suppose , of going still further , should these moderate rates , prove insufficient to keep out of our markets , the foreign manufacturer . Admitting , however , that by some miraculous changes , which no one but a prophet can foresee , Mr. Clay 's prediction is fulfilled , what then would be our situation ? We should have manufactures instead of raw produce , or both manufactures and raw produce to export , and for which we should still have to rely on foreign nations for the purchase and consumption , and our citizens would again rely on foreign nations for the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then becomes of our dignity , and the independence of our country on all foreign nations ? The commerce we have with Europeans is almost entirely an exchange of our raw produce for their manufactures , or produce . It is the exchange of these equivalents , which constitutes its support . If either party , therefore , refuses what the other can alone give , there must necessarily be an end of all commercial dealings ; and such , whatever may be the intentions of those who advocate what is termed independence of foreign nations , will be the effect of excluding by high duties , the fabrics and produce of other countries . If , however , the argument of being independent on foreign nations is worth any thing , it is on account of the interruptions to which our trade with them may be subjected . Now there is no event which can produce that effect , except a war with Great Britain ; and New England would , in that case , find it as difficult to communicate with the Carolinas , and still more with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or those European nations with whom we might be at peace . It is true we should have an inland communication , but none of the productions we get from those States , would bear the heavy expense of transporting ; at any rate , the cost would be greater than the freight and insurance upon transporting goods to and from Europe . The same would apply to most of the articles we send from hence to the Southern /z/ States . If it is wise , therefore , to lessen or destroy our foreign trade , on account of any interruptions it may be liable to by war , it would be equally wise to prohibit all intercourse between those sections of the United States , which may be exposed to the same hazards . Indeed , to carry out this principle of independence , and to have the full advantage of it , we should extend it to the intercourse between towns , families and individuals , and to enjoy the full value of the blessing , we must go back to that independent state , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink him to a level with the brute . So far , however , is this voluntary commercial dependance from being injurious , that it not only increases our means of being independent , but serves , like the intercourse between the various sections of our own country , as a bond of amity , which is the more likely to be lasting , because of the mutual advantages it confers . The prevention of our trade with Europe , for the sake of making certain goods at home , at double what they would cost abroad , is just as impolitic , as if New England , being a sovereign State , should , in order to preserve what is called her independence , compel her inhabitants to pay 10 dollars for a barrel of New . England flour , which could be had in Virginia for 5 dollars . Under such a system , we should be independent on Southern supplies , but the loss to New England would be $5,000,000 , $7,000,000 or $ 10,000,000 , as might be , for each year . And this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national independence . It is , in fact , lessening our means of support , in order that we may be more independent . Can any thing be more irrational or more preposterous ? SECTION 13 . The balance of trade , by which our opponents mean the gain or loss we sustain in our foreign trade , is one of those miserable and exploded errors of the mercantile system , which having long since been banished from every enlightened mind , has like many similar delusions , been revived among us , to work upon the prejudices of the nation , and reconcile them to the prohibitory manufacturing policy ; as it was formerly , to build up commercial monopolies . " The foreign commerce of the country , " says Mr. Clay in one of his speeches , " from some causes , some of which I have endeavoured to point out , has been extended as far as it can be . And I think there can be but little doubt , that the balance of trade is , and has been for some time past against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Massachusetts , ( Mr. Webster , of Boston , ) rejecting as a detected and exploded fallacy , the idea of a balance of trade . I have not time nor inclination to discuss that topic now . " It is with much surprise , and still greater regret , we see men of Mr. Clay 's knowledge and powers of mind , defending such " exploded fallacies . " It is the currency these errors derive from such names , which has compelled the committee to go into explanations upon many points so familiar to an intelligent mercantile community like this , as to appear quite superfluous . /z/ There are three circumstances , chiefly relied upon , to show which way the balance of trade lies . 1st . The course of exchange . 2d . Debts due to foreign countries . 3d . The Custom House returns of exports and imports . 1st . If the premium on bills on any particular country is high , it is inferred that the balance of trade is against us , or that we lose in our transactions with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing else , depends upon the supply and demand , and those again are affected by the import and export trade , between the two countries , making these negotiations , and by other circumstances also ; but the premium or discount on bills , can not much exceed the trouble and expense of transmitting coin , for which indeed they are a substitute . When the rate rises beyond that , the merchant who has debts to pay , or goods to purchase , will send gold or silver . On the other hand , should the course of trade lessen the demand for exchange , so as to produce a decline in price , greater than the expense of importing coin , it will be for the interest of the merchant to import his funds in coin , instead of selling bills , and in this way the price is kept , either above or below par , within about such a rate , as will equal the expense of importing or exporting bullion or specie . It is not necessary , however , to do this to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial transactions between us and them nearly balance each other . The exchange on England has for several years past borne a nominal advance of 7 to 12 per cent , averaging perhaps 10 per cent , varying from time to time , according to the course of trade , value of bullion , scarcity of money , &c.; &tc.; ; but the real advance , as we shall hereafter show , is about 2 1-2 per cent. * It is inferred from this premium on bills , that we lose by our trade with England , but nothing can be more false than such a conclusion ; and so would the opposite one be , if it was inferred from our drawing on England at a discount , that we were doing a profitable business . What then does the premium for bills on England indicate ? Why , that funds are wanted in England , where they are accumulated , from the proceeds of cargoes sent to Great Britain , and also from the proceeds of cargoes sold in other parts of the world , and transmitted to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , Russia , China , India , &c.; for various commercial purposes , a portion being retained to pay for importations of British goods . We find it convenient to concentrate our resources in England , as the centre of all our mercantile dealings . If a merchant wanted funds in China or India , he would also have to pay a premium equal to the interest , freight and insurance , or the charges of transmitting specie , which would of course be higher than /z/ the cost of sending to Europe , and yet no one would pretend to decide from that circumstance , upon the profit or loss of those branches of trade . It might be convenient to collect our funds in some place where we neither - purchase or sell any goods , still the owners of those funds would require the current premium , or sell at the current discount , and it certainly could not in that case be said , that the premium or discount on exchange , indicated a balance of trade either for or against us. 2d . Another indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , is the debt we are said to owe to that country , and this is one of the evidences of a balance of trade being against us . That we are much in debt , is evident , says Mr. Niles , " because exchange is 10 per cent against us . " It is not true that exchange is 10 per cent against us , nor has it ever been so . The real advance , as we have before observed , is now about 2 1-2 per cent . It has been occasionally higher , and sometimes , as in 1825 , below par , but only for a short period . If bills were , however , at 20 per cent premium , it would not follow , that we owed money in England , still less would it show that the trade with her was unprofitable . If Great Britain owed us $20,000,000 , there might be such a demand for these funds abroad , as to make them worth a premium ; and on the other hand , if we owed Great Britain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , as to make bills sell at a discount . The course of exchange then , is no certain evidence of the state of debt due to , or from England ; nor would the contracting of debts yearly in England , show that we were doing an unprofitable business . Let us imagine that last year our exports to Great Britain were $40,000,000 , and our imports the same ; then , according to our opponents , we should be doing a saving business . Let us suppose then we export this year $40,000,000 , which produces the same as in the former one , but that we borrow in addition $10,000,000 , and import the amount in merchandize j this would afford evidence according to our opponents , that we were carrying on a losing trade . Why so , we would ask ? Because , say they , we have incurred a debt . That is true , but we have an equivalent in goods , which will at any time enable us to cancel it . Where then is the loss to the nation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of trade against us ? Now if this $10,000,000 borrowed money had been brought home in dollars , an advocate of the " American System " would have admitted that there was no loss to the country . But $10,000,000 in merchandise , may be of as much value as $10,000,000 in specie . The merchant , who knows the wants of the country better than legislators or economists , because it is his business to know them , would bring the specie , if it was more wanted than the merchandise ; but if the specie was less wanted than the merchandise , it would not only be an act of folly on the part of the merchant , but an injury to the nation to import it . /z/ A superfluity of specie is of no more use to a country , than a superfluity of almanacs , except as an article of commerce to send where it is wanted . The U. S. Bank , and other institutions , have occasionally borrowed large sums in England at a lower rate of interest than what could be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2 per cent , by re-loaning . Here is a debt created , but does any one consider that the balance of trade is against them ? The effect of borrowing from a foreign country is the same as that of one state borrowing from another . Ohio sends to New York produce which sells for $2,000,000 , and borrows in addition $2,000,000 more , which is carried back in specie or merchandise , whichever may happen to be most required . Now this to the apprehension of those we are opposing , shows a balance of trade , or an unprofitable business on the part of Ohio ; though with the 2,000,000 dollars of borrowed money she should construct canals , worth to her double the amount . The amount of our debt to England is an indication of the greater demand for capital here , than there . If money can be hired for 3 per cent , in London , and reloaned for 6 per cent , here , then it would be expedient to borrow largely , and we should do so if we had credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest . The fact , however , is , that for some years past , the interest in England , and the charges for effecting loans , would make the rate as high as the value of money here , consequently we can not borrow to any great extent . It is , however , just as advantageous for this country to borrow money in England , if it can be had cheaper than at home , as it is for Ohio to borrow of New York , when she can do so on better terms than of her own citizens . If the effect of this introduction of new capital was to create habits of idleness , and lessen the stimulus to industry , then the result would be injurious , as it might diminish the accumulation of wealth ; but on the other hand , if the effect is to put in motion labour to make public improvements extend trades , manufactures , and agriculture then the result would be beneficial , and increase the accumulation of capital ; and such , in a country like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tendency of creating debts abroad , and thus adding to our own resources . But whether the effect of such operations be injurious or beneficial to those whornake them , it is no concern of Congress , or any other public body , any more than the negotiations of individuals , with our banking institutions , or the lawful operations of a farmer , a mechanic , or a navigator . 3d . The most usual and most imposing method , however , which has been adopted to prove the balance of trade , is by a reference to the Custom House exports and imports . If on examining the trade wilh any particular country , the exports are found to exceed the imports , it is said to be profitable , and on the other hand , if the imports /z/ exceed the exports , it is called a losing trade , and the balance is considered to be against the country . Thus , if we export to Great Britain $ 40,000,000 a year , and import $50,000,000 , we lose $10,000,000 , and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 against sin export of $40,000,000 is a profitable result , or a balance of trade in our favour . Now the most natural inference of an excess of imports over exports is , that the trade is profitable ; as in the case of a merchant who on exporting a cargo of $100,000 receives in return $120,000 , we should imagine there was a gain of $20,000 ; but this would not necessarily be the case , because his homeward investment might have been made up from other sources , than the avails of his outward adventure . So if we import $50,000,000 from England against $40,000,000 export , $10,000,000 of the import may have been transferred from some other quarter , in which case there would be no gain or loss ; but if we imagine $15,000,000 had been transferred from other quarters , to make up the $50,000,000 import , than there would be a loss of $5,000,000 . It requires very little reflection to see , that accounts made up without any reference to other circumstances beyond the amount of exports and imports , afford no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another . We may take the China trade , as illustrating in a remarkable manner , the incorrectness of this mode of ascertaining the balance of trade . A reference to the Custom House records , from the origin of this trade , might perhaps show an export of $80,000,000 and returns to the amount of $160,000,000 ; now according to the notions against which we are contending , this would exhibit a most disastrous result , a loss of $80,000,000 ; but the more reasonable inference it affords , would be a profit of $80,000,000 , and yet that in fact , would not be true , for on inquiry it might be found that $40,000,000 had been added to the $80,000,000 shipped from hence , from funds furnished by indirect voyages to Europe , South America , the N. W. Coast , &c.; &c.; which would reduce the profits to $40,000,000 . That this commerce has been profitable no one can doubt , who is acquainted with the men who pursue it , and the fortunes they have acquired , yet there are no documents by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even nearly to what extent , since the operations are so complicated , as to confound any attempt to separate the profits which belong to the China trade , from other branches connected with it , nor is it of any importance to ascertain that point , since those who are engaged in it find it lucrative , and when it ceases to be so to them , it will cease to be so to the country ; and the merchants who carry it on , will discontinue it , without the interference or advice of politicians or legislators . Although this branch of commerce , with others which are immediately connected with it , has probably added as much to our national wealth as any in which we have been engaged , except with Great Britain , yet owing to the erroneous notions of balance of trade , and /z/ the prejudice against exporting specie , which is equally unfounded , it has always been assailed by the anti-commercial , non-importation party , as a most ruinous and unpatriotic trade , and would long since have been restricted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevailed . Although it is impossible then , from such evidence as may be within the reach of any one , to ascertain the profit or loss of particular branches of trade , yet all will agree , that taking a course of years together , the excess or diminution of imports as compared with exports , will afford some general notion , though not a very accurate one , ol the results of the foreign trade of the country . The imports will generally be equal to the exports , with the freight and other charges , together with the ordinary profits of business , and if this sum exceeds the exports , the inference is , that the foreign trade of the country is profitable ; but our opponents would from this fact draw the opposite conclusion , and affirm the balance of trade is against us . This conclusion is now , by all practical men , admitted to be so erroneous , and so much at war with common sense , that the partisans of this obsolete doctrine are obliged to sustain it , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which their cause rests , by assumptions , which they have not proved . They affirm , that in order to make up the excess of importations , we are obliged to send abroad " all our gold and a great part of our silver , " and " a very large amount of our public and private securities , " and thus the country is mortgaged for their payment . That we may not be accused of exaggeration , we will let them state their own case . " It may be a matter of surprise , " say the Pennsylvania Society , " to many unacquainted with the subject , how our immense importations have been paid for . To this we answer , that a very large amount of our public securities has been remitted abroad for that purpose , and thus the country mortgaged for their payment . " From Mr. Lawrence 's Speech , we extract the following : " How did we pay for this immense import ? As far as we could by our Southern staples ; for the balance , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gold and a great part of our silver , has been carried to England to pay for British manufactures . " Now what are the facts ? On turning to the export of gold for 1825 , ( which is the first year a separate return has been made for that article , distinct from silver ) we find the whole amount exported to be only $315,672 , and our import $529,277 . To Great Britain not one ounce of gold was sent , but we imported from there $2,772 . The whole export of gold for 1S26 was $450,203 , and the import $116,194 . Of the export of gold $17,271 went to Great Britain , and $4,360 was imported from Great Britain . The remainder of the gold for 1825 and 1826 , went principally to Cuba and other Spanish countries , and was chiefly in doubloons , that being the coin which will make the most profitable remittance . The /z/ amount of silver exported to Great Britain in 1825 and 1S26 was $858,528 , and amount imported $199,954 . The export of gold and silver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the import to $441,149 . How does this statement compare with the assertions of our opponents , who say , that " all our gold and greater part of our silver , has been carried to England to pay lor British manufactures . " And what if it was true , that all our importations were paid for in gold and silver ? It would be no evidence that the trade was not profitable . It would only show , that those articles of merchandise , like cotton and tobacco , were worth more in England than here . Our imports from Java , Sumatra , Bengal , &c.; are paid for in silver , but is there any one in this community so unenlightened as to say those branches of commerce are not profitable ? We are surprised to find practical men falling into such errors of fact and reasoning . But an exaggerated statement of the exportation of specie to England , has been one of the methods adopted by our opponents to excite a prejudice against our trade witlf a country , which by the produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic labour and capital that theivoollen manufactures c/o , and without imposing a heavy taxation on the nation . But it is a commerce which stands in the way of the woollen manufacturers , and it must be destroyed . It appears by the Custom House returns , we send more than thirty times the gold to Cuba and South America , that we do to Great Britain , but we hear no complaints from the advocates of the " American System , " against this commerce . There are no woollen manufacturers in that quarter , to ruin the inhabitants of this country , with their cheap fabrics . Let us now examine the other assertion , as to the remittance of public securities , in payment for imports . It is only since the " American System " originated , that this objection to our trade with England was started . In the first place , the national debt , which constitutes the principal item , was much of it contracted during our Revolution , by Government , and has eince'been increased by various negotiations ; for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large portion of which , the government has received the value here in territory . The stock , therefore , issued for such debts , must not be set down as remittances for the purchases of goods , and as a part of the mercantile debt . In the next place , our public debt abroad , instead of increasing , as our opponents would have it inferred , is constantly diminishing . It appears from official documents , that in 1803 , there was due to foreigners , of funded debt of the United States , $32,119,210 . On the 1st January , ISIS , it had been reduced to $25,444,049 . On the 1st October , 1826 , it was $21,520,695 , and is at this time something less than $20,000,000 . It would seem , then , that so far as regards the national securities , we have been paying debts , instead of contracting them ; and how has this been done , but by remittances of merchandise ? It should be /z/ observed , also , that of the $20,000,000 due in Europe , a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is within the knowledge of this committee that near $1,000,000 is the property of some citizens of Philadelphia . There are , however , as our opponents truly assert , other stocks which have been sent abroad as remittances to purchase goods . They consist chiefly of U. S Bank Stocks , New York Canal Loans , and the stocks of some of the banks in New York city . The committee have made inquiries in various quarters , but can not obtain any precise information as to their amount , but we have reason to believe it does not exceed $8,000,000 . Of the ( private ) individual debts , such as will ever be paid , we do not believe the amount can be large , because there can be no inducement to borrow . We think they can hardly exceed the balances which are usually due to our merchants from bankers and commission agents ; but let us however admit that they may amount to $2,000,000 and the other stocks to $10,000,000 instead of $8,000,000 , making $12,000,000 . Now this is nothing near the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our government . This estimate , which we believe rather an uncler-statement of our own case , shows how entirely groundless are the declarations of the non-importation party , that immense sums in public securities are sent abroad , and that we are mortgaging the , country inpayment for British goods . Let us now turn to the other side of the account , and examine the balance in our favour . The committee have no means of ascertaining for the whole period of time , since the adoption of the constitution , the excess of imports over exports . They find , however , in Pitkin , that from 1795 to 1801 , seven years , the average was over $14,000,000 . From that period down to 1812 , they might have been greater and since then , less but it would probably be within bounds to call the whole $400,000,000 , which may be considered the national gain , on the mere transport oj our export produce . We admit that this is not a very accurate method of estimating this result , but it is sufficiently so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents of the balance of trade being against us , can be refuted upon their own principles , taking the facts as they really are , and not their incorrect assumptions . But the view we have given of the balance of trade , affords a very limited and inadequate idea of the benefits of foreign commerce . It is only one item in the account , to which must be added the profits on the returns of our exports , and the advantages which the agriculturist , the mechanic , the labourer , the capitalist , the navigator , the merchant , as well as the citizens at large , derive from the production and transportation of this immense amount of property , shipped to foreign countries . Of the pecuniary amount , it is so blended with other interests , that it is impossible to form any estimate , but one must be blind not to see its results , in the various improvements of Ill all the great branches of industry connected with , and dependant on trade in the erection of towns and cities the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercantile classes and the many other forms in which wealth displays itself , not the least imposing of which , are those extensive manufacturing establishments , which are mostly founded on the gains of foreign commerce . It is true , that the quantity exported of many of the great staples of the country , flour for instance , compared with the consumption , is small , but the means of disposing of this excess , has a very important bearing on the condition of the farmer , as in years of abundance , without a foreign outlet , the prices would be ruinously low , and such as to hold out no encouragement to his industry . An export of 500,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of flour , raises the value of the whole crop of 12,000,000 barrels , or whatever may be our annual production of that article , 25 or 50 per cent , and without imposing any tax upon the nation . Now the inevitable effect of the non-importation system , is a non-exportation of our produce , since foreign nations on whom we now depend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse their produce and manufactures , which is all they can give us in payment . All classes must suffer by the prohibitory system , but the evils of it will press with most severity upon the agriculturists . The truth is , and it must be obvious to every reflecting mind , that there is no such thing as a balance of trade against one nation , in its dealings with another . The supposition involves a manifest absurdity . Commerce is not a game by which one party loses what the other party wins ; many individuals engaged in it may suffer , and others may be ruined , but as a class , the merchants and traders will gain , as will the nation which they represent . The balance is in favour of every country . Mutual wants and mutual benefits , constitute the very essence of commerce , and when it ceases to have that character , it must cease to exist . Foreign trade like the home trade , from which it differs only in extent , not in its effects , is advantageous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when forced out of its natural channels by legislative bounties and restraints , that it ceases to be otherwise . The balance of trade may truly be said to be against a nation , which imposes such restrictions as to lessen or destroy that trade it affects to promote ; and of this we have a striking instance in the woollens duty , which levies on the nation a tax of $23,940,000 a year , without even ( if we credit the statements which are published ) saving those from ruin , in whose Aivour it is established . SECTION 14th . The premium paid for bills on England , and remittances of specie , and public securities abroad , to pay for our importations from England , are sources of dissatisfaction to the opponents of free trade , and held to be certain indications of the evils of foreign commerce . " In the mean time , " says Mr. Clay in one of his speeches , " there will be an export of the precious metals , to the /z/ deep injury of internal trade an unfavourable state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , debt , mortgages . " Mr. Niles and others , call the exchange on England 10 per cent , against us , and they consider the premium paid on bills as so much lost to the nation . The nominal rate is at this moment 1 1 per cent. , but 10 per cent , is perhaps the average rale for three years past . This nominal advance of 10 per cent , is made up principally by the difference between the estimate of silver here and in England . We put a higher value on it than they do in England , as compared with gold , which is their only standard of value . With us , the standard of value , is both gold and silver , but as our estimate of the former in relation to the latter , is lower than it is in Great Britain and some other countries , the gold is sent abroad as an article of merchandise , while the silver remains at home , to such an extent as is required for our circulating medium . If our standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if gold and silver bore the same relation to each other here , as they do in countries to which we send gold , then we should retain at home gold as well as silver , but while there is the difference which now exists , the gold from our mint would all be exported , or nearly all , if we coined ten times the amount we now do . On the other hand , there are some countries , particularly most parts of Asia , where the estimate of silver as compared with gold , is higher than it is here , and to those nations we send silver . The price of silver in England , like other merchandise , fluctuates , though not to the same extent ; at the last quotation it was worth 4 shillings , 9 and 3 farthings an ounce for Spanish dollars , making a dollar worth 92* 47-100ths. as compared with 100 here , or a difference of 7 1-2 per cent . The true par of exchange then upon London , is 7 1-2 per cent , advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our silver currency with which we purchase bills on England , is a depreciated one , compared with the English , of 7 1-2 per cent . A bill-holder then , who sells at 10 per cent , premium , gets an advance , or a premium of2 1-2 per cent. , which is rather less than it would cost to transmit dollars at this moment . The premium for bills on Hamburg and Holland , from whence we import few goods , is also from 2 to 3 per cent .. , and on France the same . But if we suppose the real advance on bills to be 10 per cent. , it would afford no evidence that the foreign trade was unprofitable ; nor is the premium any loss to the nation , since what is paid for the bills goes to augment the proceeds of the shipments , against which they are drawn , making it a mere transfer from one citizen to another . * We have taken the Spanish dollar at the legal value , but as an article of merchandise it fluctuates according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ten years borne a premium of 8 or 9 per cent. , but for some years past , it has varied from 1-2 per cent , to 3 per cent . /z/ Public stocks , and money securities , whether public or private , are sent abroad for sale , or as pledges for loans of money . In the first case , they may be considered as articles of merchandise , and are sent backwards and forwards as they happen to fluctuate in value , in this country or in England , to which they are chiefly sent , on account of the greater value they bear in that country than in any other . When loans are effected on them , they serve a useful purpose , by introducing capital on better terms than it can be hired at home , and instead of showing the unprofitableness of trade , it is a sign of its activity , and that we enjoy a high credit abroad , and are disposed to profit by it . It is surprising that politicians and woollen manufacturers should give themselves any uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be safely trusted to the management of the individuals who are engaged in these operations , and who probably understand their own concerns better than legislators who undertake to direct or controul them . We agree , however , that it would be full as wise and just in Congress to legislate against sending abroad public securities , as it is to legislate in favour of the manufacture of woollens . These are all matters which should be left to individuals ( free from governmental restrictions or bounties ) who in pursuing their own interests , best promote those of the nation . The idea that a free and constant exportation of specie is disadvantageous to a nation , is one of those illusions which has so often been exposed , and so entirely abandoned by men of common intelligence , that we should pass it without any further notice than it has already received , but for the frequency with which it is still alluded to , by members of Congress , members of Woollens Conventions , and writers of all descriptions , on the side of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose opinions are entitled to respect . " The trade with China and East Indies , " says Seybert , " has been uniformly disadvantageous ; and the more so , because our purchases are made almost entirely with specie . " Mr. Carey and others speak of the " uncontrolled importation of foreign goods , as draining us of our circulating medium . " We have already quoted from Mr. Clay 's and Mr. Lawrence 's speeches , passages implying the same opinions . The object in sending gold to England , is the same as sending cotton and tobacco , because it is more valuable there than here . It is sent to Cuba and other countries for the same reason , while on the other hand , we are continually receiving both silver and gold from other countries where they are less valuable than here . We exported in 1826 , of bullion and specie , $4,098,078 , while our import amounted to $G , S80,9GG . In 1825 , our export of the precious metals amounted to $8,797,055. and the import to $6-,150,825 . In 1824 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the import to $8,379,855 . Thus the import and export trade of specie fluctuates like all other branches of commerce , and it is as much an article of merchandise /z/ as coffee or sugar , and as appears to us. it is quite as unnecessary , and as unwise in the legislature to concern themselves about the one , as the other . The merchant , whose business it is to watch the markets , will , for his own interest , import specie when it is wanted , and when it accumulates beyond the wants of the country , he will export it . The comparative scarcity of gold , as we have before remarked , arises from our putting a lower value on it in proportion to silver , than most nations do , with whom we have commercial dealings , and as long as that is the case , it will continue to be shipped abroad , and the circulating medium , supplied almost entirely with silver , as the cheapest of the two metals . If there was any other money more over-valued than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its place occupied with the currency still more depreciated . Where then , we would ask , is the loss or inconvenience to the nation from a free exportation of the precious metals ? The only use we have for them , is a circulating medium , and as a material for manufactures , and any superfluity beyond what is required for those purposes , can be of no more use or benefit to have retained at home , than an excess of tobacco or cotton . So far then is the export of specie from being prejudicial , that it is advantageous to a country . Suppose it had been possible to devise any laws , which could have had the effect of retaining in the country the 150 or 200,000,000 dollars in specie , which have been imported for the last 30 years ; of what use ( beyond the ordinary wants of the country ) would it have been to the nation ? No more than the hoard of a miser , buried a thousand feet under the earth ! It would have been just so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions we are opposing , appear to us to have mistaken an effect for a cause . The abundance of specie in a country , is one of the signs of wealth ; but it is not the cause of it . Our opponents treat this subject as if a country was rich in proportion to the quantity of the precious metals it possessed . Gold and silver are wealth , but not more so than flour , lead , cotton , or any thing else , which has an exchangable value . The specie we may have in our country , is , then , but the consequence of our prosperity , not the cause of it . If not a particle of silver or gold had ever been seen on this continent , we should still have been prosperous and wealthy . There might have been great inconvenience , and some loss , for the want of such a convenient standard of value , but we should have found substitutes , as indeed we now do in paper , which forms nearly the whole of our circulating medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver and gold , as they unquestionably perform a very useful office , in regulating our currency , but we contend that every dollar which is retained at home , beyond what is wanted to keep our currency in a sound state , is just as much loss to the nation , as it would be to an individual to deposit those dollars in his chest , which could be safely loaned on interest . /z/ But is not the country liable to suffer from a scarcity of silver and gold ? No , not more so than from a scarcity of coffee or sugars , and when that difficulty occurs , we shall be relieved by importations , as we are in case of all other articles . Nothing is so easily transferred from one country to another as specie . There is much less danger to be apprehended from an over-export of specie than of iron , and still more corn , as they are both necessaries of life , ( without which we can not well do , ) and a scarcity of the latter would be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ill consequences of want of cheap food . There are substitutes for coin , but none for iron and bread . Now , none of the advocates of the " American System " discover any anxiety to stop the exportation of those necessary productions , those staples of Hie . Why then do they concern themselves about the exportation of silver and gold ? But will not a free exportation of coin , derange and depreciate our paper currency ? No ; a depreciated paper currency will drive coin out of circulation , by creating an anxiety in the holders of the paper , to make an exchange ; while on the other hand , the exportation of that specie has a tendency to restore a currency to a sound state , by checking those overissues which depreciate the currency , by compelling banks to withdraw from circulation , those floods of paper money , those facilities of trade , as they are generally called , but too frequently , ( from the manner in which many of our institutions are managed , ) facilities to commercial gambling , extravagance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the exportation of the precious metals alluded to by Mr. Clay , at the commencement of the section , must not be imputed in any degree to foreign commerce . There has been no such effect experienced from it in this quarter , nor in any of the States from whence those exportations are chiefly made . The expulsion of specie from the Western States , which Mr. Clay may perhaps have had in view , was effected , we apprehend , wholly by " stop laws " and " relief acts , " against which Mr. Clay , to his honour , always contended ; and the want of specie in the inland States , had nothing to do with the export trade of specie from the Atlantic ports . It was a legislative interference between debtor and creditor , by the enacting of laws , which compelled the latter to accept for his demand a depreciated paper , not convertible into money , at least , not into an equivalent for his demand ; a printed rag , and sometimes a worthless one , instead of a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing else which is valuable , if long continued . These laws were considered by such as chose to avail themselves of them , as a " protecting system . " They were founded on the same principles as what is called the " American System ; " the only difference we can perceive , is , that in the former case , there was a sacrifice of the rights of the few , for the benefit of the many , /z/ and in the latter , there is a sacrifice of the rights of the many , for the benefit of the few . " Stop Laws , " " Relief Systems , " and " American Systems , " all spring from the same causes , an ignorance of , or a disregard to individual rights , and should all of them be equally resisted . Perhaps there is nothing which can more strongly show the futility of legislating upon trade , beyond what is really necessary for its safety and protection , than those legal restraints which have been frequently imposed with a view of retaining in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place , it is not in the power of Kings , Congresses , or Parliaments , by any laws which they can contrive , to prevent their exportation . If there was a law , making it death to send it out of this country , the premium for smuggling would not exceed one per cent . In the next , the practical effect of such a law , if it could be enforced , would be to prevent specie from corning here , as it would be in the case of coffee and sugars , were those articles restricted to our consumption ; and thus , instead of having that superabundance of all those commodities which we now have , there would often be a scarcity . These are truths familiar to the minds of practical men in general , and it is time they were so to those legislators , politicians , and manufacturers , who undertake to found new systems of commercial policy . SECTION 15 . We now proceed to the consideration of two other points , frequently urged by our opponents , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of the home market against those interruptions to which our foreign trade is exposed . Again ; the evils we are subjected to , from those irregularities and fluctuations of prices , which our export articles are liable to , in consequence of our dependance on foreign markets . Mr. Clay , in a speech upon the tariff in 1824 , remarks , " the superiority of the home market results , first , from its steadiness and comparative certainty at all times j second , from its greater security ; third , from the creation of reciprocal interests ; arid lastly , from an ultimate and not distant augmentation of consumption , and consequently comfort , from increased quantity , and reduced prices . " These arc great advantages , pointed out by Mr. Clay , as the results of the " American System , " but to our apprehension , the inevitable consequences will be directly the reverse of ivhat he describes . First ; the great superiority of the home market on account of its security , is founded on that extraordinary assumption we have before noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , are those of war , or rumours of war . " Now it appears from the statements of our opponents , which we have given in section 12th , that the greatest inconvenience we have suffered from the interruption of our supplies , " by this ordinary state of war , " since the " landing of our fathers " was the want , during the late war with Great Britain , of 6000 dollars /z/ worth of blankets for the Indians , and they admit that the otily obstacle which stood in the way of obtaining them , was our own laws ! ! If , however , there is any force in this objection to the foreign trade , it applies also to the intercourse which one half of the Union carries on with the other . It must be obvious to every one acquainted with the subject , that it would be as hazardous during a war with Great Britain for the New England and the Middle States to communicate with the Southern sections , as it would for either of the extremities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on goods shipped from Boston or New York to the Southern States generally , would average as high or higher than on goods shipped to those countries in Europe , with whom we might be at peace ; and it would be easier and cheaper to send cotton from Charleston to Havre de Grace , than to Boston . What then should we do with those immense cargoes of domestic produce and manufactures , for the consumption of which we must depend upon the South , or how should we procure from them the materials of which many of these fabrics are made ? We are aware that some articles might be transported by inland conveyances , but the expense would be very great , and such as most of the staples of trade would not bear . Where then is that security of the home trade , against those interruptions which the foreign trade is liable to ? The argument , if it is worth any thing , goes to the expediency of limiting our transactions to those sections of the country with which we can communicate safely , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in case of war with us , can show a flag on the ocean . Now this non-intercourse policy between the extremes of our own country , however much it might be approved of by some of those wild enthusiasts , ( who having no interest in manufactures themselves , seem both ignorant and regardless of the ruin they may bring on others by their unenlightened and ill-directed zeal , ) would not suit the interests of the New Englanders , who must depend mainly on the " plantation States , " for the purchase of their manufactures ; and much more than they do on us for the purchase of their staples , since they would find a market in foreign countries for all they can raise , and procure in exchange a supply of all their wants , on better terms than we now furnish them . We do not mean , however , to deny the general proposition , that the home trade is somewhat more secure from interruption than the foreign trade , nor to underrate the advantages of that security ; but to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to confine our trade within such a limited extent , as not to be affected by a war . But war is not the " ordinary relation of the nations of the world , " and when it does occur , such is the humane and enlightened policy of the age , that belligerent nations themselves are willing to give facilities to an intercourse with each other , /z/ even when it might appear most important to restrain it . Have not our opponents themselves furnished a striking fact , in proof of what we advance in the case of the 6000 dollars worth of woollen blankets , for the want of which we were so much distressed ? Did not our enemy , who came to our shores to distress and destroy us , and who must have been acquainted with the dangerous emergency to which we were driven , freely offer us all the supplies of which we were in want ? Even Buonaparte , who is held up by Professor List , * and some others , as a patron of the anti-commercial and restrictive policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour , granted licences to carry wheat from his empire to Great Britain , when the latter was in danger of a famine . Not so much perhaps to indulge his benevolent feelings towards those islanders , as from a desire to fill his own treasury ; well knowing , such is the nature of trade , that although he might withhold supplies , they could be obtained from other nations , and even from his own subjects , thus , besides failing to ruin his enemy , he would suffer the loss of so much revenue . Could we , however , anticipate frequent wars with England , the only nation that can interfere with our trade , and were we certain she would depart from her accustomed wise policy of allowing commercial intercourse to go on with her enemy , we should soon be in a condition ( if commerce is not legislated out of existence by our " protecting system , " ) if not to dispute the supremacy of our rival on the ocean , at least to keep open sufficient channels of communication with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils incident to a war with her . Second . With regard to the irregularity and unsteadiness of prices in consequence of our reliance on the foreign trade , referred to by * The following are extracts of a series of letters upon " cosmo-polUical economy , " by Professor List , introduced to the putlic with high commendations , by Mr. C. J. Ingcrsoll , one of the promoters of , and delegates to the Harrisburg Convention . " The object of the economy of mankind , or to express it more properly , of cosmo-political economy , is to secure to the whole human race , the greatest quantity of the necessities and comforts of life . " Here is one of the definitions of " cosmo-political economy , " by one of the most learned defenders of the " American System , " and we shall now give the Professor 's remarks upon one of the greatest advocates of the restrictive system , and who carried the principles into full operation . " I saw then in my native country , ( Germany , ) the admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destroying effects of the return of what they call trade , after the downlal of INapoleon . " Again ; " Napoleon would have been very willing to charge himself with the trouble of uniting the whole surface of the earth , and to procure to the human race the blessings of a general free intercourse , but the English , it seems , did not like the prospects of such a general happiness . So the Americans , I suppose , would never like to exchange their national independence and power for a general law of nations founded upon . English power ; they would not like the prospect . It seems , therefore , cosmo-political institutions , like those of free trade , are not yet ripe for being introduced into practice . " Whether the " cosmo-polilical institutions , " to which this ingenious writer alludes , are fully ripened or not , is beyond our understandings to judge , not knowing exactly what they are , but we apprehend that we have all seen enough of Napoleon 's " cosmo-political systems , " and " continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we hope the time is not far distant , when the principles of the " American System " will be as well understood , and as justly estimated . /z/ Mr. Clay , we quote from Mr. Niles , among other similar complaints , the following statement , to prove the existence of those evils . " To show the ruinous effects that follow trade with Great Britain , because of the irregularity in the markets of that country and our own , and which , by building up the " American System , " we desire mainly to guard against take these items : In 1825. we imported British goods to the value of $36,713,000 . In 1826 , do . d &; $26,131,000 . Difference , $10,582,000 . In 1825 , the cotton , tobacco , rice and indigo exported to the United Kingdom , was valued at $33,042,000 . In 1826 , do . do . $18,871,000 . Difference , $14,171,000 . Who can calculate the distress and destruction , caused to the planters of the south and manufacturers of the east , middle and west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and materials , because of such enormous fluctuations in the value or amount of articles exported or imported ? " The " irregularity " in the imports , or falling off in 1826 , is owing to a very natural cause the operation of the heavy duties imposed on the staple fabrics of England by the Tariff of 1824 . This will appear more evident by some statements we shall hereafter exhibit ; but we are entirely at a loss to comprehend how the " manufacturers of the east , &c."; can be distressed by this diminution in the imports of foreign goods , of which they have heretofore made so many complaints . We apprehend then it must be the consumers , to whom Mr. Niles refers this part of the distress must fall on them . The falling off in our exports to England was occasioned in part by the decrease of our imports , which of course must lessen the demand abroad for our products ; and partly by a great decline in the price of cotton . Now , without pretending to understand all the meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or being acquainted with all the powers of their new system , we can not conceive how its complete establishment could have prevented the people in England from running mad upon cotton in 1825 , and paying double prices for it ; nor do we perceive that the effect of those ' speculations can be considered a " ruinous irregularity " to this country , or a source of distress to our planters nor if such were the case , in what way those evils could have been prevented by the " American System . " Of the present crop of cotton , 1,000,000 bales , we could not consume more than 200,000 bales if we did not import a yard of cloth the remaining 800,000 bales would go to Europe , and about a similar proportion of the crop of 1825 must have been disposed of in the /z/ same way , and although Congress , according to the doctrines of our opponents , may regulate our own foreign trade in what way they please , it would be impossible for them to exercise the same powers in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would of course affect the prices here in a like proportion . But we will imagine that under the full operation of the " American System " we should retain all our cotton Pt home , and that the planters should limit the cultivation to the home v demand , would that prevent fluctuations of price ? To prevent irregularity in price , the supply and demand must be equal . If our national legislators , who are called upon to direct us where we are to buy our woollens , and to compel us to pay double prices for them , can regulate the produce and consumption of cotton to a single bale , then regularity of prices may be maintained ; but we think this would be difficult . They may , perhaps , under that power in the Constitution for " promoting the general welfare , " prescribe the quantity of land which shall be planted ; but will the product always be equal ? Who can calculate the vicisitudes of the season , or who can guard against them ? Congress then , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to their utmost limits and perfection , will require something greater than even the constructive powers of our constitution the power of controling the operations of nature and the wants of man , and without which , their efforts to regulate prices , will be as futile and preposterous , as their attempts to regulate the manufacture of woollens or any other of the great branches of industry . So far , however , from its being the tendency of a limited and restricted market , to produce regularity of prices , that the very reverse of it has been found , by experience , to be the fact . Restraints upon importation or exportation are ahoays productive of uncertainty and fluctuation in prices ; and perhaps there is nothing which places this truth in a stronger light , than the operation of the British Corn Laws . The supplying of the inhabitants of Great Britain with grain of all descriptions , is guarantied to the landholders of that country , by laws and regulations , founded on the broadest principles of the " American System , " so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seasons of extreme scarcity ; yet so far is the monopoly from having the effect of keeping prices steady , that they have varied extremely even within the compass of the year , and from one season to another , the fluctuations have been from 40 to 50 per cent. , and if we extend the period still further , the variations have been greater than in any other article of merchandise in the history of commerce . On reference to the Parliamentary returns for the last fifteen years , we find wheat has been from 43s. 3d. to 122s. 8d. per quarter ; rye , from 75s. lid . down to 20s. 3d. ; barley , from 21s. 3d. up to 64s. , and other sorts nearly in the same proportion ; and these sudden and enormous fluctuations , are justly considered by the nation , as among /z/ the most pernicious consequences of this restrictive system , and as adding one , to many other strong reasons , for its abandonment . Had the trade in corn been an open one , the fluctuations would have been less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then have been governed by the average rates of grain in this country and on the continent of Europe . So far then , is the " American System " from holding out any prospect of steady prices , that if it ever does get into full operation , we shall see the same effects resulting from it , as the British Corn Laws have produced . The object of the " American System , " as avowed by the Pennsylvania Convention and its other most influential supporters , is " to countervail foreign manufactures in favour of all such as can be made at home . We except none ; " or , as Mr. Everett expresses it , " to enable each article as manufactured at home , to sustain a competition with the same article as imported . " What Mr. Everett really means by such rates as will enable our manufacturers to sustain a competition , we can all understand by his voting for a Tariff , giving 38 to 139 per cent. , and promoting the views of a Convention , which has declared it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be raised 57 1-2 to 281 per cent . " We want , " says Mr. Lawrence , " protection , it matters not whether it was 50 or 150 per cent. , so long as it was protection . " It may perhaps appear , to many of our readers , superfluous to call their attention to this point so often , but we have done so because our opponents are constantly disclaiming in their papers and speeches , any intention of prohibiting foreign goods . If there is , however , any difference in the effects of laws passed avowedly against the importation of foreign goods , and laws which impose such duties , as will prevent their importation , we should be ' glad to see it pointed out by some of the defenders of the " American System . " If we are to take the explanations of the views of our opponents , from Mr. Niles , Mr. Everett , Mr. Carey , and Mr. Lawrence , all of whom were chosen delegates of that Convention , which was assembled to regulate the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation the principles we are opposing , then it is in vain to deny that it is the intention of their party to shut out every foreign article which can be made at home ; and this , having once been accomplished , the system will be must be extended to every production of the country , which the producer may fancy stands in need of protection . Having then arrived at this point , no nation can buy of us what we have to sell , because they can have nothing to pay which we shall be allowed to receive in return , and thus we shall have no foreign markets for our surplus productions . What then will be the condition of the agriculturist who depends for his thrift and even for his support , on the value of his surplus produce ? Every one , having the slightest acquaintance with commerce , must be satisfied that the most trifling excess , if we have no vent for it abroad , /z/ will materially affect the value of the whole crop , while in years of great abundance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not only lose the fruits of his industry , but may find even the bounty of Providence a burden to him . On the other hand , should the crops fall ever so little below the ordinary wants of the country , prices of the necessaries and comforts of life , will be oppressively enhanced to the consumers , without affording a relief to the farmer , since in years of scarcity he can have little to sell . A free export trade then , which we can not have , however , without a free import trade , prevents those irregularities in prices , occasioned by the restrictive policy , and serves to maintain them on that level and moderate footing , which is in the end , most advantageous to all parties . We entreat the farmers the honest yeomanry of the country to look well to the principles of the " American System ; " to examine into its consequences for themselves , and not be deluded by the statements of our opponents , which we have proved in so many instances wholly unworthy of confidence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-importation policy , the cultivators of the soil can not fail of being the greatest sufferers . As a continuance of the Corn Laws is constantly alluded to by our opponents , as not only a proof of the wisdom of the policy they recommend , but as an evidence that Great Britain still upholds the principles of the prohibitory system , we will show , in a few words , the tax which that monopoly imposes upon the British nation , according to the views of the most intelligent writer upon that question in England . The consumption of grain of all sorts , for the United Kingdom , is estimated at 48,000,000 quarters per annum . Now it has been ascertained by an accurate comparison of the prices of grain in England with those on the continent of Europe and America , for the last ten years , that had the British ports been open under a duty of 5 shillings a quarter , the average price of grain in the Kingdom would have been reduced 8 shillings a quarter , below what it has actually sold for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the consumers would have saved 8 shillings a quarter on 48,000,000 quarters grain , or 19,200,000 pound sterling , equal at the present exchange to near $94,000,000 , which for the whole ten years amounts to $940,000,000 . Of this immense sum , about one quarter is considered , by some persons , as a real benefit to the landlords , who own the soil . The other three quarters are entirely sunk by the increased expenses attending the management of the bad soils , which are forced into cultivation by this enormous bounty on grain . The farmers who hire the land , and the labourers who work upon it , can not benefit by this monopoly , since the rent is advanced in proportion to the enhanced value of the produce ; in that respect they are in the situation of the workmen and labourers in our manufacturing establishments . Tariffs and monopolies can not help them , since their /z/ wages are regulated by the average rates of other labour , which they must have , whether their employers make or lose . Thus if we suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures , 95,000 are workmen on mere wages , and 5,000 are proprietors , the last are the only ones who have an interest in promoting the " American System . " The 95,000 gain a support , and it would no doubt be a source of inconvenience and loss to them to be turned away from their accustomed occupation ; but three quarters succeeded very well under the 5 per cent , duty , and the others would not long be idle for want of employment . What then is the effect of the corn monopoly in England ? It lessens in ten years the accumulation of national wealth $705,000,000 , without giving any more employment to domestic labour and capital than would have found occupation , had the trade been open and corn freely admitted ; on the contrary , the fund on which labour must depend for support being lessened $705,000,000 , the effect of the corn laws has been to diminish the demand for labour . Had the ports been open , there would have been fewer labourers engaged in agriculture , but there would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing , to supply the increased demand for British fabrics , which the import of corn would have occasioned , and also from the increased means of the British consumers to pay for them . It is evident that the land-holders are the only persons who can be benefitted by the corn monopoly , and it is contended by the most sensible writers , that they would save as much by the reduction of the poor rates , and other taxes which press heavily on them , and by their share of the general benefits , which would result from a more liberal system , as they now gain from a continuance of the corn laws . Here then is another illustration of one of the injurious effects of the prohibitory system , on the welfare of a nation , and resembling in a pecuniary point of view , the burden imposed upon us by the woollens tax . The corn monopoly levies an annual tax on the British nation of $94.000,000 , one quarter of which , is supposed by those who take the most favourable view of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , if we can import goods 38 per cent , cheaper than we can make them , ( and it is contended by our opponents that we can do so SO per cent , cheaper ) imposes a tax of $27.360,000 per annum , of which $3,420,000 goes to the nation for revenue , being the amount of duty on what goods are imported , and the residue , $23,940,000 , is so much bounty to the manufacturers , without however , as is contended , affording them the ordinary profits of business , and is consequently just so much diminution of capital ; and would amount in ten years to $239,400,000 . The corn tax , at the first view , appears the most burdensome , but when it is considered that Great Britain has 22.000,000 people against our 12,000,000 , and probably five or sis times our wealth , our opponents may truly say , that although the " American System 1 " /z/ is not yet in full operation , we have already rivalled the English , ( whose exploded principles we are now adopting , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far however are the Corn laws from finding any advocates in England , except among those who imagine themselves immediately benefited by them , that no statesman or writer of any reputation has for a long time been a supporter of the principles on which they are founded . The only tenable ground of their defence , urged even by the land-holders , is that from long existence , they have become so much a part of their system , as to affect rents , taxation , &c.; &c.; in such a way as to render their abolition an act of injustice towards them . There has not been , for many years past , much , if any , difference of opinion as to the impolicy of these restraints , though there has been a good deal as to the best method of getting rid of them , with the least injury to those in whose behalf they were enacted . The time has , however , at last arrived , when they can no longer be borne ; and no considerations have prevented the present enlightened ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their known hostility to commercial restrictions , as well as their attachment to the principles of civil and religious freedom , ) from introducing such modifications of those laws , as will mitigate their worst effects ; and , at no very distant day , there will no doubt be such further alterations made , as will render them entirely harmless . It is true , the act has not yet passed , but it is well known that the few individuals , through whose instrumentality it was defeated , now regret the course they took , and avow that they will hereafter give all their aid for its enactment . But we are told by Mr. Clay , that " another result of the ' American System , ' will be the creation of reciprocal interests . " We can not perceive any such tendency in it . Who is there to share with the manufacturers in the advantages of these monopolies ? or how , we would ask , can a course of measures , founded on the most narrow sectional views , and personal interests , adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such consequences ? The more obvious , and as we apprehend , the inevitable effects of this policy , will be mutual disgust and mutual hatred between those who reap the benefits of the system , and those who are the victims of it . Again according to Mr. Clay , we are to have " ultimately , an augmentation of comfort , and consequently , consumption , and reduced prices . To compel the people of this country to pay double prices for many of the first necessaries of life , and at the same time to lower the value of all our surplus produce , by disabling foreign nations from being its purchasers , is a novel and extraordinary method of increasing consumption and comfort , though it must be confessed , it is quite as reasonable a one as many of the expedients , recommended by our opponents , for promoting the general welfare . To equalise the advantages of the " American System " to all /z/ parts of the Union , Congress should grant bounties to all the other great branches of industry ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , 20 dollars a hogshead on tobacco , and 3 cents a pound on cotton , the whole of which would not equal the woollens ( tax the nation now pays . There is not an argument advanced in fa- f vour of the claims of the woollen manufacturers , which could not be urged with much more reason in favour of similar demands on the part of the inhabitants of the " plantation states . " The manufacturers assert , that their goods have fallen since 1816 , and their business is unprofitable . What , pray , is the condition of the tobacco planter , whose staple , except for the finer qualities , has fallen three-fourths in value , since the protecting system was established , and is now hardly worth transporting to the coast or , of the cotton grower , whose produce has declined since 1816 , from 30 to 9 cents a pound ; while the expenses of cultivation , have not been lessened any thing near in the same proportion ? The woollen manufacturers employ 40,000,000 dollars capital , and the wool growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the woollen monopoly , and never will , we think , ) employ 40,000,000 dollars more , three-fourths of which , as well of the manufacturing capital , be it always remembered , was profitably employed under a 5 per cent duty . If we grant , that they do employ 80,000,000 dollars , do not the wheat , tobacco , and cotton planters , employ twenty times as much ? The manufacturers employ 100,000 labourers , we think it probable they do more than that number , but not a man of them would have been idle , if the protecting , system had never been established . On the other hand , ihe cotton " and tobacco planters employ 2,000,000 persons , many of whom could not subsist , even if a check is given to the foreign demand for their staples . There is no principle of reciprocity in the " American System , " whether we view it as bearing on our foreign or our domestic relations certainly not , if we extend it beyond the few states which can profit by this sectional and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the planter of the South , and the farmer of the East , to the merchant , the mechanic , the seaman , and to all classes ; but its evils will press most heavily on those sections of the country , * and * " The burden occasioned by most of the particular duties recommended , would fall on all the community , but chiefly on those least able to bear it . In this country , the poor man personally consumes nearly as much tea , sugar , and coffee , as the rich ; and though his clothing is not so fine , yet its cost constitutes a much greater proportion of his whole expenses . Besides , this new Tariff is so nicely adjusted as to lay a far heavier import on cottons and linens , than on those of finer texture . " This is an extract from the memorial , referred to p.:ge 93 , signed by 27 of our most intelligent citizens , one third of whom were manufacturers at the time they signed it , and a still larger portion at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important article next to bread , then paid 29 per cent the existing duty is 38 per cent and the Harrisburg Tariff calls for 57 1-2 per cent cm fine goods , up to 281 per cent on the coarsest thus acting 1 most fully upon the practical doctrines of our opponents , that the coarser the goods , the higher must be the duty . Again , from the same memorial " But the influence , which has been /z/ that portion of the ' community who are the least prosperous . It will destroy our foreign , diminish our home trade , and finally unsettle the feelings and principles on which the prosperity , peace and union of these States , mainly depend . SECTION 16th . The committee will now proceed to the examination of the notion which is often advanced , and may be still more frequently inferred from the publications of some of the most approved speakers and writers in favour of the non-importation policy , viz. : That the home market will not only furnish a demand for all the produce we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the produce and manufactures of foreign nations , but if due encouragement was given to our own domestic manufactures , we should have a market at home for all our surplus produce . The better to establish this position , our opponents declare that foreign nations will not take our produce to any great extent , partly on account of their restrictive policy , and partly because the consumption of it has already " reached , if not passed its maximum ; " and that consequently we ought no longer to look abroad for a sale of our constantly increasing productions . We are told by Mr. Otis in his Convention speech " Europe will take almost nothing which your soil produces . Imports in the long run can not exceed exports , consequently the latter must decline first in value , by accumulation ; then they will diminish in quantity ; " and Mr. Lawrence , on the same occasion , remarked " Those who opposed the great American System , said we wanted canals and railroads , and internal improvements . He agreed with them ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exports were not one fourth so much as in 1792 ; 629,000 barrels of flour were imported into New England during the last year , most of which were consumed among us ; * the whole export of bread north of the Potomac , was $251 . These were appalling facts , but they were notwithstanding susceptible of proof . " We repeat the remark , that we pursue the plan on which we first commenced , of selecting statements and arguments from the most respectable of our opponents . We have already answered Mr. Otis ' assertion " that Europe will take almost nothing which our soil produces , " by proving from the Custom House reports , that in 1825 , we exported of domestic pro duce $66,944,745 , of which , at least $50,000,000 went to Europe , and the same year we exported $32,590,643 foreign produce and manufactures , more beneficial to us than the former exports , because they obtained by the seal ofprirate interest , admonishes us that those whose situation and experience enable them to judge of the operation of this new system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may tend to make its consequences rightly and generally understood . Its avowed object is to direct and control the occupations of men , by granting special privileges to those engaged in particular pursuits . " /z/ employed more labour in transporting backwards and forwards , and were at the same time purchased in exchange for domestic productions . Of the domestic productions exported , $40,372,987 went to Great Britain and her colonies , of which $35,043,466 to Great Britain . We beg the reader to keep this fact in mind relative to the large proportion of our exports to England , because this is a branch of commerce , which our opponents are endeavouring to prejudice the nation against , as injurious to our national welfare . Whatever view we take of the trade with Great Britain , it will be found to be equal in value to two thirds of all the commerce which we carry on with the remaining parts of the whole world ; but it will be impossible for us to retain but a small portion of what we now enjoy , if the system we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect in us to found our reasonings on the exports from the United States in 1825 , because it was one of speculation , and our produce was forced up , as we are told by Mr. Niles , to " a ruinous irregularity of prices , for want of the American System . " We will then take the year 1826 , when there was a reaction which caried back many commodities below their ordinary value . Our export domestic products , amounted in 1826 to $53,055,710 , of which , $25,842,299 went to Great Britain and her colonies , and of foreign articles , were shipped $24,539,612 , amounting in the whole to $77,595,322 . This statement proves how entirely unfounded are the complaints , made by our opponents , against Europeans , and more especially against Great Britain , for taking " nothing almost which our soil produces . " We affirm that every thing which Europe and Great Britain generally furnishes us with , is paid for in the products of our domestic labour , and that we can not have their produce or manufactures on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour into New England , we have no means of inquiring into its correctness , we had supposed the quantity was larger , but it has little or no bearing on this subject . We have already shown that the increased consumption of flour , by the 25,000 persons taken from the agricultural employments and converted into woollen manufacturers by the system of high duties , can not exceed 22,916 barrels for the whole of the United States , of which perhaps half may be in New England , as it is in this quarter , principally , where the woollen manufacturing business has been much extended since 1816 . We come now to Mr. Lawrence 's assertion , that the whole export of bread north of the Potomac in 1826 , was only $251 . Now as bread has never been a leading export from this country , we presume he means bread-stuffs . There is no way of ascertaining exactly where all the bread-stuffs which we export are produced , though it is to be hoped , if these distinctions are to be kept up , that the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ In 1826 , the amount of flour , Indian corn , rye , and other grains used for bread was $5,288,129 , of which , there can be no question , that the largest portion was raised north of the Potomac . The amount of bread was a little over one quarter of a million of dollars . The export of bread and bread-stuffs in 1825 , was $5,510,223 . We are aware that New England herself furnishes a very small portion of the agricultural exports from the United States , because we are a manufacturing , navigating , and commercial people , and depend on importations from the southern and middle states , for our own consumption ; but this is nothing new , and has nothing hardly to do with the " protecting system , " as we pursued these occupations to almost the extent we now do , in proportion to our population , thirty or forty years ago ; and in regard to the importation of flour from the southern states , we contend that if the Tariffof 1816 had never passed , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually imported , since our commercial capital would have been greater. * The complaints made by New Englanders that Great Britain would not buy our bread-stuffs are absurd , since if she offered $5 a barrel bounty , not a pound could go from any state north of the Hudson . But it is a miserable notion to entertain , that because we have no agricultural staples to export , we do not participate with the southern and middle states , in the advantages of their export trade , since it is the transportation and the proceeds of their produce , which is the main support of our commerce , navigation , fisheries , mechanic arts , and manufactures . Again ; we are told by Mr. Lawrence , that our exports are not one fourth so much as in 1792 . This assertion is so much at variance with facts , ( which must , we should think , be familiar to a gentleman so well known for his information and intelligence , ) that we apprehended at first it must be a mistake , or refer to something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration as it now stands , conveys no other idea than the one we attach to it . If it was a mistake , it should have been corrected . On turning to Pitkin , the committee find the whole exports for 1792 were $20,715,098 , ( domestic and foreign , ) there being at that time no separate return . In 1825 we exported $99,535,388 , and in 1826 , $77,595,322 , which is , on the average , more than four times as much as in 1792 . We lament to see such erroneous statements as these and others , which we have commented upon , circulated by men , in whose information and correctness the community place so much reliance ; it is by such mistakes , that the delusion now existing with regard to the " American System , " as it is termed , is supported . We agree , however , with our opponents , that although our exports are still large , particularly when compared with these of 1792 , yet /z/ when contrasted with a later period , they are otherwise . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1796 to 1811 , excluding two years of embargo , averaged $76,335,539 . Our population within those periods of time , was 4,500,000 to 7,500,000 , and we did not possess one third of the wealth we now do . Our exports for the last six years , excluding the speculative year of 1825 , were on the average $73,083,137 . Now , taking our population at 12,000,000 , and estimating our wealth at more than double what it was 25 years since , we ought at this time to export at least 120 to 130,000,000 dollars . It will , however , be said , that many nations , for whom we acted as carriers , during the wars they were engaged in , now have shipping of their own . This is true in some degree , but not to the extent generally imagined . Some of those nations who forty years ago almost rivalled the English in their foreign trade , scarcely now show a flag upon the ocean . Holland has very little shipping , and the Baltic powers still less ; while the Mediterranean states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed a considerable quantity of shipping , have entirely withdrawn from foreign commerce . Portugal has still considerable shipping , but it is diminishing ; while the trade of Spain , except between Cuba and the mother country , is annihilated . France , of all the European nations , has , next to Great Britain , the greatest resources of all kinds , to make her a commercial nation , yet her foreign trade is very insignificant compared with England or with this country . It is stated in the Journal of Commerce , published in Paris , that for six months , ending 30th June , 1827 , " there were 626 foreign vessels entered , of which 197 were from the United States , 37 from Hayti , and 219 from the French colonies . French vessels expedited , 391 ; of which 251 to French colonies , 30 to Hayti , and 8 to the United States . " We can not from such a statement ascertain exactly the extent of their shipping engaged in foreign trade , but it may be within bounds to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is owned in Massachusetts , which amounted , according to the last returns , to 352,442 tons . It would appear then , that the United States and Great Britain share , almost without a competitor , the foreign trade of the world , and in the contest between this country and Great Britain , every thing but their superiority of capital , is in our favour . That we navigate cheaper than they can , is evinced from their having almost entirely withdrawn from transporting our produce to their own markets . It will be seen , on reference to official documents , that of $40,372,987 exported to Great Britain and her colonies in 1825 , five-sixths went in American ships r and about the same proportion in 1826 ; while of the imports into the United States , amounting in 1825 to $96,340,075 , only $4,437,563 was in foreign ships . Of the imports of 1826 , amounting to $84,974,477 , $4,196,357 was in foreign ships . It must then be evident , to every one conversant with the subject , that our enjoying so large a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense quantities of goods we transport for other nations , ( while our ports are open to our commercial rivals on the same terms as to our own citizens , ) affords conclusive evidence that we under-carry all other nations . What then is the reason that both our tonnage and exports have decreased in amount the last fifteen years ? Our average exports for the last six years , excluding 1825 , are $3,252,402 less than the average of 1796 to 1811 , excluding two years of embargo . Our tonnage in 1810 , was 1,428,728 ; in 1820 , it amounted to 1,452,598 tons , and in 1826 , to 1,423,111 tons . We answer , that the demand for our produce has been lessened by our prohibitory system , which , by excluding foreign manufactures and produce , has diminished the means of our customers to buy of us , and this has operated to reduce our tonnage . Had we continued to act upon the free trade system , which we found from 30 years ' experience to be so beneficial , there is reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter to a third more than they now are , and that our tonnage would have increased in the same proportion . Our opponents tell us in answer to these complaints , that we can not , after all , prove much diminution of tonnage or exports for the last 15 or 20 years , and therefore the shipping and commercial interests must be prosperous . We reply , that in a country which has doubled its population , and more than doubled its wealth within twenty-five years , a branch of business which is stationary at best , can not be said to be prosperous . They do not reason in this way in their own case . They complain of a want of encouragement to woollen manufactures , while they admit they have increased in ten years from 10 to 40,000,000 dollars . The facts we state with regard to our commerce and navigation , are within the reach of every one , and can not be disputed ; it is therefore in vain for the advocates of the prohibitory policy to dany that its effects have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the agricultural interests . Are we not told by Mr. Otis , in his Convention speech , " that exports in the long run can not exceed imports " ? Nothing can be more true , and the converse of that proposition is equally so , exports can not long exceed imports . If we refuse to receive from foreign nations what they have to exchange , they can not receive from us what we wish to dispose of . This is not a matter of choice with those who trade with us ; our refusal to barter the produce of our soil , for such articles as they have to give , isill compel them to resort to those countries where such exchanges will be made . The effect of this artificial system this regulating trade by legislative restrictions and prohibitions , and in a manner frustrating the benevolent intentions of Providence , who has /z/ given to nations various wants , and various means of satisfying them , by an interchange of those commodities which might be most suitable to the circumstances of each to supply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonds of interest and friendship is strongly illustrated by the existing state of the trade between France and England . A reference to the British official statement of exports and imports for 1825 , shows an export from Great Britain to France of $5,730,183 , and an import from France to Great Britain , of $8,844,509 . We here have another remarkable result of the exclusive and prohibitory system , operating upon the commerce of the two most intelligent and wealthy nations of the old world , and placed within sight of each other . France has various commodities which England wants , while England has manufactures and colonial produce which would be equally desirable to France ; but the latter country , hampered by that restrictive policy , which was established in those unenlightened ages , when it was thought patriotic and beneficial finds itself compelled as it were , against the opinions of her wisest statesmen and economists , to decline the offers made by Great Britain , for the mutual abandonment of those restrictions which now operate so injuriously to the welfare of both . Could those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would desire , were they relieved from those impediments growing out of former laws , there would probably be an exchange , if we may judge from their riches , diversity of productions and vicinity , of at least ten times the amount of their present transactions , and both would experience an increase of happiness and wealth . We will now select an instance to show the effects of a more liberal and wise system . In the same year we have referred to , the exports from Great Britain to the Netherlands , amounted to $22,137,411 , and the imports from thence into Great Britain , $9,497,846 . What a contrast does this comparison present ! The Netherlands with a population of about one-sixth of that of France , has double the trade with a nation whose commercial intercourse is more valuable than that of any other , because of her great consumption and wealth , which enables her to make those large exchanges of merchandise , which render trade beneficial . We should think no statesman having the good of his country at heart , and who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare them with the results of the opposite one , would ever become the advocate of the former ; yet we are called upon by Mr. Otis to imitate the commercial policy of France , though reprobated by the . most intelligent men in that country , theoretical and practical , and apologised for by those who venture to uphold it , as a system forced upon the nation by the ignorance of their ancestors . We have remarked that one means resorted to by the supporters of the exclusive and non-importation policy , to bring the nation to /z/ their views , was to represent the foreign demand for our produce , as having already reached its maximum , and that it is unwise to depend on foreign nations for its consumption . We extract the following from a speech made by Mr. Clay , on a proposed alteration of the Tariff in 1820 : " Nothing is more uncertain than the pursuits of agriculture , when we mainly rely on foreign markets for the sale of its surplus produce . " We say nothing is more true than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home market for the sale of its surplus produce , will always be subject to great fluctuations andlow prices , since there will be no vent for that surplus produce , which constitutes the income of a nation , and the only preventive of those evils is a free trade . Again observes Mr. Clay on the same occasion " We had reached the maximum of foreign demand , for our three great staples , cotton , tobacco , flour , and no man will contend , that we should go on to produce more and more , to be sent to the glutted foreign markets , and consumed by devouring expenses , to give employment to our tonnage and foreign commerce . It would be extremely unwise to accommodate our industry to produce , not what was wanted abroad , but cargoes for our unemployed ships . " We can not perceive that bad markets abroad , or low freights , afford any argument for the establishment of a system , which must injure branches of business , which Mr. Clay admits , are already too much depressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed ships ? These are the private concerns of the merchant and the ship owner , and no more subjects for legislation than the common operations of the farmer or mechanic . The facts , however , adduced by Mr. Clay , to show the expediency of prohibitory duties , prove , beyond all doubt , that they are wholly unnecessary , even for the purposes of the manufacturers . If it is true that foreign markets are glutted with our staples , and we have reached the maximum of foreign demand for them , then it is certain that we shall no longer have the means of importing foreign articles , and the domestic manufacturers would be secure against all foreign competition without the aid of those bounties which they now demand . As the demand for our staples had not however ceased at the time Mr. Clay was speaking , he must have had the future in view , but it seems to us unwise to legislate the nation out of a profitable trade , because it may be affected by events which no human mind can foresee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition ? If statesmen and legislators are to be governed by their imaginations , instead of exercising a sound judgment , and will found systems on future possibilities , there is no end to the injuries we may sustain from their acts . To suppose that the nations with whom we trade , will hereafter be stationary in population , wealth , and civilization , and consequently have no increasing wants to supply , is , to say the least , a most extravagant and irrational conjecture . Why not imagine what is much /z/ more within the range of probability , that by some tremendous convulsion of nature , the Andes should be thrown into the ocean , and thus interrupt the communication we now have with Asia and South America ? What then ! Could we not have a canal across the isthmus of Darien , a North West passage , or a rail road to the Pacific ? But what if all those projects failed , should we not be deprived of those facilities of conveyance which we now enjoy ? Yes ; it can not be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change , to embarrass and destroy the valuable commerce we now carry on with those extensive regions ? Who can say what is now the maximum of consumption , and still less , what it will be hereafter ? In 1820 , the demand abroad for flour may have been limited , but a few weeks drought in South America , or three or four days bad weather in England at a critical period of their crops , would create a greater demand for bread-stuffs , than we can usually supply . But perhaps nothing can show in a more impressive manner the inexpediency of legislating on the future , than what has actually occurred sfnce Mr. Clay 's prediction in 1820 , " that our cotton had reached its maximum of foreign demand . " We have before us a statement of the crop ending 30th of Sept. 1820 , making it 453,588 bales ; and another for the year 1821 , when the crop was 472,000 bales , each weighing perhaps on the average , 300 pounds . The exports from our cotton ports , the year ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 340 Ibs. per bale , or 329,800,000 pounds , against 136,076,400 pounds , the crop of 1820 . It is contended by our opponents , that part of this increased consumption , has been occasioned by the prohibitory system , which they are advocating ; but it must be evident to every reflecting mind , that the effect of our high duties has not been to increase the consumption , since the same cotton worked up here , would have been manufactured in Europe , had we made fewer cloths . Indeed there would have been a greater quantity consumed , since had the duties remained at 15 per cent on foreign cotton goods , the consumption of cotton fabrics in the United States would have been still greater than it has been , as they would have come cheaper to the consumers . There can be no stronger evidence of this , than the fact of our having imported in 1825 , 11,036,038 dollars worth of cotton goods , which paid 29 per cent , to 100 per cent , duties , averaging perhaps 45 per cent . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enriches the whole Union , more than any article we produce , instead of having reached its maximum of export demand in 1820. has risen from 136,076,400 to 329,800,000 pounds , and so far is there from being any want o/q/
