By Robert Troup Esq . Geneva , N. Y. 8vo , pp. 61. 1821 . IN every state , which is blessed with a liberal and enlightened government , domestic improvement become an object of solicitude , the moment that protection from foreign violence is assured , the personal rights of the citizen protected , and the education of his children guarantied . When these essential points have been gained , the energies of government ought to be directed in improving the cultivation of the soil , in establishing useful manufactures , and extending commerce , internal as well as foreign . The progress of the United States from their infancy to the present time might , perhaps , afford some elucidation of this course . It is not , however , our intention to mark the change which our soil has assumed , since the period of our independence , to advert to our thriving factories , to notice the invention of machines , which have done infinite honor to the mechanical genius of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry and enterprise amongst us . We intend merely to direct the attention of our readers , in pursuance of the allusions to the general subject of internal improvement in a previous number of our review , * to the canals mentioned in the title of this article . It would be a useless attempt to set forth at this day the advantages of canals . They are proved by the experience of every people who possess them , and demonstrated equally by the dingy workshops of Birmingham , and the civic palaces of Amsterdam . Canals destroy monopolies , by bringing remote places into competition ; they give an immediate value to articles , which , from their weight or bulk , were before worthless ; they unite distant places together by a reciprocal interest and an exchange of commodities ; they animate industry , increase population , and thus minister abundantly to the power and happiness of every state . It is in this view , that the duke of Bridgewater may claim the proud honor of having been one of the most munificent benefactors of his country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late as the years 1758-9 . It induced others to follow the example ; and an artificial navigation of three thousand miles now not only contributes most powerfully to the maritime and commercial // Jaa. superiority of England , but afforded its effectual support to a contest , which she waged against all Europe at an unparalleled expense . How much does not the glory of such improvements outshine the lustre of military fame . The canal of Languedoc will consecrate the name of Andt*ossy , * when the fields of Rocroi and Nordlingen are forgotten . The United States have not heel insensible to the value of an easy and rapid inter-communication between the different parts of the union . In a country of limited extent , and especially in one like Great Britain , which is washed on all sides by the ocean , the value of canals is comparatively small ; good roads and water courses serve as a substitute . But in a country of great territorial dimensions , their importance is increased in proportion to their length . The immense inland navigation of Russia is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to resort to a most expensive and circuitous foreign commerce.t In the United States , therefore , such a system must be of infinite advantage ; and it is fortunate that they afford facilities for bringing it into operation , perhaps superior to those possessed by any state in Europe . *jn that admirable Report on Public Roads and Canals , ' which was made in 1807 , in pursuance of a resolution of the senate , by Mr Gallatin , then secretary of the treasury , some of these facilites are stated . By cutting ninety eight miles at different points , an inland transportation is secured along the whole coast from Maine to the extremity of Georgia , protected from the dangers of the ocean , and the attacks of the enemy . The lakes , those great inland seas , afford us opportunities for interior communication enjoyed by no other nation . They wash an extent of frontier second only to our sea-coast . But when we cast our eyes upon the map , and in connexion with these lakes trace the course of the Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson , and their tributary streams , what a glorious field of operation presents itself . The imagination can scarcely do justice to the grandeur and importance of those * We are aware that Riquet is generally considered the author of the canal of Languedoc ; but we believe that the merit of that work is due to Fran*ois Andreossy . He communicated the original project to Riquet , who made use of it at court , and , having secured the work , employed the talent of Andreossy in its execution . See this question discussed in the Hisloire cbs canal dv* midi , par Frcn*ois .6lndreossy , g*n*ral de division , 4*c. chapitre VII . See a General History of Inland iNavigation , by J. Phillips ; sect. 3 . London , 1803. // enterprises which shall unite the waters of the lakes with the waters of the ocean , and convert that immense and fertile country , from the head waters of the Missouri to lake Erie , into the abodes of myriads of freemen , who will owe their existence , as well as their high place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal improvement now projected . Grand as these projects are , the inherent resources of the country are more than sufficient to realize them . For it will be recollected , that the extensive improvements between the great geograpliical divisions ' of the United States , contemplated in that able and luminous report , already alluded to , amounted only to $16,600,000 ; a sum which very little exceeds the receipts into the treasury at Washington , for the last three quarters of the present year . To shew that these views are just , we return to a consideration of those works , which constitute the subject of this article . The first volume before us contains the public documents relating to the commencement and prosecution of the Champlain and great western canals , in the state of New York . They consist of the seven reports of the canal commissioners from 1810 to 1821 inclusive , and a variety of legislative papers , the application to the general government for assistance , and the report thereon , the report of the commissioners of the canal fund , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , and their construction . The appendix contains two very interesting letters from Gov . Brown of Ohio , and W. Steele Esq . of Cincinnati , on the projected canal from the Ohio to lake Erie ; and two large and valuable maps of the route of the New York canals accompany the work . The whole is preceded by an excellent and animating preface by Mr Charles G. Haines . It appears that the collection of the papers was made by that gentleman , in pursuance of a resolution of the New York corresponding association for the promotion of internal improvements ; and we think that the public are much indebted , not only to that society , but to Mr Haines , for having thus united in a compact form whatever is most valuable and authentic concerning that great enterprise , in which the country now feels so lively an interest , and which will hereafter be a matter of still greater curiosity . Posterity will look with wonder at the gigantic efforts of a state , which , with a population of 900,000 , commenced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four hundred and twenty four i*iles of . Yew &amp;rzes , No. 9. *30 // canal , with all its immense embankments , noble aqueducts , and massive locks . The line of the great western canal begins at Buffalo ; then coasting the Niagara river till it meets the Tonawanta creek , pursues its bed for eleven miles , whence it takes a north-easter .. ly direction to . the township of Cabria , passing through tho county of Niagara , and thence east through Genessee , Monroe , Ontario , Seneca , Cayuga , Onondaga , Madison , and Oneida . At Rome it approaches the Mohawk river , and thence , trav* ersing Utica , follows the south side of the river till it joins the Hudson , at a position in the vicinity of Albany . The whole distance is three hundred and sixty three miles , and it has been divided into three sections . The first extends from the embouchure on the Hudson to Utica , one hundred and nine miles ; the second , thence to Montezuma , ninety six ; the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the first and second sections a very imperfect navigation has existed for some time . In the year 1792 the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company ' was incorporated for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Mohawk and Seneca rivers , and opening a communication between both , by Wood creek and the Oneida lake . The company called Mr Weston , an English engineer , to their assistance ; but the low state of their funds caused them to limit their operations to the Mohawk and Wood creek ) which approaches within a very short distance of the former ; and accordingly the locks at the Little Falls were built . The navigation remained in this situation for many years , obstructed by the rapidity of the river , and the periodical lowness of the water in the creek , which made it necessary to lighten the boats , and produced various other difficulties . The first legislative proceeding on the subject was a resolution of the 4th February 1808 , to explore and survey the country between lake Erie and the Hudson , for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal between the tide-waters of the Hudson and lake Erie . ' The motion was made by Joshua Forman , the member from Onondaga , in the state legislature . In a note communicated to Mr Haines , and added to the Introduction , it is stated , that this motion was not carried into effect . It appears , however , that six hundred dollars were appropriated , and that Mr James Geddes , an engii*eer , made a running level of the whole route , and discov // ered various important facts connected with the general subject of his inquiries. * The project appears to have slept in the profoundest repose , till the patriotic suggestions of Thomas Eddy , Dewitt Clinton , and Jonas Platt once more called it from its slumbers . In March l8I*9 , judge Platt , then a senator , offered a resolution that Gouverneur Morris , Stephen Van Rensselaer , Dewitt Clinton , Simeon Dewitt , William North , Thomas Eddy , and Peter B. Porter be appointed commissioners to explore the whole route , take surveys , &amp;c . The motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the commissioners , in pursuance of it , contained a full and convincing statement of the advantages of the proposed canal , and of its ultimate practicability . To this report we may probably ascribe much of that interest , manifested by a large portion of the people in favor of the measure , at a subsequent period . The commissioners discourag .. ed the plan of a sloop navigation , and recommended that of barges , of from twenty to sixty tons . Indeed , by that plan , in order to save the expense of lading and unlading at either end of the canal , the cost woi*dd have been doubled . The peculiar adaptation of the Ridge ( an elevation which crosses the whole of the western part of the state of New York , and descends gradually by successive plains to lake Ontario ) to canal operations , was remarked . But the commissioners , considering that lake Erie was several hundred feet above the Hudson , suggested the application of the principles of an inclined plane . The saving of lockage , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought into the interior , together with the advantage of the pure waters of the lake , gave some plau ... sibility to an idea , which has been since abandoned . The commissioners , with great frankness , stated some difficulties in the route of the canal , the passage of the Seneca lake by an aqueduct eighty three feet high , and that at the mouth of the Cayuga , where the elevation is one hundred and eighty three feet . The valley is a mile broad , and a mound of sufficient heigth and breadth ' to cross it was a work of enormous dimension . The expense of the Erie canal was estimated at $5,000,000 , and that of the Champlain canal at $1,000,000 . An enterprise of this description , to be undertaken by a state , whose permanent annual revenue was $274,359 77 , whose whole revenue was only $619,299 29 , and its expenditure // nearly equalling its receipts , whose population only amounted to 959,220 souls , was certainly one of no trifling character . It was therefore determined , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general views of public benefit and the national policy , to seek assistance from congress , as well as from those individual statesAvhich were to be immediately benefitted . Among these the legislatures of Massachusetts and Ohio came forward with the most prompt and honorable expression of their opinion . Various negotiations and attempts proved fruitless to get from the United States , even a grant of land , to become absolute only upon the completion of the canals ; till the commissioners , wearied by their assiduity , boldly submitted the question , whether the state of New York will continue a supplicant for the favor , and a dependent on the generosity of the union , instead of making a manly and dignified appeal to her own power . ' That state decided for the latter , and it is now useless to inquire what the general government by that act may have lost , or New York acquired of wealth and honor . Though the attention of many eminent men was still steadily fixed on that great object , which they conceived would be of material utility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity , the years of 1813-14-15 passed by , without witnessing the progress of the enterprise . The calamities of war , of which New York was then the theatre , the doubts of many good men as to the feasibility of the plan , and the sufficiency of the resources of the state , and the dissensions of party , in which unfortunately the canals became involved , almost entirely retarded their progress during the period we have mentioned . Among the enlightened friends of the canal policy of the state was the late Robert Fulton , a man , whose name is identified with that of his country , whose inventions , valuable as they are , were only the earnest of what he contemplated , whose benefactions to his country will be celebrated by every American , as long as the Mississippi shall bear her floating palaces upon her bosom , or roll her rich tribute to the ocean . In his letter of Dec. 8 , 1807 , to Mr Gallatin , * he demonstrated the superior advantage of canals over roads ; and , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton , which cost ten dollars per one hundred miles for wagoning , might on a canal be carried for one dolSee American Itegister , vol iii p. 532 // lar ; and that for thirty five dollars a ton , which must be paid for three hundred miles on the best of roads , the same could be boated three thousand five hundred miles , and thus resources be drawn from the centre of this vast continent . ' He also entered into a very nice calculati*pn to prove , that if canals were made with the surplus revenue of the government , the interior would be supplied cheaper with foreign articles , than if the duties were taken off , and transportation by roads continued . In the letter which he wrote to Mr Gouverneur Morris , at that time president of the board of canal commissioners , he applies the former calculations to the New York canal , and points out the great revenue to be derived from it , in a manner equally novel and striking. * Mr flames supposes that there are two thousand sloops on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The customhouse , we understand , affords no accurate information on this subject ; and , as it is possible that this amount is something too large , we will take Mr Fulton 's calculation , made seven years since , of four hundred vessels of sixty tons burthen . The result will not affect the integrity of Mr Haines ' calculation , which finally rests on a transportation of 450,000 tons per year . The truth , in our opinion , is a medium between both . If Hudson 's river , ' says Mr Fulton , collecting freight from its surrounding country , and an interior not more distant than Cayuga or Ontario , now bears on its waters near 400,000 tons per annum , where shall the mind be arrested ? On what number of tons shall it dwell , when coming from the population of the next twenty years , and the countries which surround lake Superior , Michigan , Huron , and a canal of three hundred miles through a fertile country ? Compared with the trade now on Hudson 's river , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the following reasons : where the canal unites to the Hudson 's river the man who lives ten miles from the river , and ten from the canal , will , when he has his produce in a wagon , go direct to the river ; but he who lives thirty miles from the river , and five from the canal , will carry it to the canal ; and he , who lives fifty miles from th' river , will go thirty to the canal ; he , who lives three hundred miles from the river , will wagon his produce one hundred miles to the canal . Thus the canal would draw in the trade of a country forming a triangle with a base line two hundred miles long , and from thence to the apex three hundred miles ; equal to a range of country See the Life of Robert Fulton , by Cadwallador D. Colden , p. 2Th. // three hundred miles long and one hundred miles wide : or thirty thousand square miles : equal to acres 19,200,000 Lake Erie will draw in the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan from a L like distance ; *ake Superior from one hundred and fifty miles ; all of which may be estimated at J Total 49,200,000 a quantity , if I recollect right , not far short of the whole of England . ' Golden 's Life of Fulton , p. 281 . We may then fairly presume , that , in the lapse of a few years , the canal would produce five millions of dollars ; thus quickly reimbursing the capital expended , and giving the state a noble revenue to be employed in other and greater improvements . Mr Haines , from the amount of goods transported to Pitts*. burg and westward , from the number of tons already carried on the river , and from various other facts , which he has collected and exhibited in a very forcible manner , concludes that in a short period the amount of tonnage on the canal will he about a million ; and when we contemplate the rapid increase of our population , the immense extent of country tributary to this canal , startling as is the proposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views entertained by some on the subject of internal improvement . At length , in February 1816 , an appeal was made to the people ; a meeting was held in the city of New York ; it was large and respectable , and an able memorial , drawn up by the present chief magistrate of that state , was adopted and received numerous signatures . Though many of the best men then opposed the canals , its friends were not disheartened ; and the final success of the project is doubtless to be attributed in a very considerable degree to the zeal and perseverance of that gentleman . From this moment the busi .. ness proceeded with a rapid , but cautious step , till we now almost witness its completion , and the successful issue of a costly , but grand experiment . It is with such a prospect in view , and after having given a calculation as to the amount of ' tonnage on the canal , that the commissioners break forth in the following animated conclusion : Standing on such facts , is it extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receipt , at no distant period , of one million dollars , net revenue , from this canal ? The life of an individual // is short . The time is not distant , when those who make this report will have passed away . But no term is fixed to the existence of a state ; and the first wish of a patriot 's heart is , that his own may be immortal . But whatever limit may have been assigned to the duration of New York , by those eternal decrees which established the heavens and the earth , it is hardly to be expected , that she will be blotted from the list of political societies before the effects here stated shall have been sensibly felt . And even , when by the flow of that perpetual stream , which bears all human institutions away , our constitution shall be dissolved , and oi*r laws be lost , still the descendants of our children 's children will remain . The same mountains will stand , the same rivers run . New moral combinations will be formed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity , after a lapse of two thousand years , and the ravage of repeated revolutions , when the records of history shall have been obliterated , and the tongue of tradition have converted ( as in China ) the shadowy remeinbrance of ancient events into childish tales of miracle , this national work shall rem*in . It shall bear testimony to the genius , the learning , the industry , and the intelligence of the present age . ' Docn , nents , p. 47*. // one thousand six hundred and thirty one feet of stone and iron culverts of various dimensions ; and one thousand eight hundred and sixty feet of waste-wiers . It would appear also , that the ground is favorable in other respects , for it is stated , that from a point three miles west above the Little Falls , there is not a single yard of rock for txi*b hundred and forty miles , which it will be necessary to remove . Means have been found to lessen those obstacles , which at first threatened great labor and expense to surmount ; as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . Already fine passage boats , provided with beds and other comforts , allure the traveller , and carry him along at the rate of four and even five miles an hour ; and the agricultural products of Cayuga are found entering into competition with those of Duchess , in the market of New York . What would otherwise be an object of considerable magnitude has dwindled into insignificance when compared with the Erie canal . We have not yet spoken of the Champlain canal . It opens a market to a very large part of New York and Vermont ; and the masts , spars , lumber , &amp;c. on the shores of the lake , have already acquired a value , of which the want of a communication with the sea-board before deprived them . The commissioners called the public attention to this canal in 1814 . It extends from Whitehall to Waterford , and occasionally uses the bed of Wood creek and the Hudson . The cost of making it was estimated at $1,000,000 . It is certain , however , that it will not amount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage in 1820 ; and in that year , imperfect as it was , there passed through it 159,000 boards , 98,000 plank , 13,000 cubic feet of pine timber , 10,000 do . of hemlock timber , 29 cords of tanners ' bark , 24 do . of fire wood , 104,000 oak staves , 49,000 shingles , 3480 saw logs , 10,000 rails , 9000 cedar posts , and 8000 fence boards . A deficiency of water was , however , experienced on the summit level ; and this circumstance and the construction of a number of locks have delayed the completion of the work . The whole length of the Erie and Champlain canals , when finished , will be four hundred and twenty four miles . Their width at the top is forty feet , and at the bottom twenty eight . The locks are ninety feet long and fourteen feet broad . The sum of $800,000 has been appropriated to the Champlain canal , and the estimated expense of both is $5,371,814* // It will not be uninteresting , we trust , to compare the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average is $13,800 per mile . In England , the expenditure per mile may be taken at about $22,500. * Mr Gallatin gave the medium of American canals at $31,000 . Th* Middlesex canal in Massachusetts cost $17,000 per mile . Compared , therefore , with the advantages conferred , we believe that the Erie canal is one of the cheapest ever constructed . The canal of Languedoc is no less the admiration of Europe , than the glory of the reign of Louis XIV ; yet in its length , the magnitude of the interests it unites , the amount of commerce it bears upon it , it can not enter into a comparison with the great western canal . The length of the former is one hundred and eighty miles , is six feet deep , and cost about $2,900,000 at a time when money was far more valuable than at present . Francis Andreossy , in his Htstoire du Canal du iiidi , gives 1,200,000 quintals , about 60,000 tons , as the average transportation upon it , and states that its net receipts per year ( being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were $68,465 . The corn which is embarked on the canal from Toulouse to Carcassonne , pays two thirds of this revenue . What then must be the importance of the Erie canal , commanding the fertile country which lines its banks , and that immense population on the lakes , to whose comforts and necessities it must minister ? The imagination is startled by its own reveries , as it surveys the coasts of Erie , Huron , and Michigan , and traverses the rich prairies of Indiana , or the gloomy forests of Ohio . But we firmly believe that these bright anticipations will be converted into facts , and that our country will hereafter exhibit an inland tiade , unrivalled for its activity , its value , and its extent . *As the success of the canals is no longer doubtful , and as * they are about to create an era in the history of the union and the state of New York , it is not remarkable that there should be those , who are anxious to appropriate to themselves the honor of their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we apprehend that it will be difficult indeed to decide in favor of the claims of any individual . Mr Elkanah Watson , in the year 1788 , attended the Indian treaty at fort Stanwix , and in the autumn of 1791 travelled as far west as the village of Geneva , principally by * See a treatise on the improvement of canal navigation , by It . Fulton , civil engineer , p. 29. // water . The diary of the latter journey was prepared for publication in 1793 , but recent events alone have called it forth . In both of these journies , Mr Watson , whose mind had been turned towards canals both in Europe and America , seems undoubtedly to have directed his a*ention to the practicability of effecting an inland navigation to the great lakes . He launched his boat in Wood creek , and pursuing it to the Oneida lake , followed thence the course of the Onondaga and Seneca rivers to Caynga lake . In the journal , speaking of Wood creek , we find such expressions as these , in contemplating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions in the west , ' &amp;c . History , *c. p. 31 . And again , we are now sailing parallel with the Ontario ocean , which I hope to see ;  --  and at least enjoy in delightful anticipation , the prospect of a free and open water communication from thence to the Atlantic , via Albany and New York . ' p. 37 . In addition to these remarks , there are estimates of the expense of removing obstructions and building locks at falls , &amp;c. with some very general observations on the advantages which such an extensive navigation would afford , and the duty of the state to encourage its prosecution . The facts which Mr Watson had collected in his tour were made known to Gen. Schuyler , and had an influence in causing the passage of the act of 1791 , concerning roads and inland navigation , and for other purposes . ' Upon these principal grounds , Col. Troup has appeared before the public to support the claim al .. ready made by his friend , Mr Watson , to the exclusive merit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the canal policy of that state , is meant that system of internal communication , by which she promised herself many great and important advantages , we are inclined to think that the assertion can not be maintained : - if it be intended to put forth Mr Watson as the author of the Erie canal , we imagine that the position is equally untenable . The merit of a great original conception can not be denied ; but the talent of its possessor is frequently eclipsed by the improvements it afterwards undergoes , and the splendid combinations in which it is involved . The marquis of Worcester seems to have had the first crude notion of a steam-engineNewcomen constructed one , but the name of Watt is immortalized in the history of the arts , as the efficient author of the invention . The application of steam to the propelling of // boats is not a new idea ; nay , experiments were long since instituted to prove its efficiency . The bright and ample honor of our Fulton is that he succeeded where others failed , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and senseless . We Qannot believe that Mr Watson was the first man who perceiveff the advantage of connecting the Hudson with lake Ontario , or that a fact so palpable to any person acquainted with the geography of the country , could be undiscovered till the year 1791 . Indeed we know that during the colonial government , the subject of the Mohawk river was recommended to the assembly . It was perfectly idle at that time to talk of a canal , which should pass through forests , which resounded only with the yell of the savage . The peace of 1783 gave a new spur to enterprize , the white sentlements became more extended , and Mr Watson , with three other gentlemen , pursued only the natural course of those waters , which providence had granted for the convenience of a great country . From a point within two miles of the Mohawk on XVood creek ( we might almost say , from the Mohawk itself , for in a wet season both streams have met ) there is a navigation interrupted by occasional shallows ai1d falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even at this early period it was used , for the journal says , p. 36 , this morning we wrote home by a boat coming from the west , loaded with hemp raised at the south end of Caynga lake . ' Those gentlemen , who accompanied Mr Watson , must have been as sensible of the fact as himself , and no doubt wished with him to see , at some future day , the obstructions of the Seneca and Onondago rivers removed , and the falls of the Oswego locked . But we can not imagine what room there was for projecting that which already existed , or to do more than improve a navigation already marked out , and even in partial operation . It is apparent on the face of Mr Watson 's remarks , as well as from Col. Troup 's pamphlet , that Mr Watson 's conceptions did not extend to a canal direct from lake Oneida to the Niagara river . His view , as far as we have discovered it , was the natural communication with lake Ontario , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in his report to Gen. Schuyler . As a proof of this , we beg leave to cite the following passages : A canal communication , from hence to Oswego harbor is necessary ,  --  . bo complete the great chain of // Jan. water communication from Ontario to the Hudson . ' History , 4*c. p. 40 . The utmost stretch of our views , was to follow . the track of nature 's canal , and to remove natural or artificial obstructions ; but we never entertained the most distant conception of a canal from lake Erie to the Hudson . ' Ibid. . /*pp . Note K p. 100 . Now we conceive , that if there be any thing peculiarly imposing or advantageous in the canal operations of New-York , it is inseparably connected with the Erie canal , and that if Mr Watson 's idea of joining lake Ontario with the Mohawk by the Oswego river had even been carried into effect , it would have been of little comparative utility to that state , and that instead of securing the commerce of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very doors . In that case , a country , which is exceeded by no other of the same extent in fertility , the western part of New York , in consequence of its remote situation , would have profited little by the enterprize of her own citizens . The produce of the upper lakes , once on Ontario , would pursue its natural destination , the market of Montreal , for even the citizens of Cayuga county have found it their interest to carry their flour to that city . We ask then , would the commerce of the country between Cayuga lake and Buffalo , or that of the great inland seas beyond , ever have found its way to New York ? A variety of considerations will show its impossibility ; but we refer the reader to the irresistible arguments on this subject , contained in the memorial , Documents , p. 86 . It appears , therefore , to us , that the great and vital principle of what is called the canal policy , was to divert into the bosom of our own people a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our own shores , to open a market for the products of the western country , and finally to secure , even if *lte falls of Niagara were locked , by a cheaper route than that of lake Ontario , the commerce of the upper lakes and the territory which was contiguous to or bordering upon them . If we are correct in these statements , Mr Watson can not claim the high honor of having originated the canal policy of New York . Such an exclusive honor , in cases of this kind , rarely belongs to an individual . It is the nature of human enterprises , which consist not in one lucky effort , but in a series of wise couqsels , steadily pursued , through a great variety of measures , deliberative and active , that many should bear a part in the labor , and be entitled to a share of the credit . And // if truth and justice have obliged us to withhold from Mr Wat ... son that exclusive honor in this case , which rarely belongs to any individual in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his animated exertions in favor of the plans of uniting Wood creek and the Mohawk , and the Hudson and Lake Champlain . Doubtless the final passage of the act of 1792 was owing to the facts which had been collected in his journey of September 1791 , and which were communicated to general Schuyler , the father of the measure . His powerful concurrence and zealous activity in these projects will always be mentioned with respect and remembered with gratitude . With the information which we possess , we shall certainly not pretend to decide on so delicate and important a matter as the one before us . But we can not conclude without noticing a fact , recorded p. 64 of the History , but with which we were before acquainted . The quick and grasping mind of that eloquent orator and profound statesman , Gouvcrneur*Morris , was deeply imbued at least as early as the year 1800 , with the supreme importance of a canal between lake Erie and the Hudson . He pours forth his magnificent auguries in the following enthusiastic language , in a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no distant period , bound on the billows of these inland seas . Shall I lead your astonishment up to the verge of incredulity ? I will . Know then , that one tenth part of the expense borne by Britain , in the last campaign , would enable ships to sail from London through Hudson 's river into lake Erie . As yet , we only crawl along the outer shell of our country . The interior excels the part we inhabit , in soil , in climate , in every thing . The proudest empire of Europe ' is but a bauble , compared to what America may be-must be . ' These suggestions were by some regarded as the production of a romantic and ardent imagination ; and there were those who too often lisped the accents of contempt , over what their courage was too faint to espouse , or their minds too insignificant to conceive . That great man lived , however , to bring the subject before the public  --  the luminous report of 1811 is the fruit of his powerful and disciplined intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 , of fourteen essays , which appeared in 1807 in a newspaper , and are attributed to Jesse Hawley Esq . of Rochester . The account there given makes us regret , that we have never been able to see them . The routc of the canal is laid down , the distance // calculated , the expense estimated , as experience has since shown , with remarkable accuracy . Our readers will recollect , that this was before any legislative proceeding on the subject , and is , therefore , more worthy of observation on account of the minuteness of the details , the h , *ldness of the conception , and the courage of supporting , that which was then esteemed a wild and extravagant attempt . We proceed to make a few remarks upon the probable effects , which the great works we have been considering will have upon the interests of the United States , or upon those of that state , which has so strenuously and nobly prosecuted them . And , in the first place , we think that the internal commerce of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Let us examine for a few moments the connexion of the western canal with other great points in our limits . By an artificial navigation of sixteen miles , the voyage from Buffalo to Pittsburgh would be uninterrupted . The communications between the Ohio and lake Erie are numerous and not difficult . A short cut would join the Muskingum , which discharges itself a hundred and seventy miles below Pittsburgh with the Cayahoga . The junction of the Scioto with the Sandusky , the Miami of the Lake with the Miami of the Ohio is practicable . Michigan and Erie may unite their waters by means of the river Raisin , while by the Chicago river which runs into the former , and a branch of the river Plein , a passage might be secured into the Illinois , and theace to the Mhssissippi . The latter route has been lately pointed out in a report made to the secretary of war . ' introduct. to Doc . p. ix . The present cost of transportation across the mountains to Pittsburgh is $70 per ton . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head waters of the Ohio it is estimated at $35 , and if there were a good road only at $28 . If , therefore , it be true , that in three years the cost of wagoning to Pittsburgh amounted nearly to $5,000,000 , there would have been a saving in either case of several hundred thousand dollars . It is stated in the introduction , ( and we presume these results are the consequence of diligent inquiry , ) that taking a section of 8000 square miles within forty miles of the Ohio and Sandusky as the depot , and charging land carriage to the various places of consumption , the canal would save at least $42 per ton , and in the north-east part of Ohio at least // $90 per ton , in the cost of conveyance . The effects are - more palpable in the state of Illinois . Merchandise from Philadelphia or New Orleans , pays for carriage $130 per ton , but when the canal shall be finished , and a road of sixty miles made from the head of lake Mich*an , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From all these considerations it will seem probable , that Philadelphia and Baltimore must yield a large portion of their present trade to their more fortunate rival . The time must soon arrive , when that extensive territory from the Ohio to the great lakes , and from the Missouri to the borders of Pennsylvania , a country fertile and healthful , inhabited by a race of hardy and vigorous men , capable of supporting a population of enormous magnitude , a country , in comparison with which the fairest kingdom in Europe is almost sterile , will hereafter receive all which may supply its wants or add to its luxuries through New York , and will in return transmit , by the same channel , the rich fruits of an exuberara soil , owned and cultivated by a free population . New Orleans , great as she inevitably must be , will find her influence contracted , and will be obliged to bow to those great physical and moral causes , which have constituted New York the emporium of North America . If the contemplated canal across the stat&amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young but powerful member of the republic ) should be made , even the tobacco of Kentucky would find a cheaper passage on the smooth waters of the canal , than on the Ohio , obstructed by the falls of Louisville , or the Mississippi , at all times a tedious and dangerous navigation . The United States will feel the benefit of the canal in the improved value of the public lands in that quarter . Population will rapidly increase , and the adian , ameliorated by the benign policy of the government , will be enclosed with the cordon of the white settlements , there we trust to enjoy the blessings of civilized life . The protecting force and paternal energy of the same power will then be extended to our frontier with ease and economy . On the seaboard we have nothing to fear ; the fortifications now erecting , the perfection to which our navy is brought , and the characteristic gallantry of our seamen , afford an ample defence in that quarter . On our northern frontier we are more exposed ; and that owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A piece of ordnance during the late contest with // England , delivered at lake Ontario , cost the country $2000 , when its original price was only $400 . These canals , therefore , while they will save thousands to the individual and the nation , are calculated to protect our borders from invasion , to secure the safety of our citizens , . * , and guaranty the general welfare of the republic . The state of New York , already one of the most powerfiul in the confederacy , is destined to become yet more so . Situated in a healthy climate , and in a commanding geographical position , with a hardy population of 1,300,000 souls , she has ore her a most noble career . The profits of agriculture will be increased , the resources of the state improved , all its parts brought nearer to each other , * its population extended , and its power concentered and consolidated . She possesses great mineral riches ; the beds of gypsum in Onondaga are not only extensive , but of the purest quality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will hereafter afford a regular source of profit , by exportation to the south . Already the lake fisheries have become a matter of importance , while the Champlain canal has led to the establishment of numerous forges in a country where the iron ore is said to be of an excellent quality . The salt works at Salina are particularly deserving of attention . They already yield sixty or seventy thousand dollars to the state , the duty being twelve and a half cents per bushel . A single gallon of the water yields twenty-six ounces of salt , and the supply is inexhaustible . The Virginia , Pennsylvania , Kentucky , and Illinois salt is sold at the works , from four dollars to $7,50 per bushel ; at Salina it can be sold at two dollars per bushel . What will be the future value of the salt springs to the state can not be accurately foreseen ; but already has this commodity been carried by land to Buffalo , and thence distributed along the banks of the lake . Hereafter it will supply the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine marble and agricultural products of Vermont . As it is an article of the first necessity , the revenue to he derived from it will be a fund constantly increasing with the exigencies of a growing population . The Champlain canal , though a considerable work , has been * It was well remarked in the report of 1812 , that the proposed canal would to every useful purpose produce the same effect , as if lake Erie were l*rought within forty miles of Hudson 's river . ' // lost in the magnitude of the other . It is , however , of no small importance . It diverts a valuable trade carried on from the northern part of Vermont to Montreal , and opens a market for the country , lying on the banks of lake Champlain . The immense forests of the North , whj**h never yet felt the axe of the husbandman , will soon bow before his arm , and exchange their gloomy shades for the clear sunshine of the open field . The revenue of this canal , it is said , will produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its construction , and to establish a sinking fund for extinguishing the principal . Thus , after some years , the state will enjoy a new income , to be expended in objects of public utility . Whatever may be the force of the considerations we have urged in favor of these canals , we think that they are merged and lost in one which is paramount and superior to all , which is intimately connected with the character and conservation of our civil institutions , and our freedom and happiness as a na* tion . The government under which we live is emphatically a government founded on public opinion ; it is an association which depends for its existence on the breath of the people . This constitutes one of its great distinguishing features ; and though it is one of which we are justly proud , it is not without its perils . We cherish this pride , because it implies , nay more , requires an intelligent and patriotic population to support and defend such a system , to protect it from its own inherent weakness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , to maintain our fellow citizens in all the plenitude of legitimate and deputed command , but instantly to crush the man , like the reptile who crawls into our dwellings , who dares to usurp the fasces of authority which were never delivered to him by the people . But we are not only republics , but federated republics . We are bound together by a common charter , to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . ' This association was voluntary , and dictated by an experience of benefits under a previous confederacy . This union then depends upon the affections of the people ; and it would be found , if they were once subtracted from it , how weak and ineffectual were the laws which bound us together . Whatever , therefore , in addition to the civil ligaments of our union , superinduces those physical bonds which are ever most tangible to the minds of ordinary men , confers an *n&amp; New &amp;ries , No. 9. // nite benefit on the country , and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right of self-government . It is in this view then that we consider the great western canal of paramount importance . It connects the east with the west by a reciprocal and advantageous commerce , it brings the citizens of widely extended communities* into frequent and regular intercourse . By it , the commodities of the one are transferred in a just and equitable exchange into the limits of the other ; and thus a strong but mutual interest will ultimately unite them with a chain , which neither the fervors of party nor the mutual jealousy of states will ever be able to destroy . We rejoice that the prayers of good men seem to have been heard , and that the prophecies of those ignorant of our laws and the character of the people , or those unable to appreciate the excellence of both , are already shown to be false . The union of the states is our only safety . It protects and defends us , it secures respectability at home and abroad , it has raised the American name to an honorable elevation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether he navigates his bark upon the billows of the trackless ocean , or prosecutes his adventurous way among the naked and ferocious savages of the Missouri or Columbia . Every where may it be felt , surrounding us with ' its magic influence , till we almost lose the perception of its invaluable favors , in the regular and ample flow of its varied blessings . Remove it ,  --  give an absolute independence to every state , and the promise of our youth is blasted , and with it the world 's best hope laid low . Influenced by these views , the state of New York has carried on those great improvements , in which certainly she has far outstripped any other member of the union . They will be a monument of her talent and her vigor , when contemplated by other generations . They are the noblest objects of a people 's ambition , and the most permanent sources of their glory . When those transitory interests , which animate opposition , shall have passed away , when those miserable jealousies , which too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , these noble canals will remain to bless the memory of their authors , and distribute their benefits upon their posterity . In all human probability we do not yet perceive the full and complete advantages , which they are ulti .. mately to produce . The changes they may cause , the aspect // they may give to our country , and the character they may impress upon our people are concealed beneath the mantle of time . These subjects will hereafter afford room for the research of the historian ; at this moment they are hidden even from those who almost witness *e close of the experiment , and the animating recompense of a patriotic and intelligent people . It is the prerogative of great minds to strike out those improvements , whose excellence , though appreciated at the time , is destined to be fully enjoyed in another age . The cloaca maxsma is to this day the common sewer of Rome , and the acqueducts of the Campagna still supply to the eternal city , as they did centuries ago , the luxuries and the comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , hut these proud memorials of their genius remain ; and when the statesmen who conceived the project of the Erie and Champlain canals , and that generation who completed them , shall have passed away , the tides of the Hudson will meet in fraternal accord with the waves which wash the shores of Chicago , or beat against the cliffs of Mackinaw :  --  the most powerful testimony to the force of an enlightened government , supported by a free and educated people. *
