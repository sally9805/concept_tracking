txt ART . IV. - sl $electiot&amp; fr*rn the l*nglis4 J'rose kYo4s of JQHN MILrQN* In two vols. l2mo . Boston . I*owle* &amp; Dearborn. 1826 . THE prose writings of . Mj ri , , though they hav&amp;leen praise4 and recommended by a few who have felt their astonishing power and beauty , are yet but little known among us . We hope , however , that this will not long be the case ; and that the excellent edition by Mr Jenks , of which the title stan.ds at the head of this article , will enable many to read the prose of a man with whose poetry they have long been familiar-prose , we will venture to say , hardly inferior to , his poetry . As Americans , as lovers . of fieedom , improvement , *nd truth , we wish to see these two volumes widely circulated among our countryrnen* and deeply read . They are fit , manuals for a free people . They are full of those eloquent , soul stirring , holy lessons of liberty , which do something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , and principle , and firm resolve ; which brace up the heart , while they strengthen the understanding ; which render timidity or apostacy impossible ; which , at the same time that they impart the feeling , of discipleship , infuse the spirit of martyrdom ; // because the truths which they inculcate are of such a nature , that those who receive them must contend , and if needs be , must die for them . Therefore it is that we earnestly desire to see the prose works of John Milton generally disseminated ; and that we hail with pleasure and gratitude every attempt to make them known . When they are known , it can not be but that they will produce their impression , and be estimated by many , as they are now estimated by a few , according to their real value . For ourselves , we can truly say that we never knew Milton , till we were acquained with his prose writings . We never knew the man till then ; never felt how entirely and supremely he was a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true poem ; that is , a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things . ' We never knew till then , what a noble , highminded being , what a contemner of littleftess and baseness , what a fearless asserter of right and denouncer of wrong , how pure , how virtuous , how incorruptible , how unconquerable be was . How truly the modern poet speaks of him , when he says ; His soul was as a star , and dwelt apart . ' When we now compare him with his brother stars , we perceive that he has indeed his own separate heaven , where he shines alone , and not to be approached . If we grant that in the single respect of genius he was second to Shakspeare , and to him alone would we grant him to be second , yet what was Shakspeare 's life ? what were his occupations , studies , principles ? We know notbing of them ; they made no impression on the world ; they have passed away , and left us no trace ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shakspeare 's poetry , and not of Shakspeare . His name comes to us as a voice , an abstraction , a beautiful sound . But the name of Milton is inseparably united with the man himself ; with the image of his life ; with his studious , blameless , brilliant youth ; with his diligent , useful , resolute manhood ; with his unbroken and undaunted , though blind and neglected old age ; with learning , various , profound , unrivalled ; with opinions really liberal , and republican ; with convictions which no fear nor flattery could shake ; with principles which grew up from the very roots of truth . We will not proceed with other comparisons , which readily suggest themselves to us . They may be pursued by those who are sensible that genius of mind alone ranks far below what may be called genius of life ; genius of mind united in admi*ra* // ble consistency with genius of action , genius of purpose , and genius of heart . There is another thing with which the prose writings of Milton brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the whole power of our mother tongue . Let him who would understand how rich , how copious , how forcible the English language is , study the prose of Milton , and make himself familiar with his style ; but let him not attempt to imitate , let him not hope to equal the master , unless he feel within himself the master 's gifts and the master 's soul . But if such is the prose of the great poet , how happens it that it is not more generally known ? How happens it that this magazine of just and noble thoughts , high imaginations , and burning words , has been in a manner shut up and unvisited ? How happens it , that while the Paradise Lost has been printed in every form and size , in editions without number , for the rich and for the poor , illustrated by the artist , and furnished with notes and commentaries hy distinguished scholars , as if it were an ancient classic , that the Areopagi-tica , The Reason of Church Government , The Animadversions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two principal reasons of the want of popularity of Milton 's prose works , have been usually stated , and truly , to be the peculiarities of their style , and the nature and management of their topics . Of their style we shall say a few words by and by . Of their topics , and the management of them , in which the great cause of their unpopularity is decidedly to be found , we shall speak at once , and more at length . The prose writings , then , of Milton , are all , both Latin and English , with only one or two exceptions , strictly , and many would say , bitterly controversial . They are theological and political controversies . They wear , therefore , a formidable and forbidding aspect to the generality of readers ; for controversy is not a favorite kind of reading ; it requires more thought and a more severe and constant exercise of judgment , candor , patience , and equanimity , than most people are willing or able to bestow and apply ; it is rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has acquired a bad name ; it is called , by distinction , a thorny path ; and many think they can not walk in it without danger to their faces and their clothes , and therefore they decline it with terror and aversion . Now we profess ourselves to be great friends of contr0versy. *We // regard it with respect and favor , if not absolutely with love . If it is not a pleasant and flowery way , it is the direct road to light and knowledge ; and if so , why do we talk about thorns , as if we expected to reach any of the supreme and permanent blessings of life , treading all the distance on turf and roses ? We are glad that the glorious bard made it his adopted path , and that he pursued it with so untired , so forward , and so firm a step . We would not have had him write on any other subjects but those , which not only singularly involved the destinies of England at the period of his writing , but are inseparably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . He was peculiarly fitted to elicit and establish truth by controversy ; which we are persuaded is its proper , and almost its peculiar office . For the confirmation of this sentiment , we will take the liberty of offering our reasons . False teachers will arise in all ages , and deceive many ; some of them intending to deceive , and others having no such intention . Dreams will be announced as realities , and believed as such ; and realities will be scouted as dreams . There is such a perpetual warfare between truth and error in the world , that the old Manichean notion of two great opposing principles of good and evil , who with their kingdoms of light and darkness , are engaged in constant and tremendous battle , would be little more than an accurate account of the real state of things , if it were stripped of its personifications and oriental imagery . There is a battle between good and evil ; there is a struggle between the powers of light and darkness . Knowledge and virtue are in perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former may from time to time gain over the latter , the latter are mighty antagonists , who will no doubt maintain the contest obstinately and long . If the champions of error would in all cases avow themselves to be so ; if they would write their name and their purpose on their banners , and send an open defiance , like him of Gath , against the armies of the living God , the contest might be brought to a more certain and speedy issue ; but there are few of them who do not profess , either sincerely or insincerely , to be on the side of truth and virtue ; and thus they become doubly mischievous by being disguised , and occasion the double necessity of unmasking and overcoming them . Many teachers of what is false and of a pernicious tendency , are as honest as it is possible for self deceiving humanity to be . They are the firsb and // most thorough believers of their own dreams ; and are fully persuaded that they are dreaming for the cause of truth and the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not actuated by the same pure motives ; by those who uphold falsehood for the sake of their own private interests , or through the incitement of their bad passions , but do not confess the influence which guides and sways them , because they know that interest and passion , however powerful in themselves , are worse than powerless when presented as arguments to others ; for he who ' wishes to be heard with the least patience by his neighbor , must appear to be anxious for his neighbor 's good , not merely careful of his own . Tyrants talk of the safety of the state , and the happiness of their people , without saying much about the sweets of absolute power , and the indulgence of all their appetites and luxurious wishes . indeed , it is not unfrequently the case that interest is louder in its professions of disinterestedness than is disinterestedness itself ; for virtue is modest , and hypocrisy is bold ; and a part that is acted is likely to be overacted . To detect error is to overthrow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow that they are in the wrong , or , in other words , that they are attacking what really is truth . The world is filled with falsehood , which never calls itself hy that name . The diversities of human intellect and feeling , and the influences of education , habit , and passion , give rise to innumerable errors , which agree together in two points , in being of a bad tendency , and in assuming the name of truth . On the one hand is falsehood , which thinks itself to he truth ; and on the other hand is falsehood , which is resolved , if possible , to be thought so too , whatever it may think itself . Hence come theories , systems , and plans , varying from each other , and from truth in different degrees ; and , just in proportion as they vary from truth , conducing to unhappiness , if not immediately , yet in their remote effects . Wrong opinions and views tend to wrong conduct , and wrong conduct seeks to defend or excuse itself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , natural and inevitable , of human freedom and human imperfection , the bitter fruits of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , plucked from the beginning , and harshly infused into the mingled cup of life . Men are in a state of discipline ; and these are the weaknesses , disorders , and rebellions of their pupilage . They are in training // for that heavenly harmony which is the end of the Divine government ; and these are the sad discords of their inexperience and perverseness , which break in upon the universal melody , and disturb the pure song of the stars . Surrounded on all sides by bad principles , false opinions , and doubtful disputations , what then is the duty of the sincere , serious , impartial lover of truth ? What is his duty , in view of the evils which result from erroneous doctrines , and in regard to those who inculcate them ? It plainly consists in moral courage and intrepidity ; in affording a fair and fearless audience to all propositions , and advancing a faithful avowal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoin silence by authority , or attempt to enforce it by penalties , on those who would proclaim their free thoughts , whether for good or evil , is not only a fruitless , but an unwise and an unrighteous expedient . The endeavor to suppress presumed error by physical power , is itself an error of uncommon magnitude ; as great as any which it would suppress ; and one which the world is beginning to get rid of , by that best of all methods of suppression , consent and dearly bought experience . Opinions are like certain plants , which thrive , and spread , and weave their roots more firmly together , by being trodden upon and used roughly . The basket which the Corinthian woman set upon the young acanthus , was speedily overtopped and hidden by the rank and resolute leaves which sprung up from beneath it . There is a pride in man which always rises against pressure ; and a sympathy in man which takes the part of an oppressed brother . Besides , to punish error is only to proclaim it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the silent and secret thoughts of men ; but that which is punished may ; and that which is received in secret , will secretly make its progress , undermining and destroying , like a poison without its antidote ; for mere force , or mere denunciation , is no antidote for the mind . The only way to deal with error is , to meet it , face to face ; to examine it critically , feature by feature ; to question it boldly , and to answer it fairly . To fly from it , is to tempt it to advance . To fear it , is to acknowledge its power , and to increase it ; to wrong , moreover , the power of truth ; to misapprehend the very nature of truth ; to doubt the reality of its existence , the divinity of its origin , and the strength and durability of its foundations ; to give up the world to the dominion // of darkness , and the reign of the evil principle ; to deny , practically , that there is anything progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reason , or attainable in knowledge . What is it that we fear ? Do we fear that God has so constituted the human mind , in relation to whatever is made to concern it , or come before it , that it has no final ability to discern between what is good and what is bad ; what is stable and what is fleeting ; what is and what is not ? Do we fear that our Creator has ordained such an affinity between error and the rational part of those whom we are constrained to call his rational creatures , that the two agree more constantly , and always will agree more constantly and lovingly together , than will the latter and truth ? Do we fear that error will naturally bear examination more steadfastly and successfully than truth ? or that the human mind necessarily supports what is false , with more ease and vigor than what is real ? or that those minds which espouse the cause of evil , are constantly stronger than those which take the good side ? or that vice is portioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? Do we fear these things ? Do we apprehend that this is the course and order of the moral world ? Then ought our life to be one perpetual fear ; we should fear the government of the universe , and the dispensations of eternity . But if we do not fear that man is'made more capable and susceptible of error than of truth , and that error is endowed from above with a permanent superiority here below , then error is not to be feared , but to be faced and opposed . If there is any falsehood which should terrify us , it is that which lives in our own houses , and speaks from our own hearts ; and even that , perhaps , is to be handled severely rather than timidly ; hut that which comes from without , as it must come , and there is no help for it , so let it come . Let the prophet that bath a dream , tell his dream ; let us hear it , and know what it is , so that it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as men will proclaim their fancies , and other men will hear them , let them unburthen themselves ; and let them not disperse their spurious ware abroad , till it has undergone its inspection , and received its brand . Error is a disease incident to humanity ; and we can not fly from it ; and as there are no means of general prevention , let it develope itself , that we may see it and trace it , and steadily administer its cure . Fear and ignorance go together ; and those who timidly shrink frora error , are in the way of // losing the opportunity of much truth ; for truth is often descried by comparison , and the manifestation of that , which among many things presented , is the most worthy . By sifting the dust we discover the diamonds ; which , though hidden in the earth , and crusted over with earth , are diamonds still . Let every ambitious imagination , therefore , take its own course , and come out and show itself . And let not its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which refuses to confront aud rebuke it . It would be a pity , indeed , if all the zeal , and all the courage , and all the alertness , were to be exhibited on the wrong side , and cowardice and torpor alone were to be seen on the right . At the same time that it is our duty , and also our policy , to be fearless in regarding error , it is our duty to be intrepid in declaring the truth . If truth is of any value , we should maintain it as if we valued it . If it is of any certain benefit to mankind , we should proclaim it , as the well wishers of our race . If it is the cause of Heaven , we should plead for it earnestly , as the partakers of a spiritual existence , and the heirs of inimortality . If we believe that infinite wisdom and rectitude govern the world , we should join ourselves to its interests , and contend for its rights , as for the course which will finally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living word within his bosom , has no right to keep It shut up there , pining and drooping for air and light and action . U must go forth and do its work , which is to oppose every false invention of man , and bring it to trial and to condemnation . He who thinks that error and vice are destructive of the best interests of society , and of his own too , as connected with and forming a part of them , what has he to do , but to be the faithful advocate of religion and virtue , if he thinks that religion and virtue are contrary to error and vice , and to be preferred before them ? If a man has no settled principles *f right , why does he talk about error , or even pretend to fear it ? Neither error nor truth is anything to him . But if he is possessed of settled principles , why does he suffer fear , or fashion , or any motive in the world , , to shake his confidence. , or prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called doubtful. , because they divide honest and well meaning opinions , the lover of truth is to pnrsue the same course , xvhenever he has taken his side candidly and with understanding ; and he always will take his // side , as soon as he is satisfied that the subject is of sufficient importance to claim his decision . These questions generally grow less and less doubtful every day , the more they are examined and discussed , and the more liberally they are handled . Experience is a principal test of truth ; and as truth is founded on reality , or rather is reality itself , it will sooner or later be made manifest by that test . Sooner or later ; for in speaking of so long lived a thing as opinion , which dies not with one generation of men , but enjoys a spiritual and transmitted existence , we must not confine ourselves to short periods of time , but extend our view far behind and far before ,  --  back even to the day when man was created , and forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too apt to become impatient , when we can not see favorite opinions confirmed in our own lifetime . Our own lifetime is but a moment ; is but a single beat of the pendulum which measures out the solemn and majestic progress of the ages . We must not attach so much importance to the period ' of our life . The epochs of mind and morals must be regarded in conjunction with the life of our world ; nor must even that life be considered as a long one , as it respects that part of it which is past . The days of its years have as yet , probably been few , in comparison with those which are still to be numbered . In the mean time , our lives , though short , compose the age of the world , and our labors and inquiries , by their accumulation , must bring about the world 's improvement , and add , however gradually , to its experience . The duty involves a struggle , but it is not therefore to be avoided . Thus thought Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the shadow of a doubt seems ever to have passed over his mind , of the worth and the might of truth ; and he scorned with a lofty indignation all aids to her cause , but those which were offered by God 's good spirit , and man 's free mind . For who knows not , ' says he , that truth is strong , next to the Almighty ; she needs no policies , nor stratagems , nor licensings , to make her victorious ; those are the shifts and the defences that error uses against her power ; give her but room , and do not bind her when she sleeps ; for then she speaks not true , as the old Proteus did , who spake oracles only when he was caught and bound . ' lyXTith these convictions , Milton never hesitated in his course . Living in a time of great mental as well as physical conflict // and distraction , and conscious of the talents which , like power ful engines of warfare , had been given into his trust , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were at once his place and his privilege to contend for the rights of mankind . Though he loved peace , he loved truth more ; he loved the souls of men ; which is the dearest loves and stirs up to the noblest jealousy . ' He preferred his duty before his rest . He knew the toil and danger which awaited him ; hut he knew also that he had taken his part in the race where that immortal garland is to be run for , not without dust and heat . ' His great soul was in itself gentle and open as day , and in gentler times would not have appeared in so warlike a guise . He would willingly have framed his measures to the concords of peace ; hut , ' to use again his own matchless speech , when God commands to take the trumpet , and blow a dolorous or a jarring blast , it lies not in man's will what he shall say , or what he shall conceal . ' The voice of duty , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ; he did take the trumpet , and blow a blast of which all Europe rang from side to side ; ' a blast which even yet is not silent , but has come echoing down from year to year to us of the present , and will still go sounding on , clear toned and thrilling , through the unknoxvn depths of future time , and from region to region of the globe , till nations will hear and be roused up , that now are dead , and the heart of the whole world shall beat , like the heart of a single champion , at the summons of truth and liberty . The two principal objects of Milton 's attack , were the dignities , dogmas , and ceremonies of English prelacy and kingly forms of government . In his victorious career he met and overthrew all arguments from prescription , antiquity , and a false prudence and caution . Ije was awed by nothing human ; he despised all temporizing and halfway expedients in matters of great moment , all timid recipes of confections and potherbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of going too far in the direction of truth , or of announcing her dictates too boldly . We can not , however , in any way give so clear an exposition of his polemical spirit and style , as by quoting some passages from his works . Our first extract shall be from that splendid tract , the Areopagitica ; a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing . ' The paragraph , as will readily be seen , is an answer to the plea that an unrestricted // press becomes the source of schisms , and crowds of new and dangerous opinions . And what do they tell us vainly of new opinions , when this very opinion of theirs , that none must be heard but whom they like , is the worst and newest opinion of all others , and is the chief cause why sects and schisms do so much abound , and true knowledge is kept at distance from us ; besides yet a greater danger which is in it . For when God shakes a kingdom , with strong and healthful commotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sectaries and false teachers are then busiest in seducing . But yet more true it is , that God then raises to his own work men of rare abilities and more than common industry , not only to look back arid revise what hath been taught heretofore , but to gain further and to go on some new enlightened steps in the discovery of truth . For such is the order of God 's enlightening his church , to dispense and deal out by degrees his beam , so as our earthly eyes may best sustain it . Neither is God appointed and confined , where and out of what place these his chosen shall be first heard to speak ; for he sees not as man sees , chooses not as man chooses , lest we should devote ourselves again to set places and assemblies , and outward callings of men , planting our faith one while in the old Convocation house , and another while in the chapel at Westminster , when all the faith and religion that shall be there canonized , is not sufficient without plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supple the least bruise of conscience , to edify the meanest Christian , who desires to walk in the spirit , and not in the letter of human trust , for all the number of voices that can be there made ; no , though harry the Seventh himself there , with all his liege tombs about him , should lend them voices from the dead , to swell their number . And if the men be erroneous who appear to be the leading schismatics , what withholds us but our sloth , our selfwill , and distrust in the right cause , that we do not give them gentle meetings and gentle dismissions , that we debate not and examine the matter thoroughly , with liberal and frequent audience , if not for their sakes , yet for our own ? seeing no man who bath tasted learning , but will confess the many ways of profiting by those , who , not contented with stale receipts , are able to manage and set forth new positions to the world . And were they but as the dust and cinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may yet serve to polish and brighten the armory of truth , even for that respect they were not utterly to he cast away . But if they be of those whom God bath fitted for the special use of these times with eminent and ample gifts , and those perhaps neither among the priests nor among the Pharisees , and we in the haste of a precip* // itant zeal shall make no distinction , but resolve to stop their mouths , because we fear they come with new and dangerous opinions , as we commonly forejudge them ere we understand them , no less than *voe to us , while , thinking thus to defend the gospel , we are found the persecutors ! ' Vol. ii . pp. 69 , *O . We are mistaken if our readers do not find some passages here , which could have flowed from but few pens beside that of the author of Paradise Lost . Let us take another beautiful and indignant burst of eloquence from The Reason of Church Government urged against Prelaty . ' He denies the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reading this passage , as well as others in which prelacy is mentioned and mveigbed against , we must bear in mind what the establishment had been in the writer 's time , and how little reason he had to view it with respect or indulgence . It was not the prevention of schism , but it was schism itself , and the hateful thirst of lording in the church , that first bestowed a being upon prelaty ; this was the true cause , but the pretence is still the same . The l ) relates , as they would have it thought , are the only mauls of schism . Forsooth , if they be put down , a deluge of innumerable sects will follow ; we shall be all Brownists , Familists , Anabaptists . For the word Puritan seems to be quashed , and all that heretofore were counted such , are now Brownists . And thus do they raise an evil report upon the expected reforming grace that God bath bid us hope for ; like those faithless spies , whose carcasses shall perish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste the good of reformation . Do they keep away schism ? If to bring a numb and chill stupidity of soul , an unactive blindness of mind upon the people by their leaden doctrine , or no doctrine at all ; if to persecute all knowing and zealous Christians by the violence of their courts , be to keep away schism , they keep away schism indeed ; and by this kind of discipline all Italy and Spain is as purely and politically kept from schism as England bath been by them . With as good a plea might the dead palsy boast to a man , It is I that free you from stitches and pains , and the troublesome feeling of cold and heat , of wounds and strokes ; if I were gone , all these would molest you . The winter might as well vaunt itself against the spring ; I destroy all noisome and rank weeds , I keep down all pestilent vapors ; Yes , and all wholesome herbs , and all fresh dews , by your violent and hidebound frost ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , thus overgirded by your imprisonment , then the flowers put forth and spring , and then the sun shall scatter the mists , and the manuring // hand of the tiller shall root up all that burdens the soil without thank to your bondage . But far worse than any frozen captivity is the bondage of prelates ; for that other , if it keep down anything which is good within the earth , so doth it likewise that which is ill ; but these let out freely the ill , and keep down the good , or else keep down the lesser ill , and let out the greatest . ' Vol. i. pp. 123 , 124 . Again , to the same purpose is the following paragraph from the next chapter . As for those many sects and divisions rumored abroad to he amongst us , it is not hard to perceive that they are partly the mere fictions and false alarms of the prelates , thereby to cast amazements and panic terrors into the hearts of weaker Christians , that they should not venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I know not what worse inconveniences . With the same objected fears and suspicions , we know that subtle prelate , Gardner , sought to divert the reformation . It may suffice us to be taught by St Paul , that there must be sects for the manifesting of those that are soundhearted . These are but winds and flaws to try the floating vessel of our faith , whether it be stanch and sail well , whether our ballast be just , our anchorage and cable strong . By this is seen who lives by faith and certain knowledge , and who by credulity and the prevailing opinion of the age ; whose virtue is of an unchangeable grain , and whose of a slight wash . If God come to try our constancy , we ought not to shrink or stand the less firmly for that , but pass on with more steadfast resolution to establish the truth , though it were through a lane of sects and heresies on each side . ' Vol. i. p. 131 . But almost every page is alive with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The style is warm , surely . Who would wish it cold ? The expressions are glowing . How could they have been dull and dim , from such a man , in such a time , and against such opponents ?

And here withal I invoke the immortal Deity , revealer and judge of secrets , that wherever I have in this book plainly and roundly , though worthily and truly , laid open the faults and blemishes of fathers , martyrs , or Christian emperors , or have otherwise inveighed against error and superstition with vehement expressions ; 1 have done it , neither out of malice , nor list to speak evil , nor any vainglory , but of mere necessity to vindicate the spotless truth from an ignominious bondage , whose native worth is now become of such a low esteema that she is like to find // small credit with us for what she can say , unless she can bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove herself a retainer to Constantine , and wear his badge . More tolerable it were for the church of God , that , all these names were utterly abolished like the brazen serpent , than that men 's fond opinion should thus idolize them , and the heavenly truth be thus captivated . ' Vol. i. p. 9 . We are aware , however , that a heavier charge can be brought and sustained against Milton , than the controversial nature of his writings , or the force and warmth of their language . That language is not only forcible and warm ; it is occasionally intemperate and abusive , highly so . We may say , that it is not wonderful , that e*rcited and exasperated as the political and religious independents of England had been , their writers should have revenged themselves by harsh and scurrilous retorts ; but we can not help a feeling of disappointment , that the spirit of Milton did not sustain itself above such a low species of contention . Of the literary faults of his style , the principal seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast , and the almost interminable length to which many of them were drawn out . These , together with the tinge of antiquity which time has imparted to it , render his prose somewhat of a study to those who are not accustomed to the old writers . But the difficulty is no greater than a little practice will overcome ; till at last the taste will be pleased with peculiarities which at first greatly offended , or at least perplexed it . We will here introduce a quotation from his Reason of Church Government , ' in which his chief faults are exemplified . It consists of but one sentence , though we confess one of the longest , if not the longest in these volumes ; and it is pretty well seasoned with abuse , though not with the worst which his writings furnish . If it did not also present much of his true and characteristic vigor and richness , we should not have exhibited its appalling dimensions to our readers . This , too , is an invective against the Church of England and its ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her liturgy confesses to be perfect freedom ; but her works and her opinions declare that the service of prelaty is perfect slavery , and by consequence perfect falsehood ; which makes me wonder much that many of the gentry , studious men , as I hear , should engage themselves to write , and speak publicly in her defence ; but that I believe their honest and ingenuous natures , coming to the universities to store themselves // with good and solid learning , and there unfortunately fed with nothing else but the scragged and thorny lectures of monk .. ish and miserable sophistry , were sent home again with such a scholastical bur in their throats , as hath stopped and hindered all true and generous philosophy from entering , cracked their voices for ever with metaphysical gargarisms , and hath made them admire a sort of formal outside men , prelatically addicted , whose unchastened and unwrought minds were never yet initiated or subdued under the true lore of religion or moral virtue , which two are the best and greatest points of learning , but either slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literature to get their living by , and dazzle the ignorant , or else fondly overstudied in useless controversies , except those which they use with all the specious and delusive subtlety they are able , to defend their prelatical Sparta , having a gospel and church government set before their eyes , as a fair field wherein they might exercise the greatest virtues and the greatest deeds of christian authority , in mean fortunes and little furniture of this world ; which even the sage heathen writers , and those old Fabricii and Curii well knew to be a manner of working , than which nothing could liken a mortal man more to God , who delights most to work from within hiruselg and not by the heavy luggage of corporeal instruments ; they understand it not , and think no such matter , but admire and dote upon worldly riches and honors , with an easy and intemperate life , to the bane of Christianity ; yea , they and their seminaries shame not to profess , to petition , arid never leave pealing our ears , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they list with wealth , with deaneries and pluralities , with baronies and stately preferments , all learning and religion will go unUer foot ; which is such a shameless , such a bestial plea , and of that odious impudence in churchmen , who should be to us a pattern of temperance and frugal mediocrity , who should teach us to contemn this world , and the gaudy things thereof , according to the promise which they themselves require fiorn us in baptism , that should the scripture stand by and be mute , there is not that sect of philosophers among the heathen so dissolute , no not Epicurus , nor Aristippus with all his Cyrenaic rout , but would shut his schooldoors against such greasy sophisters ; not any college of mountebanks , but would think scorn to discover in themselves , with such a brazen forehead , the outrageous desire of filthy lucre , which the prelates make so little conscience of , that they are ready to fight , and if it lay in their power , to massacre all good Christians , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their temporal dignities , their unconscionable wealth and revenues , their cruel authority over their brethren // that labor in the word , while they snore in their luxurious excess , openly proclaiming themselves now in the sight of all men , to be those which for a while they sought to cover under sheep 's clothing , ravenous and savage wolves , threatening inroads and bloody incursions upon the flock of Christ , which they took upon them to feed , but now claim to devour as their prey ; more like that huge dragon of Egypt , breathing out waste and desolation to the land , unless he were daily fattened with virgin 's blood . Vol. i. pp. 177-179 . We should not be surprised , if this proved to be one of the longest periods on record . Such a tax upon patience is hardly to be borne , and not to be paid without a serious protest . But to return for a moment to the more important topic of Milton 's opinions . They were evidently in advance of the age ,  --  too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in advance of the world , and for a long time to come , perhaps , will continue to be so . On the subjects of toleration , religious liberty , civil and political rights , education , and the duties and prospects of men , he will forever be on an equal line with the most improved age ; for he marched forward at once to the utmost boundary of truth . His treatise on the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce , ' notwithstanding the side which it takes , is in its whole tendency favorable to purity and virtue . The domestic unhappiness with which he himself was afflicted , led him to consider this subject , and no doubt had its influence on his views of it . He convinced himself , and endeavored to convince others , that divorce should be granted on the grounds of opposition of sentiments , habits , temper , and feelings between the parties . But with whatever learning and fervor and skill he maintained this opinion , the convictions of the wisest , most virtuous , and most liberal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it false . We look on this instance as a remarkable proof of the grand principle which pervades all his works , that truth will at last prevail . It has prevailed over eloquence like his . We quit the subject of this article with reluctance . But we have only time again to recommend Mr Jenks 's Selection to the public . It contains several of Milton 's treatises entire , and all that is valuable , either for style or sentiment , in the rest . It is confined to his English prose only ; as the object of the editor was to make the English reader better acquainted with Milton 's own prose* not the prose of any translator . ' TJ*ie // Selection is prefaced by a historical account , exceedingly well drawn up , of his works , both English and Latin ; and further to bespeak general favor for these two volumes , we would remark that they afford to the reader , for the moderate price of three dollars , what he could not otherwise obtain for ten times the sum .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
