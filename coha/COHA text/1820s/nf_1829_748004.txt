txt degree of capacity for reflection to make it appear to the sufferer a subject of any importance what is the fate of either body or soul . Thus the mind is said to have been tranquillized , when , in fact , it was only benumbed , and rendered incapable of summoning its natural energies even to a contemplation so important and pressing as that of an eternal world . Whether this gradual insensibility , so often attendant upon sickness , is to be viewed as a merciful provision of the Almighty in order to divest the physical circumstance of dying of a part of its terrors ; - or whether it was intended as a warning to early and deep repentance before the approach of so precarious a season , it is not at present necessary to inquire . The only inference intended to be deduced is this , that if all the terrors of futurity , all the moral pains of dissolution , all the hopes and fears of an unknown world , are so often found incapable of arousing a dying man from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality , the mere circumstance of dying in calmness is by no means a sufficient evidence of a well-grounded hope of the felicities of Heaven . The inference is still more forcible , if surrounding friends , as too often happens , have anxiously guarded every avenue , to prevent the intrusion of that religious instruction and advice which were necessary to open the eyes of the unconscious sufferer . Moral causes may likewise combine with physical as a sedative in death . Ignorance , or unbelief , or ' ' hardness of heart , and contempt of God 's word and commandment , " may spread a deceitful calm which will but end in a sad reverse of eternal bitterness and disappointment . Allowing , however , for every , limitation and exception , it may still be laid down as a universal proposition , that where there visibly exists a firm belief in a future state of retribution , with a due sense of human sinfulness and guilt , nothing but the means of salvation revealed in the Gospel can give peace and /z/ satisfaction to the soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this vivid perception may oot exist ; but where it really doeg exist , there is assuredly but one means of obtaining repose . If this proposition be correct , it follows that wherever a death-bed has been really calm without any specific dependance upon the Redeemer , the effect has been produced either by ignorance or unbelief ; either by not knowing and believing in a future state of retribution , or by not duly considering that guilt and sinfulness of man which ought to render the idea of retribution alarming to the fallen mind . These two primary causes , may , however branch out into various subordinate ones ; but all these may be again traced back to their original sources of igno rance or skepticism . The various causes of falselyhappy deaths have been so well pointed out by a revered author of the present age that no apology is necessary for the quotation . " The blind are bold ; they do not see the precipice they despise . - Or , perhaps , there is less unwillingness to quit a world which has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last dregs . They leave life with less reluctance , feeling that they have exhausted all its gratifications. - Or it is a disbelief of the reality of the state on which they are about to enter . - Or it is a desire to be released from excessive pain , a desire naturally felt by those who calculate their gain rather by what they are escaping from , than by what they are to receive . - Or it is equability of temper , or firmness of nerve , or hardness of mind . - Or it is the arrogant wish to make the last act of life confirm its preceding professions . - Or it is the vanity of perpetuating their philosophic character . - Or , if * It will be seen that in this and the following remarks , it is taken for granted that the mind is capable of due reflection , and not become languid or indifferent by disease , or kept from serious thought by any external artifice. /q/ some faiDt ray of light break in , it is the pride of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire of posthumous renown among their own party ; the hope to make their disciples stand firm by their example ; ambition to give their Jast possible blow to Revelation - or , perhaps , the fear of expressing doubts which might beget a suspicion that their disbelief was not so sturdy as they would have it thought . Above all , may they not , as a punishment for their long neglect of the warning voice of truth , be given up to a strong delusion to believe the lie they have so often propagated , and really expect to find in death that eternal sleep with which they have affected to quiet their own consciences , and have really weakened the faith of others . " * Among the various particulars included in this statement there are several which do not exactly apply to the question at present under consideration . The greater number of these cases are evidently those of apparent , and not real tranquillity ; cases in which a mask is worn to deceive the spectator while the mind is fully conscious of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real calm in death can be produced ; - by ignorance respecting human guilt and a future state ; - by skepticism concerning them ; or by a knowledge that guilt has been expiated and punishment sustained on our behalf . It may not be improper to illustrate and confirm this remark by a few distinct references and observations . If we look back to the heathen world , we shall , it is true , discover almost innumerable instances of tranquil and even triumphant dissolution ; but in the majority of these cases ignorance was evidently the parent of this false peace . A human being wholly unconscious of spiritual subjects , unacquainted with his own immortality , with the nature of God and of him- * Practical by Miss H. More . /z/ // self , with bis aggravated ofiences against his Crealory and with the awful retribution which his offences merit , may die at ease because he ' ' dieth as the fool dieth . ' ' Amongst persons of this class the best and most enlightened individuals of the heathen world must be included . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of part at least of the truths just mentioned may still die in false peace through their ignorance of the remainder . One single incorrect idea , whether it be respecting the supposed indiscriminate mercy of God , or the innocence of man , or any other subject intimately connected with repose in death , may by its lethargic influence prevent the salutary effect of every other article of belief . A person may fearlessly plunge into an overwhelming stream , either from not knowing its rapidity and depth , or from a false opinion that he can stem its torrent , but in neither case is his rash security to be envied . The example , therefore , of a heathen , however enr lightened , ought not to be cited as a sufficient proof that a person ignorant of Christ , yet conscious of a future retribution , may nevertheless die in unaffected peace ; for though the person in question might know much , he could not possibly know all that was necessary to render the experiment complete . Allowing , for the sake of example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a judgment to come , still he could not be duly sensible of his own corrupt nature and personal demerits without being first acquainted with the original condition of man , his subsequent fall , the strictness of the divine law , his own personal transgressions of it , and in short , with all those circumstances which rendered an atonement necessary for human redemption . It is only therefore in cases in which these points are fully understood and believed , that we can correctly ascertain whether any consolation short of a genuine faith and dependance /z/ vpOD Jesus Christ can give satisfaction to a truly en fighteoed mind . Let us tbea turn from the heroes and philosophers of the classical world to that large class of persons wboy educated within the limits of Christendom , are seen to pass into eternity without manifesting fear or perturbation , though evidently destitute of any realizing views of that salvation , a knowledge of which is maintained to be so necessary for the repose of every well-infomied and tender conscience . Instances of this kind , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreconcilable with the doctrine laid down in the preceding remarks ; and in point of fact are so urged every day with a view to prove that after all our speculations there is in reality no great need for those religious feelings- and sentiments to which persons of seriously-disposed mind usually attach the highest ira* portance . If men , we are told , can die thus happily by means of their present general views of Christianity , there can be no particular necessity for entering more deeply into its peculiar disquisitions . In this objection it will be seen , that the knowledge and belief of the individual in Christianity are taken for granted from the mere circumstance of his having been born of Christian parentage and educated in a Christian country . Should it however appear , as will be hereafter shown , that notwithstanding these advantages he may very possibly be still ignorant or unbelieving respecting some important points revealed in the Gospel , it will follow , that amidst all his presumed light and information he is but a heathen with the name of a Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks already made respecting the nations who know not , or believe not , those truths which made an atonement indispensable . In the mean time it should be observed , that that objection may be carried much further than the objector himself might be disposed to allow . For if the // single circumstance of calmness in death is to determine the sufficiency of a person 's religious belief , heathenism itself will not be without its triumphs , and all the calm and heroic deaths of classical antiquity roust henceforth be narrated as proofs of the adequacy of the systems beneath whose influence they originated . Had this calmness been connected with a due knowledge and belief , the case would have been far more relevant and convincing . It would be , perhaps , considered as a somewhat harsh assertion , though it is perfectly true , that the deaths of a large portion of professed Christians are tranquil only on the very same grounds as those of many heathens were tranquil also . Men are oftentimes accustomed to bring forward the generic rather than the specific idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means unusual to find professedly Christian writers selecting examples of happy deaths almost indiscriminately from heathens , heretics , and true believers , with , perhaps , scarcely a single warning to point out the important specific difiTerences between the religious systems of the various persons whose characters are discussed . Thus , under one generic name , we are told of the pious and happy death of Cyrus , or Socrates , or some other favorite of antiquity , in nearly the same terms which are elsewhere employed to characterize that of a Christian martyr or apostle . The features which are common to all are minutely pourtrayed , while those which are peculiar to the latter are overlooked . It is the frame of mind simply considered , and not as connected with Christian truth , that excites their attention . The marked and important difference , not merely between the hopes of these classes of persons , but also between the grounds on which those hopes depend , is quite overlooked amidst the spurious Catholicism of a universal creed . The worshipper of Jehovah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one found in an /z/ awful ignorance of bis moral condition that calm which the other derived from a well-founded hope in his Redeemer , it is predicted of both alike that they expired in piety and peace . It would however be very probably urged by the objector in return , that his argument was intended to apply solely to professed Christians . He would , perhaps , allow that in a heathen , or even in a vicious man , a peaceful death must of course be connected with a considerable degree of ignorance or unbelief ; but he would add , that where the individual was a baptized person , and there existed no particular viciousness of character , calmness in death , even though unconnected with any peculiar reliance on the atonement of Christ , would be nevertheless not a deceitful but a rational and well-founded repose , grounded on general views of the Creator 's mercy , though not specifically dependent upon any idea of the merits and propitiation of the Redeemer . Here then we return to the precise point of controversy ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an idle speculation ; for if what is currently applauded and envied as an easy and hopeful death , be in truth oftentimes nothing more than the natural consequence of ignorance or infidelity , or both in conjunction , nothing surely can be more evident than the necessity of careful self-examination , in order that our tranquillity in dissolution may not be followed by a far more dreadful death than the one whose terrors we had thoughtlessly despised . How often do we hear it remarked respecting persons the most heedless and irreligious , that ' ' he died like a lamb . " - He died like a lamb ! Impossible , if in the full possession of his mental faculties he seriously contemplated his Maker and himself , as they are both exhibited in Scripture , without at the same time taking fully into his account the redemption that is in Christ Jesus . Impossible , if be adequately saw and feh /z/ the disease without being enabled to apply the remedy . Impossible , if he knew and believed his guilt , without reposing by faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . If dying ignorant of Christ Jesus , he died in comfort , or at least in what unjustly bears that name , he could not assuredly credit the denunciations of Divine wrath ; or , believing them , did not see how justly they applied to himself . Here then existed some degree of ignorance or unbelief ; and , in fact , there is no subject upon which men in general , even in a Christian country , are so skeptical as on that of their own personal sinfulness and spiritual inability . If they do not discredit akogether the doctrine of future rewards and punishments , they are at least ignorant or unbelieving respecting their own individual demerits , and consequently expect , what the Almighty has no where promised to grant , that their contaminated and imperfect righteousness shall be found worthy of procuring their admission into heaven . But if they really felt , with the true members of the church , that " there is no health in them , " nothing short of a scriptural knowledge of the great Physician of souls could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal punishment is their desert by nature , they could venture to cherish no hope of heaven but by the free grace of Christ . The expectation ol the end without any reference to the only means is evidently a serious error ; or if , in order to supply this defect , the means are supposed to consist in human merit and human works , that very ignorance is incidentally betrayed the existence of which it was the object of the present argum.ent to prove . To know Revelation justly includes in its very elements the knowledge of our being by nature in a situation so guilty and alarming that " without the shedding oj blood there is no remission . " It is true that hardness of heart , and the other causes which have been already enumerated , may conduce /q/ to a false peace ; but the meanfl bj which thej operate are undoubtedly conuected with the encour* agement of latent ignorance , or infidelity ; for were the whole subject fiMy understood and credited , who would be able to harden his heart , or proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe fully would create in the dying sinner much the same mental feelings as those which he must necessarily experience at the last day , when knowledge and conviction shall both irresistibly flash upon his conscience . The awfulness of his condition will not be in itself more alarming a million of years hence than it is at the moment of dissolution , and the only reason why it will affect the mind in a more powerful and impressive manner is , that he will then be permitted no longer to fortify his heart either by misconception or skeptical indifference . Satiety and disappointment , equability of nerve and philosophical pride , with all those other causes which have been mentioned in a preceding extract , would have no power to make a sinner really calm in death , were they not combined with some secret ignorance or doubt respecting the certainty of that eternal punishment which his sins have incurred . The case of our great English moralist is a most decisive illustration of the impossibility of discovering any mode of solacing a scripturally enlightened conscience except that which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sinfulness in the sight of God , he might have expired , as thousands every day expire , in a blind and fatal repose ; or had be been inclined to infidelity , he might have jested , like Hume and others of a similar school , on the subject of his approaching dissolution . Neither , however , of these effects would have constituted that true peace which his spiritually directed mind so eagerly sought , and which , before bis death , he most certainly obtained . * Page 4. 12 TftOE 1K0 ALSE A few practical remarks upon the subject of the hurt hours of this illustrious man wiU not only be a forcible comment upon the foregoing propositions , but will tend to show that what Dr. Johnson 's best biographers have been almost ashamed to confess , and have industriously eiLerted themselves to palliate , constituted , in truth , the most auspicious circumstance of his life , and was the best proof of his increase in religious knowledge and holiness of mind . Whoever considers with a Christian eye the death of Dr. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Providence , it could not have been free from agitation and anxiety . Johnson was a man of tender conscience , and one who from his very infancy had been instructed in Christian principles . But be was also , in the strict judgment of revealed religion , an inconsistent man . Neither his habits nor his companions had been such as his own conscience approved ; and even a short time before his end we find one of his biographers lamenting that " the visits of idle and some worthless persons were never unwelcome to him , ** on the express ground that " these things drove on time . " His ideas of morality being of the highest order , many things which are considered by men at large as but venial ofiences appeared to him as positive crimes . Even his constitutional indolence and irritability of mind were sufficient of themselves to keep him constantly humbled and self-abased ; and though among his gay or literary companions he usually appears upon the comparatively high ground of a Christian moralist , and the strenuous defender of revealed religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , he felt himself both defective and disobedient . Together with this conscientious feeling he had adopted certain incorrect , not to say superstitious , ideas , respecting the method of placating the Deity . He seems , for example , to have believed that penance , in its confined and popish sense , as distinguished from /q/ simple peniteDce , is of great avail in procuring the Divine favor and forgiveness . Thus vtrben his conscience distressed him on account of act of disobedience to his parent , we find him manj years afterwards remaining a considerable time bare-headed in the rain , exposed in the public streets to the ridicule and the conjectures of every spectator . As far as filial affection and true amiableness of mind are concerned , the actor in such a scene deserves and ensures universal veneration and esteem* Even while we smile at the somewhat ludicrous nature of the action , we instinctively feel a sympathy and respect which perhaps a wiser but less remarkable mode of exhibiting his feelings might not have procured . But Johnson seems to have performed this humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he emphatically adds , " In contrition I stood , and I hope the penance was ex* piatory . If these words really mean any thing - and when did Dr. Johnson utter words without meaning ? - he must have intended by them to express his hope that the previous fault was really atoned for , in a religious sense , by the subsequent act of self-denial ; or , in other words , that God accepts human penance as an expiation for human sins ; a doctrine to which revealed religion gives no sanction whatever . Johnson 's system appears at this time to have been , as it were , a sort of barter between himself and Heaven , and consequently his chief fear was , lest the equivalent which he presented should not be sufficient to entitle him in the divine mercy to the pardon of his transgressions . His trust on the Redeemer , though perfectly sincere , does not appear to have been either exclusive or implicit ; for though all his prayers for mercy and acknowledgements of blessings were oSered up solely through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in point of fact , for many years to have viewed the atonement rather as a medium through which God U V4 /z/ to accept our imperfect services and to make them adequate , by the conditions of a remedial law , to the purchase of heaven , than as a sacrifice by which akm heaven is fuUy secured and freely given to the bdieving penitent . Dr. Johnson 's line of reading in IKvinitj was perhaps unfavorable to a full perception of Christian truth . The writings of Mr. Law , in particufaury which he had studied with some attention , were by no means well adapted to his peculiar case . For a thoughtless , a frivolous , or an impenitent sinner , the ' Serious Call " might have been eminently useful in exciting a deep consciousness of guilt , a salutary remorse for the past , and holy resolutions for the future ; and as far as these elements of religion extend , the perusal of this celebrated book might doubtless have had some good effect upon the mind of Dr. Johnson . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisguised exhibition of a Redeemer whose sacrifice is perfect and all-sufficient , in the inculcation of the gracious promises of a reconciled Father to the returning prodigal , Law , and other writers of a similar school , are undoubtedly defective , and the same defect seems to have characterized for many years the views of our illustrious moralist . He lived in a. perpetual dilemma , by trusting to works which his well-informed conscience told him were not good , and yet on the goodness of which , in conjunction at least with the merits of Christ , he placed his dependence for eternity . To give therefore comfort to the mind of such a man as Dr. Johnson , there were but two modes ; either by blinding his conscience , or by increasing his faith ; either by extenuating his sins , or by pointing out in all its glories the sufficiency of the Christian ransonu The friends who surrounded this eminent man during the greater part of his life , were little qualified to perform the latter , and therefore very naturally resorted to the former . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony ; but instead of examining the wound and /q/ applying the remedy , they contented themselves with administering anodynes and opiates , and persuading their afflicted friend , that there existed no cause of danger or alarm . But Johnson was not thus deceived . The nostrum which has lulled its millions to a fatal repose , on him , by the mercy of Grod , had no effect . His convictions of sin were as lasting as they were deep ; it was not therefore until he had discarded his natural and longcherished views of commutation and human desert , and had learned to trust humbly and exclusively to his Saviour , that his mind became at peace . Let us view sotpe of the recorded circumstances of the transaction ; and in so doing , we shall , as Christians , have much more occasion to applaud the scriptural correctness of Johnson 's feelings respecting the value of his soul , and the guilt f his nature , and the inadequacy of man 's best merits and repentance , than to congratulate him upon the accession of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded his dying pillow . Finding him in great mental distress , ** I told him , " remarks one of his biographers , * " of the many enjoyments of which I thought him in possession , namely , a permanent income , tolerable heaJth , a high degree of reputation for his moral qualities and literary exertions , " &; c . Had Johnson 's depression of mind been nothing more than common melancholy or discontent , these topics of consolation would have been highly appropriate ; they might also have been fitly urged as arguments for gratitude and thanksgiving to the Alngbty , on account of such exalted mercies . In either of these points of view , the piety of Dr. Johnson would doubtless have prompted him to acknowledge the value of the blessing , and the duty of contentment and praise . But , as arguments for quieting an alarmed Sir John Hawkins . /z/ conscience , they were quite inadequate , for what would it have profited this distinguished man , to have gained all his well-merited honors , or even were it possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should become , as he himself afterwards expressed it ** a castaway /z/ The feelings of Dr. Johnson on this subject were more fully evidenced on a subsequent occasion . One day , in particular , " remarks Sir John Hawkins , ' when I was suggesting to him these and the like reflections , be gave thanks to Almighty God , but added , that notwithstanding all the above benefits , the prospect of death , which was now at no great distance from him , was become terrible , and that be could not think of it but with great pain and trouble of mind . " Nothing assuredly could be more correct , than Dr. Johnson 's distinction . He acknowledged the value of the mercies which he enjoyed , and be gratefully gave thanks to Almighty God " for them ; but he felt that they could not soften the terrors of a death-bed , or make the prospect of meeting his Judge less painful and palling . Hawkins , who could not enter into his illustrious friend 's more just and enlarged views of human guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much surprised and shocked at such a declaration from such a man , " and proceeded therefore to urge for his comfort the usual arguments of extenuation . He reports that he " told him that he conceived his life to have been a uniform course of virtue ; that he had ever shown a deep sense of , and zeal for religion ; and that , both by his example and his writings , he had recommended the practice of it ; that he had not rest ed , as many do , in the exercise of common honesty , avoiding the grosser enormities , yet rejecting those advantages that result from the belief of Divine Revelation ; but that he had , by prayer and other exercises of devotion , cultivated in his mind the seeds of goodness , and was become habitually pious . " /q/ This was the rock on which numberless professed Christians have fatally split ; and to the mercy of the Almighty must it be ascribed , that the great and good Dr. Johnson did not add one more to the melancholy catalogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inculcate but this ? that his friend , like the Pharisee in the Gospel , ought to place his confidence upon his being more meritorious than other men , and instead of attributing the praise to Him who bad * made him to differ , " was to " sacrifice to his own net , and burn incense to his own drag . " Can we wonder , that with such flattering doctrines constantly sounding in his ears . Dr. Johnson was suffered to undergo much severe mental discipline , in order to reduce him in his own esteem to that lowly place , which as a human , and consequently a fallen being , it was his duty , however high his attainments or his talents , to occupy ? The snare of spiritual pride , which Sir John Hawkins thus unconsciously spread for his dying friend , was the more seductive from the circumstance of Dr. Johnson 's life having been upon the whole correct and laudable , and from his writings having been eminently useful for the promotion of morality and virtue . The convictions of a profligate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quieted by such common-place soporifics ; but where there was really so much apparent cause for self-complacency and graiulaiion , as in the case of Dr. Johnson , it must appear almost wonderful that the self-riglrteous delusion did not succeed . It would undoubtedly have given this biographer much satisfaction to have heard from his friend tiio usual language of an unsubdued heart . " I thank God , that upon the whole I have acted my part well upon the stage of life . We are all frail and fallible , but I have no great sins to account for . I have been honest and charitable ; my conduct , I trust , has been with /z/ some few exceptions , * one uniform course of virtue ; ' I therefore die in peace , looking forward to that happiness which , I trust , my actions have ensured , from a God of infinite mercy and compassion . " But to the humble and well-informed Christian , the penitential sorrows of Johnson , ( springing , as they did , from a heart ill at ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrant sin as from a general sense of the exalted nature of the divine law and the imperfections of the best human obedience , ) will appear a happier and surer pledge of his scriptural renovation of mind than the most rapturous expressions which Pharisaic confidence could have produced . The self-righteous arguments of Hawkins could not , however , touch the case of Johnson . " These suggestions , " he continues , " made little impression on him ; he lamented the indolence in which he had spent his life ; talked of secret transgressions , and seemed desirous of telling me more to that purpose than I was willing to hear . " Happy was it for Dr. Johnson that his confessor 's arguments produced so little effect , and that he was at length instructed by a better guide than his well-meaning , but inexperienced friend . Had the arguments of Hawkins effected their intended operation , we should have seen one of the greatest and most powerful minds that ever animated a human frame quitting its frail receptacle in a flimsy robe of selfrighteousness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the soul naked , and guilty , and defenceless before its Almighty Judge . It is easy to conceive the language of a plain practical Christian , while he stood beside the death-bed of such a man as Dr. Johnson , and poured in the balm of religious consolation . " I fully admit , " he might have said , " your sins , yet I would point you to an allpowerful Saviour , and turn those very apprehensions and that godly sorrow into motives for repose . True , ou are in yourself all that you have confessed yourself /q/ to be ; and if you were not , a Redeemer would be of no yaluei for Christ came * not to heal the whole , but them that are sick . ' I rejoice that you thus feel and acknowledge your transgressions ; for though beyond most men you have cause for gratitude , though you have enjoyed God 's highest gifts , though by bis preventing grace , operating through the medium of a religious education and a tender conscience , you have been enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unto God . ' What you have you have received , and great therefore as may have been your talents , and useful as may have been your life , you have nothing so good and perfect as to be fit to offer to the Almighty as a claim to heaven . Yet , on the other hand , is not your very consciousness of guilt the best hope of safety , the brightest omen of pardon f Has it not bowed you down in contrition f Has it not taught you the inestimable value of the Redeemer 's sacrifice and death f You acknowledge yourself a sinner ; and what is the characteristic of the Gospel , but that the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin ? On this rock only can you find a firm founda* tion for the hopes of a human soul ; but here it may build securely , amidst all the agitating storms of an alarmed conscience and a tempestuous world . Repose then upon your Saviour in simple and firm reliance , knowing that he possesses the same ability and will to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , confessed himself the * chief of sinners , ' but who nevertheless found peace in his Redeemer , and was eventually filled ' with joy unspeakable and full of glory . ' Look then to Him who is * the Author and Finisher of our faith , ' and to Him from whom ' all good desires do proceed ; ' contemplate the end , the nature , the extent , the value of the sacrifice of Christ , and see whether there be any scriptural reason why you should be excluded from its benefits . Look also to that Divine Spirit , who is the guide , the enlightener , the consoler , /z/ and the sanctifier of the Christian Church , to subdue unbelief , to increase faith , and to implant a never-ending hope which shall support you amidst all the afflictions of life , and raise you far above the terrors of the grave . " Thus a plain and honest religious friend might have gone on to " preach the Gospel " in that simplicity with which it was at first dispensed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grace , the mercy , the compassion of God ; the atonement and intercession of Christ ; the promised influence of the Holy Spirit ; with every other topic connected with the salvation and happiness of a penitent transgressor . There might , indeed , have been nothing remarkably novel or inviting in the manner of stating these simple truths ; yet , coming from a warm and honest heart , and being accompanied with that divine benediction which is never wanting where the soul has been prepared by humility and contrition for its reception , they might have produced the happiest effects , when philosophic suasion and human advice had exerted themselves in vain . In moments of great mental distress , arguments which even a child in religion could readily discover and apply , might be wanting to quiet the mind of eveh such a man as Dr. Johnson himself . But in the narrative of Hawkins , and in the arguments which we find him proposing to the dying moralist , these and similar topics of genuine consolation appear to have had no place . That " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or only incidentally , mentioned ; and we find the narrator continuing in the following strain his inefiicient consolations : " In a visit which I made him in a few days , in consequence of a very pressing request to see me , I found him laboring under very great dejection of mind . He bade me draw near to him , and said he wanted to enter into a serious conversation with me ; and upon my expressing my willingness to join in it , he , with a /q/ look that cut me to the heart , told me that he had the prospect of death before him , and that he dreaded to meet bis Saviour . I could not but be astonished at such a declaration , and advised him , as I had done before , to reflect on the course of.his life , and the ser* vices which he had rendered to the cause of religion and virtue , as well by his example as his writbgs ; to which he answered , that he had written as a philosopher , but bad not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reasoned thus : Every man knows his own sins , and what grace he has resisted . But to those of others , and the circumstances under which they were committed , he is a stranger . He is therefore to look on himself as the greatest sinner that he knows of . ' At the conclusion of this argument , which he strongly enforced , he uttered this passionate impassioned exclamation : Shall I , who have been a teacher of others , be myself a cast-away ? ' " In this interestmg passage - interesting as detailing the religious progress of such a mind as Dr. Johnson 's - *how many important facts and reflections crowd upon the imagination ! We see the highest human intellect unable at the approach of death to find a single argument for hope or comfort , though stimulated by the mention of all the good deeds and auspicious forebodings which an anxious and attentive friend could suggest . Who that beholds this eminent man thus desirous to open his mind , and to enter into a serious conversation " upon the most momentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but must regret that he had not found a spiritual adviser who was capable of fully entering into his feelings , and administering scriptural consolation to his afflicted mind ? The narrator informs us in this passage , that ' he could not but be astonished at such a declaration " as that which Dr. Johnson made . But in reality , where was the real ground for astonishment f Is it astonishing that an inheritor of a fallen and corrupt nature vilvo // is about to quit the world , and to be * ' judged according to the deeds done in the body , ' ' should be alarmed at the anticipation of the event , and be anxious to understand fully the only mode of pardon and acceptance ? Rather is it not astonishing that every other intelligent man does not feel at his last hour the same anxieties which Dr. Johnson experienced ? - unless , mdeed , they have been previously removed by the hopes revealed in that glorious dispensation which alone undertakes to point out in what way the Almighty sees fit to pardon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished who knew his own heart ; for , as Dr. Johnson truly remarked , every Christian , how lair soever his character in the estimation of others , ought to look upon Umself as the greatest sinner that he knows of ; " a remark , be it observed , which shows how deeply Dr. Johnson had begun to drink into the spirit of that great Apostle , who , amidst all his excellencies , confessed and felt himself , as was just remarked , " the chief of sinners . " What a contrast does the advice of Hawkins , as stated by himself in the preceding passage , form to the scriptural exhortation of our own Church ! Instead of advising his friend seriously to examine himself ' whether he repented him truly of his former sins , steadfastly purposing ( should he survive ) to lead a new life , having a lively faith in God 's mercy dirougfa Christ , with a thankful remembrance of his death , and being in charity with all men , " he bids him look back to his past goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hope and satisfaction which he had anticipated . But the truth was , that on the subject of religion , as on every other . Dr. Johnson entertained far more correct ideas than the friends around him ; and though he had not hitherto found peace with his Creator , through the blood of Jesus Christ , yet he could not be satisGed with the ordinary consolations of an uninformed or Pharisaic mind . /q/ The sun did not , however , set in this long continued cloud ; for Johnson at length obtained comfort , where alone true comfort could be obtained , in the sacrifice and mediation of Jesus Christ ; a circumstance to which Sir John Hawkins transiently alludes , but the particulars of which must be supplied from the narra* tiFe of Boswell , whose words are as follows : Dr. Brocklesby , who will not be suspected of fanaticism , obliged me with the following account : Far some time before his death all his fears were ffdhned and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith , and his trust in the merits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the necessity of faith in the sacrifice of Jesus , as necessary , beyond all good works whatever , for the salvation of mankind , " allowing for the brevity of this statement , and for the somewhat chilling circumstance of its coming from the pen of a man who ' will not be suspected of fanaticism , " what a triumph was here for the plain unsophisticated doctrines of the Gospel , especially that of free justification by faith in Jesus Christ ! After every other means had been tried , and tried in vain , a simple penitential reliance upon the sacrifice of the Redeemer , produced in the heart of this devout man a peace and satisfaction which no reflections upon human merit could bestow . He seems to have acquired a completely new idea of Christian theology , and could doubtless henceforth practically adopt the animating language of his own church in her eleventh article , ' " that we are justified by faith only , is a most wholesome doctrine , and very full of comfort . " There are several ways in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , of which the most correct perhaps is that of its having been permitted as a kind and fatherly chastisement from the Almighty for the inconsistencies of his life . Both Johnson himself and his most partial biographer intimate that his character was not perfectly free even /z/ from gross sins : but , omittiog these unpleasant recollections , we are at least certain that bis general habits and companions during a considerable part of his life were not such as a strictly consistent Christian would have chosen , because they were not such as could in any way conduce to his spiritual comfort or improvement . Dr. J. was indeed called in the usual course of Providence to live in the world , " but it was his duty so to have lived iu it " as not of it ; " and with the high sense which he uniformly entertained of religion , and the vast influence which he had justly acquired in society , his conduct and example would have been of the greatest service in persuading men to a holy as well as a virtuous life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to a general decorum and purity of conduct . It is certain that in reflecting upon his past life he did not view it as having been truly and decidedly Christian . He even prays in his dying hours that God would " pardon his late conversion ; " thus evidencing not simply the usual humility and contrition of every genuine Christian , but , in addition to this , a secret consciousness that his heart had never before been en tirely " right with God . " Had Johnson survived this period of his decisive " conversion , " we might have expected to have seen throughout his conduct that he had indeed become ' a new creature in Christ Jesus . " His respect for religion , and his general excellence of character , could not perhaps have admitted of much visible change for the better ; but in heavenly-mindedness , in love and zeal for the souls of men , in deadness to the world and to fame , in the choice of books and companions , and in the exhibition of all those spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might and must have beheld a marked improvement . Instead of being merely the Seneca of the English nation , he might possibly have become its Saint Paul ; and would /q/ doubtless in future have embodied his moral injunctions , not in the cold form of ethical philosophy , or even in the generalities of the Christian religion , but in an ardent love to God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ ; in a union to the Redeemer and a dependence upon that Holy Spirit who is the Enlightener and Sanctifier . That such a supposition is not visionary , may be proved even from the meagre accounts afforded by a spectator who would of course be inclined rather to soften down than to give prominence to any thing which might be construed into " fanaticism . " We learn then from this witness , that in point of fact there was already a marked alteration in Dr. Johnson 's language upon religion , as instead of spending his time upon barren generalities , " he talked often about the necessity of faith in Jesus " That of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless have appeared to him as of the utmost importance ; and we have to lament - if indeed any dispensation of Providence may be lawfully lamented - that Johnson bad not lived to check the Pelagianism and Pharisaism of his age , by proclaiming " often , " and with all the weight of his authority , that " faith in the sacrifice of Jesus is necessary , beyond all good works whatever , for the salvation of mankind . " It will of course be readily allowed , that the eonstitutional melancholy of this great man might have had much influence in causing this religious depression ; but whatever may have been the proximate cause , the affliction itself may still be viewed as performing the office of parental correction to reclaim his relapses , and teaoh him the hatefulness and folly of sin . But without speculating upon either the final or the efiicient cause , the medium through which that cause operated was evidently an indistinctness in his views respecting the nature of the Redeemer 's atonement ; an indistinctness common to Dr. Johnson with no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ // in the sacrifice of Christ , but he knew little of its fbl* ness and its freeness , and he was unable to appropriate it to his own case . He was perhaps little in the habk of contemplating the Son ol God as ' a great Priest , who can be touched with the fueling of our infirmities , " and who is graciously interceding on our behalf . The character of the Almighty as a reconciled Father and Friend , with whom he was to have daily ' * communion and fellowship , " Was less prominent in his thoughts than those attributes which render him ' ' a consuming fire . " He feared and respected religion rather than loved it , and by building his structure for many years on a self-righteous foundation , rendered the whole fabric liable to be overthrown by the first attack of an accusing conscience . In reply to any general inference to be derived from these remarks , it may be urged , that Dr. Johnson 's was a peculiar and exempt case ; and that his painful feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness , were rather the effect of his natural malady than of any peculiarly correct ideas upon religion . But even admitting this to have been the fact , the inference is still nearly the same ; for who can assert that either his understanding or his character has been superior to Dr. Johnson 's , and that therefore he may be justly sustained in death by a support which this eminent man - from whatever cause - found unavailing . If the greatest moralist of his age and nation was obliged at length to seek repose in the same free mercy which pardoned the thief upon the cross , who that knows his own heart will henceforth venture to glory in himself ? The conscience may indeed be seared ; we may not feel as Johnson felt ; we may be ignorant both of God and of ourselves ; and thus , for want of knowing or believing our spiritual danger , may leave the world with a false tranquillity , and enter the presence of our Creator " with a lie in our right hand . " All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be our boast ; for if our minds were as religiously enlighteued , and our hearts as correctly impressed as Dr. Johnson 's , we could obtain hope only where he obtained it , by faith in the sacrifice of Jesus . " The case , however , of Dr. Johnson is not an exempt case ; for what has been the feeling of true Christians in every age , but one of a similar , though perhaps less marked and conspicuous kind f The devout and eminent George Herbert remarked upon his death-bed , ' I have nothing to present to Grod but sin and misery ; but the first is pardoned , and a few hours will now put an end to the latter . " His friend , like Dr. Johnson 's , began to remind him of ' his many acts of mercy , " but this holy man ventured not to put any trust in them for his salvation . They be good iror , " said he , ' if they he sprinkled with Ae blood of Christy but not otherufiseJ He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt Aeir importance and necessity ; and doubtless concurred with that kindred spirit , Richard Hooker , in his well-known remark " We acknowledge a dutiful necessity of doing well , but the meritorious dignity of doing well we utterly renounce . " No inference therefore can be more wide of that intended to be deduced in the present essay , than that the retrospect of a holy life is of little importance upon a death-bed . On the contrary , good men in every age have felt it to be a high consolation , and a source of the most unbounded gratitude to Grod , if they have been enabled by his grace to maintain a holy and exemplary deportment ; but as the meritorious cause of human redemption , as die plea upon which our hopes are to be founded for eternity , nothing assuredly can be more unscriptural and fallacious than self-dependence and desert . Dr. John Donne , the proverbially pious satirist and poet of the sixteenth century , remarked upon his death-bed in nearly the same words with his friend /z/ George Herbert , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sin and misery , yet I know he looks upon me , not as I am in myself , but as I am in my Saviour . " With the names of Donne and Herbert is intimately and pleasingly associated that of the meek and learned Hooker ; and who that has heard of the eminently religious , and amiable life of this revered man , but remembers also his deeply penitential confession in the hour of death f " I have lived to see that this worid is made up of perturbations , and I have long been preparing to leave it , and gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with God , which I noii apprehend to be near . And though I have by his grace loved him in my youth , and feared him in mine age , and labored to have a conscience void of offence to him , and to all men ; yet if thou , O Lord , be ex* treme to mark what I have done amiss , who can abide it f And therefore where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I plead not my righteousness Im the forgiveness of my unrighteousnessj for His merit who died to purchase a pardon for penitent sinners , It was this plea of free grace that enabled him to say with bis last breath , " God hath heard my daily petitions ; for I am at peace with all men , and he is ai peace with me ; and from which blessed assurance 1 feel that inward joy , which this world can neither give nor take from me . " After mentioning Hooker , we ought not to pass ovei that other great apologist of the church of England Bishop Jewel , . from whom we hear similar confession ! and anticipations . He was not , he said , afraid to die but assigned as his reason , not the goodness of his pas* life , though it had been almost inimitably good , bu that he had " a gracious Lord , " adding , " there U laid up for me a crown of righteousness . - CAm u my righteousness J But these persons , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supposed to be more intimately acquainted with the technical language of religion than other men . Select then the case of the virtuous and heroic Philip Sidney. * He was a soldier , and a brave one ; yet he died the death of a humble Christian . In him we see a character upon which calumny herself has been able to fix no spot . His country reposed upon him with full confidence as its most hopeful friend and protector , and in defence of that country he lost , in the field of battle , his valuable life . Posterity has vied with his contemporaries in doing justice to his memory and perpetuating his varied excellencies . The venerable Camden speaks of him at once with rapture and regret , as " the great hope of mankind , " " the most lively pattern of virtue , and the darling of the world ; " the hero ' whose virtues have come to perfection , " and whom men ought for ever to commemorate " not with tears but admiration . " Yet this man , of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and upon whose virtues and untimely death rival universities poured forth volume upon volume of eulogies and regrets ; - this man , thus flattered and caressed , found at length that " all was vanity , " and that nothing could give him peace upon a death-bed but the same humble hope which fills the bosom of the most illiterate and lowly Christian . As a soldier , nothing could daunt the mind of Sir Philip Sidney ; yet , remarks one of his biographers , ' ' the guilt of sin , the present beholding of death , the terror of God 's judgment-seat , which seemed in hot displeasure to cut him down , concumng , did make a * It may perhaps be necessary to apologize for the triteness of such examples as Johnson , Herbert , Donne , Hooker , Jewel , Sidney , &c.; which are selected , not because others equally appropriate , and less hackneyed , might not have been easily produced ; but because the celebrity of these persons renders their conduct more interesting and convincing than that of persons less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected for the sake of practieal effect /z/ // fear and astonishment in his mind . " He , boweveri at length obtained peace through his Saviour , ** giving thanks to God that he did chastise him with a loving and fatherly coercion , and to his singular profit , vihether to live or die . " Deeply feeling his transgressions , he " vowed with an unfeigned heart and full purpose , if God should give him life , to consecrate the same to his service , and to make his glory the mark of all his actions . " The mental distress of Sidney did not arise , any more than that of Dr. Johnson , from the usual remorse attendant upon an irregular and vicious life . On the contrary , both these men had lived virtuously and usefully in the world ; but , amidst all their exemplary qualities , they could find no security in their last hours except in self-renunciation and faith in Christ . Sidney 's biographer expressly relates that , " although be had professed the gospel , loved and favoured those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church , taken good order and very good care for his family and soldiers to be instructed , and be brought to live accordingly ; yet entering into deep'examination of his life now in the time of his affliction , he felt those inward motions and workings of* Grod 's Holy Spirit in his conscience exciting him to a deep sorrow for his former conduct . " Again , " his former virtues seemed nothing , for he wholly condemned his former life . " " I have no comfort , " added he , " in that way : reflecting on his past virtues , all things in my former life have been vain , vain , vain . " How different these expressions of a renewed heart from that unscriptural common-place gratulation which is so often witnessed on similar occasions ! If even a Sidney , that " most lively pattern of virtue , " could not look back with complacency or forward with hope , trusting in any measure to his own merits , who under similar circumstances of life can be reasonably consid- * Hiatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-confidence ? The important subject which occupied his time from the moment of his fatal wound to his death , was the ascertaming the real bearings of his religious character . ** He did grow weaker and weaker in bodj , and thereby gathered that he should die , which caused him to enter yet into a more correct consideration of himself , what assurance he had of salvation ; and having , by the promises of God , and testimony of his graces which he felt working in him , gathered his assurance of God 's favour unto eternal life , and made him perceive that he did chastise him , as a most kind Father , to fashion him to his will , he said that he feared not to die . " This paragraph , though couched in language very different from the current phrases of modern theology , being such as to many persons may appear somewhat unphilosophical and enthusiastic , contains , when properly considered , a most important lesson for ascertaining the truth or fallacy of our religious hopes . Sir Philip Sidney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ought to be , of ascertaining " what assurance he had of salvation , " which , on the ground of human desert , we have already seen he did not venture to expect . In order to come to a decision , he directs his view to the " promises of God " as revealed in scripture , and the ** testimony of his graces " as exhibited in his own heart ; or , in other words , he first endeavors to discover to whom pardon is offered in the gospel , and then proceeds to examine how far he was himself included in the character described . He founded his hopes wholly and exclusively upon Grod 's immutable /z/ ration with fear and trembling , ' ' knowing that ** it was God that worked in him both to will and to do of hit good pleasure . " For some time his frequent Subject of lamentation was that he had not a full and sure dependence upon Christ ; " and thus * sowing in tears , " he ultimately reaped in joy ; " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost his expiring breath , " I would not change my joy for the empire of the world . " From this moment his religious comfoit seems never to have left him ; for , observes the abovementioned biographer , ' It now seemed as if all natural beat and life were almost utterly gone out of him ; that his understanding had failed , and that it was to no purpose to speak any more unto him . But it was far otherwise . I spake thus unto him : ' Sir , if you hear what I say , let us by some means know it ; and if yoa have still your inward joy and consolation in God , hM up your hand . ' With that he did lift up his hand and stretched it forth on high , which we thought he could scarce have moved ; which caused the beholders to cry out with joy that his understandmg should still be perfect , and that the weak body , beyond all expectation , should so readily give a sign of the joy of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a terrific image , the spiritual affections as well as understanding must have been duly cultivated . To him who can really say with the apostle respecting his Redeemer , " whom having not seen I love ; " or with the Psalmist , ' whom have I in heaven but Thee , and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee ; " the dissolution of soul and body can present no unwelcome theme of meditation . But a cold and speculative theology , even should there be nothing heterodox in ' the creed , or very exceptionable in the life , will not support a mortal sinking into eternity . At such a moment , the helpless soul feels its need of a Father , a Protector , a Guide : it is about to pass into that awful RIPOSC nr DEATH . S3 and unknown world whence it can never retam , and desires therefore an Almighty Friend to welcome its inrival . It is not the Deity , simply considered , but God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine believer . To an ardent and grateful attachment to the Redeemer , not less than to faith in his merits and obedidice , must be ascribed the pleasurable anticipations of holy men in death . Stephen expired in peace , notwithoUmding his outward sufferings , because he ** look* ed unto Jesus , " and trusted to him to * receive his sprit . " Saint Paul beheld with delight the future world , because he ' knew in whom he had believ* ed , " and had arrived at the joyful conclusion that to live is Christ , and to die is gain . " Or , to advert to later examples , the venerable Bede , amidst much bodily infirmity , exclaimed that he * earnestly wished to behold the King in his beauty ; " and the celebrated Peter Du Moulin , reproving a friend who spoke highly of his good works , remarked how greatly he was grieved by such flattering language , and attributed an be had done to the sovereign grace of Grod operating by the weakest instrument ; adding , on another occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whpn bhall I rest in thy bosom f When shall I drink of the river of thy pleasures f I am unworthy of it , O my God ! but thou art glorified by doing good to the unworthy . It is not for them who are whole , but for those who are sick that thy Son , the great Physician , was sent . I am going to my Father and my God : I go to him with confidence , /or he has arrayed me with the robe of his righteousness . How different from these sublime aspirations were the forebodings of the most virtuous heathens ! Death had not to them lost its sting , nor was the grave robbed of its terrors . Doubt and uncertainty were their brightest portion ; there nUght be a future state , and /z/ the virtuous might be happy after death ; but beyond this pkusible conjecture unenlightened reason had no power to aspire . To allay the tortures of conscience there was no blood of sprinkling ; " they knew of no ** fountain opened for sin and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * though thy sins be as scarlet , they shall be white as snow ; though they be like crimson , they shall be as wool ; " or been taught " the blessedness of that man whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered . " That Jesus Christ " came into the world to save sinners , " was a mystery hid from their knowledge , and that the * kingdom of heaven is opened for all believers , " was a truth far beyond their utmost powers of investigation . But , cheered by the doctrine of the atonement , the meanest Christian learns to ' depart in peace , " believing that , notwithstanding his frailties and his transgressions , his omnipotent Redeemer is still able and willing to ' save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him . " It appears then , from the foregoing observations , that death-beds in general , may be reduced to four descriptions . The first is the case of those persons who die in tranquillity , but who ought , alas ! if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we may discern the infidel , the hardened sinner , the ignorant , the selfrighteous , and various other kinds of characters ; in all of whom , however , want of knowledge , or want of faith , must have tended to produce this false security ; for , would these unhappy persons have understood as they understand now , would they have believed as they now believe , assuredly no human artifice whatever could have lulled them to so fatal a repose . The second class is the exact converse of the first , including numerous individuals of characters variously modified , but the hopes of all of whom , being really fixed upon a right foundation , ought to have been , we might have conceived , brighter and more satisfactory /q/ than in the actual trial they perhaps appeared . Instances of this kind will sometimes occur , ( as in the case of thepoet Cowper , ) for which it is not easy to account . We may , indeed , oftentimes discover , without much difficulty , the immediate cause ; we may ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apprehension , but the ultimate design of the Almighty in so distressing an event , and the beneficial effect intended to be produced upon the sufferer , may not be quite so apparent . But since it is evident , both from scripture and experience , that the death-bed of a consistent Christian Is usually rendered a scene of comfort and composure , if not of positive delight , we may oftentimes discover , when an apparent exception occurs , that there existed some obvious cause quite adequate to the production of the effect . The Almighty does not contend with the Christian without reason . There had possibly been frequent or notorious lapses from the right path ; some favorite sin had been indulged , some incorrect doctrine had been harbored , some secret fear of man , or dread of temporal disadvantage had prevented an explicit avowal of Christian principles . There had , perhaps , existed a culpable degree of ignorance respecting some important part of the gospel dispensation , especially those parts which relate to the believer 's privileges and the freedom of salvation . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-renun- ' ciation was not impartial and unreserved ; the flesh had not been sufficiently mortified ; self*denial had not been duly practised ; reliance by faith on Christ had not been sufficiently simple and implicit . There was some latent inconsistency , some unsubdued temper some daily-besetting sin , some undue adherence to the world , some secret feeling of rebellion against God , to intercept the light of the divine coimtenance , and to blot out the fair face of the celestial world . Conversion , though genuine , was , perhaps , as Dr. Johnson remark- /z/ ed of his own , late ; the Holy Spirit had been oAia grieved ; his influences had been long resisted ; CbrifCM virtues had dwindled and decayed ; while earth-bon principles and feelings had sprung up in all their natift luxuriance , and impeded the growth of every heavenly implanted grace . Still , however , in the . majority of those cases m which faith , though weak , is really genuine , a light is at length seen to ' spring up in darkness ; " some indh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person , though checquered with anxiety and distress , are yet , ( even independently of the final result , ) in* finitely more blessed than those of the impenitent and unbelieving . The third class consists of persons who have died unhappily , and who had apparently no scriptural ground for dying otherwise . It includes in its vast scope an indefinitely varying range of characters , from the ordinary sinner , who , dying , ' makes no sign , " to the Antichrist of Ferney himself , whose agonizing groans and execrations spoke - though how imperfectly ! - the tortures of his departing soul . Here we may place also skeptics of that more common class , who fear eternity without believing in the scriptures , and who tremblingly expect a future state of rewards and punishments , without any trust in Him who alone " hath the keys o ! hell and of death . " Infidelity may , indeed , boast thai some of its dbciples have met death with composure and even cheerfulness ; but , alas ! who shall so balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hume or a Voltaire is to be preferred ; whether to quit the world in false repose , and ' ' in hell to li ( up one 's eyes , " be a better or a worse lot than to fore see and to shudder at the destruction which it is to ( late to avoid ! The fourth class consists of those who die happily and whose happiness is well-founded . Of such per sons several instances have been already brought for /q/ ward , nor is even the present age destitute of numerous witnesses to the power of the gospel in the hour of dissolutioY ) . There are , indeed , many motives for the true Christian 's meeting death , not merely with acquiescence , but even with pleasure . The pious and amiable Melancthon was accustomed to console himself with the following reflections , which he recorded 88 some of the reasons why he himself should not be 3orry to quit the present world : " Thou , " said he , " shalt bid adieu to sin . Thou shalt be freed from cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shalt enter into light . Thou shalt see God . Thou shalt behold also his Divine Son . Thou shalt comprehend all those wonderful secrets which thou couldst not understand in the present life . Thou shalt know why we are framed as we are . Thou shalt learn also the mystical conjunction of the divine and human natures in Jesus Christ . " This holy man might have been justly mentioned among the preceding examples of persons who in their last moments , deeply felt and penitently confessed the guilt of their nature and their conduct , but who , amidst all , blessed God that Christ had become their Saviour and Redeemer . The passages of scripture which gave Melancthon most delight and comfort upon his death-bed , and which he was accustomed frequently to repeat , were chiefly those which speak of faith in Jesus Christ . The three following were among the number : " God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeih in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . " " Whoso seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Being justified by faith , we have peace with God . " Thus fixing his hopes upon an immutable foundation , his aspirations after immortality became daily more fervid and intense . He appropriated to himself the words of St. Paul , " I have a desire to depart and be with Christ ; " and so completely was his mind en- /z/ grossed by scriptural ideas , that be is said to bayo cbaunted in his sleep , in the manner then customary at public worship , those affecting words of our Liord before his last supper : ' With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer ; for I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of ( rod . " Resembling our own Hooker in many important respects , he resembled him in this also , that the word peace dwelt upon his lips even in death . He adopted , as many pious men in every age have done , the exclamation of Simeon : " Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes have seen thy salvation . ' Like Hooker , he had ' lived to see the world made up of perturbations , " and though both of these excellent men sacrificed much , and indeed every thing but their conscience , for peace , yet from the nature of the controversies in which they were engaged , neither of them had been permitted to enjoy vt , upon earth . But Melancthon was now about to enter* that state " where the wicked cease from troubling 9 and where the weary are at rest . " He was at peace with God through the reconciling blood of his Redeemer ; he was at peace with his own conscience ; and , as for the world , he was quitting at once its pleasures and its cares for evermore . He possessed all that he had long sought ; his heart was full ; and when asked by a friend if there were any thing more to be desired , he replied in that brief but emphatic exclama-tion , /z/ COLOSSIANS , ii . 2 . To understand , to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advanced Christian ; and hence ' we meet in scripture with those remarkable expressions , " The full assurance of Understanding , " " The full assurance of Faith , " and " the full assurance of Hope . " The infidel may in some measure comprehend the gospel , without believing its divinity ; as condemned spirits believe its divinity , without enjoying its blessings . But the beatitude of the disciple of Christ consists in the threefold union of a knoioledge which unfolds the doctrines of the Cross , difaithr which admits their truth , and a hope which whispers that their promised blessings shall be his own . Christian piety being a reasonable service , and springing not from the vivacity of the imagination , but from the legitimate use of an understanding enlightened by the Holy Spirit to perceive what is right , and a will disposed by the same divine Agent to embrace it , must of necessity pre-suppose knowledge as a preparative for faith ; for although , in various instances , faith is seen to consist with a considerable degree of ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently so much resembling the full assurance of celestial intelligences , who drink immediately at the fountain-head of wisdom itself , as when it is grounded on an extensive view of the whole economy of redemption , in all its bearings and results . But while by the recognition of this truth we prevent that unnatural /z/ alliance which superstition once thought fit to rornn between devotion and ignorance , we must guard infioitely more against that pride which would incite the enlightened but unimpressed professor of Christianity to value his speculative knowledge above the bumble faith and ardent hope of the less intelligent disciple . A strong . check to this pride is the reflection , tliat the knowledge of the one , however accurate or extensive , is but the ordinary result of the human understanding operating upon a system of speculative truths ; whilst tliat of the other , though perhaps detached and circumscribed , evinces by the practical excellency of its effects , that it emanated from that divine Enhghtener , " frogi whom all holy desires , all just counsels , and all good works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though consistent both with reason and scripture , is opposed , not only to the ordinary pride of the human heart , but in an especial manner to the skepticism of an age in which supernatural agency is exploded as a " cunningly devised fable , " it becomes necessary to view the subject more at large , and to show that the full assurance - of understanding is a divine gift , and not a merely human attainment ; a gift freely bestowed upon every ingenuous and humble inquirer , but withheld in equitable judgment from the presumptuous and insincere . On this subject the Bible is our only guide ; and to those who profess to believe its inspiration no other can appear necessary . What then is the testimony of revelation ? Is it not laid down in terms too explicit for ignorance herself to misunderstand , or sophistry to evade , that " the world by wisdom knew not God ; " that ' * the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God ; " and that " the natural man receiveth not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned . " It is true , indeed , that the apostle in another place /q/ isserts that the heathen had a sufficient idea of a Divinity to render them inexcusable in their wickedness ; but even admitting that this knowledge might not be an immediate emanation from Him who never leaves him- self without witness in the secret tribunal of conscience , or might not be a vestige of universal tradition , a refleeted gleam of light on the mountains of error long after the luminary itself had set in darkness - still it was by no means that full assurance of understanding which would lead men to regard their Creator with earnest hope , unrivalled affection , and implicit confidence , and to aspire after that holy intercourse and communion with him for which man was originally created , and which religion teaches us to look for as the reward of glorified spirits in a future world . Should it be objected that the above-cited passages relate merely to the original inability of man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means imply , that those truths being once revealed and open to inquiry , any superadded assistance is now necessary in order to produce the full assurance of understanding , the objection may be obviated by other passages which not only imply the ignorance of man , but explicitly point out the agent of his illumination . " We have an unction from the Holy One , " said the seraphic apostle St. John , ' and know all things . " Isaiah confidently predicted , " all thy people shall be taught of God . " Our Saviour , in strict conformity with this prediction , promised that after his ascension the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , should teach his disciples all things ; and St. Paul , relying on these assurances , did not cease to pray for his Colossian charge , that they might be " filled with the knowledge of God 's will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding . " It is edifying to observe how forcibly this doctrine of the divine teaching is inculcated in the formularies of the Established Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , who as at this /z/ i 42 rULL A88URANCB ' time didst teach the hearts of thy faithful people , hy sending to them the light of thy Holy Spirit , grant us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things , and evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort . " Such was the language of our forefathers . Among the various errors in the scanty creed of modernized theology , the exclusion of the divine interposition is ona of the most glaring . It can not , however , excite wonder that tliose , who are insensible to the want of the Holy Spirit as a Comforter , should fail to acknowledge him as an enlightener and guide . But the true Christian , feeling his own weakness , and the strength and subtlety of his spiritual foes , perceives the value of the divine assistance ; while therefore he " rejoices in the holy comfort " of the Spirit , he prays to him also for " a right understanding in all things . " He is conscious that we can neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Christ preventing us , that we may have a good will , and working with us when we have that good will . " To separate the commands of Grod from that proffered assistance which is necessary for their fulfilment , is to dislocate the whole system of Christianity . The injunction would be useless without the promised aid ; but the aid is never denied where there is a sincere desire implanted to comply with the injunction . If we are exhorted " to work out our own salvation , " it is immediately added , as a check to pride and an encouragement to exertion , that ' it is God who worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure . " Thus we are instructed equally to avoid self-sufficiency and spiritual sloth . We are not to sit contentedly in indolence , waiting for those influences which are promised to sincere exertion . The operation of the divine Spirit was never intended as a bar to the use of our natural faculties . Were a person to resolve , that , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unassisted endeavours , he would never use any labour for that purpose , his infe- f OF UNDEBSTANBING. 43 fence would be as hostile to scripture as it is to natural reasoo . The Holy Spirit is unreservedly promised to " all that seek him . " The evident means , thereforOi of obtaining spiritual understanding is diligent exertion , accompanied with earnest prayer . Either by itself is Dot enough . A principal cause , perhaps , why persons otherwise well disposed fail to perceive the reality of the Holy Spirit 's work , is that they confound the agent with the means which he employs . A pious education , the intercourse of rehgious friends , the Christian ministry , the scriptures and devotional books , are not agents , but merely instruments , and ' ' means of grace , " and would be therefore wholly inefficient , but for the powerful interposition of Him who appointed them to accomplish his designs . How dim-sighted , then , alas , is man ! from whom the thin veil of ordinances can conceal that celestial hand which directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will appear that the acknowledged necessity of the influences of the Holy Spirit as the illuminator of the understanding , is by no means a doctrine justly chargeable as superstitious , or tending to check the exertion of our rational powers . God might indeed produce , in a moment , the full assurance of understanding in a heathen who had never heard of the gospel ; but he has been pleased , in the general course of his providence , to operate in a manner less apparently miraculous , employing and consecrating the faculties of the mind and the affections of the heart to produce the intended effect . The Creator is ever willing to teach as many as he makes desirous to learn ; so that a failure to search into the doctrines of the Bible is a settled contempt of his Holy Spirit . It is not necessary , under the present circumstances of Christianity , that open displays of power , such as attended the conversion of St. Paul , should be daily seen to take place . The influences of the bless- /z/ // ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should judge rather by the ultimate and permanen effect , than by the concomitant circumstances* Th ( humble Christian , whose religious knowledge has been gradually and almost unconsciously acquired in hk early years , till at length made effectual by a correspondent faith , will not less acknowledge the omnipotent hand of the divine Enlightener , than a convertec heathen , on whose mind Christianity , like the tropica sun , has burst with almost instantaneous effulgence The silent removal of a doubt , the imperceptible subjugation of a prejudice , even the secret implantation o a holy desire to examine into the question , if they ul timately end in salutary knowledge , prove themselve : to be as much the operation of God as the most mi raculous conversion recorded in the annals of th Christian Church . The influences of the Spirit an not less valuable or less efficacious when they gentlj ' * distil as the dew , " than when they assume the mos energetic and unexpected forms . It may be urged , that if the divine influences b ( oftentimes so gradual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by distinguishing then from the ordinary operations of the mind ; for that th ( doctrine is but a metaphysical subtlety , and of no us in real experience . To this it might be a sufficien answer , that if the doctrine had not been of importance it would not have been so carefully inculcated in th volume of revelation . Its practical tendencies are however , singularly striking . It teaches humility anc self-renunciation , by instructing ns to attribute our reJi gious attainments not to ourselves but to a higher source It guards us against despair , and animates us in ou Christian race , by pointing out to us divine assistanc that is never withheld where it is devoutedly implored while it collaterally proves that degradation of our na ture which has made supernatural assistance necessar to enable us to perceive the glories of a system int /q/ which pure spirits most ardently desire to look . lo a word , it connects God with man , and teaches us to view ourselves , not as beings overlooked or forsaken , but as placed continually under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever employed in enlightening our understandings and divinely influencing our affections . These two operations are indeed more closely connected than the mere philosopher might be disposed to allow . A humble mind and devout affections are eminently serviceable , and even absolutely requisite , in attaining the full assurance of spiritual understanding . Our Saviour said , not that he who possessed the greatest powers of intellect , but he who wished to do the will of God , should know of his doctrine , whether it was of God , or whether he spake of himself . To a divinely instructed mind , there shines forth a beautiful consistency in the doctrines of revelation . The fall and the atonement , the inability of man , and the assistance of the Holy Spirit , appear evidently intended to correspond . When man fell , he became darkened in his understanding , as well as depraved in his will : his intellectual faculties were obscured , as well as his moral powers deranged . Those things which he once intuitively understood became unknown . His Creator now appeared as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and inextricable maze . The tempter , while he hardened the heart , having also blinded the understanding , the first operation of the Holy Spirit is to remove the veil , and to restore man to his primeval faculty of spiritual perception . Hence the apostle says , that " the new man is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created him . " Every thing becomes new . Where is the proud being , wrapt in conscious dignity , who trusted to his inherent merit , and challenged heaven almost as a right f He is a penitent , humbly prostrate at the throne of mercy . He has /z/ been taught the simple fact on which the whole system of Christianity is founded , namely , the sinfulness of man . Enlightened by divine instruction , he is surprised that he could so long have failed to perceive the meaning of texts of scripture the most evident and impoctant . ' By one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin , and so death passed upon all meo , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean thing out of an unclean f Not one . " " The whole world lielh in wickedness . " " There is none righteous , no , no one . " " All have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ; " with various other passages of similar and equally decisive import . This fact being once perceived , all things rise in proof for its confirmation ; for what is the whole history of man , but a complicated tissue of weaknesses , imperfections , and crimes , which awfully illustrate and confirm the scriptural doctrine of our fallen state ? Every thing around us proves that man is deeply polluted by sin . What are the pride , the sensuality , the irreligion , the raging passions of the great body of the world , but the effects of the general contagion ? " All we like sheep have gone astray . " Let us compare this description with real matter of fact . Let us turn , for instance , to the aged ; to those whom experience has made wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be supposed to exhibit the most exemplary pattern . Delusive expectation ! Fraud , avarice , unsubdued passions , callousness of heart , and confirmed habits of sin , are visible on every side . The love of wealth is usually their predominant passion ; and upon the very precipice of the grave they stand counting their gold , heedless of death , who with rapid step silently approaches behind them , preparing to precipitate them into the tremendous gulf . But these men , it may be said , are hackneyed in the ways of the world , and have become gradually contaminated by continual bad example . Let us then /q/ turn to the bloom of childhood . Here we may , perhaps , discover minds untainted . Evil passions may here be unknown , and contagious example may not yet have produced its hateful effects . Purity and in* nocence , which have been exiled from the busy world , may here have found a congenial abode . Ah , no ! nothing like it ; the farthest from it possible . Every vice and passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selfishness , falsehood , are but a small portion of the vices evident at our first entrance . But the refinements of society may make a difference . Turn then to the higher walks of life . Still the same scene , gilded indeed with wealth , and varnished with elegance , yet still substantially the same . Yet before we despair , let us behold the cottage of the peasant . This may possibly be a more innocent and heavenly spot . The contagion of cities and of courts may not have penetrated here , and the continual presence of the works of nature , and the simplicity of rural employment , may have given the mind a more celestial inclination . Vain expectation ! The refinements of life may not indeed have found their way to so remote a scene ; but sin , the universal guest , has obtained admittance . Here are all the vices of the higher ranks , without that t*hin veil of refinement , which , though it can not render them less criminal , makes them at least less openly disgusting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that general brutality t of character which is the natural consequence of sin . ! * No rank , therefore , no profession , is free from the dire contagion . The renovated understanding thus convinced of sin , can not fail to observe those passages of scripture which threaten its punishment . These passages are of the most decisive and awful nature . " The wages of sin is death . " " The wicked is reserved unto the day of destruction . " " The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of /z/ men . " " Upon the wicked he shall rain snares , fire , and brimstone , and a horrible tempest . This is the portion of their cup . " With those passages which thus speak of the sinfulness of mankind and the wrath of God impending over his head , the full assurance of understanding combines those also which point out his inability to procure pardon or justification in the sight of bis Maker by his own merits and obedience . " Enter not into judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight shall no man living be justified . " " If thou be righteous , what givest thou unto God , or what receiveth He at thy hands ? Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art , and thy righteousness may profit the son of man . " " My goodness extendelh not unto thee . " " There is none righteous , no not one . " " All our righteousnesses are as fihliy rags . " But , while on the one hand the enlightened understanding thus contemplates ** Man 's first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree , whose mortal taste Brought death into the world , and all our wo , With loss of Eden , " it perceives throughout the volume of inspiration mention made of " one greater man , " who , by his obedience and death , should ** Restore us , and regain the blissful seat . " This most animating and delightful doctrine appears conspicuously in every part of the Bible . " As by one man many were made sinners , so by one shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ . " " He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin , that we might be made the righteousness of God in him . " " Christ hath once suffered for sins , just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God . " /z/ /q/ " He batb redeemed us from the curse of the law , by being made a curse for us . " " He was delivered for our offences , and rose again for our justification . " The doctrines of the depravity and impotency of mankind , and the vicarious sacrifice and obedience of Christ being thus proved , the renewed understanding naturally proceeds to investigate the nature of the blessings procured by the atonement ; and reposing upon the promised guidance of the Holy Spirit in its researches into divine truth , it can not fail to obtain all needful information . Is man sinful and exposed to the divine wrath ? Pardon is ensured . ' I have blotted out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy sins . " " God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them . " Is the human heart by nature at enmity with God f Reconciliation and peace are obtained . " You that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled . " " Being justified by faith , we have peace with God . " Was man unrighteous and unholy f ' * In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified . " " Ye are washed , ye are sanctified , ye are justified , in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God . " Was he exposed to the unutterable penahies of the second death Jesus Christ " abolished death , and brought life and immortality to liht through the gospel . " " He became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him . " ' * These are they that came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore are they before the throne of God . " The procuring cause of these inestimable blessings being thus ascertained to be the obedience and death of Christ , the method in which they are conveyed to the recipient naturally becomes the object of inquiry ; nor will the scriptures conduce less to enlighten the mind ou this than on the former points of investigation . /z/ " We conclude , " saith the Apostle , " that a man is justified by faithj without " the deeds of the law . " Should it be asserted , ( what can not however be proved , ) that Saint Paul intended only the ceremonial law , still this exalted grace will not hence be excluded from its office of justifying ; for he expressly affirms , in another place , that ' God shall justify both the circumcision by faith , and the uncircumcision through faith . ' " By grace ye are saved through faith . " Whosoever belie veth on Him , shall receive remission of sins ; " but without faith it is Impossible to please God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty which appears , at first sight , in comparing those texts which speak of all men as naturally sinful and unholy , with those which declare that ' without holiness no man shall see the Lord , " by referring to that renewal of heart , that implantation of a sacred principle , which is represented as making us ' meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light . " If man be naturally unfitted by sin for a world where nothing that defiles can procure admission , what can be more consistent with reason than that such a change should take place as is expressed in scripture by the terms conversion being born again and being raised to newness of life ? Should it be objected , that nothing more is intended by these expression than what is necessarily conveyed in the Sacrament of Baptism , it would be easy to adduce various passages of scripture , ' Which distinctly speak of the " renewing of the Holy Ghost , " as well as the " washing of water ; " of an inward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . But let , us appeal to facts . Is It not a matter of notoriety that Baptism is not necessarily followed by holiness of heart or morality of life ? Must not therefore some change be necessary which Baptism does not always convey f If a baptized person can become a deliberately wicked character , what alternative is there , but /q/ either to give him up as beyond the reach of mercy , or to inculcate the necessity of conversion , that is , an entire renovation of heart , to make him meet for a world which an impenitent sinner can not obtain and could not enjoy . The instructed understanding can not therefore but perceive the doctrine of an entire mental transformation to be an important scriptural tenet , and will consequently acknowledge in the words of Divinity itself , that " except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . " The full assurance of understanding is conspicuous in reconciling two important articles of belief , which , by the unskilful and irreligious , are usually represented as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation procured by Jesus Christ alone , and gratuitously applied to us by faith , irrespectively of human works or human merit , and the equally absolute necessity of that imparted " holiness without which we can not see the Lord . " There are three common errors on this subject . The first , which imagines our supposedly good works to be the real ground of our acceptance with God , is confuted by Saint Paul , who teaches that " we are justified yrec/y by God ' * race through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus . " The second , which allows that justification may be obtained by a speculative faith unproductive of good works , is silenced by the pointed interrogation of Saint James , " Can /aiA save him ? " The third , which combines the grace of God and our own works as in procuring salvation , ( a doctrine the most common , and not the least delusive of the three , ) is refuted by that decisive passage , in which Saint Paul abundantly shows the impossibility of such a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more of works ; otherwise grace is no more grace ; but if of works , then it is no more of grace ; otherwise work is not work . " But the well-informed and well-disposed inquirer readily escapes these difficulties by viewing /z/ the merits of Christ as the procuring cause , faith as the appropriating and uniting principle , and holiness , which is the generic term under which all good wO ) : ks as well as motives are included , as the necessary result . Widely differing from the self-righteous man , he asserts that our trust for salvation must be placed entirely on Christ 's having suffered and fulfilled the law for us , while he explicitly denies the latitudinarian inference , that we are therefore emancipated from moral restraints . He views the Messiah as a Prophet , a Priest , and a Saviour ; but he does not rgect him as a Prince , a model , and a guide ; a reformer of human manners , and a patron of moral excellence . While he perceives the indispensable necessity of faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sentiments , and that Christianity is a regulator of the life as well as of the creed . The preceding remarks are by no means intended to discourage the uneducated Christian , who laments his inability fully to comprehend the whole system of divine truth in all its harmonies and relations ; especially since the expression , " the full assurance of understanding , " refers , perhaps , upon the whole , rather to the certainty and stability , than to the extent of our spiritual comprehension . Knowledge may be limited , and yet be perfect in its kind . It is not for man , the being of a moment , accurately to survey with his feeble glance an edifice whose base is the whole world , and whose summit aspires beyond the third heavens : it is enough for him , if perceiving its utility , he be taught to shelter in it his defenceless head before the impending storm . The best infornied Christian , as well as the most ignorant , must lament with the Apostle , " We see but in part and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal claim to derive comfort from the subsequent declaration , that , " When that which is perfect is come , that which is in part shall be done away . " The obvious and important inquiry is not so much /q/ whether our knowledge be complete , &s; whether it be of the right kind ; whether it embrace the essentials of Christianity , and whether it evidence itself to be that " wisdom which cometh from above , " by being " first 3 pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be entreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality and without hypocrisy . " On subjects unimportant in themselves , or unimportant to us , it will be no diminution of our felicity to have been uninformed , especially if the consciousness of our ignorance teach us to aspire more ardently after those regions of light and knowledge , where doubt shall be lost in certainty , and probation be exchanged for reward . It is important to remark , that the full assurance of Christian understanding is invariably accompanied with Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , are usually those who have blindly moulded one half of revelation into a system , without regarding that other half , which would have taught them to modify or correct their premature conclusions . Nor is this observation unconfirmed by general experience in other sciences . The deep philo* sopfaer , who perceives the difiiculties which encompass either side of his favourite system , is usually less arrogant than the mere sciolist who espouses the dogma without entering into the merits of the objection , and therefore ignorantly asserts what he can not defend . Modesty and understanding sliould ever be combined in the Christian character . If the philosopher be taught self-diffidence , by knowing that every atom that floats in the sun-beam , every drop that sparkles in the ocean , may furnish questions which the most enlightened can not answer , and difficulties which the most profound can not solve how much more the Christian , whose difficulties are greater in proportion as the subject which he attempts to investigate is more removed from the ordinary province of the human understanding . It is , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ may , without difficulty , comprehend all that is neces sary for our happiness here or hereafter ; but those things which would only satiate our curiosity , without influencing our motives or regulating our actions , are wisely involved in undeveloped mystery . The full assurance of understanding , though it does not attempt to fathom those doctrines which are evidently among the " secret things which belong unto God , " will , however , readily perceive the practical ends which they were intended to impress . If , for example , it can not account for the introduction of moral evil into a world of holiness and felicity , it will be content to admire and adore that infinite wisdom which contrived out of it to educe good , and condescend to disclose in the volume of inspiration a remedy commensurate with the disease . It it can not unfold the mystery of the Trinity , it will humbly submit to the scriptural statement , knowing it to have proceeded from God himself : it will believe the divinity of the three sacred Persons , and endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian - thus deriving every practical benefit from the doctrine , without professing to unravel the difficulties with which it is surrounded . If the passing events of Providence , and the unaccomplished designs of futurity , appear confused and inexplicable , the renewed understanding is satisfied with ascertaining the consolatory fact , that " all things work together for good to them that love God , that are the " called according to his purpose , " the government being for that end placed upon Him who " redeemed his church with his own blood . " But while the full assurance of understanding endeavours to trace in scripture the stupendous system of human redemption , it naturally proceeds to inquire into the exciting cause of such astonishing effects . Contemplating with wonder the exuberant streams oi mercy , it ascends to their inexhaustible fountain , the infinite , the gratuitous , the immutable love of God , unin /q/ the person of his dearly beloved Son . But le powers of the understanding sink beneath the tful task . God is love ! - Love ineffable ! es* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amount to the plenitude of underig , unless we are enabled to encircle every thing ith this golden chain which bounds and connects hole . The heaven-taught mind will perceive ssential attribute of the Deity displaying itself everlasting , in ordaining a remedy for the fall of in devising that immutable covenant , that isel of peace , " by which the co-equal with the ' was to leave the right hand of the Majesty on o ' take upon him the form of a servant , to be of a woman , made under the law , to redeem ? who were under the law , " that " bringing many o glory , " he might " see the travail of his soul $ satisfied . " Inconceivable philanthropy ! How very idea of human merit and human pride fade while we gaze at this dazzling scene of divine and compassion ! How should the suavities of be enlarged and multiplied towards our feleatures while we contemplate this mysterious , speakable charity of our common Parent ! Once i , in the full assurance of understanding , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ipture an exhaustless subject of devout meditar the longest life . New excellencies will every nfold themselves . The Christian advancing in knowledge resembles a mariner gliding down a at first the stream appears shallow , and he almost to touch the bank on either side ; but as ceeds it becomes deeper and wider , till at length lost in an ocean where his plummet can find no i , his eye can perceive no bounds . /z/ It is important in studying the sacred volume ever to retain in mind that it was not intended to be written with that systematic precision which is expected in works of merely human science . Without adopting the formality of mathematical discussion , it seemed fit to the Author of all Wisdom to inculcate in the course of epistolary , prophetic , historical , or devotional writing , the most important truths in the way best adapted for general instruction . Even in the more argumentative books , remote inferences , fervent appeals , sudden ejaculations , rapid transitions , followed often by a resumption of the subject equally rapid and unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings . Human artifice is evidently discarded ; so that amidst images and doctrines the most sublime , every thing partakes of a simplicity which banishes all idea of fraud or collusion . Partly , perhaps , owing to this free method of writing , and partly to the imperfection of human language , we often find in scripture the same word used in different acceptations ; so that we are mercifully constrained to peruse its various parts , " comparing spiritual things with spiritual , " in order to form a perfect idea of almost any one subject . These observations are suggested by considering the different scriptural significations attached to the important word Faith , as used in the inspired writings . It stands not less for that supernatural principle which enabled Judas , though a wicked /q/ man , to work miracles ; for that transient feeling which supported Demas for a time , but could not prevent his ultimate relapse ; and for that theoretical persuasion in Agrippa by which he believed the prophets , - than for that saving principle which actuated St. Paul and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , though distinct , are analogous , all implying in their elements a firm persuasion of certain truths , and differing chiefly in the mode , the duration , the agent , and the effects of that belief . It is not an unconmion error to speak of faith as being little more than the simple result of the judgment exerted in deciding upon the evidences of Christianity . In its highest sense , however , it is a far more complex principle , including the operations of the understanding , the will , and the affections ; comprehending every spiritual grace , and virtue , and displaying itself in acts and habits the most varied and distinct . Faith employs and concentrates every faculty of the soul . But however high its attainments , however wide its influence , it may be ultimately traced to its elementary principle , a belief in the divine inspiration of the holy scriptures . The chief danger is when to this elementary principle , this preparatory attainment , are attributed those saving effects which can arise only from a subsequent and superadded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on a recognition of the divinity of the Bible ; but the mere recognition of its divinity , is not therefore justifying faith . It is indeed impossible to peruse the New Testament without perceiving tlmt effects are attributed to this exalted grace which can not be predicated of a mere speculative belief . In persons of reflecting minds , it is highly conducive to the full assurance of faith during the future stages of their spiritual course , that they should have early examined into those outward evidences by which the divine inspiration of our holy religion is irrefragably prov- /z/ ed . It often occurs that religious parents , while they properly inculcate on their children the necessity of faith in its highest signification , overlook the importance of teaching the outward evidences of Christianity . Unless therefore they become partakers of this heavenly grace , no motive remains but the influence of education or compliance with custom , for retaining even the forms of religion : whereas a persuasion of the truth of the Bible , grounded on rational evidence , is a permanent principle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honest prejudices of education are efiaced . The full assurance of historical faith may be easily attained in the due and humble use of the reasoning powers . Admitting the being of a God , it can be proved a possible case , that he should reveal himself to his creature man . The possibility being admitted , it will appear that it is also highly probable : for if man was intended to be left entirely ignorant of his Maker , to what purposes were the higher faculties of his soul created ? Besides , might not many valuable ends be attained . by such a revelation ? Might not his morals , with which his happiness is evidently connected , be possibly rendered more consistent with right reason ? Might not new motives be added to virtue , and new discouragements to vice ? - a result which even an atheist , who professes to regard the well-being of society , must admit to be desirable . Again - since it is evident that man has by nature a conscience , which often disturbs his happiness on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a superior Being , and perhaps foxeboding something of a futurity , might it not be desirable , for many obvious reasons , that he should be furnished with more certain information on the subject ? These , and similar reflections , will render the idea of a divine revelation by no means improbable . At this juncture , Christianity presents itself , and challenges investigation . Is /q/ there any thing in it that previous to all inquiry renders it impossible or even improbable that it should have been a revelation from God ; and which therefore presents a bar to further discussion ? By no means ; for it relates to subjects , which , if true , are highly iraportant , and every way worthy to be revealed . What then are its evidences f Here a wide field of inquiry is laid open , from which no person possessing a sound judgment and a well-disposed mind could ever complain that he returned unsatisfied . What , for instance , can be more conclusive than a long series of minute prophecies , followed , many yoars after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully proved by the unimpeachable faith of historical evidences . Where shall we seek for arguments stronger than the numerous miracles which are attested to have been performed ; and that in the sight of persons rational and disinterested , many of whom may be proved to have written accounts of what they had witnessed , and to have suffered the most bitter torments , rather than retract their evidence f How again can we account for the acknowledged harmony existing between the numerous books that compose the sacred canon , - - books written at long intervals of time , on subjects the most various , and infinitely above the unassisted powers of reason , and by persons of very different stations in life , ( by prophets , by historians , by poets , by legislators , by fishermen , by mechanics , by kings , ) without acknowledging them to have had some common source of information ; and what source could there possibly be but the Divinity himself ? The extensive diffusion of the gospel , ( a system completely opposed to the natural pride and prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secular and the ecclesiastical power of every nation upon earth , is a fact for which nothing but supernatural assistance can account . But among such varied evidences , there is none perhaps more immediately striking than the present state of the Jews , /z/ and its correspondence with scriptural predictions ; a circumstance observable by all , and which infidelitjr itself can never explain away . To many minds , bowever , these obvious arguments are not more forcible ' than those minute correspondences , those unexpected corroborations , which diligence has discovered by cooh paring scriptural passages with each other , and with the works of contemporary authors . A person unacquainted with the foregoing arguments , may obtain satisfactory evidence of a somewhat different kind . Observing that wise and good men , whose opinion he has been accustomed to regard with veneration , acknowledge the scriptures as the yrord of God , he has already a presumptive argument in their favor . This argument is greatly corroborated by his own examination . He sees the correspondence between scripture and matter of fact . Having observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things for which no uninspired author has ever beea able to account , ) he finds at the very commencement of the sacred volume the most satisfactory solution of the difficulty . He discovers in the Bible an exact and practical description of human nature , whilst the most boasted theories of philosophers are uniformly found inapplicable to real facts . Comparing his own heart with the delineations of it in scripture , he perceives a similarity which convinces him that none but the Searcher of Hearts could have drawn the picture . The character ascribed to the Deity , as a being infinitely potent , wise , equitable , holy , beneficent , - a character so evidently just , yet so widely differing from Pagan descriptions , confirms him in his belief . If there be difficulties , as undoubtedly there are , they are such as may be analogically proved to be very compatible with a divine revelation . The tendency of the whole system , even in a moral point of view , is evidently good , to make men wise , virtuous , and bappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ orginated not in human fraudi much less in the suggestions of infernal spirits , but in the infinite source of beneyolence and perfection itself . A conTiction grounded on evidence , is at all times a valuable Christian attainment ; but especially so in an age of skepticism , and in seasons of great distress and unbelief . Oftentimes when the ajSections are cold and the will vacillating , the judgment retains its hold upon the divine evidence of Christianity , and thus helps to support the soul , when every thing else is for a moment lost . We may be plausibly tempted to view our other powers as subject to delusion , but we shall not so easily question the truth of what has been impartially demonstrated by our boasted faculty of reason ; especially if having once determined the point , we keep the leading arguments ever present in our view . These Remarks , however , by no means tend to deny the absolute necessity of " that unction from the Holy One , " by which alone ' we know all things ; " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make use of the humble and prayerful exertions of our rational powers as a means of grace to confirm our faith . But while the importance of a well-grounded historical belief is strenuously maintained , in opposition to the error of those who assert that Christianity can not be proved by rational argument , it must never be forgotten that a much higher principle than a mere speculative or educational belief is necessary to render us true disciples of Jesus Christ . The evidences of Christianity are not Christianity itself . If they be important , as they certainly are , it is solely on account of the importance of the system to which they refer . Having therefore once attained a firm belief of the truth of the gospel , it becomes absurd to confine our attention wholly , or even chiefly , to this first principle : " Rather let us go on to perfection . " Why content ourselves with surveying externally the walls and /z/ i 63 rULL ASSURANCE buttresses of the edifice , when we are invited to enter and behold its interior beauties ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , the practical believer is enjoying its blessing ; having clearly ascertained that gold is to be found in the mine , he begins to dig in order to obtain it . The faith to which such high encomiums are attached in scripture , not only admits the Bible to be true , but feels it to be practically important . It perceives in the plan of redemption an incomparable excellence and congruity , which are of more weight than a thousand external arguments . It finds diat the gospel comes home to the feelings and the heart . The blessings promised are realized . The experience of the soul corresponds with the conclusions of the understanding . All is rational , consistent , and agreeable to the evidence of fact . This kind of argument is highly satisfactory , and it is that which the Divine Spirit usually employs to build up the Christian in bis most holy faith . It is not uncommon for persons to enjoy a high degree of faith , so as even to be willing to become martyrs for their profession , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who depend for its truth chiefly upon its wonderful suitability to the condition of fallen man , and its more than natural influence on their own minds . Faith , it is indeed certain , is always grounded upon knowledge ; but that knowledge may be often far less than the pride of intellect is willing to allow . The mind , graduaUy enlightened by the Holy Spirit , may have perceived at an early period of investigation , such internal marks of divinity in the scriptures , as shall possibly lead to the full assurance of faith long before they conduct to the perfection of knowledge . A considerable point is gained , when an inquirer , confessing and feeling the Bible to be the Book of God , determines unreservedly to admit and embrace its truths as they successively unfold themselves to his understanding . A person or FAITH . 63 thus humbly and piously disposed is in a state of mind infinitely more safe , and will arrive at the full assurance of faith far more certainly , than the most diligent collector of the mere evidences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable , and in ordinary cases increase together . They are twinsisters , and the presence of the one usually pre-supposes or induces the presence of the other . If further proof be wanted to show that Faith , as used in its higher significations in scripture , is far more than the bare admission of an orthodox creed , the effects attributed to it would decide the point . Saint Peter speaks of it as ' ' purifying the heart ; " Saint Paul calls it * the faith that worketh by love ; " and Saint John asserts that it * ' overcometh the world . " Now , is it not demonstrable by facts , that the principle which too often passes current in the present day for Christian faith , is totally inadequate to the production of these exalted effects ? Are not the possessors of it oftentimes as impure , as worldly , and as selfish , as though purity , love , and conquest over the world , had never been recorded as characteristics of saving faith f To the Christian grace under consideration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of God ; not however as being an intrinsically good work , or the conditional commandment of a remedial law , but as uniting us to Christ Jesus , and thus making us partakers of the benefits which by his obedience and death he procured for all that believe in bis name . No fact is more conspicuous in scripture than that Christ suffered on our account , in order that * as by one man many were made sinners , so by one should many be made righteous . " The being made righteous , or its synonyme jutstificatiorif is an important blessing , implying not merely pardon , but a restoration to all our forfeited privileges as completely as if sin had never existed . The obedience of Christ is the procuring cause of this justification , but faith is the /z/ means or iostrument of its application to the recipient ; for faith apprehends the Redeemer in all bis relatioof to fallen man ; and believing Him to be made unto itt ' wisdom , righteousness , sanctification , and redemp ? tion , " relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those doctrines which theoretical faith admits only as barren speculations . This observation may be illustrated by a slight review of the three well-known characters which our Saviour bears to the Christian , namely , his Prophet , his Priest , and his King . As a Prophet or teacher sent from ( rod , the true believer not only acknowledges the authenticity of his mission , but sits humbly at his feet to receive his precepts . He learns the utter depravity of man , and his inability to merit heaven by the best obedience which since the fall it is in his power to bestow . He becomes acquainted with the necessity of that repentance and change of heart which our Saviour so earnesdy inculcated when upon earth . He believes the divinity , the co-eternity , and co-equality of the three tivine Persons in the unity of the Godhead , because the Incarnate Word taught it , both personally , and by his followers under his unerring inspiration . As a Priest faith beholds the Messiah ofiering himself a sacrifice for sin , and thus procuring pardon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It conceives of this atonement as full , perfect , and satisfactory , to the exclusion of every thing else as the meritorious or procuring cause of redemption ; and enables us to rely upon it fully for pardon and acceptance with God . To expect salvation in any other way than as penitent sinners , trusting wholly to the obedience and death of Christ , is to degrade him from his ' sacerdotal function . Saint Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews expatiates on this eminent character of the Messiah in a manner the most sublime and the most consolatory - the most impassioned , yet the most judiaous /q/ and edifying . Ineffably glorious are the scenes Mch he has unfolded to the eye of faith ! He repreBttts the second person in the Trinity , the co-equal and co-eternal with the Father , as consenting , by a divine agreement entered into from everlasting , to become ' a great High-Priest , " and once in the end of tke world " to appear ** to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Christ Jesus was " made like unto Us brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful Higb-Priest in things pertaining to Grod , to make reconciliition for the sins of the people . " Thus become inornate , he * through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , " and " being made perfect , became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him . " The sacrifice thus fully performed , and never needing to be repeated , he still retained ' ' an unchangeable priesthood , " in consequence of which * he passed roto the heavens , " " to appear in the presence of Groti for us . " Having prayed and interceded for his followers when upon earth , he now mediates for them in heaven , and as a High-Priest offers up their prayers upon " the golden altar of incense . " This doctrine of the intercession of Christ is embraced by foith as an important and consoling truth , from the consideration of which Saint Paul , in his usual method of deriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime , infers that we ' should hold fast our profession , " and ' * should draw near to God with a true heart , in full assurance of faith . This heavenly principle therefore beholding Christ Jesus at the right hand of the Majesty on high , interceding on our behalf , teaches the Christian to offer up his prayers in holy confidence and hope , fully assured that his Heavenly Father is able and willing ' to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , " through the merits and intercession of our adorable HighPriest. /z/ 66 yULL ASSURANCS At a Kingf Failb receives his commands , and submits to his authority . It expels from the heart everj rival power , so that religion becomes the unreserved allegiance of a willing subject . Devotion to God , displayed by a sincere and voluntary , though imperfect , obedience to his will , whether as relating to our creed or our practice , is a necessary result of the full assu ance of faith . The gospel thus provides in an effectual manner for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind which ' can not fail to produce them ; while it sets aside pride , by making our salvation due , not to them , but entirely to the merits of Christ The doctrines of " the cross of Christ " are eminently adverse to human vanity . Salvation is represented as entirely an act of grace . To renounce ourselves , - to conquer all the natural ideas of the fallen mind relative to the attainment of heaven , - to trust to the mercy of God conveyed to us solely through Jesus Christ , not for any worthiness in ourselves , but gratuitously on account of hi own sovereign favor and loving-kindness , - to rely as humble penitents upon the Saviour of mankind for the application of his obedience and merits to us , as our claim to pardon , justification , and eternal glory , with a firm belief that such reliance will not be in vain , - all this , however difficult , however apparently humiliating , however opposed to the natural suggestions of the unrenewed mind , seems to be included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not therefore excite wonder that so exalted a principle should suppose as exalted an Agent , or that an apostle should in consequence affirm , that ' faith is the gift of God . " Ignorance may vaguely depend upon the divine mercy , because it does not perceive the heinousness of sin , or estimate aright the justice of God in decreeing its punishment : - presumption may arrogantly hope to obtain heaven , because it magnifies our supposed excellence , and extenuates our real guih , till it has formed such a /q/ character as it imagiDes deserves the Creator 's approhadon ; but for the humble penitent , feeling and acknowledging on the one hand his inherent depravity , Ms actual transgressions , and his utter unworthiness , ( aQ which will appear more aggravated as his repentance is more profound , ) - and perceiving on the other the infinite holiness and inflexible integrity of the Creator , who has inseparably appended misery to sin , - for a person thus penitent and thus instructed , possessing a tender conscience with an enlightened understanding , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resolvable only on the principles of the Christian revelation . Faith and hope thus implanted where , humanly speaking , despair appeared inevitable , evince themselves to be indeed " the gift of God . " It is not unusual , when the necessity of faith is mentioned , to subject oneself to a reproof , as if the importance of good works had been denied ; a supposition both ungenerous and unjust . Even could it be proved that the doctrine of justification by faith is hostile to morality , this fact could not efiace that doctrine from the Bible , where it appears in characters indelible by human artifice ; but it would furnish an argument much stronger than any that has ever been yet suggested , against the divine inspiration of that volume . No method therefore of defending the honor of Christianity can be more injudicious than merging or softening down the doctrme of justification by faith in order to inculcate , as we suppose , more forcibly , the necessity of good works . It is the most candid , and indeed the most judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring by forced constructions to steal from the sacred volume a doctrine , which , after all our efiTorts , will still appear too conspicuously to be concealed . But , in reality , what difficulty is there in the subject , when it is expressly allowed that where there is not morality and obedience there can not possibly be // faith ? It is not a dead faith , but a holy and efficacious principle , which is contended for . Faith , it if true , operates immediately upon the understanding , the affections , and the will ; but is it therefore hostile to outward correctness of conduct ? Does holiness of heart necessarily preclude morality of life f Can not a converted penitent believe that his sins , tbou many , are pardoned through the obedience of his surety , without consequently feeling a desire to renew them ? Is it not even possible that he may have so completely felt the wretchedness , the folly , and ingratitude , as well as the impiety of a sinful life , that a return to it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain , that the streams may be pure , is the dictate of wisdom . If good works be necessary or desirable , as undoubtedly they are , begin with the sources of action . * Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , " and every other crime ; the heart therefore must be purified , if the conduct is to be reformed . Now is not the purifying of the heart expressly mentioned by Saint Peter , in the Acts of the Apostles , as the property of faith ? Any principle short of this would have produced only a partial and perhaps transient effect . But that which sanctifies , not merely the conduct , but the heart , becomes universal in its influence . Nothing can interfere with its operation . A pebble thrown into the current agitates not the fountain-head ; but if the fountain-head be agitated , the current necessarily becomes disturbed . Why then in religion alone should men be censured for beginning with the beginning ? Why when they attempt to inculcate a ' religion of motives , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good works are confessedly indispensable , but faith is the germ from which they must spring . Holiness , from which good works necessarily flow , is essentially connected with justifying faith . We are as /q/ much said to be ** sancUfied in Christ Jesus , " as to be justified by his merits and obedience . A principle wUch purifies the heart causes war with all thatis immofdl in the life ; so that where faith exists , a diving sanctity pervades the soul , rendering us " meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the samts in light , " and producing in the conduct ' whatever is lovely and of good report . " Again , faith " worketh by love . " Its origin , its tendency , its end , are congenial to the most amiable disportions of the soul . It involves nothing austere or terrific in its operations . It wields not the torch of the inquisitor , or the lash of the self-tormenting devotee . Its * ' Author and Finisher " is the glorious and gracious Being who is emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it teaches us to love him because he hath first loved us . " Hence faith , working by love , incites to a cordial and filial obedience to his commands , and thus afibrds the strongest pledge for morality and good works . Duty becomes pleasure , obedience a delight . But whilst God is honored , mankind also is benefited ; for the humble penitent , gratefully remembering that Christ died for him , will remember that he died not for him alone . The being partners in the same misfortune and the same remedy becomes a new source of attachment to our species . Faith , therefore , while it " worketh by love , " in elevating the soul in devout afifections to our Creator , Redeemer , and Sanctifier , operates no less in benevolence towards all mankind . It prompts us to love God , but we can not do this without loving our brother also . The circles are distinct , but they are concentric , and we can not embrace the larger without including the less . The Messiah comprised the whole law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the other is disregarded . True faith honors both . The apostle teaches us that of the three cardinal graces of our holy religion , the greatest /z/ is charity ; by which be undoubtedly means a principle of love to Grod followed by love to man , and prompting to every exertion and every sacrifice io the cause both of our Creator and of human kind . Charity therefore must be applauded as the highest of Christian graces ; but charity , it must never be forgotten , is the daughter and the inseparable companion of Christian faith . It is by no means a subject for surprise that , persons accustomed to understand by the word Faith a vague inoperative principle , a merely speculative or educational assent to a system of religious truths , should exclude it from the important office of justifying , or should ask in the well-known , but often-perverted words of St. James , " Can faith save him ? " Justification is indeed a blessing of such inestimable . value , that too much caution can not possibly be exerted in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if a mere recognition of the truths of religion , a barren faith teaching . us to call Christ " Lord , Lord , " without doing his will or walking in his steps , were the instrument of justification , the utmost injury would accrue to the sacred interests of morality . But when the case is widely different , when the heavenly principle , to which the office of justifying is attached , is one producing every result which the moralist can desire , we need fear no danger from the assertion of St. Paul , that * ' a man is justified by faith . " The faith of the Christian is the fruitful parent of all that is excellent both in the heart and life . The Apostle John incidentally furnishes us with the two premises of a syllogism which undeniably shows how incompatible are faith and immorality . " Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; " " Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God ; " the conclusion from which is irresistible , that whosoever believeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least habitually and with a willing /q/ consent . Both Saint Peter and Saint Paul , in speaking of the all-sufficiency of faith , guard their doctrine from abuse by alluding to one or more of its essential properties , in order that their converts might not boast of an inefficient creed while their hearts and conduct were unrenewed . Faith , that purifieth the heart and worketh by love , could not easily be supposed to mean a mere barren assent to the truth of Christianity . Among the characteristic properties of faith there is no one more remarkable than that mentioned by Saint John , and to which allusion has been already made , namely , that it ' overcometh the world . " It is evident from universal experience , that no other principle can produce this effect . Faith , however , performs it by a mode of operation peculiar to itself ; by presenting to the view things that are invisible , and showing their great superiority to the vanities of time and sense . - The reason why men prefer this world to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convinced , but that their passions are allured . Heaven is allowedly the greater object , but it is distant and invisible : whereas the world is ever at hand with its fascinations . It assumes every shape , addresses itself to every passion , obtrudes into every recess . We are never free from its influence . Whatever we see around us is the world ; and if we look into our own hearts , the world and worldliness are triumphant there . The voluptuous man worships it in the shape of pleasure ; the covetous , of gold ; the ambitious , of honour ; the retired , of ease . It dwells in cities ; but , not confined to these , it seeks the lonely retreat , it enters the temple of the AImighty , it intrudes into the closet of the most leavenly-minded Christian . Persons the most unlike n every other respect are here equally enslaved . The ) rofligate and the moralist , the infidel and the ostentaious devotee , are under its influence . Business and ) leasure , pride and pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less of tbc world . An object thus prepossessing , and thus obtrusivei must of necessity influence our minds , unless something more important be introduced . - * Now , faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence o ( things not seen . " It brings heaven nigh . It antedates eternity . It prevents th unhallowed intrusion of the world by pre-occupying its place , and presenting to the mind objects infinitely more important , and which are overlooked only because they are remote and spiritual . Upon every earthly scene it inscribes , Vanity of vanities , all is vanity ; " while it invests every thing relating to a future world with inconceivable importance . Men in general view heaven as a dream and earth as a reality , and their conduct corresponds to their perceptions ; but faith reverses the scene , and thus " it overcometh the world . " It presents motives to duty more forcibly than the highest temporal considerations , whilst it assures us of thai divine encouragement and support which alone can enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is not easily counteracted . St. Paul illustrates his definition of faith by numerous examples . He represents Moses , for instance , as surrounded with the world in its most attractive forms . He possessed the pleasures , the aflluence , and the wisdom of Egypt , and was presumptive heir to its crown . These were objects visible and tangible ; but faith weighed them in the balance of the sanctuary and found them lighter than nothing and vanity , so that he in consequence " esteemed the reproach ol Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt , foi he had respect to the recompense of the reward . " Faith was thus " the evidence of things not seen . " - The Apostle continues to exemplify his position by 8 glorious " cloud of witnesses , " proving to the Hebrews that faith in the expected Messiah had enabled theii or riiTH. 73 forefathers to overcome the world in its most varied forms . Its blandishments and its tortures were equally impotent : pleasures could not seduce their affections , nor pain overcome their constancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who enjoy greater information , and have witnessed the coming of Him whom thej* only expected , should imitate their example , and * run with patience the race that is set before us , looking unto Jesus , the author and finisher of our faith . " In the present day , we have not indeed those appalling difficulties to overcome with which the apostle and his contemporaries were environed : but the world is an enemy ever present , an enemy that must be hourly opposed , but which can never be conquered but by the same principle which enabled so many of the primitive Christians to become martyrs for the cause of their Redeemer . Saint John triumphantly inquires , " Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ? " Surely no one . All other men are its slaves and willing captives . It never even occurs to them that they are required to overcome it ; or that its " pomps and vanities " are to be renounced by the express letter of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they n can not revel more fully in its enjoyments . If any new species of worldly gratification be invented , they long to taste its delights . The man who possesses most of the spirit of the world , and has drunk deepest of its poisoned chalice , becomes an object of admiration and envy ; while the Christian , who has in any considerable measure lived up to the spirit of his baptismal vows , is regarded with mingled hatred and contempt . But what , it may be asked , is the nature of that world which faith teaches and enables us to overcome ? . The " beloved apostle " speaks of it as comprising " the ; lust of the flesh , the lust of the eye , and the pride of life . " j The first of these is subdued by really believing that I " our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost , " and /z/ constantly calling to mind , that " the grace of God which bringeth salvation , teaches us , that , denying ungodliness and worldly lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this present world . " The second , which includes every kind of covetousness , is not less a characteristic of the world than the former . If we use illicit means to procure riches , if we covet our neighbour 's possessions to increase them , if we sacri6ce to them that time and attention which ought to be devoted to our Creator , if we love them inordinately , if we dispose of them merely for our personal gratification , without considering the important purposes for which they were sent , we are among those unhappy persons described by Saint Paul , who , not perceiving that " the love of money is the root of all evil , " " have erred from ihefaithj and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows . " The full assurance ol faith would evidently have prevented these i unhappy effects . The third characteristic of the world is ' the pride - of life , " which no principle short of true faith can ef- i fectually subdue . Pride , we might almost imagine , was that fabled Proteus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent conquest , - that hydra *l which multiplied sevenfold as often as wounded , - that Antaeus which could never be conquered on his native /v earth . The man of business is often proud of bis skill , the man of family of his honors , the vigorous of his strength , the affluent of his riches , the learned of his talents , the elegant of his accomplishments ; nay , often the Christian himself of his spiritual graces and attainments . But faith abases pride , by pointing out Hiro , S " who , being in the form of God , and thinking it no i robbery to be equal with God , " yet " made himself of 1 no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of man ; and being found in fashion as a man , humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross . " /q/ Pride shrinks away from a sight like this . The characteristic of Christian faith is Christian humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from the state of dignity and happiness in which he was created , into an immeasurable gulf of sin and misery . His passions , his transgressions , his ignorance , his corrupt affections , his unhallowed will , the temporal and eternal punishment which he deserves , contrasted with the unmerited mercies which he has received , and the still greater , which through the merits of his Saviour he expects , all tend to create deep self-abasement and humility r " Pride was not made for man . " It is remarkable , how completely this description of the things which are in the world , and which faith is required to overcome , seems to include many of the most fashionable amusements of the present age . If any diversion , however specious the forms it may assume , ( forms , perhaps , so specious as oftentimes to gain it admission into families otherwise moral and exemplary , ) tend in any manner to inflame the sensual passions , to foster or gratify the insatiable cupidity of the selfish heart , or to encourage that pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely included under those things which faith may and ought to overcome . Whether scenic amusements and public assemblies be not usually conducted in such a way as to bring them under both the first and third of these characteristics , may deserve inquiry before we venture to join in them . Gaming , in all its forms , is evidently included in the second . A man who enjoys the full assurance of faith , can not possibly delight in unhallowed pleasures . The spirit and the temper of his mind are at variance with them . If any amusement be undertaken with a view to our heahh or innocent recreation , it can not be unlawful , so long as we find it does not unfit us for our duties to God and our neighbour ; so long as it does not encroach on moments that should /z/ be better employed , and does not indispose the miod for raeditatioD , prayer , and self-examination ; but if any one of these effects arise from our partaking in any diversion , either the diversion was sin in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render us criminal in the sight of God . Were we always to live in the full assurance of faith , the most trivial occurrences of life would be consecrated by its influence ; but " whatsoever is not of faith is sin ; ' ' so that every pursuit on which we can not consistently expect the divine blessing becomes a crime . The true Christian desires not any stronger argument against questionable amusements than the words of Saint John- - " these things are not of the Father , but of the world. * ' To him who desires to live up to the spirit of his baptismal engagements , this apostle could urge no stronger objection against the world than that it is worldly ; as Saint Paul , in describing the malignity of sin , says only that it is " exceeding sinful . " To a person just beginning to yield himself up to i his Creator , the world is a most formidable enemy ; for his faith , though genuine in kind , may not yet be j sufficiently matured to effect so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Struck with a ; sense of our real interest , and feeling the unparalleled importance of eternity , we resolve for a moment to profess ourselves decided followers of Christ , and desire to live up to our holy profession ; but too soon the impression is obliterated , and the discarded syren , with her allurements or her frowns , regains us to herself . Such is her influence , that if she can not fascinate , she overpowers ; if she can not make sin appear smiling and agreeable , she equally succeeds by representing holiness as terrific and austere . We dare not be different from the majority of heedless beings around us , although we believe our salvation depends upon the issue . We sacrifice our souls for the sake /q/ of fashion , and prefer the broad way that leadeth to destruction , because it is the common custom among our associates to walk in it . As the world is one of the first enemies which Christian faith has to encounter , so also it remains one of the last . It clings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven . Faith may have overpowered our natural fear of death and dread of futurity , long before it has completed its conquest over this versatile enchantress . If , however , we do not find that terrestrial scenes become daily less important to us ; that the world with its opinions , its pleasures , and its possessions , is sinking in our view - that eternity , as it approaches nearer , becomes more interesting , while the objects of time and sense relinquish their hold upon our heart , - we may be assured that we do not possess that full assurance of faith , whose essential property it is to overcome the world . Faith , however , by no means resembles that romantic sickliness of fancy , that feverish discontent , that cherished melancholy of poetical feeling , which not only render their possessor dissatisfied with the present scene , but also disqualify him for performing his duty in it . The heavenly grace under consideration is practically encctaZ in its influence . It does not terminate in gloomy reverie and self-absorption . While it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it derives is not that we may therefore be idle , but , on the contrary , must be doubly vigilant and active . It evidences its sense of the importance of eternity , not by neglecting the duties of time , but by a diligent and conscientious discharge of them ; knowing that a world of probation , though transitory and unsatisfying in itself , is awfully momentous in its connexion with the everlasting realities of a future state , especially at that solemn crisis when we shall be judged ' according to the deeds done in the body . " To remarks of the preceding nature it is often ob- /z/ jected , that the state of mind spoken of as constituting the operation of Christian faith , is but one among the many modes of factitious excitement , - a mere delusion , engendered and fostered by a well-disposed but credulous imagination , and by no means encouraged by the cool and rational spirit of the gospel . If this objection be admitted , in what way shall we account for the continual recurrence in scripture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living by faith , standing by faith ; of being purified by faith , sanctified by faith , justified by faith ; of Christians being mutu* ally comforted by faith , of having access to God by faith , of Christ 's dwelling in men 's hearts by faith , with various other expressions of similar import ? Does the sacred canon describe as real and essential , what is but visionary and delusive ? Far from it . If therefore Saint Paul avowed that ' ' the life which he lived in the flesh he lived by the faith of the Son of God , who loved him and gave himself for him , " it is surely not enthusiastic to expect a somewhat similar , though perhaps less remarkable experience , in all who profess the same . unchangeable religion . Faith then is a divine grace , produced externally by the truths of the gospel , - not however as the eflScient , but the instrumental cause , - and internally by the teaching of God the Father and the Holy Ghost . - Without it " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance , it produces the most celestial effects . " Looking unto Jesus , " its author and finisher , it enables us to " lay aside every weight , and the sin that doth so easily beset us . " It prompts us to emulate that glorious company of saints , confessors , and martyrs , " of whom the world was not worthy ; " but who obtained so " good a report through faith . It teaches us , in the spirit of self-renunciation , implicitly to rely upon God as " a faithful Creator . " From this moment , " to live is Christ , and to die is gain . " Beyond the valley of the shadow of death the eye of faith perceives /q/ a heavenly light breaking forth , and gradually increasing to the perfect day . Surrounded with clouds and darkness here , the Christian beholds an unsetting sun beaming on the distant hills beyond the grave . If mortality can boast of happiness , it is the lot of that man who , ready to depart , forgetting a world which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward towards his native home , can in the confidence of his faith assert with Job , ' I know that my Redeemer llveth ; " or exult with the apostle of the Gentiles , who , in the near prospect of dissolution , his heart glowing with rapture and melting with divine love , could exclaim , in a voice already attuned to the music of the third heavens , ' I am ready to be offered , and the time of ray departure is at hand : I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith ; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day . " This was the triumph of the gospel ; the full assurance of Christian faith . Theoretical religion , a mere orthodox creed , could never have exalted the apostle to so sublime , so enviable a height of gratitude and adoration . When the moment comes in which the writer and the I'eader. of these pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must yield their present stations to a succeeding race , what more glorious epitaph can they desire than the aposde 's most emphatic words , /z/ The Christian 's highest attainment is the full assu ance of hope . Faith is the principle that points out the all-sufficiency of Christ Jesus for our salvation , and unites us to Hira ; but the well-assured expectation of glory which succeeds this union is more correctly denominated hope than faith . The functions , however , of these two divine graces are oftentimes so blended , that it is not easy to draw the exact line of demarcation between them ; so that what is predicated of the one might in many cases be applied with equal propriety to the other . Christian hope may be defined a heavenly and weU ' grounded expectation of salvation and eternal glort/i by Christ Jesus , in the method propounded in the gospel . It is heavenly , both because it emanates from God , and because it tends towards him . God is called the " God of hope , " and is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The principle , thus celestial in its origin , is not less so in its tendency . Rising above the mists that hover round sublunary scenes , it aspires after the invisible source of beatitude and perfection . Its language is , " Whom have I in heaven but Thee ? and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee . " Christian Hope is further defined to be well-grounded , in opposition to the presumptuous hope of the Pharisee , the delusive or HOPE . 81 hope of the hypocrite , and the vague dependence of the careless and uninformed . It is expectation as dis tinguished from perception ; for ' hope that is seen is not hope . " Salvation and eternal glory are mentioned as its objects , in order to distinguish it from human and worldly expectations ; for although it is the exclusive privilege of the Christian that he has " the promise of the life that now is , " as well as " that which is to come ; " yet his hopes being conversant almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing else as subordinate ; and would be willing to sacrifice every outward enjoyment , and to sustain every outward misery , for the hope of the prize of his high calling . Lastly , - Chriitian hope can exist only through Christ Jesus , who is expressly entitled " our hope , " and can be truly derived only in the method propounded in the gospel , by faith in his name If the preceding definition be correct , no principle that is human in its origin , or worldly in its tendency , that rests on false or insufficient grounds , or that expects salvation in any way but solely through the merits of Christ Jesus in the scriptural method , by a true and lively faith , can fairly claim the tide of Christian hope . In meditating qn this exalted principle , three obvious considerations occur to the mind , namely , its nature , its effects , and the means of its attainment and increase . To comprehend the nature of Christian hope , it is necessary to consider both the sublimity of the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which it rests . Among the objects of the Chrisuan'sl hope , the first is pardon of sins . The magnitude of this blessing will conspicuously appear from the various considerations which naturally rendered it of improbable attainment . Was not our forefather and federal representative forewarned , and was he not endued with power to stand i What reason then could there be to hope that the omnipotent and infinitely just Being , whom he had /z/ ofiended , would , under these aggravated circumstances , condescend to provide a remedy f Is not the gleam of hope still farther darkened by considering , that the * only way in which the wisdom of God saw fit that sin should be pardoned must be by the incarnation and death of his co-equal and well-heloved Son ? Both the infinite price of redemption , and man 's unworthiness of it , conspired to render it a hopeless blessing . If to this we add our own personal demerits , our continued , our multiplied , our aggravated transgressions , our sins committed against light and against knowledge , against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , taking also into our view the unbending justice and unimpeachable veracity of the Creator , - we shall perceive the pardon of sin to be no ordinary benefaction . But Christian hope , being commensurate with Christian faith , looks still higher , expecting not only pardon , but justification ; that is , a complete and satisfactory acquittal , an oblivion of every charge against us , and a re-investiture in all the original but forfeited privileges of our once happy primogenitor . Hence this animating principle , though far from attempting to veil the malignity of sin , or furnishing motives for its encouragement , yet being grounded on a sense of the immeasurable love of God and the infinite value of the Redeemer 's sacrifice , looks forward , even in this world , to the highest blessings . It humbly expects unfailing supplies of grace in the due use of all appointed means , with new and continual accessions of knowledge , of faith , and of holiness . Amidst all the inherent weaknesses of the Christian , and the spiritual enemies which would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hope teaches him to expect the preserving mercy of God to keep him in his arduous course , assured that whom the Heavenly Parent loveth he loveth unto the end . Faith having once credited the astonishing assertion of the apostle , that " all things work together or HOPE . 88 for good to them that love God , to them that are the called according to his purpose , " the map of providence , even in its darkest shades , instantly becomes illumined with the cheering rays of hope . ' ' All things ! " Deprived of health and friends , of the comforts and conveniences of life - enough will still remain . Hope builds upon the universality of the proposition . We perceive not the mysteries of futurity ; but hope , mingled with faith , includes them all in the glorious catalogue of blessings . Every moment , as it glides by upon its silent pinion , appears commissioned to perform an errand of mercy . Nature , pursuing her appointed course , is unconsciously producing the intended effects . Even losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . Enemies involuntarily become friends ; and hope , instead of wantonly lacerating her feet with the briars that infest her path , contrives from every thorn to pluck a flower . Even temporal mercies , though but of secondary importance , are anticipated by her upon the faith of that consoling promise , ' ' Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all thesQ things shall be added unto you . " Christian hope has its highest triumph where natural hope entirely fails . It embraces objects unseen and eternal . It extends beyond the grave . " This is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life . " Faith having taught us that we must rise again , hope anticipates a resurrection unto happiness . It expects the moment when our ' ' vile body shall be made like unto Christ 's glorious body , " and when , invested with the garment of the Redeemer 's righteousness , we shall be found ' perfect and entire , lacking nothing . " Already hope hears the thrilling accents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter thou into the joy of thy Lord . " Heaven from that moment bens . The great object for which the world was created is acconjplished . Fallen man has arrived at the /z/ portals of the celestial world , and has begun to enjoy the unclouded presence of his Creator . The glory a God , to which human felicity was intended to be subservient , is now complete . Hope , in looking forward to these inefiable scenes , expects infinitely more than she can conceive . She limits the anticipated joy by nothing but the power of the Creator to bestow , and the glorified spirit to contain . Where the full assurance of hope exists , how intense oftentimes are the aspirations of the soul after the expected bliss ! Terrestrial objects begin to pall upon the sense , except when taken in their important reference to eternity . Nothing but eternity can fill the expanded soul . Fallen as mankind is , hift powers are still too noble to be satisfied with any thing that arth can afford . Saint Paul prayed for a blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " filled with all the fulness of God . " From the deathbed of the expiring Christian , methinks I hear the alternately soft breathings and rapturous anticipations of the heaven-born principle of hope . " When shall this mortal put on immortality ? Why , O Lord , are thy chariot wheels so long in coming ? Why tarry the wheels of thy chariots ? When shall this thirsty soul drink at the fountain-head of the river of life , the streams of which eternally make glad the city of God ? Roll swiftly on , ye lingering moments , and bring me to my eternal reward . Vanish , ye interposing clouds , that veil from my mortal gaze my Redeemer 's throne . How brightly does eternity begin to dawn upon my parting soul ! Even now I behold the distant shores to which I am hastening . Already they appear illumined with celestial radiance . The past is forgotten . The vanities of time gone ! Nothing remains but the remembrance of the mercy and the truth which have followed me all my days . God hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become my portion forever . Mine eyes shall see the King in his beauty , or HOPE . 85 they shall behold the land that is very far off . Every tear shall be wiped away . Tbe wicked shall cease from troubling , and the weary shall be at rest . The disappointments of life are over , and shall never recur . All is DOW certainty and repose . My Redeemer hath triumphed over death and hell : he hath led captivity captive , and hath insured the victory even to me , the weakest of his followers . All things are mine , whether ' the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; ' all are secured to me by the same unalterable tenure which secures them to my almighty Redeemer ; for I am Christ 's , and Christ is God 's . How do earthly delights shrink into nothing in comparison with the glories of eternity ! What equivalent can life , with all its boasted enjoyments , afford for the unclouded presence , the beatific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I love ; in whom , though now I see him not , yet believing , I rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory ? ' Every thing short of this is less than nothing and vanity . But this will satiate the most enlarged desires of my soul . Then shall I be satis6ed when I awake in thy Hkeness . " Such are the anticipations that oftentimes fill the bosom of the dying Christian ! Such is his foretaste of the glory that shall follow ! But , look again - the last sigh has escaped , and hope has winged her eager way to scenes where she is forever lost in divine fruition . If then Christian hope be a principle embracing such illimitable objects of enjoyment , it becomes highly necessary to inquire into the stability of the basis on which it rests . It is no common foundation that can support so vast an edifice . Were human merit or human promises our ground of expectation , we might be eventually obliged to exclaim with Job , " My hope hast thou removed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being founded upon the immutable promises of Him who can not falsify or retract , is in- /z/ finitely more stable than any earthly confidence . TIm power of the promiser being supreme , bis beneficeat intentions can not be frustrated ; from which coosidoration the apostle of the Gentiles was accustomed to derive the highest satisfaction . I know in wbom I have believed , and that he is able to keep that wfaieb I have committed unto him . " The eternal bills shall sink away , the sun shall forget to run his diurnal course , earth shall be dissolved , and all the starry worlds which adorn the brow of night be blotted from existence ; but while Deity itself shall survive , the hope of the Christian is secure . The omnipotence and unimpeachable truth of the sacred Trinity are combined i with unbounded love and mercy in support of the be- pr liever 's expectation . Our trust , the apostle affirms , was made to rest upon two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie , " in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled for T refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us in the gospel . " These two immutable things , therefore , namely , the promise and the oath of the Eternal , are - irrevocably pledged in behalf of all those who are in- eluded in the character described . It is consoling to know that the promises of God are confirmed in Jesus Christ ; that ' in him they are all yea , and in him amen , ; unto the glory of God by us . " Saint Paul therefore expressly entitles the Messiah , " the Lord Jesus Christ our hope . " No pledge could possibly be stronger , or convey more forcibly to our weak minds , ( what , however , would have been equally true though no pledge had been given , ) the immutable nature of the divine promise . No pledge , it is asserted , could have been stronger ; for " if God spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood of the incarnate Son of God is solemn and inviolable . The obedience of Christ being complete , to the exclusion of every thing human as the /q/ meritorious cause of salvation , the promised blessings will not , can not be withheld from any who answer to the character described . Unchangeable veracity , almighty power , and godlike beneficence , all concur to forbid such an idea . We may even conceive that our Heavenly Parent beholds with sacred complacency the hope which he himself has implanted ; a hope spring* iog from him as its source , tending towards him as its end , and embracing as its objects those eternal realities which he himself hath taught us to desire . Such th6n is Christian hope ; such are its objects and such the immutable basis on which it rests . What then are its effects ? for hope is no dormant principle ; in the spiritual as well as moral world its operation is energetic and unceasing . It is the grand spring of vigour and alacrity . What but the hope of conquest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expectation of enjoyment and repose after the fatigues of the day , supports the laborer amidst his incessant toil . ' Incited by this flattering principle , the adventurous merchant quits his native clime , and tempts the dangers of a faithless element . Unwearied in his pursuit , he contentedly pants beneath the fervors of a tropical sun , and braves the rigors of the tempestuous north . His object is affluence ; but how often does his hope deceive him ! how often does his eventful voyage terminate in the bitterness of disappointment ! if his end be attained , how unsatisfactory and how fleeting his envied possession ! Yet still he persists . And shall Christian hope - a hope conversant with objects infinitely more important in their nature , and , which adds inexpressibly to their value , objects eternal and unchanging - be esteemed a speculative or inefficient principle The promises of the gospel were intended to awaken men to spiritual Kfe and activity . A mere belief of the existence of Heaven and Hell , without any means of attaining the one or avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart , and have paralysed every generous faculty into inaction . It is the property of despair to benumb the soul , while hope adds toit unwonted elasticity and ardor . As the weary traveller , lost at midnight in the pathless wild , and scarcely able to urge along his sullen step , if by chance he perceive at a distance the cheerful glimmering of a taper , redoubles his pace , and in the eagerness of hope , forgets for a moment the fatigues and anxieties of the way , - so the Christian , exploring his path to the heavenly Canaan through this vale of tears , is oftentimes incited by the brightness of the distant prospect to new exertions in his course , and learns , from the consideration of his most triumphant privileges , to adopt in his practice the exhortation of Saint Paul , " Be ye steadfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the LiOrd , forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord . The Apostle , in writing to the Gentiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope by allusions to the well-known Grecian games . He describes , for instance , the candidates in the Isthmian foot-race , as practising rigid temperance and self-denial , and submitting to the most painful restraints , in order to prepare themselves for the important contest . Their highest ambition was excited ; all their renown acquired in former victories , and which was usually considerable , and dearer to them than life itself , was now at stake . This last contest was to decide their lot , and they were to return home covered With glory , or overwhelmed with reproaches , the most despised or the most illustrious of men . Having once become candidates for the prize , there remained no alternative between the extremes of honor and contempt . To elevate their minds to the utmost ardor of artificial excitement , the most studied efforts of friends and countrymen were incessantly employed . The song of the poet and the eulogy of the historian continually /q/ sounded in their ears . No stimulant of virtue to arouse the torpid energies of the fallen mind was omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the approbation of their gods , all conspired to raise them to the highest pitch of phrensied expectation . Thus preternaturally excited , they approached the eventful scene . If new incentives were wanting , they were now abundantly supplied . The presence of their kings and heroes , of their poets and philosophers , the alternately breathless silence and rapturous shouts of myriads of their expecting countrymen , the applauses of their friends , and the taunts of their enemies , the remembrance of former victories , the dread of future disgrace ; above all , the honorary chaplet that waited the victorious brow , conferring a glory superior in their eyes to the diadem of princes , - all concurred to infuse the proudest hopes , the most ardent desires , into their undaunted souls . The race once begun , every nerve and ligament is strained to obtain the long-hoped-for prize . One object only fills the panting bosom . - Every consequence is risked . If victory be gained , they value not life itself for its attainment . Thus winged by expectation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible celerity their breatliless course , their hopes and fears rapidly increasing as they approach the goal , till at length a few moments put an end to their toil , and crown the victor with the hardearned wreath . Alluding to this scene , a scene with which the Corinthians were perfectly conversant , the Apostle introduces an observation as striking and important as it is natural and unaffected : " Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible ; " evidently implying that the conduct of the Christian should correspond to the unequalled magnitude of bis hopes , and the arduous nature of his contest . The antagonist of the Olympic wresder was but a mortal like himself ; but " we wrestle not with flesh and blood , but with principalities , and powers , and the /z/ rulers of the darkness of this world , and spiritual edness in high places . " The spectators of his contest were frail and ignorant men , who proved by ardor in such a worthless cause , bow little tbey knew of the really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest of the Christian is beheld and approved by kindred spirits upon earth , by an innumerable company of saints and angels in heaven , and by the Eternal Judge himself , who giveth us the victoiy through our Lord Jesus Christ . " Above all , eir reward was but a perishable garland , which has long since mouldered away with the brow which it adorned ; while the prize of our high vocation is ' an inheritance incorruptible , undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for us . " As therefore our hope b inexpressibly glorious , our spiritual exertions ought to be constant , energetic , and unreserved . The health and vigor of the soul are to the Christian , what the health and vigor of the body were to the Olympic champion . Let us then study to preserve them by mortifying our corrupt affections , and by a continual spirit of prayer and watchfulness , of dependence and humility . Another effect ascribed by the apostle to Christian hope , is , that every person possessing it , " purifietb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remarkable that this very property of purifying the heart is ascribed also to faith , which not only shows the intimate connexion between these two principles , but also effectually obviates any suspicion of their being hostile to good works . The necessity of purification evidently implies , that by nature we are polluted with sin ; a doctrine indeed so luminously displayed in scripture , that it is difficult to conceive how it should ever have been denied. : - But in what manner , it may be asked , does hope purify the soul ? What connexion can it have with sanctification ? The answer is easy . In the first /z/ /q/ place , it is evidently congr%tous that he who expects Mich high and heavenly blessings should be qualified hj holiness for the enjoyment of them . And as it is congruous , it is also necessary ; for though our only tide to heaven is the infinite mercy of Christ applied to us by faith , yet our qualification for it is holiness of heart , and , by consequence , of life , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope which looks forward to a scene where worldliness has never in* truded , where sensual gratifications are unknown , where avarice and pride , voluptuousness and evil passion - in a word , where every tiling sinful and contaminating is forever excluded - must of necessity be accompanied with some degree of mental purification . The only limit affixed by the apostle is , " even as God is pure ; " and although this expression corresponds , it must be lamented , rather to the Christian 's habitual desire than to his actual attainment , yet it shows at least the radical excellency of that principle from which so glorious a desire can spring . Among the effects of hope , it is scarcely necessary to observe that joy is especially included , since this is confessedly its most natural and evident result . Saint Paul speaks of rejoicing in hope , " as not less a duty than being " patient in tribulation , " and ' ' instant in prayer . " A man who really expects that " all things will work together for his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an arduous conflict , he knows that through the " Captain of his salvation , " the victory is secure . He therefore rejoices in hope now , and shall rejoice in eternal fruition hereafter . A valuable property of Christian hope is , that at the worst of seasons , it preserves us from defection . It is " the anchor of the soul , " which being " cast within the veil , " renders our feeble bark steady and secure amidst the storms of a tempestuous world . Hence the apostle says , " we are saved , " that is , preserved , " by hope . " The firm belief and pleasurable anticipation of future /z/ glories are more than a counterbalance for every present danger , persecution , or disappointment . The apostle was an illustrious example of bis position , that we are preserved by hope . " In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labors , in watchings , in fastings , in journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils amongst false brethren , in weariness , in painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness , besides those things which were without , the care of all the churches ; " what , but the full assurance of hope of the eternal glory that should follow , could have preserved his unwearied constancy ? But incited by this unconquerable principle , he cheerfully submitted to all that malice or misconception could inflict . Plunged continually in an overwhelming sea of troubles and persecutions , the buoyancy of hope instantly elevated him to the surface , and enabled him calmly to overlook the surrounding storm . We have no instance upon record of his ever being once betrayed into impatience , despondency , or irritation . His exertions were grounded upon principle , and were therefore permanent and uniform . In patience he possessed his soul . His success among the heathen may in a great measure be imputed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was remarkably conspicuous , - the " meekness of wisdom , " and the " patience of hope ; " both , however , under the benign influence of that " love unfeigned " which pervaded his whole soul , and added an engaging sweetness to all his labors . That faith in the gospel , and a fully assured hope of its inestimable blessings , should Inflame his zeal and diligence in preaching it to others , was no uncommon result ; but that a zeal so ardent , a diligence so unconquerable , should have been uniformly guided by the " meekness of wisdom , " was a circumstance of /q/ ccurrence . In persons of ordinary character it unusual to perceive an eager and laudable zeal J eternal welfare of their fellow-creatures , comhowever , with but little of that meek discretion in a world of sin and prejudice is required to lue effect to the most praise-worthy exertions ; th still less , perhaps , of that patience of hope , " is necessary to support the pious philanthropist the delays , misrepresentations , ingratitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitute of the " patience of hope " is however us defect in a religious character . Zeal without iffering and humility is of little value . When iristian was commanded to let his " light shine men , " it was not meant that he should resemble or , dazzling the world for a moment with an un- ig glare , and then angrily sinking into darkness ; her , that he should imitate the celestial luminary , daily rises almost unheeded to perform his im ; task , and gradually waxes brighter and more ; ; and patiently and steadily diffusing blessings him both on the evil and the good , without It all influenced by the applauses or the censures lower world . en Christian hope be so exalted an attainment , mes a question of great practical importance , in lanner it may be acquired f It is not the san- unauthorized expectation of a presumptuous but the deliberate dictate of a mind enlightened Holy Spirit to discover the true evidences of an piety , and taught by the same Spirit to deimbly , but correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-examination , is not mark of folly than of presumption . Before re we profess to obtain " a good hope through ' it is necessary that we should institute an iminquiry into our real state . Have we , for insincerely repented of sin , feeling , as our Church c. ft i /z/ expresses it , " the remembrance of it to be grievous , the burden of it to be intolerable ? " Perceiving , at the same time , our utter inability to save ourselves by our own merits , have we humbly applied to our Crea- a tor for pardon , through the worthiness and obedience h of his dearly beloved Son , the only Mediator between offended Deity and offending man ? Has such a change taken place in our hearts , that sin , even in its more specious forms , has become hateful , and holiness and obedience to Crod our element and delight ? Do jii we love and serve our Maker supremely and without &; reserve ? Have we complied with the exhortation of the apostle , ' Be not conformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewing of your minds ? " Has a sense of the value of the soul and the importance of eternity become predominant in our minds ? Have we cheerfully submitted to the mode of salvation revealed in scripture , as conscious sinners , feeling our guilt and inability , and in humble penitence trusting to the merits of the Redeemer alone for acceptance with God ? Is our faith evidenced by good works ? by the implantation of Christian graces and virtues in the soul , and the hourly exhibition of their benign influence in our lives and conduct ? Do we know the value , and practise the duty , of prayer and divine communion ? Do we cultivate and rejoice in all ' the means of grace , " which were expressly intended to keep alive in us " the hope of glory ? " Do we earnestly pray that God would ' search and try us , " and enable us faithfullv to ascertain our true character f In a word , have we " presented ourselves , our souls and bodies , a living sacrifice unto God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live no longer unto ourselves , but unto Him who bought us with the price of his own most precious blood ? " In estimating the propriety of our hopes , we should never cease to remember , that no hope is well founded which is not accompanied by faith and love . Trust /q/ in the promises of God , through Christ , is the ground of Christian hope ; charity b its never-failing effect . The soul beholding by the eye of &ith; the glories of futurity , and already enjoying them by lively anticipa* tion , can not but melt into ardent love to their betiefi* cent-Dispenser . A consequent desire to behold him as he is , to enjoy his eternal smile , and to utter before bim the delightful homage of gratitude and adoration , becomes a predominant feeling of the bosom . Since , however , the infinite Source of benevolence and loveliness is invisible to mortal eyes , and needs not mortal assistance , the enraptured soul can only vent its fervent desires and heavenly affections , by transferring to his visible image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity , which are but faint and feeble tations of the Creator 's unspeakable love and beneficence towards us . But faint and feeble as they are , he graciously accepts them ; Forasmuch as ye did it to the least of these little ones , ye did it unto me . " Thus are the three Christian graces connected by an indissoluble bond . Faith is the parent of hope , and hope is the companion of charity . Faith shall soon be lost in sight , and hope in eioyment ; but charity shall still survive , the same in kind , though much higher in degree , with that which even now inires the heaven-born soul . The two former were iatended only for a state of probation ; the latter is essential and eternal , being the bond which joins the Creator to his creatures , and by which his creatures , in proportion as they resemble him , will be mutually united to each other . The Christian 's love to God , which is now so cold and imperfect , shall then be exalted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this immortal principle of love will be continually receiving new accessions of fervor by the unclouded presence and nearer approach of its long-expected object . If then we would ascertain the nature of our faith and hope , let us especially examine /z/ g ( TULL ASSURANCE whether they be accompanied by divine love ; a loi tending primarily and supremely to God , and display ed by a constant disposition to benefit the bodies and souls of our fellow-creatures . The end of the commandment is charity , out of a pure heart , and . good conscience , and faith unfeigned . " ' Love is the fulfilling of the law . " It not unfrequently occurs , that sincere ChristiaDS , who , upon careful self-examination , accompanied with earnest prayer , appear to have good reason to believe themselves possessors of true religion , are still far from experiencing that full assurance of hope which is always a desirable attainment . The fault being however in ourselves , and not in our Heavenly Parent , who never withholds the comforts of religion , except where he perceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it may not be useless to suggest a few practical hints for obtaining the desired blessing . Meditate frequently upon God ; not so much , however , in his abstracted perfections , as in his covenantal relations to us in the economy of human redemption . A mere belief in a Being omnipotent and everlasting , self-derived and unapproachable , infinitely holy and inflexibly just , is by no means necessarily productive ol the full assurance of hope . Learn rather to view hira as a reconciled Father , an almighty Guardian , a divine Comforter , a patient and unerring Guide . Contemplate his benignity , his compassion , his long-suffering . Repose in him as an unchanging friend , aspire after him as your " exceeding great reward . " Behold his immutable veracity , his supreme power , and his unbounded wisdom , not as mere abstract properties ol the Divinity , but as harmonizing with that goodness and mercy which prompted him to redeem a wicked and ungrateful world . Reflect with holy fervor upor his love , as displayed in the person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anc man ; and upon his promises of pardon and blessing /q/ fb the returning penitent , through faith in the beneficent liedeemer . Study to be more humble , more vigilant , and more submissive to his will . Quench not his Holy Spirit by worldliness or unbelief . Watch over those evil tempers and unhallowed propensities which too often intercept the light of his divine countenance . - Learn from your past experience of his mercy a lesson of implicit confidence . Especially neglect not that important means of obtaining the full assurance of hope - fervent and continual prayer . Hope , like faith , is the gift of God , and is bestowed freely on all who ask ; Saint Paul therefore makes it the subject of one of his most animated intercessional benedictions . ' * Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost . " It can not be doubted but that " the Author of every good and perfect gift " can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to raise the mind above all doubt and perturbation . This appears to have been eminently the case of Saint Paul : " I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith . Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , shall give me at that day . " " The Spirit itself , " the same apostle teaches , " beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God . " Prayer , therefore , for the influences of this Holy Spirit is an evident means of obtaining the comfort of hope . The very act of prayer , if it spring from the heart , evidences that we already possess some degree of hope in the willingness of God to listen to our petitions ; and since habitual prayer familiarizes us to the contemplation of his gracious encouragements and promises , it tends to strengthen and confirm the hope from which it sprang . For hope is an increasing grace ; like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself the seeds of its future growth and perfection . Where /z/ it exists but in the lowest degree , it causes love to its celestial objects ; and love , by its habitual contemplation of God , daily beholding in him new grounds of i trust and confidence , gives birth , in return , to more -i exalted hopes . Thus do understanding , faith , hope , i and charity , mutually act and re-act , augmenting and i augmented by their reciprocal influence , till they all ! i arrive at that maturity which constitutes the Christian 's highest attainment in this present world . ' It is delightful to behold the advanced spiritual - traveller , after the fatigues of his toilsome day , arriving in the evening of life within sight of his eternal : home . Elevated , like Moses , upon the heights of ; Pisgah , far above the busy crowd with whom he has ) so long associated , he is enabled from the serene emi- i nence on which he stands to behold at once the coun- try he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ' looks back upon his chequered path , surprised that obstacles which now appear so trifling , compared with the importance of the objects in view , should so long have retarded his progress . The interposing mountains which once he thought impassable , have now lost their asperities , and appear but as airy clouds in the distant horizon . With sorrow he retraces his frequent deviations from the direct path in search of giddy phantoms , which oftentimes , after all his efforts , eluded his pursuit , or if obtained , proved but an encumbrance to him in his arduous pilgrimage . Animated by the beauty of the country which He s before him , and which is separated from him only by the dark river of death that rolls along its sullen wave to the ocean of eternity , he looks back with regret and wonder upon that infatuation which so often induced him to prefer the trifles of the scene through which he was journeying , to the celestial glories of yon blissful shore . " Forgetting therefore these things which are behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His hopes e in heaven . He adopts the language of the /q/ Psalmist , " What wait I for ? " - For worldly honors ? They can not fill the unbounded grasp of an immortal soul . For pleasures f They are unsatisfactory and fleeting . Thousands of dying voluptuaries have confessed their inability to produce happiness , and have bitterly lamented their own folly in pursuing them . - For riches f They are valuable only as applied to the responsible ends for which they were bestowed , but by no means tend to make a death-bed easy , or eternity more welcome . " What then wait I for ? Surely my hope is in thee , O Lord . " I wait not for any thing mutable or terrestrial . Wealth , and honors , and long life , will not satiate my desires . God shall be my portion forever . I shall " be filled with all the fulness of God . " /z/ Few errors are more common , or more injurious , than the idea that our Saviour came upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not perhaps avow the sentiment in plain terms , but does not our general spirit too often prove it to be a latent article of our belief ? The most ostentatious formalist will not assert that he Ims fully performed that unlimited obedience which God required of Adam before the fall . He sees indeed that the thing is impossible . He even readily acknowledges some trifling imperfections , some casual inadvertencies , some slight mental aberrations . He will not exactly affirm that a wrong thought never once glanced through his mind - that a useless or improper word never once passed his lips - that a selfish , or thoughtless , or otherwise imperfect action never once marked his conduct . He dares not say , that from his very infancy he has loved the Lord his God with " al his heart , and soul , and mind , and strength , " or tha he has loved his neighbor exactly as himself . H trusts , however , that his heart is good , that he has n flagrant crime to answer for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorances , " are all of so venial a kind a to be easily forgiven . Without stopping to comment upon the various ob jectionable parts of this statement , especially the totaL ignorance which it implies of the nature and extent o the divine requisitions , were we to proceed to ask upon what he grounded his hopes of salvation , which , by hii /q/ own acknowledgmenty could not be claimed upon the condition of unerring obedience , the answer would probably be , God is merciful : he does not expect men to be angels : he made us , and will allow something for our natural infirmities . " Still , however , this answer , to say no worse , is vague and unsatisfactory . Reasoning upon the principles of natural religion , it may be fairly assumed , that if by being angels is meant being perfect in holiness and obedience , God does expect man to be as holy as an angel , for he originally made him such , and never superinduced any thing to render him otherwise . If by our fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and our misfortune , but by no means our excuse . God made us " very good , " and capable of performing all that he required . Our sins and infirQiities are entirely self-derived . The question then still recurs , and must be anvvered some other way . Natural religion being foiled ' Q its attempts , modernized Christianity enters , and professes to solve the difficulty . " We ive under a lenient dispensation . The obedience and leath of Christ have great weight ; so that if our conluct be upon the whole moral and sincere , all is well . V few thoughtless amusements , a few venial faults , a giddy follies of youth , will never be regarded by ur Creator as unpardonable crimes . " Now , is it not the obvious tendency of this language lo prove that God is too merciful to be just , too attentive tohis benevolence to spend a thought upon his veracity i Not being able or even willing to reach the standard of his law , we strive to lower his law to our imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural or revealed , do we make the attempt ? Admitting that God is originally entitled to universal obedience , whence do we infer that he has relinquished his claim i Surely not from natural reason , and much less from scripture ; for though the /z/ k /z/ Redeemer died to procure pardon for our awful violation of obedience , when by repentance and faith we turn unto him whom we have forsaken , he did not render obedience less a duty . So far indeed from it , he defined its nature , and added new motives and encouragements to its performance . Obedience to God is the original law of our creation . It is an obligation eternal and immutable . The excellency of Christianity consists , not in superseding its necessity , but in making it an object of desire and delight , at the same time that it reveals pardon by the vicarious obedience of Christ Jesus to those who by the decision of natural religion must have been otherwise reduced to despair . The idea therefore that we who live since the advent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law which is satisfied with 2l partial obedience - is evidently derogatory to the unchangeable perfections of our Creator . The peremptory requisitions of God 's law are unaltered and unalterable , and so that it is not by pleading our own imperfect obedience , however sincere , but the full and perfect obedience of our Surety , that we can scripturally hope for the blessings of salvation . If a partial obedience had been sufficient , Christ died in vain . Extremes frequently approach , and it is evidently so in the case before us . The anti-legalist , in his exclusive zeal for doctrines , asserts that Christ entirely abolished the moi-al law as a rule of conduct : while the nominal Christian persuades himself that he cd.  - -  to soften down its requisitions ; that is , abolisheoit in part . The first , it must be confessed , substitutes the " law of love " in the place of the moral code ; but the system of the latter is wholly incongruous and disjointed . If Christ has in any measure lowered the obedience that was naturally due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowedly imperfect may be saved by them , because they equal the usual standard of professed Christians , to what degree of absurdity /q/ my not the doctrine be carried f If a mere thoughtless , giddy worlding may expect salvation by this remedial law , because perhaps he has not been guilty of flagrant acts of turpitude , we could not reasonably exclude another who was but one shade worse ; and thus we might proceed in the scale of moral depravity , till there was not an individual in existence to whom salvation was not justly due . It is owing to the frequent , though perhaps almost unconscious encouragement of this serious error , that the great doctrine of the atonement is not more distinctly acknowledged and acted upon by the majority of professed Christians . They think they shall surely arrive at heaven because Christ , they imagine , has rendered the conditions of obtaining it perfectly easy ; - - so easy indeed , that a baptized person may indulge the * lust of the flesh , the lust of the eye , and the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not considering the extent and immutability of the law , they perceive not the nature or value of the gospel . They can not indeed , on account of their acknowledged imperfections , trust entirely to the inexorable " covenant of works " under which Adam was created ; yet being unwilling to comply with the humbling " covenant of grace , " which , while it promises free i pardon upon our repentance and faith , makes a holy j and obedient heart the indispensable criterion of our having been enabled to accept that covenant , they waver between the two , and endeavor to soften down the irreversible law of our creation by a few qualifying clauses wrested from the covenant of grace . This conduct is , however , highly unchristian ; for our Lord , so far from having come upon earth to render the divine law less strict , expressly pointed out its spiritual and universal nature , and applied it to the very " thoughts and intents of the heart . " He did not emancipate us from our allegiance , though he proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had broken it , should , with earnest repentance and implicit faith in his mercy , return to the propitiated Sovereign from whom they had revolted . He reconciled us unto God ; not that we might from henceforth live with impunity " Atheists in the world , ' ' seeking our own pleasure , and following our own devices ; but that being adopted into his family , we might become spiritual and holy , and meet for the heavenly inheritance which he had provided for his returning child . He did not preach grace in order that sin might abound ; but , on the contrary , attached the application of his grace inseparably and exclusively to such a renovation of heart as should make sin appear an object of abhorrence . It is then obvious that the expectation of heaven , so usual even amongst those who never once seriously considered how it might be scripturaily obtained , arises from ignorance of the natural and unalterable requisitions of the divine law . We trust to the uncovenanted mercies of God , because we are not sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uninteresting to those who " call themselves Christians , " seriously to inquire what is the real nature and extent of the obedience which we owe to our Creator . In the first place , it should be universal , without partiality or reserve . David said , " I shall not be ashamed when I have respect to all God 's commandments . " It is not occasionally splendid acts , but uniformity of principle that God requires . To be free from the grosser violations of duty , whilst we willingly tolerate what we call trifling faults , is of no avail . As far as the habit of mind is concerned , - and it is this to which Omniscience chiefly looks , - the distinction between venial and mortal sin is unscriptural and delusive . " Whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , is guilty of all . " Willingly to indulge any one evil habit , even supposing we were free from all others , would render us partakers of the guilt /q/ of Saul , who slew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought must be brought into willing captivity . It is to little purpose that the judgment is convinced , if the will , the fancy , the affections , be disobedient . He who has an unalienable right to the whole , will not be satisfied with a part . Obedience that extends only to what is agreeable , and lasts only as long as it suits our convenience , is too partial and too transient to deserve the divine acceptance . If we kve religion while she inspires our hopes , but part from her as soon as she thwarts our inclinations , our friendship is worthless and insincere . While we pray that " we may obtain that which God doth promise , " we must also love that which he doth command . " Our obedience also must correspond to our knowledge of the Creator 's will . " To him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin . " There are many things which though tolerated and even applauded in general society , including , perhaps , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet inconsistent with the self-denying and heavenly spirit of a professed inhabitant of a better country , who is only passing through the present world as a state of probation and moral restraint . Of these . Christian obedience demands an impartial and cheerful surrender . It forbids compromise or reserve . It is a stranger to that worldly policy , which sometimes affecting the name of Christian prudence , consents to commit a questionable evil in order to produce an unquestionable good . Saul , perhaps , imagined that reserving a part of the spoil of the Amalekites , though God had commanded the whole to be destroyed , would be more than atoned for by so great an act of piety as the offering a magnificent sacrifice to Jehovah . It is thus that we often yield something to the world , in hopes that the world in return will be induced to yield something to religion . We follow an acquaintance to a doubtful amusement , with a view of afterwards alluring /z/ bim to an instructive sermon . We read his bad book , in hopes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we believe to be wrong , to prevent , as we profess , J what we know to be worse ; thus making , as it were , / a tacit calculation of how much sin we may commit in order to produce a certain quantity of holiness . This , however , is not acting up to the light of Christianity , which teaches us never to violate one com- mand of God under pretext of doing something more J to his honor . The Supreme Disposer of Events mty , I indeed elicit good from evil ; but he never approvei I the sinner even when he overrules the crime . Nothing 1 therefore is more inconsistent with true obedience than - : " doing evil that good may come , " or trusting that the end will sanctify the means . ' Simplicity and gpdly sincerity " are essential qualities of Christian obedi- ' ence . It should be our chief effort to learn what is our duty , and to persist in it without fear of dangerous consequences , which he who overrules all hearts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , will never impute to our account . Again , true obedience must be the obedience of faith . Even under the Jewish economy this heavenly grace was indispensable ; and although it could not then be extended to many particulars which since the coming of the Messiah are revealed , yet it was to be perfect in its kind . It embraced those promises which were to be fulfilled when Shiloh should come , and relied upon the veracity of God for their accomplishment . It was faith that made the ceremonial observances acts of genuine obedience . When Saint Paul , rapt in divine meditation , beheld the glorious ' ' cloud of witnesses , " and sketched with the glowing colours of a seraph their immortal deeds , he ascribed them all to this exalted principle . Their obedience was the obedience of faith . The same acts performed without the same motives would have been worthless and unaccepted. /q/ Select any one example from the glorious catalogue , and try it by this test . When Abraham , for instance , was commanded to offer up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paternal affection , which must have been doubly harrowed up by the affecting minuteness of the command , " thy son - thine only son - Isaac - whom thou lovest ; " but with that distrust of the divine goodness , and veracity , and power , which naturally represented the mandate as wholly subversive of a former promise , " in thee shall all the nations of the be blessed . " Yet knowing that the word of Jehovah was inviolably firm , he feared not the result . At the awful moment when every hope was about to be extinguished , - his son bound upon the altar , - the parent 's hand extended to inflict the mortal stroke , fiuth rose triumphant in his bosom , and " accounted that God was able to raise up Isaac even from the &#9632; dead . " His trust in God was unconquerable by human reason or human foresight . Having once ascertained the divine will , he implicitly and even cheerfully obeyed . Let us now imagine the same action performed from a different motive . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator as an unreasonable tyrant , who was able to punish him still more severely in case of disobedience . " Resistance , " he might have argued , " is in vain . If I fail to comply , my son will still be taken , and perhaps by more severe and lasting torments . My whole household also may share his misfortune , and my grey hairs at length , stained and dishonored , be brought with sorrow to the grave . Cruel , therefore , as is the command , I will , I must , comply . " , Now is it not evident that compliance from such a motive would have been wholly unacceptable to God ? Our Maker looks for trust and dependence . A good action performed , or a bad one avoided , merely from a principle of slavish dread , would neither merit nor /z/ receive his approbation . In addition therefore to faitbi love is an essential quality in Christian obedience ; for " in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but faith which worketb by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moral , ( " circumcision or uncircumcision , " ) is truly acceptaole , unless it spring from ' love to God , and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ . " The divine command is , " My son , give me thy heart ; but the religion of more than half the world is an attempt at commutttion . The voluptuary stipulates , that if he may be allowed quietly to resign his heart to the vanities and pleasures of the world , as long as he retains his vigor and his youth , he will give in exchange a few ardent prayers upon a death-bed , a few unavailing tears , a few sighs of deep-felt contrition , a few closing moments of j devotion to God , out of a whole life , due to his honor ' and his service . The covetous man yields his heart to his gold , but trusts that Heaven will accept the posthumous equivalent of a charitable bequest . The nominal Christian is content to yield an hour 's external homage on the Sabbath , on the condition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the week ; or should conscience sometimes begin to reproach him , he throws into the scale a fast or a festival , and doubts not but this will effectually turn it in his favor . The inconsistent devotee , whose heart is usurped by the avaricious and malignant spirit of gaming , is determined that the commutation shall be perfectly liberal , and therefore , perhaps daily , frequents the service of the church , and endeavors , during its continuance , to spend as few thoughts as possible upon the interesting engagement that is so soon to succeed . This restraint , however , being very irksome , is looked upon as purchasing a more than usual indulgence for a worldly spirit ; and should even a little pride , or discontent , or anger , or covetousness , or envy , or censoriousness , shortly after find admission , /q/ it will be easily excused at the tribunal of conscience , on account of the precious stock of merit acquired by so good an act . Penances , and pilgrimages , and masses , and lazarettos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautified , " are but a few of the ostentatious equivalents which have been offered to our Creator for the revolted affections of the heart ; but He who * giveth not his honor to another " spurns at the degrading compromise , and accepts of no gift that does not spontaneously flow from the cordial obedience of faith and love . ' ' Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the Lord r Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams . " Not indeed that external observances are to be neglected ; not that prayers , and fasting , and almsdeeds are to be discountenanced : they are undoubtedly all excellent and indispensable , and the only danger is when they are intended as substitutes for something higher . The " form of godliness " is necessary , but can not atone for the absence of the " power . " - Where the heart and affections , are devoted to God , these things will not , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means true , that wherever these things are performed , the heart is necessarily devoted to God . The act which men applaud for its piety , is oftentimes but a sacrifice to decency or custom , if not to ostentation and the love of praise . It is to the motive that we must chiefly look for the immense difference between the moralist and the Christian , the Pharisee and the genuine disciple . The good works of the one spring from a principle of gratitude and affection ; those of the other from habit , or expediency , or fear , or at best from an arrogant expectation of purchasing heaven by the performance . - The one is an obedient child , the other an unwilling dave . /z/ If , boweveri an earthly parent would not be satisfied with an obedience wholly unprompted by affeetioii why should we offer the same insult to our Father which is in heaven ? No person who loves any object better than his Creator can be said to be truly obedh ent . God requires our supreme and unrivalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily become holy and acceptable in his eyes . To render obedience complete , it must be constant and unremitted . There are no excepted moments io which a rival is allowed . Amidst the fatigues and the anxieties of life , our spirit must be uniformly Christian . Religion , though not always in our thoughts , must be so interwoven with the first springs of action , as to be always conspicuous in our conduct . Surrounded with the worshippers of the world , we must never bow our knee to their enchanting idol . The apostle exhorts us in the very same verse both to be diligent in business , and ' fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ; " so that the importance of our callings in life is by no means an excuse for our neglect of eternal concerns . God is far from accepting that aguish piety which works itself up into a warm fit of devotion every seventh day , and then contentedly shivers and freezes the other six . Our devotion should be the regular glow of a soul in spiritual health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental Christianity . A few tears shed in passion-week will not evince our love for the Redeemer , if we are deliberately " crucifying him afresh , and putting hira to an open shame " during the remainder of the year . Unusually solemn occasions , it is true , call for unusually solemn acts ; but the general impression should remain long after the individual act has ceased . The gospel being intended for all ages , and climates , and conditions in life , was made of such a nature that its energy might be unintermitted in every possible variety of circumstance . Had it simply consisted of a stated CHRISTIAN OBEDIENCE . Ill routine of ceremonies , its operation must frequently have been suspended , or even rendered wholly impracticable ; but what season or circumstance is there which can prevent the obedience of the heart ? In business and at leisure , at home and abroad , in prosperity and adversity , in sickness and in heahh , the habitual desire to obey God will find means to operate in acts appropriate to the occasion . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be avoided , none in which there is not some duty to be performed . In reply to these remarks , it may be said , that if our Creator requires an obedience such as has been described , - an obedience universal and impartial , fully commensurate with our knowledge of his will , uniformly grounded on faith and love , and exerted during the whole of our lives without intermission or reserve , - who can possibly be saved ? for where is the favored mortal who in this world of imperfection can boast of such an obedience ? These questions conduct us at once to the whole scheme of Christianity . It is evident that upon the condition of perfect obedience our case is hopeless ; and it is equally evident that imperfect obedience , however sincere , will not satisfy the divine law , which has a right to demand all that God originally created man able to perform . But infinite wisdom , combining with infinite goodness , devised a plan by which every difficulty is removed . How completely therefore do the doctrines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his disobedience , finds himself obnoxious to the divine wrath , and therefore needs an atonement . An atonement is provided . " He who knew no sin became sin for us , that we might be the righteousness of God in him . " The Messiah was constituted the " Mediator of a better covenant . " It harmonized with die attributes of Deity to accept his vicarious obedience u the means of our pardon and justification . This is /z/ the ineffable mystery which human reason could never have discovered , but which is unequivocally revealed in a volume that possesses indubitable marks , both internal and external , of the divinity of its origin . We are required to believe this obedience to be perfect and all-sufficient to the exclusion of every thing else as the procuring cause of our redemption . This , however , is no easy task . We are unwilling to allow that Jesus Christ discharged the whole debt , and are ever attributing some degree of merit to our own performances ; forgetting that the coin which we naturally ofier in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that it is false as well as inadequate - that for want of Christian motives it is a mere counterfeit obedience , worthless in the sight of God , and unable to purchase the rewards of heaven . The expressions in our thirteenth Article are so ex- , ceedingly strong upon this subject , that were they not evidently founded upon scripture , we might be inclined to question their truth . " Works done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his Spirit are not pleasant to God , forasmuch as they spring not out of ? faith in Jesus Christ ; " - " yea rather for that they are j ? not done as God hath willed and commanded there to ; ' be done , we doubt not but they have the nature of sin . " It appears therefore that a renovation of heart is necessary to render our best acts of obedience acceptable to God . The actions of a converted man assume a new character , being performed from new motives , and under the influence of the divine " inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator ever present , assisting us by his Holy Spirit to perform such works as shall be acceptable in his sight , and silendy guiding us in the delightful paths of Christian obedience . Those very acts which , though laudable in themselves , once " partook of the nature of sin , " by reason of the sinfulness of their agent , now become /z/ 2ts of holiness , and are grateful to our Heavenly Paml on account of the renovated principles from which ley spring . The Church of England , in the Article preceding lat which has been just quoted , renders this subject cceedingly plain . " Albeit that good works , which re the fruits of faith , and follow after justification , moot put away our sins or endure the severity of lod 's judgments , yet they are pleasing and acceptable God in Christ , and do spring out necessarily of a ue and lively faith ; insomuch that by them a lively lith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned y the fruit . " From this Article we may evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , in the opinion of le Church , " put away our sins , or endure the severi ' of God 's judgments ; " or , what is nearly the same ling , that they have no power to justify us , since they mnot even exist till /ifer justification , being the /ruite ' faith , and sot its precursors . We are thus necesirily led to look to some other cause of justification ; imely , the vicarious sufferings and obedience of hrist , which are gratuitously applied to all who with hearty repentance and true faith turn unto God . " 2 . We learn that after justification , and as fruits of Jtb , the works of the Christian are higi ) ly pleasing to rod . A cup of cold water given to a disciple , in the %me of a disciple will not lose its reward , while the tost praiseworthy actions , if performed from simply itural motives , or intended to co-operate with the lerits of the Redeemer in purchasing salvation , are 10 worldly and self-sufficient to be esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust to a dead inefficient faith ; nee the exalted principle to which the office of justi'ing is ascribed , necessarily produces good works ; /z/ " insomucb that by them a lively faith may be as evidently knowD as a tree discerned by its fruits . " How explicitly , yet how temperately , are Christian doctrines stated , how equally are they balanced , and how wisely are they guarded from unchristian inferences , in the judicious formularies of our venerable Church ! To the true Christian who feels and laments the imperfection of his obedience , who knows the delight of unreserved compliance , but finds that perverseness and depravity still remain to pollute his motives and contaminate his actions , nothing can be more consoling than the consideration of the plenary atonement of Christ , and the influence of the Eternal Spirit . Well might our Church assert that justification " by faith only , " is ' ' a most wholesome doctrine and very full of comfort ; " - a doctrine , be it remembered , which can never be abused except by wilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for true faith , and obedience is its necessary result . Repentance implies that sin has become hateful in its nature , as well as terrific in its consequences . It is therefore the supreme desire of every true penitent to live a life of obedience : he laments only that his efforts are not more undivided and effectual . He should however remember , for his comfort , that his sanctification , though slow , is constantly progressive . If he daily increase in discovering and lamenting his sinfulness , it is not because he is in reality become worse , but because his knowledge is growing more accurate and his conscience more susceptible . Let him therefore derive comfort from the promises of assistance and support which are treasured in the volume of life , and let him anticipate those realms of bliss where he shall perfectly obey his covenant Father without intermission or reserve . /z/ * Paul , in writing to Timothy , has pointedly Id what classes of persons should exist in the days . He prophesied that " perilous times " 1 come , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that men should be ' ' lovf their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , lemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unhoithout natural affection , truce-breakers , false ac , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are traitors , beady , high-minded , lovers of pleasures than lovers of God , having a form of godliness , enying the power . " d the apostle been all his life conversant with irious classes of society in the present age and ry , it would have been impossible for him to have led a more correct outline of modern character ; lis will not excite wonder , if we reflect that " holy ) f old wrote as they were moved by the Holy : , " and were instructed to describe the evil before- in order that we who are exposed to its contagion be guarded against its influence . ire we to select from the apostle 's catalogue of those characteristics which more especially mark resent day , scarcely one particular in the enumeI could be omitted , and it should be remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human character , but are eminently 3C and appropriate . They point out the peculiar ! ll as the general faults of modern times , and could tave been foretold but by that omniscient Spirit ( new the end from the beginning* /z/ But the most extraordinary feature in the whole portrait is , - not that men should be guilty of such vices , but that amidst tiiem all they should still seriously " profess and call themselves Christians . " When the apostle viewed with his holy and enlightened mind the real nature of the gospel , and felt , as he most deeply did , its sanctifying power in his own bosom , we might have thought he could scarcely have conceived it possible for men to profess the religion of Christ , while they revelled in all that was sinful and unchristian . But the guidance of immediate inspiration supplied what in those purer times of the church experience had scarcely began to suggest ; and hence the apostle was enabled to foresee the inconsistencies which should shortly arise among professed Christians , and a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easily acquired without the aid of any new communication from above . The possibility then , of having the form of godliness ivhile the power is denied , can not be a subject of doubt : in the present remarks , therefore , it will be simply attempted , for the sake of practical instruction , to point out a few characteristic features , by which the power may be distinguished from the form , and to make such other general observations as incidentally arise from the subject under consideration . In the present age and country , a great majority of persons seriously profess themselves to be Christians ; but amongst the individuals comprised under this common denomination , there are found some of almost every shade of sentiment and character . There is , however , one large class which may be passed by without controversy , namely , persons of openly immoral and vicious habits , and who indicate by overt signs that Christianity is with them avowedly but a name . Of men of this description , charity itself can have no hesitation in affirming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the blessings of the gospel . Theur case is as POWER OF RELIGIOir. 117 lecisive as it is awful . A man , for instance , who lever frequents divine worship , but revels in open inquitjr , is a broadly-marked character , and carries conriction both to himself and others , that whoever may ye right he is certainly wrong . He publicly neglects GkMl upon earth , and can not therefore have so much as I rational pretence for imagining himself an heir of that celestial kingdom of which the presence of the Creator constitutes the very bliss and perfection . But the majority of professed Christians consists of persons of a somewhat more decent , but , perhaps , often equally delusive , character . They have not abandoned the profession of the gospel , nor forgotten the propriety and duty of attending public worship ; they entertain a kind of vague dependence upon the death and sufferings of the Redeemer , and hope for pardon through his merits , in conjunction with their ) wn works , which , judging by a very false and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eriously questioned as to their hopes of a future world , bey usually reply in such a way as to show that amidst II their exterior decencies they have no true and peni3nt sense of their transgressions , nor of that change of leart and character without which no man can see the ingdom of God . Yet relying on an educational proession of Christianity , they imagine themselves secure , nd , in many cases , not all the solemnities of a can open their eyes to the delusion . Genuine religion is , however , something transcendmiy above this easy form and profession . It is of no piritual utility to " name the name of Christ , " unless Jso we " depart from iniquity : " it is of no avail to ivow a belief in revelation , unless our hearts be really noulded according to its precepts . To profess relion from mere custom , without being really taught by he Spirit of God , is but to trust to an outward form , vbich simply and in itself is of no efficacy whatever owards human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , from the form , in springing from the heart , and being grounded on a deep conviction of our sinfulness , and the necessity of the redemption which is offered in the gospd It is nothing superficial , or evanescent , or insincere . The partaker of it must have felt in his soul what he professes with his lips , that " he is tied and bound with the chain of his sin ; " he must have perceived his guilt before God , and must have been ' weary and heavj laden " with the consciousness of his infirmities ; he must have mourned over his evil nature , and must hare acknowledged ' his inability to merit heaven by his best observances : in a word , he must have experimentally learned some , at least , of the primary and fundamental truths of the gospel , before he can be truly said to hare risen one single step above the mere formalities of religion . A profession of piety which has not thus involved in its very elements a penitent consciousness of sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially on a death-bed and at the last day . But the joy that succeeds a really " godly sorrow " will be f lasting and substantial ; for when in moments of danger the voice of conscience shall recall our sins to remembrance , the scene , though awful , will not be new ; we shall come prepared to acknowledge the worst , yet by the mercy of God to hope the best ; our character will have been ascertained long before , and having learned that " the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin , " we shall be enabled through him to cherish a humble expectation that our transgressions are forgiven and have lost their condemning power . We shall , indeed , feel them to be hateful , and doubly so on account of the pure and holy nature implanted in our hearts ; but having long repented of them , having earnestly prayed and exerted ourselves against them , having desired , by the grace of God , never more to commit them , and , above all , having been enabled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice and merits of Him who alone can expiate sin , we shall learn to look up with holy confidence , that at the last day they shall not be permitted to appear in judgment inst us , but shall be blotted out by the blood of the atonement . We shall not extenuate their malignity , we shall not place our supposedly good works in the opposite scale as a counterpoise to them , but fully knowing and confessing them in all their aggravations , we shall yet cherish " a good hope through grace , " that they are atoned for by the sufferings and death of our ever blessed Redeemer . But who shall describe the terrors of that man who having had throughout life ' a form to live while . he was dead , " and who never having once really felt the guilt and misery which he so often professed with his lips , begins , for the first time , on a bed of sickness and in the prospect of death , to think seriously of his spiritual concerns and his eternal destination f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sins and vanities will now flit before his eyes as ghastly phantoms ; d a consciousness of guilt will flash on his soul with painful and irresistible conviction . He will resemble a man , who utterly ruined and insolvent . Scenes which he once thought merely idle , he will now feel to have been positively vicious ; and what , as a rational being , he could not but despise , even while he professed to enjoy , he will now , with his newly-enlightened mind , perceive to have been as sinful as is was puerile , as fatal to his soul as it was unbecoming the dignity of his nature . At such a moment the mere form of religion will be useless , the power only can sustain the dying penitent , and enable him to triumph over sin and death , in the cheering prospect of those celestial regions where sin and death shall exist no more . The power again diflfers from the form , by being /z/ exclusively the work of the Spirit of God ; whereas the latter is oftentimes nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a sense of moral decency and political decorum . It is not difficult to continue during our whole lives regular attendants upon the exteriors of divine worship , by the mere force of good education and example but this is a feeling veiy different from that influence of the Holy Spirit upon the heart , which alone can dispose us to ' do unto God true and laudable service , " impressing us with a deep and permanent sense of the value of our souls , and the importance of eternity , renewing our earthly affections , inclining us to God , and making us children of our Heavenly Father and heirs of his everlasting kingdom . One of the greatest defects in the religious views of persons in general is , that they do not thus sufficiendy recognize the Holy Spirit 's influence , at least as a practical and personal concern . Hence they look upon the conversion of heart , of which the scriptures so often speak , as a slight , and , perhaps , an unimportant change of character ; but were they duly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would learn to infer the greatness of the operation , and would see that it is to little purpose to profess religion outwardly , unless the Spirit of God has really enlightened and converted the heart . The power also differs essentially from the form , in being of a purifying nature . It makes the Christian desire to be perfect , even as his Father which is in heaven is perfect ; for though he feels that sin may and must remain in him as long as he continues in the present world , yet the aspiration of his mind is towards the ineffable beauty of holiness , and the beatitude of a sinless state . We have certainly no scriptural reason to imagine our religion genuine , unless we are thus partakers of a new nature , inclining us to all that is holy , and rendering us averse from all that is sinful. /q/ however much it might have been once naturally loved and admired , and however consistent it may still remain with the customs and the maxims of the world . To evidence satisfactorily that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking after new attainments ; forgetting those things which are behind , we must , like the apostle , press forward to those which are before . Where the power really exists , there will be a " growth in grace ; " an increasing knowledge of the doctrines of the cross of Christ , and a corresponding love for its precepts ; a growing devotedness to God , and deadness to the world ; a progress in every thing spiritual and holy , and a retrocession from all that is earthly and impure . There will be daily contests with " the world , the flesh , and the devil , " and , by the assistance of the Holy Spirit and faith in the Redeemer , daily victories over them . There will be an increasing dread of sin in all its forms ; so that a thousand things which once appeared innocent or laudable , will now be decidedly shunned as incompatible with an entire and unreserved devotedness to our Creator . We shall learn to feel more and more the proneness of our nature to temptation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome its allurements . The tenderness of our conscience will increase , and the fear of grieving the Spirit of God , and of wounding our own souls will become more deeply rooted and confirmed . There will be a susceptibility of religious feeling of which we had before no conception . Not only open sins , but the very glancing of a wrong thought through . the mind will cause a holy sensation of pain and uneasiness , ' and will be followed , when we are in a right frame of soul , by a renewed prayer for pardon and reconciliation . The desire to increase in all Christian graces , and to be assimilated more and more to the image of our Liord and Saviour Jesus Christ , will become a permanent wish of the heart . /z/ it /z/ To the attainment of this end , among many other means , self-examination will be constantly practised ; a duty which can not possibly be omitted where the power of religion really exists . There will be an abiding wish to know our real state and character ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , shall dread nothing so much as false security and selfdeception . Every wish and feeling of the soul , every word which proceeds from the lip , every action of the life , will furnish a person thus rightly disposed with abundant matter for self-examination . Even when we are least conscious of it , we shall find , upon reflection , that if our hearts are really in a right state , we habitually and almost insensibly refer our thoughts , and words , and actions , to the standard of truth , and that we learn to view every thing immediately in its connexion with God and with eternity . It is not in our more sober moments only that we shall practise these duties ; for we shall acquire a habit of constantly , and as it were naturally , investigating the nature of our conduct , and ascertaining what conclusion it suggests respecting our religious state . When sin presents itself before us , we shall feel a struggle to overcome its fascinations ; and the heart will be elevated towards the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conquest , thus divinely bestowed , will be followed by a peaceful satisfaction ; or , if we fall in the contest , there will ensue a salutary remorse , a godly contrition , very far above the merely natural remonstrances of conscience , teaching us that we have acted unwisely and ungratefully ; that we have crucified our Redeemer afresh , and brought darkness , if not despair , into our own minds . This uneasiness under conscious guilt will not abate till we are again enabled with true contrition to repent , to pray , to plead the merits of our Redeemer , and to obtain strength from above against the recurrence of temptation . Yet still there will remain a wound : the /q/ emembrance of the past will be grievous ; and though be peaceful consciousness of a latent hope in God 's nercy will distinguish this genuine penitence from that ' sorrow of the world " which worketh death , yet ibundant cause will be left for renewed humility and vatchfulness . Indeed , without these , the power of " religion can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are inevitably exposed to the ittacks of our spiritual enemies . The man who enoys any thing of the power of his holy profession will ispire after a more humble and dependent frame of mind : he will long to be " clothed with humility , " cnowing from experience that pride , especially spirituil pride , is not only hostile to the whole tenor of the ; ospel which he professes , but invariably lays a snare ) efore him , and causes him to fall . So far , therefore , Vom his superior privileges rendering him proud , they vill serve to promote humility , by reminding him svery moment of that free and unmerited grace which done made him to differ from the mere formalist and Pharisee . Thus his very graces and conquests over iia increase his circumspection , and self-abasement , md prayer . The less power the world has over him , he more he is afraid of its allurements : the less susceptible he is of temptation , the more he avoids its nfluence ; for it is not a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather of none whatever , to sport 30 the brink of temptation , and to dally with those spiritual enemies whom we are commanded most anxiously to avoid . The power of true religion is further and most importantly evidenced , by an habitual communion and intercourse with God in prayer . There will be a holy enjoyment , a sacred complacency , in this delightful 3rdinance , which never attends the mere form , where the essence is unknown . Prayer will become - what sf course it ought to be - the constant disclosure of ur wants , with a well-grounded consciousness that /z/ our Heavenly Father is able and williag , out of the fulness treasured up in Christ Jesus , to supply them all . Not only will it be a tribute of love and grati* tude , and an earnest desire after pardon and accept* ance , but it will incidentally produce an important i effect in meliorating the heart , and producing tliose very dispositions and graces which we implore . If j prayer has not been really found to operate in this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 1 been hitlierto a form without power ; for where tbe power exists the soul will necessarily partake , in some measure , of those affections which the lips express ; the act of confession will be truly accompanied with a sense of the burden of sin , the act of praise with sensations of love and grateful adoration , and the act of supplication with a deep feeling of human necessity and divine compassion . Words without meaning will no longer glide from the lips , but devotion will become , what it had never before been , a ** reasonable , " and through the merits and intercession of Christ , an " acceptable " service . Of these facts the sacred writings furnish numerous examples . What but the power of religion , as distinguished from the form , caused Enoch to " walk with God , " and maintained in the souls of David , of St. Paul , and various other scripture characters , that sacred communion with ' ' the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , " of which the scriptures so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of spiritual life which has been already described : we observe them in possession of such heavenly comforts and satisfactions as the mere exterior of religion could not possibly afford . It was the language of their very heart , and is still the language of those who follow in their steps . How may I best glorify God ? How may I realize more of the spiritual presence of my Redeemer , and the strengthening and consoling influences of my omnipotent Sanetifier /q/ ? How may I live near to God ? How may I enjoy " the light of his countenance , " and how may I best cultivate a spirit of dependence upon him , and of grateful acquiescence in his will ? How may I promote his cause in the world ? How may I live so as to glorify my Father which is in heaven ? In a word , How may I most experience the genuine influence and vitality of religion , as distinct from mere conventional forms and ceremonial observances f Without , however , considering the Christian character in its full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form by some of those tests which the apostle has laid down in the words already cited oX the commencement of these remarks . After specifying a long catalogue of vicious qualities , he concludes with pointedly observing , that persons thus characterized possess the form of godliness without the power . We may therefore infer , independently of other evidence , that those who really live under the power of religion will be remarkable for qualities of a very different kind ; that they will not be lovers of themselves , that they will not be covetous , that they will not be boasters , or proud , or blasphemous , or disobedient , or unthankful , or unholy , or without natural affection , or truce-breakers , or false accusers , or incontinent , or fierce , or despisers of those that are good , or traitors , or heady , or high-minded , or lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God . It is indeed true , and a truth which must not be forgotten , that every scriptural description of the Christian 's exalted character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directed , than conveys an actual estimate of what his enlightened conscience would venture to specify as his own individual progress ; but still , if our Lord 's assertion be correct , that " by their fruits ye shall know them , " we are certainly not to overlook those exterior marlfs which indicate the presence or absence of internal /z/ principles . But in thus forming our . estiniatei it is necessary to be sure that we select a standard suffi* sufficiently lofty and correct ; and should above all thingi i= beware of concluding that our religion is more thai /-form , merely from the circumstance of our having m been mercifully preserved from the grosser vices of i our nature . We must view sin , not as men in general view it , but as our Saviour portrayed it in his se mon on the mount , as extending to the very thoughts and feelings , and desires . Especially should we consider the state of our minds in reference to thoss things which , though censured by the scripture wri- ; ters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reputation in the estination of the world it large . Saint Paul , in the foregoing enumeration , brings together dispositions of mind the most varied and distinct , yet he predicates of them all indiscriminately , that they indicate the substitution of the form of religion for the power . The proud man , the lover of self , and the lover of pleasure , are classed with the traitor , the incontinent , the truce-breaker , and the blasphemer ; not , however , because there are not various shades in the degree of immorality , but because the habitual prevalence of any one evil disposition is not less a mark of the absence of the spirit of religbn , than the tendency to an open and flagitious vice . His intention is not to extenuate the evil of those things which are allowedly and grossly wrong , but to show more fully the evil of those also which might otherwise have passed under a specious appearance as almost right . He did not class the traitor and bl ' phemer with the lovers of pleasure more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think the less of their enormities , but in order that the latter might be aroused from their indifference , by seeing that even their decorous vices place them in the same general class with more open offenders against their Maker* The very first test laid down by the aposde is one /q/ Aat applies closely to the subject in question . ' Men ihall be lovers of their own selves ; " - the inference iom which is , that where the power of religion exists , nen will not be lovers of themselves , as far , at least , 18 religious principle prevails over the corrupt propen &#9632; ties of nature . Indeed , how can he admire his own supposedly good qualities who every moment feels in himself an evil principle , which , as far as it remains unsubdued by grace from above , is constantly thwarting the better dispositions of his renewed mind , and , as the apostle remarks of himself , ' ' bringing him into captivity to the law of sin f " The true Christian acknowledges , that whatever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the gift , he learns to love , not himself , but the almighty Giver . It is , in fact , the immediate tendency of that divine principle which constitutes the power of religion to heighten self-love into love to Crod , and to make the ktter the ruling motive of action . Tlie genuine believer , therefore , when in the full exercise of bis exalted privileges , feels that , by the divine assistance , he could gladly sacri6ce self , and all that is connected with self , for the cause of his Redeemer . The flame thus enkindled spreads around , and loving God , he learns to love his fellow-creatures also . Affection to his Saviour sbo ; vs itself by affection for those for whom , in common with himself , that Saviour died . He thus becomes united to his species by a thousand new and endearing ties : his affections are expanded and his heart enlarged : every man becomes his brother , so that he would willingly * spend and be spent , " not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind ; in much the same spirit , though not , perhaps , to the same extent , as the apostle , who was willing to be ' accursed from Christ , for the sake of his brethren , his kinsmen , according to the flesh . " Self-love is not , indeed , extinguished , but it is elevated to the beat and noblest objects : it embraces heaven , /z/ // and places its satisfaction in the favor of God . Thus puri6ed , it prompts , not to self-esteem and self-indulgence ; but , on the contrary , to every necessary suffering and sacrifice in the cause of God and man , identifying its own gratification with doing the will and submitting to the awards of an ever-gracious and 0Te ruling Providence . The power of religion as distinct from the form may be defined to consist in that renewal or transfo mation of mind of which the scriptures incessantly teach both the nature and the necessity . That such a renovation or " new birth " is indispensable for the enjoyment of heaven , who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallen mind , and the nature of that celestial world into which " nothing that defileth " can obtain admission f The company of condemned spirits , who still love sin though they are suffering its punishment , would be more congenial to an unrenewed heart than the purities of heaven and the spiritual felicities of an angelic world . Yet , on the other hand , it is very possible to find , even in the present day , persons whose minds are already attuned , as it were , for the enjoyment of a future state ; persons to whom religion is a continual source of happiness and expectation , and who appear never so much to enjoy existence as when the blessings of the gospel are immediately present to their minds . Yet there was a time when they also loved the world , and when God was not in all their thoughts . Whence then the happy change ? Why are they more willing to die , and better prepared for death than before ? Why has the world ceased to engross them , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has infused such energy , and spirit , and enjoyment into their prayers and services ; and what has expanded their hearts in tenderness and compassion towards their fellow-men ? The answer is not distant ; - the power of religion has been added to the /q/ brra ; and they have begun really to experience and enjoy the genuine effects of what was before nothing beyond a decent succession of superficial observances . For the sake of practical illustration and instruction , it may not be useless to show the sort of process which oftentimes takes place in the human mind in its progress from formal to real religion . There is , indeed , great danger on this subject of systematizing far too much , and thus of reducing piety to a precise series of mental operations ; yet , on the other hand , if there be in reality such a process as that renewal of mind which is described in scripture as necessary to salvation , there must have existed certain definite , if not strongly-marked gradations between the incipient steps and the ultimate attainment . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a person by no means vicious in his conduct or heterodox in his creed , but on whom Christianity , notwithstanding its admitted excellence , has produced no very decided or remarkable effect . This is a case of probable and frequent occurrence ; and in viewing it more closely , let us endeavor to obsesve whether there may not be more than fancy in the renovation which has been supposed . Men , in general , are sufficiently willing to allow of the propriety of a reformation in a person of profligate habits , but they can not discern what change can take place for the better in a man of virtuous and regular deportment . He attended divine worship , he was sober , and just , and charitable , and in the sight of the world at large * was a really good man . " So far it is well : but suppose that by reading the scriptures , by the conversation of a religious friend , by the public ministry of God 's word , by the confessions of his own church , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes really convinced of those fundamental truths which have been already frequently noticed , especially his personal sinfulness , and the consequent terrors of the divine law ; /z/ he now iSnds , that amidst all his boasted religion , he is in reality a transgressor against God , and that , dying as he is by nature , he can cherish no good or scriptural hope of salvation . He knows that his heart and affections ought to have been set upon things above , yet he feels that so far from this being the case , he has been attached supremely , if not exclusively , to the things of time and the enjoyments of sense , and amidst all his religious professions has been proud , or selfrighteous , or insincere , or unholy , or a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God . A person thus opening his eyes to the first principles of genuine religion , is surprised that , notwithstanding bis formal profession , he never before perceived things which now appear so plain as to enforce the most poignant conviction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious truth , the more he feels confused and astonished : he finds himself at once guilty and helpless , and sees no natural means of safety and escape . He trembles at the thought of death and judgment ; yet amidst all , he blesses his Creator for having brought him to a correct spiritual perception before it was too late ; thus evidencing , by the whole tenor of his conduct , that even already he finds the mere form of religion incapable of sustaining a sinner amidst the convictions of an enlightened conscience . Thus far sensible of his sinfulness and danger , be begins perhaps to make various attempts for quieting his mind . Finding , however , ' the arrow too deeply rooted to be extricated by the common expedients of business , or diversion , or company , he recurs to that new species of formality which our spiritual enemy is ever ready to suggest , as an adequate remedy , namely , a Pharisaic reformation instead of a genuine conversion . He begins to imagine , that if he change his life a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by repeating his prayers somewhat more /q/ often , and by other similar and equally superficial performances , he will become jusily entitled to those lessings which his former course of action was insuficient to ensure . Soon however , he begins to find his best resolutions broken , his holiest deeds contaminated , and his heart still radically corrupt . He now , perhaps , advances to the important discovery of something more being required for human salvation than any imperfect obedience which the best of fallible men has it in his power to bestow . Were he even to become , ( which , however , he finds impossible , ) perfectly good and holy from the present moment , he could not by this means necessarily claim oblivion of his past transgressions . The more therefore he views his case by the unerring light of revelation , the more awful it appears . His judge is God , who seeth the very secrets of the heart , and from whose justly-provoked anger there is no nat ural mode of escape ; so that , by the fair deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what is unsatisfactory and alarming . Now , even in this painful state of mind , there is sufficient evidence that Christianity has ceased to be a mere form : it has not , indeed , yet produced its ultimate and happiest efiect , but it has evidenced its power by causing a salutary wound , which nothing but its own influence , under the direction of its almighty Revealer , can effectually heal . The more awful parts of revelation having thus ceased to be matters of form , its promises and blessings will undergo a similar operation . While it was nothing more than a vague unmeaning ceremony to confess , what we did not feel , that " we have erred and strayed from God 's ways like lost sheep , and that there is no health in us , " it could not but be a subject of equal indifference to learn that Christ Jesus came expressly ' ' to seek and to save them that were lost . " To those who ' * trusted in themselves that they /z/ were righteous , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Redeemer 's being ** made unto as righteousness , " and of our being made " the righteousness of God in Him . " While our confessions of sio , and our professed fears of eternal punishment were merely verbal forms , the promises of God to the penitent believer must have been correspondingly lowered in our estimation ; and while , notwithstanding the expressions uttered by our lips , we preserved in oar hearts a high sense of the meritorious nature of oar imperfect observances , it could be little more than a grave mockery to be informed that mankind can be redeemed only by the blood of Christ , and justified only by faith in him . But the threatenings of revelation having now been made by the Holy Spirit to assume their just impo tance , and the humbled penitent having seriously felt his danger , and the insufficiency of his own best deeds to merit salvation , the remaining truths of the gospel are no longer subjects of indifference or contempt . It ceases to be a mere submission to customary forms that induces him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which he learns that the law which he had broken has been honored , and the punishment which he had deserved has been sustained . It is not to him any longer an uninteresting or unaffecting truth , that although man has " destroyed himself , " yet " in God is his help . " He was once content with a simple recognition of the fact ; but he now desires also faith to enjoy the blessing . It is not enough to ascertain , as a general truth , that mercy is offered ; be wishes to bring the subject to bear upon his own individual case , that what he knows to be correct as an abstract proposition , he may find to be consolatory and influential as a personal concern ; for it often happens to a penitent of tender conscience , that many things which he allows to be true of every one else , he can scarcely venture to assume as applicable to himself . /q/ hat very holiness and renovation of mind which conitute the best pledge and proof of his being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very causes of difdence and oftentimes of distress ; for the more the ower of reUgion predominates over the form , the reater will be the dread of insincerity and self-decepion . The Divine Spirit is not , however , an uninterested pectator of the progress of that religious feeling which le himself has implanted ; and since he wounds only bat he may heal , it follows that wherever he has made he threatenings of Christianity effectual in producing I salutary sorrow for sin , he will ultimately make its iromises conducive to a well-grounded and permanent epose . The Christian thus far advanced , has evidentf become " a new creature : " his heart is changed : in , which was once his delight , is now his burden : he Bcoils from it , as being that which is contrary to his etter nature , and which was the direful cause of his Redeemer 's sufferings : he desires to be entirely freed cm its influence , and rejoices in the anticipation of eaven , not solely as a relief from eternal punishment , ad an entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever emancipated from sin and temptation , " ooi the seductions of an evil heart , and the fascinaions of a deceitful world . The power of religion will now have subverted some if the dearest opinions and prepossessions of the unrelewed heart . The supposed individual has become in lis own view a being fallen , yet redeemed ; deserving nrrath , yet enjoying favor ; exposed by sin to the pains of hell , yet rendered heir , through his Saviour , to the Telieities of heaven . His daily wish is to know the mil of God , and his daily endeavor is to perform it . Scripture has become to him the most interesting of books , and religion the most important of concerns . The affairs of eternity are ever prominent in his thoughts , and produce a corresponding influence upon /z/ bis conduct . He yenerates the Almighty as his Cm* tor , he feels grateful to Jiim as his Preserver , he fean him as his Parent , he loves him as his Redeeier . Thus various sentiments arise in his mind with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor are his views in reference to himself less conspicuous 1 changed . He is no longer , in his own conception , tbit . lofty being who looked to himself with pride and admi- ration , trusting to bis own efforts , and boasting of his , own inherent claims . He confesses himself to be a ' corrupt being , who , if saved at all , must be saved by j free mercy ; and while , perhaps , the world around is wondering at the change in his character , and thinking that he now imagines himself the best and most boly of men , be is secretly lamenting his defects , and pouring out his soul at the throne of mercy for acceptance and forgiveness solely through the merits of his adorable Redeemer . Having traced the power of religion thus far , it would be easy to carry the delineation much farther . But for the purpose now intended it is not necessary to describe the advanced Christian : it is enough if it have been shown that even the first steps in religion presuppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Christianity . True religion implies a complete revolution of character , and a dereliction of many of the most natural feelings and opinions of an unsubdued mind . Its*efifects have been already faintly sketched as they appear in the general tenor of a Christian 's life , but they will be most conspicuous and interesting in circumstances of peculiar difficulty and distress . In trouble , there will be a calm , a resignation , an acquiescence , which no natural considerations could possibly have produced . In death , there will be a well-grounded trust in God , very different , on the one hand , from the despair of him who is " driven away in his wickedness ; " and , on the other , from the false confidence of him who ' hath no bands in his /q/ eath . " Above all , the power of religion will be evient in preparing its possessor for that world which , s has been already observed , a wicked man not only cannot attain , but could not even enjoy ; that world of 7hich purity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . f /z/ fe It would be sometimes useful , both in order to substantiate a correct opinion , and to detect a false one , to ask the simple question that occurs , for example , at finding ourselves possessed of a suspicious bank-note ; " How came it into my possession ? " If the source be either doubtful or unknown , our opinion or our banknote , as the case may happen , demands a careful investigation , for the purpose of ascertaining its authenticity . Men do not materially object to those human laws which render us liable to a legal process for being detected with a forged paper in our possession , even though they know that in many cases it might have been our misfortune and not our crime ; still less therefore can we censure the justice of our Creator in punishing us for essentially false opinions in religion , which might have been corrected by the diligent use of the means of Christian information . When upon examination the source to which we retrace our opinion or our bank-note ( for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexceptionable , we must not hastily throw it aside , to please the first person who chooses to affirm that it is false . A doctrine or precept evidently derived from the volume of inspiration should satisfy our minds much in the sameT manner as a note which we remembered having received immediately from the bank from which it purported to issue . Were we thus at all times accurately to retrace the steps by which we first arrived at any particular conclusion , it would be of inestimable use towards estifliatifig /q/ the yakie of our Eentiments . At one stroke balf of the false and absurd opinions which infest the world wooid be swept awdy . They could not sustain the tool inquiry , " How were they derived ? " Our asseoC would , in future , be proportioned to the evidence produced . We should deliberate calmly , and decide with nooderation . Error would melt away , while truth would receive the utmost increase of stability and vigor . Imagine , for instance , that an intelligent North-Brit00 , who believed in second-sight almost as firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrace his ideas upon these subjects to the fountain-head , endeavoring to conduct his investigation with the unsparing impartiality of a neutral inquirer ; what would be the result ? His first conclusion would possibly be , that as far as concerned himself , both points rested upon exactly equal and similar ground , the mere prejudice of education . Were he to stop here , his religion would ' sufifer just as much as his superstition , and both would lie expiring by a mortal wound . But the next step rectifies the whole . He believed in second-sight by the force of education ; and having discarded this prejudice , he finds no rational ground for his opinion . But Christianity be perceives is founded upon evidence , and assumes new claims to credibility in proportion as his scrutiny is more severe . The sajne process therefore that melted away the dross , would serve only to purify the gold . The wheat would become more valuable , by being separated from the chaff . It is not , however , always practicable thus to retrace our opinions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they originally reposed . We oftentimes resemble an aged traveller , who knows that be once visited a certain spot , though he has long lost the manuscript that described his journey . Whether be arrived by water or by land , on foot or in any vehi- /z/ // cle , is perhaps irrecoverably forgotteD ; so that be can assert only the unconnected fact of his having certain ly been there . A person believes , for instance , that there once existed such an individual as the intolerant Queen Mary ; but in what manner he first formed that opinion , he is wholly unable to determine . The : fact was probably mentioned to him at a time of life j when he was ready to credit the most extravagant t fairy tale ; so that had he never received subsequent i evidence on the subject , he would hardly have failed : of classing the fiction and the fact together , and of supposing , that because he had been deceived in the one he was equally so in the other also . The application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration . A man of thought , while reflecting upon the mutations of character and the fluctuations of opinion in the world around him , will sometimes look back to observe how his own sentiments were imbibed , and his own character mntured . He will thus endeavor to ascertain upon what evidence his opinions rest . In making his retrospective observations , he will soon perceive that the revolutions of empires are not more surprising than the changes which have taken place in his own bosom . He is not the same being he was some twenty years ago . But should he revert to the faint remembrance of past days , and endeavor to realize long-forgotten incidents , hoping to discover by what process his mind was formed and his habits of thinking matured , he will soon find himself enveloped in the clouds of darkness and confusion . He discovers that he possesses a thousand opinions for which he can assign scarcely any possible reason . He makes use of the theorem , but lias forgotten the demonstration ; or , to recur to a former allusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows not whence it was derived . For instance ; he has grown up perhaps with an aversion to a /q/ pirdcular individual or a particular opinion , utterly mconscious in what manner it was originally conceived . It was possibly a mere trivial accident in his efaildhood , that caused his present feeling ; so that eould he divest himself of prejudice , and form his ideas anew , that offensive individual or opinion might , under his present circumstances , prove eminently congenial to bis own state of mind . Yet he dislikes , he knows not why ; as persons taught in their infancy to dread the gloom of midnight , oftentimes retain the feeling to the very end of life , without remembering how it was first impressed , or by what means it has been still continued . The philosopher thus reviewing the formation of his mind and character , resembles an aged linguist , who should attempt to recollect in what book or company he first became acquainted with each word which he has been so long accustomed to consider as his own . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinions were unmarked ; that they were sometimes too minute to attract observation , and sometimes too distant to be regained by memory . In retracing the current of life , he would observe with astonishment what new qualities it had imbibed from the various soils over which it had glided , and the different rivulets with which it had mixed . Every new association of thought , every book which he had read , every friendship that he had formed , every company which he had entered , every event which he had witnessed , had , in some degree , tended to model or confirm his present character . The exact feelings of childhood and infancy could not indeed be retraced : every attempt to recal them would be but grasping at a dream . A momentary glimpse , it is true , might sometimes be obtained ; but before a perfect image could be formed , the illusion would vanish , transient and obscure as the shadows of evening . Yet from what could be recalled , be would ascertain /z/ // that scarcely one feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fostered his growth aod mar tured his reason , had insensibly modified his character ; and that every region of his mind had undergone fre* quent revolutions by the recession of former mmates and the introduction of new ones . It must not , however , be supposed that ottr opher would start from his reverie without having learned some useful rules of conduct , and happily then are two important ones which obviously result from the preceding speculation . i The first is the necessity of opposing every thing i lacious or absurd at the very entrance . His mind having been perpetually , though gradually changing , he bfers that it may continue to change ; and dreads to , reflect that when he again takes a retrospect of himself , L he may perhaps discover that some good irapressioo u has been imperceptibly obliterated , or has given place to one of a very different character . It may be with his mind as with the index of his watch , which has - completely veered round , though he never once pe ceived it move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , however disgusting at j first , becomes naturalized in the mind , and what un- foreseen efiects it may afterwards produce upon the feelings and the conduct , he will be anxious to exclude every thought that may possibly , however remotely , tend to mislead his understanding or corrupt his heart . Every page of history affords evidence , as decisive as it is lamentable , of the astonishing growth of evils which , if attacked in time , might have been efiectuaily suppressed . Revert , for example , the disgusted eye from salina the slave of impurity , to Massalina the modest virgin , guarded by youthful delicacy , and thoughdess of her future guilt* Trace in imagination the intermediate gradations . How slow ! yet how silently progressive ! Behold her gliding from unshaken incocency /q/ to hesitating reluctance ; thence to trembling concession ; thence , by a thousand shades of progressioo , to familiarity with vice ; and thence , by more rapid stages , to avowed licentiousness , to publicity of guilt , to exultation in her disgrace . Our philosopher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Perceiving in how imperceptible and unsuspected a manner many of his opinions have been formed , he will not be ashamed frequently to review them , in order to distinguish between what is simply the resuh of prejudice or custom , and what has been deliberately adopted by subsequent bvestigation . It is frequently possible to conjecture with tolerable accuracy the opinions and feelings of an individual by blowing the circumstances of bis life . We are indeed scarcely conscious how much oftener our sentiments are formed by exterior objects and events , than by the deliberate efforts of our own minds . How many of the giddy flutterers , the busy worldlings , the indolent voluptuaries , the unmeaning formalists ojf the present age , taking their measures of Christianity from surrounding and defective examples , imperceptibly conclude that they themselves are good Christians , and in consequence , close up every avenue by which the light c conviction might break into their minds . Were ftey but candidly to inquire , ** How were my religious opinions formed ? " they would find that the volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , had little or no share in determining their judgment . It will be the object of the succeeding remarks to point out several sources of error , which , either separately or in combination , appear to influence almost every person who is not possessed of two very rare qualities , a well-balanced understanding , and a sincerely pious mind . To enter fully into the subject does /z/ not concur with the present design ; so that a few of the more frequent causes only will be adduced . Should the reader of these pages have reason to imagine that bis own opinions , ( especially those upon religion , ) have in any measure resulted from the operation of these or similar causes , it will evidently become bis duty to raze the tottering fabric , and to rebuild it upon a more rational , and scriptural , and noiid plan . The first cause of error which needs be mentioned is impatience . Truth is usually found to be a mean between two extremes . It is simple , whild error is infinite ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a traveller , at full speed , of discovering a valuable jewel which happened to lie imobtrusively beside his path , amidst a thousand pebbles of similar color and dimensions . To many minds doubt and inquiry are torture . An impatient man can not suspend his judgment : or mediocrity does not afiford sufficient stimulus to his feelings : every thing must be at first sight superlatively disgusting or irresistibly prepossessing . A person thus disposed will not often deny himself the unwise pleasure of forming and expressing an opin-ion upon every subject that comes under his most transient observation . It would be ludicrous , were it not morally distressing , to observe the solemn authority with which he utters his edicts upon topics which he no more understands than an idsect the mechanism of a watch , upon the surface of which it has accidentally alighted . He can not perceive the necessity of a minute induction of particulars in order to deduce a general inference ; but seeing a little , and presuming- a great deal , he precipitately jumps into a conclusion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen sometimes bears to the great deal that b presumed , and to contrast the magnificence of /q/ the coBcIusion with the apparent poverty of the pre-Buses* To exaiBiDB every subject upon which we are called to decide is evidently a reasonable duty ; but unhappily it is one hr removed from the habits of a large portion of mankind . The suspense of investigation is naturally unpleasant , and it is not without much mental discipline that it at length becomes habitual . In religion especially , though a subject of acknowledged importance , the majority , even of persons otherwise well iaibrmed , can not be brought to submit to the restraint of serious inquiry . To correct our natural impatience of suspense is one great end of scholastic pursuits ; aud in consequence , those studies which inure the mind to the fatigue of unprejudiced deliberation have always been considered , even irrespectively of their immediate end , as of high importance . But suspense , simply considered , can never become agreeable . It may be familiarized by custom , and made the companion of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its own account . The pleasure , for example , excited in the mind of a novel reader by an intricate plot , or that of a mathematician by an abstruse series of demonstrations , though necessarily connected with suspense , does not arise immediately from it ; for if so , how much soever each of these characters might be interested in his subject , he would never desire to arrive at the conclusion , since bis pleasure , which , on this supposition , is contemporary with his suspense , and dependent upon it , would be thus entirely destroyed . This , however , is contrary to fact ; for who , in the midst of an interesting narrative or argument , was ever known finally to close the volume , in order that the pleasures of suspense might not be lost in certainty ? On the contrary , the very desire to arrive at the conclusion may be attributed , in a great degree , to the wish of being liberated from the anxiety of suspense . /z/ It is in consequence of the uneasiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost equally balanced , expedients the most puerile are sometimes employed to produce an imaginary preponderance . The cast of a die , the wanderings of a bird , the casual opening of a volume , and a hundred other accidents equally trivial and uncontrollable , have been permitted to decide the fate of nations , and to give laws to the sovereigns of the world . The mind wearied with doubt , instead of grasping that side of the question which , upon the whole , appears most correct , sinks supine , and gladly reposes upon the bosom of imagined infallibility . It appears , then , that one great source of error is that impatience which prevents our calmly discussing a question before we venture to form an opinion . It is so easy upon the one hand to " jump into a conclusion , " and so difficult and tedious upon the other to balance opposite probabilities , to unweave intricacies , remove objections , collate rival opinions , detect error , elicit truth , anticipate contingency ; pursue causes to their effects , and resolve effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger portion of mankind should be content with first prepossessions , and anxiously avoid even a temporary suspense of unbiassed examination . A few plausible arguments , a few unsifted facts , are sufficient oftentimes to cause an unalterable decision ; whereas the very next argument that was offered , the very next fact that . occurred , might have overturned the whole visionary fabric . It is frequently observed , that persons of unusually lively mind are far from being celebrated for the correctness of their opinions . A man of common thought , who has learned to suspend his judgment , will not often be obliged to retract his positions : but the impatient genius , to whom deliberation is torment , is incessantly employed in obliterating past decisions , or involving himself in new absurdities of error . Till the mind /z/ /q/ has been accustomed to patience amidst the tantalizing delays of suspense , nothing of a permanent value can be ensured . In no instance , perhaps , are our opinions more likely to be influenced by impatience than in judging of character . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of whom appears generous , intelligent , and manly ; the other frivolous , insignificant , and self-conceited. - In such a case , it is impossible not to feel immediately a corresponding predilection or contempt , and not very easy , perhaps , not to hint our opinion to our neighbor . But who can say whether a further intimacy , or an inquiry among those who know their real characters , might not soon convince us that the apparently noble qualities of the one were but natural endowments , which served as a passport to imbecility or pride , if not to incorrectness of moral principle ; while that which disgusted us in the other was but a defect in manner , of which the individual was unconscious , or which he had already labored to remove ? It is true , indeed , that we may usually form some idea of a person 's character by those common rules of judging , which are insensibly acquired in general intercourse with society . But induction , however extensive , being necessarily partial , will not always when individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever therefore decide upon an unknown character , merely because the person to whom it belongs resembles , in some exterior points , another with whom we are well acquainted . The minute varieties of human nature are so indefinitely multiplied , that nothing but individual experience can be a decisive test . Unexpected modifications of character , novel workings of passion , eccentricities , obliquities , and paradoxes innumerable , will occur upon every side , to confound our most specious calculations . Truth usually lies at an equal distance from the two extremes of party spirit . It is not often that the bo ( /z/ // which we are requested to read is the most useful or the most dangerous that was ever written ; that the person to whom we are introduced is the very best or the very worst man in the world ; that the institution which we are requested to patronize is either the most useful or the most injurious that was ever set on foot* Yet such possibly were the descriptions of party zeal , and which are eagerly adopted by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at the expense of reason and of truth . The sentiments of an honest and wise man , being the result of calm inquiry , will usually incline towards moderation . Having explored the extremes , he will gladly rest in the mean ; as the pendulum , after vibrating from side to side , settles at its centre of gravity and remains unmoved . Another frequent cause of error is what may be denominated moral reaction . The prevalence of infidelity upon the continent of Europe naturally arose from those mummeries of superstition which , under the semblance of Christianity , have gone far to ruin its cause , disgusting at once the man of piety by their wickedness , and the man of taste by their absurdity . A person who is required to believe too much , often revenges himself by believing nothing . He sees , for instance , myriads of absurdities arising from the doctrine of transubstanliation , and therefore revolts from the whole system to which this hypothesis is most injuriously appended . The tendency to this moral recoil is often so general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own history a strong corroboration of this remark . - During the time of the interregnum , the religious sentiments of too many zealous partizans had been of a very extravagant nature . The doctrines of revelation had been disjoined from its precepts ; so that one half of the Bible became useless , except , perhaps , in the hands of an unusually skilful allegorizer , who had the /q/ art of extracting a merely speculative theorem from the most practical command . . The lan.8 ; uage even of secular intercourse was modelled upon that of the received translation of the sacred volume . The most unchristian acts were described in the most Christian terms . Men thought themselves religious if they used the language of the Bible , however flagrantly they might oppose its spirit . He who could give to a text the most fanciful twist , the most recondite allusion , was esteemed the ablest divine . The union of a sound creed with an irreligious life , of a clear insight into revelation with a neglect of all its duties , had become alarmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very widely apparent . Even some truly pious men , led away with the error of the times , neglected sufficiently to insist upon several of those essential graces which constitute the beauty of the Christian character ; and as for social and moral duties , they were very generally forgotten . Such was the state of affairs at the Restoration . - Here then was a conjuncture of circumstances remarkably disposed for that moral reaction which ensued , and the effects of which are felt to the present hour . The religionists of the succeeding Stuart reigns , thought , that , in order to be right , they must be as far as possible removed from the opinions and practices of their predecessors . Such was the extraordinary nature of this revulsion , that it is almost wonderful that they did not assert that there wa$ no God , in order to distinguish themselves from the Puritans , who , witli all their faults , certainly believed and felt that there was one . Short , however , of this , there was scarcely any thing in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding . It Was quite in course that an avidity for public amusements of the most exceptionable kind should become epidemic ; that the stage , amidst all its licentiousness , should be frequented as a school for virtue ; that profaneness should not only be tole- // rated , but actually patronized and esteemed ; because all these things were evidently most pleasant sarcasms upon the strictness of the preceding age . It had been so much the custom to conceal a sinful life under the exterior garb of religion , that men now began almost to take credit to themselves for the openness of their iniquity . To turn the language of scripture into ridicule by impious jests , was esteemed an excellent libel on those men who were accustQmed to speak of it with the highest veneration . All this was very natural : it was but such a reaction as might have been confidently anticipated . But the great difficulty still remained . The pulpit , it might have been thought , was too sacred for a similar experiment . Besides , many of the doctrines which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though miserably wrested , and detached , and overstated , were yet substantially the doctrines of revelation and of the Established Church . In ordinary circumstances , therefore , it would not have appeared quite decent either openly to oppose , or even silently to suppress them ; but so great , at the season in question , was the prejudice against the puritanic age , that every thing else was willingly sacrificed for its gratification . The recoil waj fearful . At one undiscriminating stroke , the preaching of a large portion of the established clergy was dismembered of almost all the peculiarities of the Christian dispensation . " Another gospel , " which however " was not another , " was made to supersede that b which pardon and justification had hitherto been proclaimed to the believing penitent solely through the merits and obedience of the omnipotent Redeemer Reaction in this case performed more than the greates direct force . The utmost eflforts of infidels to banisl from our pulpits the peculiar , but essential , tenets o the gospel , would have been in vain ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily pro duced the effect . el s /z/ t /q/ It is to be lamented that our church by this means received a shock from which it has never completely recovered . The dread of Puritanism has been ever smce employed by the great enemy of mankind to depress that spirituality and heavenly-mindedness which are the very badges of Christianity . The doctrines of the Bible , and their practical effects upon the heart as well as life , have been too often superseded by mere ethical philosophy ; so that had not our public forms remained unaltered , we might , in many cases , almost doubt what had been the religion of our forefathers . . In politics also , the violent and arbitrary principles of the Stuart reigns produced the still more violent counter principles of the leaders of the rebellion ; and the excesses of these , in their turn , paved the way for the re-admission of the principles of the Stuarts . Thus , again , the romantic institution of chivalry possibly originated in an ill-regulated attempt to correct the unreasonable error of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with insult and contempt . The world had not yet arrived at that true medium , which , making women neither , on the one band , divinities , nor , on the other , beings inferior and subservient to man , had represented them in their real dignity , as his equals , his companions , and his friends . Thus , again , before the time of the crusades , Europe had silently lain for ages in torpid indifference . This was the season in which men , if once aroused , were in danger of reverting to the most unexpected extremes . They wanted but an incitement ; which being supplied by the romantic zeal of Peter the Hermit , they started from their slumbers , grasped their swords , and endeavored to atone for their past apathy , by hurling the crescent from the minarets of Palestine , and involving all Europe and Asia in the horrors of an exterminating war . In a more recent instance of this reaction , we have seen the citizens of Paris , at one moment , proud of /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , exulting with : republican fury around his scaffold , and literally rush- i ing to dip their hands in his blood ; and agin resign* ing their liberties and lives to a despot . When , alas ! shall there universally prevail some principle of action , pure , efficient , and uniform , to correct the sallies and moderate the passions of ungoveroable man f This reaction is frequently visible in more confined societies . The heir of the avaricious parent often be comes a prodigal ; and the youth too austerely educated , bursts the trammels of domestic subjection , and plunges headlong into licentiousness . Who could not point out , among his acquaintance , the relatives of pious individuals throwing off the restraints of a religious education , and openly despising what they had been most instructed to admire f A person of this description might say , ' I should perhaps have loved religion , but for the form in which I saw it arrayed . It was incessantly pressed upon me in my infant hours of amusement , not only without any attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not of punishment . Instead of select moments and favorable conjunctures being sought out and embraced , I was daily condemned to the same irksome task , even at times when my mind ought to have been amused with puerile recreations . Besides , I too often observed individuals , who professed to be unusually religious , exhibiting the most unamiable proofs of their want of common meekness and urbanity . The Almighty was represented as a tyrant , and man as a slave . In short , the whole process of my education tended to deprive religion of every lovely association , and to render what was represented as necessary to my salvation , utterly Jpepugnant to my reason and my feelings . " Such is the language that is sometimes heard from the apostate children of religious but injudicious parents ; and though it can not justify the speaker , it ought to conTinea /q/ the bearer of the necessity of associating religion , as far as possible , with pleasing rather than painful recoUecUons . A child may and should be taught urgently and frequently all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having just cause afforded turn of complaint for harshness or unreasonable demands . Nothing is more to be dreaded than this moral reaction . It is as much the object of a judicious preceptor to teach a child to love the Bible as to make bim understand it : nay , more ; for love will soon lead to knowledge , but knowledge is of no avail without love . Another cause of error is mental imbecility . There are persons who , for whatever reason , seem utterly unable to draw moderate and equitable conclusions . They are the dupes of every new speculation . The slightest argument impels them to the most absurd opinions . The singularity of a proposition , far from exciting their suspicion , serves only to confirm their belief . They are always wrong , always in extremes , yet always imagine themselves right and reasonable , and are surprised that others do not see the force of what to them appears so obviously true . It must not , however , be imagined that the class in question is composed only of thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be described is compatible , though in a subordinate degree , with a very high order of general intellect ; for even the most learned and sagacious men have been sometimes seen conscientiously to embrace opinions which a well-informed child would be ashamed to own . There are persons who seem to think rightly upon every subject , perhaps , but one ; as a madman may be found to reason perfectly well , except upon the particular topic that caused his derangement . For there is in many human beings a kind of idiosyncracy , which , independently of pride , or passion , impels them to say , and to do , the most eccentric things . Even the man // of genius is not necessarily exempted from this statement ; for there are few opinions so absurd as not to have found sincere advocates even among persons of undoubted talent . How often has one favorite hypothesis led persons , otherwise sensible and well-informed , to a train of the ihost extravagant conclusions ! There are writers who , having by some unaccountable imbecility admitted one error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parian marble , through the whole of their argument , have rendered their otherwise masterly works almost entirely useless . Without selecting an extreme case , the learned and highly valuable commentary of Hammond might be brought forward as an illustration . It is amusing to observe how gravely he introduces us to our old enemies the gnostics , and without a syllable of parley begins the favorite attack ; and this at a time when we least expected their company , and hoped to have passed comfortably on without a single blow on either side . In such a case as this , the defect in judgment may by no means lead to any errors of a very dangerous nature ; but instances might easily be produced in which a similar cause has tended to the most injurious results . The predominance of fancy over the judgment produces a peculiar species of mental imbecility . To this may be attributed many of the improprieties of the mystic writers . The strange explications of scripture , which have sometimes amused or astonished the world , may be traced , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . The powers of the fancy may be so strong , and under such slight regulation , that a person who possesses common sense sufficient for ten other men , may not have enough for himself . To what but the influence of this giddy deity over the more sober decrees of the judgment , can be ascribed the eccentric opinions of the amiable Bishop Berkley i To charge such a man with general imbecility , would be absurd ; yet could any speculation be more imbecile /q/ than that of the nonentity of matter , and the immateriality of all visible scenes ? One string , we find , may jar in a mind the most harmoniously arranged . There is an unfortunate species of imbecility which displays itself in a constant change of opinions , and that perhaps for others equally unworthy of belief . Occasional corrections ought not to stamp a character with the imputation of mental weakness . They may occur in the best regulated mind in consequence of a new influx of light and knowledge , and in such cases are often successive approximations towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle restlessness which can never be satisfied but by the charms of novelty . Persons under this influence not only change often , but with the most unmeasured violence . They never repair without pulling down ; they never forsake their present error without reverting to the opposite . Their scale is graduated only for the widest excesses of apathy and passion , of heat and cold . To treat with ridicule or contempt those unhappy persons whose erroneous opinions arise from either total or partial imbecility , is not only cruel but useless ; for if we would reduce them to moderation , it must not be by shocking their minds with harsh assertions , but by acting towards them with unaffected kindness and mild expostulation . Thus may we silently , but efiectually , turn aside the helm , and deflect their course from the rocks of Scylla , without exposing them to the dangers of Charybdis . Controversy is another source of error ; and it is astonishing to observe in how forcible a manner it Sometimes operates . Its peculiar effect is to give undue prominence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that through its influence the best arranged system often loses the beauty of its proportions . A man , whose opinions have been quietly formed , vrill usually find that each point is more or less con- 154 souBCES or spicuous in his system , according to its intrinsic consequence . But no sooner does he issue forth into the field of controversy , than this equitable balance is in imminent danger of being destroyed . The particular doctrine that is attacked instantly becomes a favorite , as an afflicted child is usually preferred to all the rest . The very habit of defending a point invests it with unwonted importance ; so that it is scarcely possible to open a polemical work , without being informed that the subject under consideration , whatever it may be , is about the most momentous that was ever discussed . The writer was possibly at one time as indifferent to it as his reader ; but the constant act of defending his position has impressed it upon his mind with a power not its own . He has every moment perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally sagacious in discovering the ill effects of the system of his adversary . Thus has he proceeded , till his favorite tenet has eclipsed all others . Symmetry , which is as indispensable in a system of opinions as in an architectural design , is entirely forgotten . His descriptions become harsli and overcharged ; so that what was perhaps substantially true and laudable , is rendered false and dangerous by his distortion and extravagance . To this natural effect of controversy may be ascribed many of the unguarded statements even of pious and learned men upon subjects connected with religion . Perceiving , perhaps , that some particular scriptural doctrine was much neglected , they have felt it necessary to show its importance ; but while they have eagerly pursued this laudable end , they have forgotten the equal importance of all the rest . In arguing against a common error , strong language must sometimes be employed ; nor can we wonder if this language is sometimes stronger than the occasion requires . Were we to judge of the relative importance of the thirty-nine articles of religion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , we might imagine each one in succession to have been the most important ; for controversy disturbs the natural order of distances and magnitudes . The individual truth , the insulated error under consideration , occupies the whole sphere of vision , so that other truths and other errors of equal or superior importance are in danger of being overlooked k These effects of controversy , though highly injurious , may unconsciously consist with the most innocent intentions ; but there are others equally common which always involve actual guilt . It is impossible to survey the annals of literary or theological warfare without discovering , even amongst the best of men , something too much resembling obstinacy or prevarication . A controversialist may begin moderately , but he seldom ends so . Heated with opposition , he tries to remove himself as far as possible from the opinions of his opponents . He finds it necessary to go to greater lengths than he intended , in order to defend what is undoubtedly true . " If I am obliged to give up this , I must give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an obstinate man would almost refuse his assent to the postulates of Euclid , if he suspected that they might be made use of to refute his favorite opinions . The last , but not the least prolific source , that needs be mentioned , is pride . This is closely connected with several of the foregoing causes , and without it they could not always exist . But independently also , and distinctly , it has a most extensive and energetic effect . An ambitious man who can not attract attention by superiority of talent , will often endeavor to do it by singularity of opinion ; for he who is unable to surpass others in illustrating known truth , may easily become conspicuous by some novelty in error . Hence most of the wild theories , paradoxes , and speculations , that infest the world . It is scarcely possible to find a very eccentric book in which there are not evident indications // of pride . The unusual opinions , for example , of Bishop Warburton are remarkably characterized hj this quality ; indeed , so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often the reason why they wen unusual . A still more forcible illustration may be derived from almost every work published by our modem pseudo-philosophers . Nearly the same principle that inclines one person to comply with every modish sentiment of the times in which he lives , induces another to resort to the contrary extreme of opposing whatever he finds established by public opinion . The pestilent philosophers of modern days have acquired much celebrity by this easy practice . They have railed against the most important institutions , without offering any thing of equal value in their place ; as the ambitious incendiary , who could not perhaps build a hovel , hoped to become illustrious by consuming the temple of Diana . Since , however , all proud men can not invent new systems of opinion , many are content with adopting the absurdities of others ; being perhaps aware that some sentiments are so eccentric and unlikely to be generally admitted , that the imitator becomes almost as conspicuous as the original artist . There are persons whose pride hourly leads them into erroneous opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that where others are right they must necessarily be wrong . Their politics , their religion , their literature , must possess something new and remarkable . They court opposition for its own sake . To judge of their opinion upon any given subject , it is necessary to inquire what is not the opinion of ordinary men . They are afraid of being considered tame characters . They are too proud to profess the same creed with their pious neighbors . No sentiment can recommend itself to their judgment that does not also gratify their love of notoriety . To enumerate other sources of error would increase /q/ the number of these remarks beyond the intended design . Prejudice , education , love of pleasure , the passbos , and various other causes , might , however , be mentioned , as not less extensive and powerful than those already detailed . But the object of these hints was chiefly to suggest a few practical ideas , in order to assist in answering the very important question , " How came I to possess such or such an opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it rests are improper or insufficient , the line of conduct that ought to be pursued is too obvious to need recital . /z/ " / am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ " It is by no means a subject for astonishment that men should have been ashamed of Christianity at its first promulgation . The Messiah had just suffered crucifixion , which was a mode of punishment confined to malefactors and the lowest classes of society : his followers were persecuted from city to city with the most implacable and cruel bigotry , and every thing was practised to bring the gospel into disrepute . It can not therefore excite surprise , that persons in general , and more especially the proud , the rich , and the learned , were ashamed of the new dispensation . But in the present ay , when Christianity has long been patronized as the religious code of the most enlightened quarter of the globe , when its evidences are acknowledged to be irresistible , and its blessings of infinite value , it is surely astonishing that men should be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire into the subject , the more we shall discover this to be the fact . To a man who believes Christianity to be a system " generally necessary to salvation , " it is distressing to reflect over how small a portion of the world it is yet diffused . Amidst the vast tracts of Africa , Asia , and America , scarcely is it known , except in the different European colonies . But from these desolate scenes let us turn our eyes to those brighter spots on which the light of revelation has shone . Christendom may present a more animating sight . Yet , alas ! though i the spiritual sun is indeed visible over the whole of this extensive tract , he too often appears " shorn of his beams , " and enveloped in the clouds and darkness /q/ of error . Superstition ( and what superstition can be more degrading to the gospel or to the human intellect than that of the unreformed church f ) has obscured the light of genuine Christianity . In some few countries , however , the gospel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the most conspicuous place . Nothing can be more spiritual , or scriptural , or worthy of the highest intellect and understanding , than the worship of the Church of England . Yet were the great Author of our religion orally to reveal his mind to us as he did to Saint John , he might say of us , as he said of the Ephesian church , " Nevertheless , 1 have also something against thee . " For is it not a fact rather to be lamented than denied , that a large portion , not only of those who vaguely call themselves Christians , but of those who zealously profess themselves members of the pure and apostolical church established in these realms , are , in reality , ashamed of the gospel of Christ ? Since , however , this charge is of a most weighty , and apparently an invidious , nature , it becomes necessary to inquire into the evidence upon which it depends . At the first promulgation of Christianity , the mere recognition of it as a religious system was sufficient to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely nominal professors was therefore comparatively small ; for few persons would go so far as to acknowledge Christ Jesus as their teacher , and thereby make themselves partakers of his reproach , who did not intend to go further , by fully admitting his doctrines , and leading a life strictly consistent with his commands . But in the present age and country the case is widely different ; a general belief in Christianity is rather a source of reputation and credit , than of censure or opposition ; and by no means necessarily supposes any great sacrifice or privation for the sake of our nominal Redeemer . Merely to say , " I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ , " costs us nothing . /z/ We run no risk , incur no odium , raise no suspicion . Being born within the limits of Christendom , it is considered a thing of course that we should not verbal/ deny our titular Lord . All the prejudices of our country and our education concur to make Christianity , as a system , respectable in our eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to be a Christian , in the common acceptation of the term , is never spoken of as a claim to honor or applause . It is therefore very possible to deceive ourselves in supposing we inherit the apostle 's spirit , merely because we can literally adopt his words , for- p getting that the circumstances under which we repeat them are essentially different . It is little to assert that we are not ashamed of that to which no mark of shame is ever thought of being attached . Many who in the present century name the name of Christ in Great Britain , would have opposed it , had they been contemporaries of the apostles in Judea or Asia Minor . It is evident , therefore , that the bare acknowledgment of Christianity in a Christian country , is a very insufficient test of our religious character . We have seen , not many years since , in a neighboring nation , whole bodies of men who professed the name of Christ , and who were possibly as much attached to his religion , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it among ourselves , becoming ashamed of it as soon as it ceased to be countenanced by the distributors of emolument and patronage ! This is surely an important fact , warning us to ascertain whether our religion is merely the unexamined prejudice of education , or that internal principle which enabled Saint Paul to submit to every opposition rather than renounce his Lord . From these remarks it will appear , that in examining whether or not we are " ashamed of the gospel of Christ , " we should look beyond the unmeaning recognition of Christianity which the worst as well as /q/ the best men around us will readily profess ; and should consider the apostle 's words in an extended view , as including the whole of a genuine Christian 's belief and practice , not only as distinguished from that , fornstance , of a Mahometan or infidel , but from that also of the ignorant and irreligious of his own nominal persuasion . Admitting this , it becomes , alas too ea to show that many professed Christians are , in reality , ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to advert to the licentious and profane , as examples of this truth . We find it oftentimes exhibited in persons who possess far greater claims to our respect - in the decorous , the moral , the benevolent , the sincere . Let us , as an example , select a character , such as is often seen in the more decent ranks of life , of a person taught by education and custom to respect Christianity , and perhaps confirmed in his veneration by observing the unrivalled moral excellence of its effects . At divine worship his attendance is regular , and his conduct exemplary . In his worldly affairs he is punctual and just , in his temper mild and amiable , in his alms liberal yet judicious , in his general conduct , upright and sincere . He even perhaps ventures further , willingly lending both his influence and his property to promote Christianity , and education , and good morals amongst the ignorant and destitute . Of a person thus well disposed , it can not but be painful to speak otherwise than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly draw a veil over every thing that might cast a shade on so lovely a picture , were not this falsely-kind office inconsistent with true Christian charity . Should such a person as has been described be inclined to undertake the important duty of self-examination , accompanied with earnest prayer for the divine guidance in ascertaining his true character , he might possibly discover that amidst so much that is laudable /z/ there is much also that is wrong , and that bow praiseworthy soever may be his general conduct , he , in reality , studiously avoids the reproach of the cross of Christ . It is not necessary that we should deny the divine mission of our Saviour , in order to constitute us enemies of the gospel ; for it is very possible that individuals of such a character as has been sketched out , though apparently devout and orthodox , may be justly obnoxious to the same serious charge . The line of conduct which has been described is by no means ao undeniable proof of willingness to bear the shame of the cross , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace , it is not unusually the direct road to admiration and esteem . The very same actions would have pre-supposed , in the times of the apostles , a disposition of mind which is by no means their necessary companion in the present day . It is not too much to say , that our conduct may in every thing be externally Christian , without our heart being right in the sight of God . The mere outward acknowledgment of Christianity in this highly Christian land , by no means indicates our real attachment to our professed Lord . Where there is no possible temptation to waver , there can be no exertion of principle in remaining firm . While therefore we are grateful to that beneficent Providence which has placed us in an eminently pious country , and made us subject to no external pains and penalties for our religion , we should be incited to greater rather than less scrupulousness in ascertaining its real effects upon our hearts and conduct . It is very possible , and indeed very common , to acknowledge Christianity in the gross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contemplate it at a distance as an object of applause and veneration , but to shrink from any minute examination of its individual parts . We do not hesitate to admit its authority , but we blush to be found living in its spirit . We confess it as our /q/ religion , but do not adopt it as our rule . We unmeanDgly pay homage to it od the Sabbath , whilst we conravene its inflaence during the remainder of the week , t is an outward badge which prevents our being misaken for Pagans or Jews , but not , as it ought to be , a principle interwoven in our hearts , which distinguishes js from those thoughtless persons who live ' without Giod in the world " among our own compatriots and friends If the assertion of our Saviour be true , that " out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh , " we may in some degree judge whether or not we are ashamed of the gospel of Christ , by the general tone of our daily conversation . Do we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to this standard ? Do we delight to converse on the important realities which are disclosed by revelation ; and that not abstractedly as subjects of mere literary taste and argument , but as practically connected with the improvement of the heart and life ? Or , on the contrary , do we instinctively shrink from topics thus immediately connected with the cross of Christ , and seek for delight in worldly ones ? Does not the passing rumor of the day usually interest us more than the immutable realities of eternity ? If religious subjects , strictly so called , be introduced , do we not often prove , by our silence or uneasiness , if not by our contempt , that we are heartily ashamed of their admission f Do we not also evidence this false modesty by representing religion as an unfit theme for habitual meditation , or conversational intercourse , and as calculated only for admission into pulpits and theological books ; thus completely dissenting from the general spirit of the early Christians and of our own pious forefathers , who were never ashamed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strictly devotional conversation . Awe for religion is the assigned cause ; but indifference to it , and I desire to avoid it , are the real ones , why it is almost 164 rJLLSE XODKSTt banished from modern intercourse . Men are not ashamed to speak of the existence of a Deity , or to converse upon any other subject of what is called natural religion ; but no sooner are the peculiarities of the gospel introduced , than our false modesty , or rather our active dislike is excited , and we strive to put ao end to the discussion . To a professor of another religion , we must oftentimes appear like a company of persons , who , for some unknown or unworthy motive , have determined to support , in the eyes of their neighbors , a system of which each is secretly ashamed , and which , therefore , all agree to banish from general conversation , and to confine to certain stated periodical formalities , in which each may venture to take a share without any distinct charge of credulity being attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves well acquainted with our natural propensity to be ashamed of the gospel , when they admitted into the baptismal service those emphatic words , " We do sign him with the sign of the cross , in token h hereafter he shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified , and manfully to fight under his banner against sin , the world , and the devil . " Yet , alas ! how often is their wise precaution rendered vain ! - Baptized into the Christian faith , we too often voluntarily and even eagerly yield to those spiritual enemies which by our sureties we had promised to renounce . We are even ashamed of genuine religion in others . An individual may make high aflvances in moral virtue and religious decorum , not only without his intellect or his sincerity being called into question , but with an evident increase of reputation to both . His motives not being suspected to be exclusively christian , his conduct is applauded and admired . But if he candidly point to the letter of his baptismal engagements as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is really determined to ' * fight under Christ 's banner against /q/ sin , the world , and the devil , " by exhibiting a life of faith , of prayer , of humility , of dependence upon God , of watchfulness against every sin both in the heart and conduct , of eagerness to perform the divine commands , and of determined hostility to those pomps and vanities of the world " which he has so solemnly vowed to renounce , - do we not instantly suspect him of enthusiasm or affectation ; of an imbecile understanding , or a hypocritical heart ? Do we not further evidence that we are ashamed of the gospel in its genuine spirit , by silently avoiding his company , if not by more open and direct modes of warfare ? In short , are we not willing to applaud every virtue of every man , unless when we perceive it to be the immediate effect of practical faith in Jesus Christ ? In our conduct , it is evident that we are ashamed of the cross of Christ , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than by the injunctions of the Bible ; or if , instead of adhering strictly to our Christian engagements , we study how far we may conform to the spirit of the world , how far we may indulge the " desires of the flesh , the desire of the eye , and the pride of life , " without absolutely forfeiting our claim to the name and privileges of Christians . An anxiety to avoid that unmerited reproach which , as disciples of Christ , we ought to rejoice to bear , is often perceptible iii the most trifling occurrences of life . If , for instance , a worldly gratification be proposed , which , though not , perhaps , verbally condemned by Christianity , is at least inimical to its general spirit - which supposes us to be habitually living as inhabitants of another world , as followers of the humble , holy , and patient Redeemer , and as imitators of those who have been most successful in copying his example , - should we in such a case dare to be singular in avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it appears to us to be inconsistent with the heavenly spirit of our religion , and a virtual renuncia*- /z/ tion of our baptismal vows ? Even when we decline the questionable pleasure , it is not unusual to act io such a way as to be conscious to ourselves that we are asha'ined of the cross of Christ , at the very time we profess to adhere to his commands . We plead , for j example , ( and perhaps truly , ) indisposition or a preengagement , when our duty required an explicit refu- ja sal ; softened indeed by ail the courtesies which enter k into the happiness of civilized and polished life , but by i no means compromising sincerity and conscience , or ii disposing our thoughtless friend to believe , that if the intervening engagement had not taken place , if the unfortunate indisposition had not unhappily occurred , there . was nothing to prevent our complying with his L unchristian request . Again - we evidence our reluctance to bear the re- ' &#9632; proach of Christ , if in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our principles ; if in our domestic cir- cle we fail to promote , as far as possible , family devo- * tion , the study of the sacred scriptures , and a heartfelt t regard to their doctrines and commands ; and if in our * general intercourse with society we do not conscientiously add our testimony , humble as it'may be , to the &#9632; power and iujportance of true religion . Men are never backward to applaud virtue and condemn vice , as such - because these terms do not belong exclusively to the language of revelation ; but nn and holiness , on account of their reference not only to the outward act , but to the actuating principle , and from their describing our conduct rather as it appears in the sight of God , and as it respects his revealed laws , than as relating to merely morgil and political considerations are usually avoided as suspicious terms by those who do not cordially admit the essential peculiarities of the gospel . It is , however , always a sign of our desire to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic doctrines or language of scripture , or attempt to lower down its deeper coloring to the slight /q/ sbades of ethical philosophy . If our ideas of Christianity , though they may admit it to be a divine revela* don , teach us to regard it rather as the religion of our country , and of great moral and political importance , than as immediately connected with the salvation of the human soul , and the interests of eternity , we idmit no more than is awfully compatible with a deiberate disavowal of its most essential doctrines , and a ystematic neglect of its most binding precepts ; - no Dore than the prejudices of country and education night be expected to produce on a mind the most hosile to personal religion . To persons such as have been described in a former part of these remarks , persons whose moral excellence af character makes it truly lamentable that they should be deluded in their religious views , no test , perhaps , is more appropriate than the absence or possession of Christian humility . What , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , the integrity , the amiableness , the beneficence which we have admired , instead of being , as they ought to be , the fruits of Christian faith and love , are intended to supersede , or even to co-operate with , that perfect and complete sacrifice and obedience which are exhibited in the gospel as the only meritorious cause of our redemption ? Must they not in this case prove the fruitful sources of self-complacency and spiritual pride ? Will they not oppose the humbling spirit of that dispensation which has made our pardon an act of unmerhed grace and compassion - " not of works , lest any man should boast , " but exclusively on account of the gratuitous mercy of God in Jesus Christ is .. It is lamentable to reflect , as it may appear harsh to eissert , that persons of the decorous character just described are frequently more ashamed of the cross of Christ than persons of less exemplary habits . For what is the cross of Christ f Is it not the revelation of free pardon to a rebellious world solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are there any classes of persons mentioned in scripture so naturally good as to deserve being exempted from the universal list of proscription , and for whom therefore the death of Christ was a supererogated work ? Or are there two methods of salvation proposed , the one for the profligate , and the other for the moraUst f So far from it , we find that he who owed fifty pence was as unable to pay as he that owed five hundred , and the creditor is said to have freely forgiven both . This doctrine , however , though evidently scriptural , is so completely opposed to the natural pride of a man j who feels conscious of the outward propriety of his conduct on the one hand , and knows not the extent of the divine requisitions on the other , that it is not often v that he can be readily induced to acknowledge its truth . He scornfully rejects the idea of being saved L in the same manner as Zaccheus or the thief upon the - cross ; forgetting that one great and specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sin not less heinous in the sight of God , and ultimately not less injurious to society , than the former extortion or dishonesty of these afterwards repentant characters . The expectation of being saved either wholly , or in part , upon account of our own merits , derogates essentially from the suflSciency of our Saviour 's obedience and death . Our pride indeed seldom goes so far as boldly to set aside the necessity of the sacrifice of Christ ; but we virtually produce the same effect by supposing that we already possess much that is good , and therefore need only a partial redemption to compensate for our acknowledged deficiency . To this serious error a person such as has been described is peculiarly liable . He sees in himself much that is praiseworthy in the sight of man , but forgets that " his goodness extend eth not unto God . " Comparing his actions with those of many of his neighbors , he thinks he perceives reason for self-gratulation and applause ; /q/ ) ut were he to examine himself by the standard of jod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ las been an ungrateful and unprofitable servant . Can le , for example , assert that his heart has been supremeY and undividedly fixed in holy love and devout adoraion upon his Maker , which is evidently the great law f his creation f Have every thought , and word , and ction been consecrated to his service . Supposing ven that his conduct had been uniformly good , withut the slightest deflection from the path of rectitude , a supposition , of course , wholly incompatible with ict , and which arrogance itself will not venture to ssert , ) yet has it invariably sprung from Christian lotives ? Has it been always intended to promote the lory of God , and the eternal welfare of his own soul ? las no spirit of pride or worldliness ever mixed with lis motives or contaminated his actions f Have love 3 God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ been the predominant principles of his heart , and have they een evidenced in his conduct , by undeviating love for ill mankind f Are anger , resentment , and desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour 's Sermon on the Mount for his guide , will he lonscientiously assert , that he has perfectly complied nth God 's holy will and commandments in their spiitual import and extent ? Surely no man in a Chrisian country , whose ignorance is not at least as great s his pride , will venture upon such an assertion . We re , therefore , all confessedly guilty , before God . Yet fhWe we acknowledge thus much in a general point f view , we often evince our shame of the gospel , by lesitating to admit the scriptural doctrine on this subset in its full extent . We assert that our heart and fe , though not perfectly good , equal or exceed the verage standard of mankind ; and as God is merciful , 7e trust to the merits of our Saviour to make up fdr ur defects . Does not , however , this language show a reluctance /z/ to admit the unqualified doctrines of that gospel which teaches us to approach our Creator for mercy , only through our all-prevailing Mediator and Advocate ; feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no action of our own can possess any legal merit towards procuring our forgiveness ? The apostle Saint Paul , perceiving that the idea of our being saved partly by our own works , and partly by the merits of our Surety , was an error highly derogatory to the honor of the Redeemer 's sacrifice , and tending greatly to encourage that spiritual pride which Christianity was expressly intended to counteract , - opposed the plausible doctrine with all the force of argument and all the vehemence of zeal . Had he never written more than one well-known sentence , this surely would have been quite conclusive on the subject . If salvation , he asserts , be * ' by grace , then it is no more of works , otherwise grace is no more grace : but if it be of works , then it is no more grace , otherwise work is no more work . " There is therefore no medium between being saved entirely either by works or by grace : the first , owing to our acknowledged imperfections , is impossible ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation by the merits of Christ in conjunction with our own , is to oppose the spirit of the apostle 's argument , and evidently indicates a reluctance to submit unreservedly to the humbling doctrines of the cross of Christ . The reason , perhaps , why persons of moral character so often err on this essential part of Christianity , is , that they do not sufficiently perceive the extent of human corruption . They join indeed habitually in those strong general expressions of sinfulness , guilt , and spiritual impotence , which so frequently occur in the Bible , and its offspring the Liturgy ; but they have never considered the awful fact as it relates to themselves . Tliey contend that " their heart is good , " forgetting the statement of Omniscience itself , that " the /q/ heart of man is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked . " They seem unconscious that the fall of mankind has so completely changed our moral condition , that nothing we can perform by nature is truly good ; or , in the language of our Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inspiration of his Spirit , are not pleasant to God , forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ . " They fail therefore to perceive the necessity of that renovation of heart , that implantation of the " grace of Christ , " which , notwithstanding their propriety of conduct , may not yet have taken place , but antecedent to which , no human action is well pleasing unto God , on account of the evil nature of the motives from which it springs . One error in religion usually depending upon another , we can not be surprised that those who do not cordially admit the doctrine of human guilt and inability , should be ashamed of another essential part of revelation , the necessity of the Holy Spirit 's influences . Conscious that their supposedly good works , which , upon their hypothesis , deserve wholly , if not , at least in part , the rewards of heaven , were the oflspring of merely natural motives , they are by no means prepared to allow the declaration of our Article , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acceptable to God with out the grace of Gpd by Christ preventing us , that we may have a good will , and working with us when we have that good will . " It appears then but too certain that even in this Christian country no small portion of the professed disciples of Christ are , in reality , ashamed of many of the peculiarities of *his gospel ; and this radical fault we have seen is discoverable , not only amongst the utterly thoughtless and licentious , but among many also of the moral and sincere . To live in the genuine spirit of our profession , emulating the holy conduct of saints , confessors , martyrs , and our Divine Master himself , constitutes no part of the aim of many , who nevertheless /z/ profess to differ widely from the irreligious and profane . False shame of the gospel is a temptation exactly suited to the disposition of those who would be startled at the more open assaults of our spirtitual enemy . It is so plausibly veiled under the names of modesty , proper deference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding ostentations singularity , that we are not always aware of its pernicious influence . A person whose sensitiveness of character , and whose temper and education , incline him to avoid whatever may excite the " world 's dread laugh , " will find this a most formidable temptation . To certain coarse and wayward minds , singularity , even without any adequate reason , seems to possess intrinsic charms . Men thus inclined , ( unless happily restrained by that factitious urbanity which often veils what religion only can overcome , ) delight in courting unprovoked controversy . They love to set the opinions and maxims of the world at defiance . They invite noise and controversy , not for the sake of truth , but on account of their inherent attractions ; and seem never to enjoy existence more than when surrounded with a circle of auditors who are listening with mingled astonishment and indignation to their affectedly eccentric opinions . The opposition , which to others would be intolerable , is to them but a kind of pleasing stimulus . A man thus naturally or educationally inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is oftentimes too willing to suppose that he is bearing the reproach of the gospel , when he is only gratifying his favorite propensity , a propensity not less corrupt when employed on religion than when on other objects . He fancies he is not ashamed of the cross of Christ , because he boldly avows his theological tenets ; forgetting that he does no more for Christianity than he would do for the most indifferent speculation in politics or philosophy . He escapes , it is true , that " fear of man " which " bringih a snare ; " but he forgets that his victory is owing /q/ rather to the audacity of his brow , and the rigidity of his nerves , than to his real veneration for the holy cause which he defends . There are persons , however , of a very different temperament , and to whom the corporeal pains oi martyrdom itself would be the least part of its terrors . A malicious hint , a reproachful smile , are torture to their minds . Convinced in their judgment that Christianity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear the ridicule of being " righteous overmuch , " and therefore fail to enter completely into its spirit . They know what is right , but false shame prevents their putting it in practice . The contemptuous smile of an irreligious acquaintance outweighs with hem both the force of scripture and the deliberate convictions of their own impartial reason . They dread lest the slightest approximation to primitive piety should subject them to the charge of imbecility or enthusiasm . In a word , they shun the cross of Christ . But is not this obviously unchristian ? Are not pride and worldliness , however variously disguised , its exciting cause ? No just plea can possibly be found to excuse so flagrant a violation of our allegiance to our professed Lord : it is a temptation which we are bound to resist . If the peculiar doctrines or spirit of the gospel necessarily excite the frown or suspicion of the world , we must be content to bear them . ' ' One is our master , even Christ . " " We can not serve God and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and well-bred , without denying or even merging our religious principles . Christian politeness is far removed from hypocrisy . If we would evidence that we do not wantonly affect singularity or oppose the maxims and opinions of men , let it be shown , not by a suppression of the doctrines or practices of our holy religion , but by the sweetness , modesty , and prudence with which we exemplify and inculcate them . We should remember also , for our comfort , that the great- /z/ er the difficulty we 6nd in bearing the reproach of Christ , the greater is our reward if we are enabled resolutely to comply with the obligation . Thiere is no class of persons upon whom the shame of the cross is more likely to produce a powerful eflFect , than upon the younger members of amiable , but not decidedly religious families . Having , perhaps , been providentially thrown into circumstances in which they have had an opportunity of seeing a standard of religion more elevated and more resembling the apostolic age than the one to which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than merely nominal Christianity , a ' form of godliness without the power , " " a name to live while we are dead , " they have determined , by the gnice of God , to act up to their conviction - ** to confess the faith of Christ cruci6ed , and manfully to fight under his banner against sin , the world , and the devil , and to continue his faithful soldiers and servants unto their lives ' end . " As they examine more closely the sacred scriptures , they perceive more evidently that a line of conduct is required widely differing from that of the mere educational Christians with whom they are surrounded . Their judgment is convinced . The trines and injimctions of the Bihie , not to say of their own church , appear to them so plain , that they can not withhold their assent . Instructed and influenced by the Divine Spirit , they have been tausht to overcome their first natural prejudices against a life of piety , and have felt that to dedicate themselves to their Creator is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only convinced their judgment , but won their hearts . Moral and amiable as their lives may have been , yet perceiving the truth of the scriptural doctrine , that in the sight of God they , like others , are sinners , and deserve his eternal wrath , - they have imbibed the most ardent love and gratitude to their adorable Saviour , who redeemed them with the price /q/ of his own invaluable blood . They have determined , in consequence , by bis assistance , to walk in bis ways , and to make the concerns of eternity their great object of care in this fleeting world . Thus convinced , and thus resolved , they begin their Christian course . The glories of heaven are full in their view . The pomps and vanities of the world have become insipid and even hateful to them . They can enjoy nothing that appears inconsistent with their heavenly vocation and their vows of fidelity to their celestial Lord . Their supreme desire is to be holy as God is holy , and perfect as he is perfect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snare . " They could , perhaps , have borne the pains of the cross , but they know not how to sustain its reproach . They could fave the open rigors of persecution rather than yield c an unchristian pleasure , or omit a Christian duty ; ut they know not how to support the tender solicitaions or reproaches of mistaken affection , or the railty , half playful , half severe , of a respected friend . Susceptible and tender , they shrink beneath the cruel charge of unnecessary singularity , if not of hypocritical : reciseness ; conveyed , perhaps , ( to add the more to ts poignancy , ) by those whom they highly value and revere . They weep while they see friendship and Qiffection , which have hitherto been uniformly exerted for their good , combining themselves with authority which they have always felt it a delightful privilege to obey , in order really , however uninienlionally , - to pluck them from their Redeemer 's hand , and if possible to plunge them into that giddy vortex which their baptismal vows , confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid . It is in circumstances like these that the reality of religious professions is brought to the test . The difficulty is often increased when surrounding friends are persons who would not invite to any pleasure , or deter from any duty , except where the voice of general and respectable custom seemed /z/ fully to authorize their conduct . A religious youth placed among persons of openly immoral habits , finds no great cause for embarrassment or hesitation . In shunning them , he not only does not meet with censure , but even gains applause . But among persons of regular , yet not decidedly religious character , it is often quite impracticable to preserve tenderness of conscience , without incurring misrepresentation or reproach ; since it is impossible to convey to the world at large those nice susceptibilities of Christianity by which she instructs men to shrink from the very appearance of evil . In cases of this kind , the reproach of the cross is a most formidable impediment in the Christian course ; but formidable as it may be , it must be overcome by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great , however , as are the obstacles of this nature which perplex the youthful Christian in the present age , they are unworthy of comparison with those which surrounded the first converts to Christianity . Surely , then , they are not insurmountable by those who inherit any portion of the faith , the hope , the zeal , the patience of the apostolic age , and who , being convinced of the treachery of their own hearts , the mutability of their will , and the feebleness of their resolutions , continually look up to a higher Power for such a portion of the " wisdom of the serpent , " and the " harmlessness of the dove , " as may enable them to act , on the one hand , with modesty , propriety , and affection , without , on the other , betraying their Divine Master , or shrinking from the honorable reproach of his cross . In cases of doubt , it should ever be admitted as a rule , that God must be preferred to man ; and should dim-sighted expediency attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may counteract her unchristian policy by another maxim equally simple and decisive - ' ' Do not evil , that good may come . " /q/ It is interesting to conceive the case of an amiable young Greek or Roman , converted by the preaching of St. Paul , and just beginning to bear the reproach of his Redeemer 's cross . Imagine him endowed with large mental powers , enjoying a high rank in the scale of society , and heir to all the worldly gratifications which the wealthy and luxurious city of Rome , or Athens , or Corinth , could afford . Attached , however , to the service of his heavenly Master , he finds that no prudence or amiableness can avert contempt or opposition . His dearest relatives , his most inticnate associates , not only despise his religious views , but endeavor by every taunting argument , if not by open persecution , to bring him back to the spirit of the world . He feels that he really gives them pain and concern upon ' t is account , and knows not how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent . What a ield for the cultivation of the most difficult Christian jraces and virtues ! How urgently would the apostle lave exhorted such a convert to combine that zeal for God , and that love for his Redeemer , which would prevent his shrinking from the " reproach of Christ , " with that meekness , that prudence , that conciliating teniper , that patience under injuries and opposition , which conspicuously marked his own character , prompting him cheerfully to become ' all things to all men , that he might by all means save some . " How earnestly would he have dissuaded him from indulging in angry disputes and contumelious censures , and especially from aflfecting a tone of superiority over those who might not possess his own degree of spiritual knowledge . How diligently would he have instructed him to pray for that joy and peace in believing , which , displaying themselves in habitual serenity and even cheerfulness of disposition , might convince his associates that Christianity is not the gloomy phantasm of a morbid imagination , but an unfailing source of true beatitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he have enjoined him , as he loved his divine Saviour , and valued his own soul , to cuhivate the amiable graces and tempers of the Christian character , acting uniformly with wisdom , humility , and affection , L in order ' ' by well doing to put to silence the igno- 7 , rance of foolish men . " Yet , on the other hand , how urgent and explicit i would have been his cautions against spurious candor , unhallowed compliances , and shame of the cross of . i Christ . His language to the christianized Hebrews is , " Follow peace with all men : " but , as if to prevent is their imagining that , in order to obtain it , they might - occasionally compromise their conscience , or in any e way lower the standard of Christian piety , he immediately adds , ' and holiness , without which no man : shall see the Lord . " He would never have permitted r. temporal interest , universal example , or even the stronger argument of veneration and affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youthful r. convert , as a valid plea for the slightest infringement * on his baptismal vows . Where the duly was clear , he would have yielded nothing whatever to worldly policy or false shame . He could pity weakness , but he would not sanction error : while he admired conciliation , he would have expected consistency . It is pleasing to imagine what happy effects the humble , affectionate , yet firm and upright conduct of such a convert might produce upon discerning and well-disposed friends . Seeing his good works , they might insensibly learn to " glorify his Father which is in heaven , " and to become " followers of him even as he also followed Christ ; " for a character correctly modelled upon the principles of our Lord and his faithful followers , is the most powerful demonstration of the beauty and efficacy of religion . The various evils which result from being ashamed of the gospel are too obvious to need recital . To a person under this unhappy influence , knowledge serves /q/ only to increase guilt , and susceptibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by teaching what it does not of itself give power to perform . To avoid the reproach of the cross , men not only neglect positive duties , but commit positive crimes , applauding and practising , for the sake of worldly conformity , what " * their judgment allows to be wrong , and what their knowledge , if unbiassed by their feelings , would prompt them to avoid . It may not , therefore , be improper to add a few considerations , which point out the absurdity , as well as the wickedness , of being ashamed of the gospel of our Redeemer . The most powerful of these , is that which is mentioned by St. Paul , in his epistle to the Romans . " I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that beiievelh . " He does not say that he was not ashamed of the gospel on account of its being patronized by the State and connected with honor and emolument , for this was not then the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and popular decorum ; nor even because of its unrivalled moral excellence , which is usually its highest claim to praise in the opinion of many modern panegyrists of Christianity . Forgetting these minor , though in themselves important considerations , he viewed the gospel at once in its most prominent and most important aspect , as " the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth . " He considered it as the record of the most astonishing events that were ever destined to occur in the annals of eternal ages ; as the highest energy of Omnipotence exerted for the salvation of a ruined world . When man had deserved the utmost punishment that God could inflict , his oflTended Judge became his covenant Father , and devised the most stupendous method of reconciling his own unchangeable attributes with the restoration of his offending child . The eter- i /z/ nal and co-equal Son of God , veiling his divinity in the humble garb of our fallen nature , naagni6ed and made honorable the law which we had broken , and became a personal sacri6ce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shows how we may become " sons of God , " and " heirs of the kingdom of heaven ; " how we may escape eternal punishment , and become entitled to eternal felicity . Such is the reli religion which we despise ; - for surely no despite can be greater than to profess to believe it , while we act as if it were a delusion . We are ashamed of what ? Of a glorious revelation from our adorable Creator , which , amidst the darkness of a dreary world , has burst upon us with celestial effulgence , bringing * ' life and immortality to light . " Seraphs , the most exalted of created intelligences , desire to look into it ; while man , for whose benefit it was designed , too often treats if with contempt , professing to believe its truth , while he lives in the habitual violation of its spirit . We do notit is true , professedly withdraw our allegiance from oub Redeemer .

We blush that men should thint we are actuated by a constant sense of the presence o an unseen God , and live in habits of divine comnumioB with our Maker ; - that we cherish the most humiliat ing views of ourselves , as guilty sinners , justly deserv ing his eternal wrath , and depend for salvation , nc upon any supposed merit in ourselves , but entire ! * upon the obedience and death of our Surely ; - that , despising and forsaking the pomps an vanities of the world , we live a life of faith and holiness , of dependence and humility , and resolve " i know nething among men but Jesus Christ , and hii : crucified . " Not to be ashamed of the gospel , woulc not , we might imagine , require any great degree of piety or self-possession . For , is it not , confessedly , a /z/ /q/ divine revelation P Is it not ' consistent with reason ? Is it not established by prooC ? Is it not even admitted ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamap authority f Are not its blessings inestimably valuable , its precepts supremely good , its doctrines incNB:f efiably sublime ?

Why then are we so often ashamed of tiie- gospel ? EvicJently because we fear the face-of men . We perceive that true religion is despised - that habitual devotion to Ciod , founded upon faith in our Lord Jesus Christ , is looked upon as the offspring of a weak mind or capricious imagination , if not of spiritual hypocrisy or pride . Such are the mighty causes that blind our untlerstanding and harden our hearts ! But viewing our .. selves as rational and responsible creatures , what is M here so important in the opinion of frail and fallible en , that we should sacrifice to it our conscience and Mr hopes for an eternal world ? Contempt and ridi ule were but a part of those persecutions which the &#9632; J first Christians , and even our own forefathers , were Compelled to undergo . How many thousands of per- i6 i /z/ SODS , not excluding children and numbers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of martyrdom , rather than deny the gospel of their Saviour ! And shall modern Christians be ashamed of that trifling portion of worldly contempt which may fall to their share ? Shall we sacrifice our souls for the vain customs of a world which in a few years we must leave forever ? Observe the firmness of Saint Paul . Nothing coald daunt his resolution . He gloried in the cross of Christ , though be was ridiculed for it by some of the most polite and learned nations then upon earth , and persecuted by some of the most cruel and implacable . He travelled from city to city , disseminating , amidst the scoffs and taunts of an enraged populace , the doctrines of a crucified Redeemer . To the Greeks , his preaching was foolishness ; so that in the long list of bis persecutions may be enumerated what , to a man of the apostle 's refined education and literary attainments , , j must have been peculiarly mortifying , the charge of ; being a weak and ignorant enthusiast . Now , is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same re- ligion , while we possess nothing of the same spirit ? - i If we can not submit to an idle taunt , bow could we i , have borne these " cruel mockin2 ; s ? " - how could we ' j n have " jeoparded our lives unto the death . " If we ' &#9632; know not how to sustain the petty vexation of an unceremonious hint , how could we , like the apostle , have traversed the world , promulgating , in defiance of human power and human malice , the doctrines of the cross , and at length sealing the truth of our testimony with our blood ? If , when placed in a Christian country , protected by a Christian legislature , and enjoying i a national form of worship , ( which of itself bears wit- " ness to the holy principles and practices of our forefathers , ) we shrink from a cordial participation in their tenets , their feelings , and their conduct , and pervert their venerable formularies to the lifeless and unscriptural /q/ system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , like them , we had been called to " bear the burden and beat of the day , " and to suffer persecution and torture for the sake of our religious principles ? It would be of great service to us often to recall to mbd the solemnity of that moment which has been already mentioned , in which we were admitted by baptism into the outward and visible church of Christ . The remembrance is exceedingly impressive ; and if in our infancy , though then unconscious of the benefit , we were externally dedicated to the service of our Creator , shall we , when matured in understanding to see the propriety of the dedication , voluntarily exclude ourselves from the proffered blessings ? It may be mentioned as a necessary result of religious consistency , though it does not deserve to be admitted as a legitimate argument , that it raises rather than lowers a character in the sight of the world . Uen , even while they ridicule , feel a secret respect bich inconsistency can never procure . He who pro* fesses to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rules , deserves even by human maxims , I contempt which coherence of conduct would have ivoided . There is something manly and noble in an lonest avowal of Christian principles , and an undisguised exemplification of Christian conduct ; and should there be those , who contemn ' them in the days sf health and strength , they will be among the first to envy their possessor upon a death-bed and in sight of an eternal world . To profess Christ nominally , while in our hearts we are ashamed of his gospel , is as absurd as it is wicked . It were almost safer to confess ourselves complete infidels , than to act in so impious and inconsistent a manner . We learn to pity the heathen , because they possess not the scriptures , and have not heard of a Redeemer - forgetting how much more severe will be our /z/ judgment , if , having known these things , " we neglect so great salvation . " And what is our motive ? Why truly we can not overcome the fear of man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we feel shame DOW , what shall we feel when all the world is assembled at the last day , and men and angels are witnesses of that sentence which the Almighty Judge shall pass upon those who denied Christ upon earth ? The Saviour himself , when incarnate among men , left a warning on this important siihject : - " Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man he ashamed , when he shall come in bis own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels . " It is impossible fully to conceive the import of these admonitory words . They show , however , that God will punish men , as it were , by a law of equitable re- , taliation . As our motive for slighting the gospel i r fear of shame , so our punishment shall be " everlasting P contempt . " But how great the difference ! The p shame that prevents our living up to our profession is a p cowardly fear of mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an eternal ' * confusion , " the mockery of men and angels , and the endless taunts of our com- r panions in destruction . No one will pity , but all will J5 scorn us for our absurd and wicked choice . The more therefore we reflect , the more shall we see the folly , as well as criminality , of being ashamed of the gospel . It is sacrificing eternity for a moment . Had we the alternative proposed of a long life of honor among men , with never-ending shame and conlennpt in the world to come , or of a little opposition while we are here , followed by an eternity of that inconceivable honor and glory which are reserved for those who are not ashamed of Christ upon earth , we could not reasonably doubt whether of the two to prefer . And yet , while we are not certain of an hour or a moment , we try to avoid the reproach of the cross of Christ , though /q/ are conscious it is at the expense of our everlasting ioterest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , or we shall be sheltered from it io " the haven where we would be ; " but when mile Koos and millions of years are fled , the shame which we so wantonly incur will still be new and still begin-ningAsa proof of our unchristian fear of man , were a thoughtless companion at this moment to enter our presence , should we not perhaps be ashamed of the important but humbling reflections that may be passing io our minds , and gaily attempt to smile away our convictions by the levities of worldly conversation , forget* ting that instead of an agreeable companion , it might have been one for whose approach we are little prepared , and who even now may be waiting the Creator 's signal for admission ? At the sight of death , the censure of mortals will be nothing to us - we shall be above them ; they will be over for evermore . But when shall the confusion of that man end , of whom the Saviour says , ' I will be ashamed of him , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a contrast to these painful , though necessary , reflections , it is delightful to imagine the raptures of the apostle Saint Paul , when he quitted the world , and found himself in the presence of his beneficent Creator . We may conceive him humbly pointing to his epistles , to his labours among the Gentiles , and to the body which he had quilted on earth , still reeking from the axe of the executioner , as proofs that he had not been ashamed of the cross of his Redeemer . But who shall paint his ecstacies of joy , when the glorified Messiah acknowledged him before his Father and the holy angels , saying , Well done , good and faithful servant ; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord ! " His pains , his dangers , his sorrows , would be forever forgotten , and the shame which he bore for the sake of Christ would then indeed appear his highest glory . /z/ But why refer to mortal examples ? Let t is rather consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and persecuted for the sake of mankind , even of those who had despised and rejected him . When we behold the ' Lord of life and glory " thus condescending to become " an outcast of the people , " and bearing every pain and indignity that malice could inflict , how trifling does that portion of shame appear which his followers are called upon to sustain ! It is less than nothing in comparison . What ingratitude , therefore , as well as impiety , is it to shrink from a little shame for his sake who has done so much for us ! Let us not then fear to profess before men that we are in earnest about the salvation of our souls ; that we feel an ardent love and gratitude to the Redeemer ; that we depend by faith upon his sacriflce and obedience for our salvation ; and that we desire to live in the holy , self-denying spirit of his religion . They may indeed wonder at the change in our character , and designate our conduct by some contemptuous epithet ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience , all will be peace . The hope of the glory that awaits the Christian far outweighs , even in the present world , the contempt of men ; and it will not be long before those who ridiculed his conduct will wish that they were partakers of his reward . Let us not fear then to advocate the doctrines of the cross of our Saviour . Let our conversation and spirit prove that we are not ashamed of prayer , of praise , of studying the scriptures , of devotional intercourse , or of that divine operation of the Holy Spirit vpon the heart , which constitutes so important a doctrine of Christianity . Let us explicitly act up to our sentiments . It is not unusual to find dying persons lamenting their former want of sincerity and firmness in this important particular . We know not what poignant regrets we are laying up for our departing hours . /q/ if we recoil , while in health , from an unreserved and constant avowal of our religious principles . When we come within view of eternity , nothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consciousness of having , through fear of the reproach of Christ , concealed , perhaps even from our clearest intimates and friends , our views on the most important of all subjects which can interest a human being . Having acted disingenuously towards our Saviour in our days of heahh and usefulness , how can we expect that be will irradiate our expiring moments with his divine presence and manifestations ? The written rule of God 's conduct is , " them that honor me I will honor ; " and why should we think that in our particular case be ibi will reverse it ? When eternity approaches , it usually er ; appears so unspeakably important , and the opinions of Mil men so completely lose their former influence upon Ml the mind , that the repentant sufierer is astonished KT at the fatuity of his own conduct in not acting up to ej the plain , unsophisticated spirit of his heavenly profes ' / sion . How often do we hear of persons , constitutionally the most timid , summoning around their death-bed their thoughtless relatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , perhaps , the last time , what they bitterly acknowledge ought to have been their own conduct , and what they affectionately trust will be the conduct of their surviving friends ? Piety never yet excited a blush in a dying man : * ' Men may lire foob , but fools they can not die/ ' Let us not then ask , as persons too commonly do . What will men say were we to begin to make a consistent profession of religion i Let us ask rather . What will conscience say if we neglect to do it ? What willthe holy angels say , when they see before the bar of Heaven an accountable and immortal being , who knew what his heavenly vocation required , but who feared the momentary contempt of man more than the eternal /z/ wrath of God ? What will condemned spirits say , when they find that their malicious arts have seduced us into an inextricable snare ? Above all , What will be the language of the omniscient Judge , when in the dreadful day of account we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mortals vanish into nothing before these important considerations ! Let us ' then regard the world as it really is ; or , what is much the same thing , as it will appear to us when we are about to quit it . Let us view it as false , as unsatisfying , as probationary ; and let us habitually contrast it with that unchangeable and eternal world towards which we are so rapidly approaching . This will be a powerful argument against being ashamed of Christ ; for what is the frown or the applause of a few misguided mortals to the man who expects in a few days , or years , to be a glorified spirit in the presence of his omnipotent Creator , enjoying the delights of heaven for evermore f /z/ E to God and charity to our neighbor are the sunr substance of the decalogue . The latter part of duty forms that " new commandment " which our ie Lord gave to his disciples , and which is an 5me of the second table of the other ten . ' he universality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , prevent its applying with peculiar e to the more intimate relations and connexions of Husbands and wives , parents and children , hren and sisters , masters and servants , are placed he gospel under particular obligations to the pracof this delightful command . There is also another lexion which is frequently and pointedly mentioned : he New Testament ; namely , the sacred and lonsible relation , between spiritual pastors and r flock . Emancipation from ecclesiastical tyranny is reckonand justly , among the privileges of modern times , in throwing off a burdensome and useless yoke , in oring conscience to its just and unalienable rights , r not men , in the usual spirit of innovation , have e more than was necessary , more than was wise ? 5 present age has not indeed materially abridged immunities of the church ; but has it not introdu , what , to a clergyman who really values the souls lis fellow-creatures , must appear far injurious , eneral diminution of affection and esteem for its /z/ ministers ? Has it not discarded most of those innocent prepossessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might he attended , once formed also a plentiful source of usefulness f Compared with former days , how little do we now hear of persons applying to their religious teacher for advice in difficulties , for direction in scruples of conscience , for mediation in cases of contest and dispute ? The laity , in fact , tend to 611 the church with indolent , unskilful , and irreligious ministers , by not making it a public disgrace not to be the very reverse of these characters . Were they unanimously to show , that they expect from their pastors , not simply the accustomed public services , but private advice and instruction , and an example of all the holy , humble , self-denying graces of the Christian and ministerial characters , - improper persons would be in a great measure excluded from the church , by finding that it was an arduous , and , to them , irksome employment , instead of the pleasant sinecure which they had been taught to expect . They could not withstand public opinion . The clerical function would be a torment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seek refuge from it in some less spiritual vocation . But so long as the laity are willing to tolerate irreligious ministers , they must not be surprised if such ministers abound . The general opinion of the world is indeed no excuse for a pastor who does not live up to his holy profession ; but this opinion , if correctly exerted , would be a powerful drawback upon those who intended to assume the sacred garb only for the sake of interested considerations . The great mutual duty between clergymen and their parishes is Christian affection ; for where this exists , it will prompt its possessor to discharge every other obligation of his allotted calling . On the part of a minister the necessity of Christian affection is self-evident . His very office is a * labor /q/ of love . " He is a shepherd , a guide , a messenger of peace ; and every thing that can demand affection and 6delity belongs to his responsible vocation . When he considers how the incarnate Son of the most high God , - " that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his flock , how can he avoid feeling something , though comparatively but a small pait , of his divine Master 's love ? Daily employed , as he must necessarily be if he live up to the duties of his profession , in teaching men to " put on bowels of mercy , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , long-suffering , " and to fiilBl that new commandment of Christ , that , as he loved us , so should we love one another , " how can he but imbibe something of the blessed spirit which he inculcates upon others ? How can he himself avoid learning what he thus teaches to all human kind ? One of the most striking features of the apostolic age IS the Christian regard that subsisted between pastors and their flock . The language and wishes of St. Paul are inexpressibly aflTecting . To attempt to select individual examples of his tenderness for his Christian converts would be superfluous ; for what page is there of his writings that does not abound in them ? In like manner , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems there to have imbibed no small portion of that meek philanthropy which adorned the character of the Redeemer , was accustomed to exhibit by the most endearing epithets the Christian affection of his heart . Brethren , - my beloved , - my well beloved , - my little children , - are the usual thles by which the venerable Saint John ws wont to address his interesting charge ; whilst every thing that he uttered or recorded proved the amiable feeling of his own heart , and was well adapted for infusing a kindred principle into the hearts of others . There is much in every class of character and every situation to excite the afl ! ection or pity of a Chris- // tian minister . For the younger part of bis flock , lie surely can not but feel an inexpressible anxiety whilst be considers their ignorance and thoughtlessness , and bow in the bloom of their days , and at the very time when they ought to yield themselves unreservedly to their Creator , they are gaily and smilingly running the road that leadeth to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because more hopeless tear , while he views them , though upon the very brink of eternity , more insensible oftentimes of their danger than youth itself . Over early piety he watches with the affectionate solicitude of paternal regard . For the advanced Christian he feels the love and esteem due to a brother in Christ Jesus ; while to the aged disciple , bending beneath the weight of accumulated years , and about to be gathered , like a shock of corn fully ripe , into the heavenly garner , he looks up with the- veneration of a son beside the death-bed of an expiring parent . How intense are his feelings when upon the Sabbath he beholds his flock collected to receive instruction from his lips ! " These immortal souls are given to my chorge He needs no other reflection to excite his affection . This one thought contains a volume . What tie so binding ? What responsibility so awful ? What claim to Christian love so strict and so endearing ? Would you ascertain the ardor of his feelings . ' * Trace , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmost soul to the throne of mercy , while he beholds one unhappy sinner ignorant and inattentive , another callous and impenetrable , a third evidently grovelling in the world , scarcely unharnessed from the overpowering cares of the week ; and even of those who seem , for the moment , really interested and aflected , the greater part obliterating the hallowed impression as soon as the solemn service is concluded . So completely indeed ought Christian affection to be the characteristic of a pious minister , that he should /q/ become the entire properly of others . Forgetting himself , and his personal feelings , he should become ' ' all tilings to all men ; " he should ' * weep with them that weep , and rejoice with those that rejoice ; " " to the weak he must become as weak , to gain the weak ; " he must seek , " rfot his own , but another man 's " prosperity , and must comfort those that are in trouble , ** by the comfort wherewith he is himself comforted of God . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , it may be more generally useful to consider the propriety of a reciprocal aOTection in the flock towards their spiritual pastor . If a minister really exhibit an affectionate spirit , gratitude demands la similar return . St. Paul very forcibly urges this consideration in his apostolical advice to the Thessalonians : - " We beseech you , brethren , to know them who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ; and to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . " A minister is , or ought to be , like his adorable Master , a spiritual physician ; and surely if we feel grateful to those who are anxious to restore to health the diseased body , we should riot forget those who evince an equal anxiety to perform a still more kind office for the immortal soul ; especially when we consider , that in so doing they are often obliged to sacrifice their own personal feelings , and to bear opposition and ill-will for the unsparing faithfulness of their exertions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious minister , we could not surely withhold oar gratitude , even though we might not duly perceive the necessity of his sohcitude upon our account . We see , and perhaps applaud him , in his more open ministrations ; but forget that his private moments , his silent meditations , his literary hours , his sleepless nights , his unseen retirements , are not less spent for our
