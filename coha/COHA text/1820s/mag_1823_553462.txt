txt ART . 11. - Lectures on Physiology , Zoology , and the A'aturat History of Man , delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons , by William Lawrence , F. R. S. Professor of . dnato-. my and Surgery to the College , . dssistant Surgeon to St Bartholomew 's hospital , Surgeon to Bridewell and Bethle-. hem hospitals , and to the London Infirmary for diseases of the Eye ; with twelve engravings . London , 1822 . THIs work has excited more general attention , than *s usually enjoyed by treatises on similar subjects ; partly on account of the opposition , with which the author 's attempt to publish it was encountered and which seems therefore to have been ill-judged , and partly from a certain cast of radical or levelling principles , with which it is tinctured . The first part of it is occupied by four lectures , one of which contains a reply to the charge brought against the author by a brother lecturer , Mr Ahernethy , of having perverted his office to the very unworthy design of propagating opinions detrimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of loosening those restraints , on which the welfare of mankind depends , ' and a defence of certain opinions advanced in former lectures . The other three consist of general views of the nature , utility , and proper objects of physiology and zoology . The remaining and by much the largest portion of the work is devoted to the natural history of man . It affords a good view of what has hitherto been done in relation to this very interesting subject , together with the author 's particular opinions concerning it . We think this latter part , with some exceptions , will be found both agreeable and useful to the general reader ; but as // the book is not common in this country , we can refer him to the article Man ' in Rees ' Cyclopedia , which contains nearly the same matter , and was , we believe , contributed by Mr Lawrence . When we hinted above our disapprobation of the kind*of opposition , which these lectures have met with , we were far from intending to imply that they contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen of the ability and industry of Mr Lawrence should adopt or attempt to promulgate some of the opinions expressed in them . We object to the nature of the opposition , because it ought to have been foreseen that it would be ineffectual and worse than ineffectual ; that it would only serve to give currency to these opinions among that very class of society to which they are likely to do most injury ; that the consequence of disallowing Mr Lawrence 's claim to copy-right , and obliging him to relinquish the publication , would be , that twenty or more booksellers could publish instead of one , and at a smaller expense than if they had purchased the copy ; and that a work which , from the nature of the title page , the expense of literary property , hot-press , and copperplate engravings , would have been found only in the libraries of the wealthy or the scientific , is now inundating London in every variety of cheap dress and embel-. lishment , which the experienced typographers of that metropolis can devise ; and that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hundreds of obscure book-stalV* , and hawked at the corners of the streets in sixpenny numbers . Leaving , however , the further consideration of this matter to those whom it may concern , we proceed to remark upon the opinion that has excited so much attention and so much hostility against Mr Lawrence , namely , that the notion of an immaterial soul is opposed to the evidence of anatomy and physiology . This conclusion , with certain corollaries which he chooses to draw from it , must , be acknowledged to be somewhat uncomfortable , and would be still more so , if we did not recollect that some honest and learned men have in times past been led by mistaken reasoning to believe and teach the doctrine of materialism , without doing so much injury as might have been expected either to themselves or their neighbors ; just as philosophers // have demonstrated again and again , that free agency is imposs*bIe , while they and all they world continue to act according to their inclinations . We may be permitted to regret that our author had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cau*se and Effect , which he quotes in terms of high approbation , since his reasoning might possibly have thus been freed from occasional confusion , and partaken less of that character , which is best described by the epithet rambling . As it is , we are pleased that he has alluded to it in the manner above-mentioned , as we are thus enabled to take the principles laid down in that work , which our readers may remember we had occasion to review in a former number , as mutually acknowledged . A cause , then , being that which immediately precedes any change , and which , existing at any time in similar circumstances , has been always and will be always immediately followed by a similar change , ' it was incumbent upon Mr Lawrence to show that similar organization in similar circumstances always produces similar phenomena , and conversely , that vast disparity of intellect is always accompanied by proportional difference in the organs , of which he assumes that the mental processes are functions . Demonstration in cases of this kind is hardly to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that similar , or nearly similar organization is accompanied with immense difference of intellect , it must be allowed to be probable , that the manifestations of mind are not the immediate consequents or effects of such organization , but of some intermediate link ; and this probability will be stronger , in proportion as such instances are more numerous . The probability of something existing beyond our ken ' is all that is necessary for our present purpose , and that no such probability , but the contrary , results from anatomical and physiological inquiries , is the position which our author endeavours to maintain ; and in support of it the general doctrine of the correspon* dence of the mental phenomena with material arrangement is considered in three several points of view . The first regards the same individual of the human race at different periods of his existence . Our author expresses himself thus : These organs ' ( those within the skull ) begin to be exercisas soon as the child is born ; and a faint glimmering of mind // is dimly perceived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as weak and infantile as the body . As the senses acquire their powers and the cerebral jelly becomes firmer , the mind gradually strengthens , slowly advances with the body , through childhood to puberty , and becomes adult when the development of the frame is complete ; it is , moreover , male or female according to the sex of the body . In the perfect period of organization , the mind is seen in the plenitude of its powers ; but this state of full vigor is short in duration , both for the intellect and the corporeal fabric . The wear and tear of the latter is evidenced in its mental movements ; with the decline of organization , the mind decays ; it becomes decrepit with the body ; and both are at the same time extinguislied by death . What do we infer from this succession of phenomena ? the existence and action of a principle entirely distinct from body ; or a close analogy to the history of all other functions ? ' p. 94 . Where then shall we find proofs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mind , which , like the corporeal frame , is infantile in the child , manly in the adult , sick or debilitated in disease , phrensied or melancboly in the madman , enfeebled ' in the decline of life , doting in decrepitude , and annihilated by death . Take away from the mind of man , or from that of any other animal , the operations of the five external senses and the functions of the brain , and what will be left behind ? ' p. 6 . This view our readers will immediately perceive to be simimr to that in which this subject was regarded by Dr Priestley and other materialists . We do not perceive that Mr Lawrence has added any thing important to the arguments produced by those writers . The extracts we have given are pretty fair specimens of his mode of reasoning , which we conceive to be not likely to carry with it such irresistible force as he seems to expect . The passage in Italics we consider a remarkable assertion , if intended , as it must be , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any exact definition of a male mind , but are humbly of opinion that such females as Boadicea , Margaret of Anjou , *and others , or within our own knowledge a revolutionary heroine , now we believe on the pension list of the United States , were actually in possession of an article of that description ; and that the renowned Chevalier D'Eon , during his or her life , might have puzzled our confident physiologist quite as much as the said Chevalier 's contemporaries , and bid defiance to the most approved mode of craniological examination . // Moreover , it would have been as well , if our author had informed us whether the cerebral jelly became softer again as the mind returned to second childhood ; a point which , the fact being otherwise , he does not think it necessary to settle . To the question in the last paragraph of the extracts , we are ready to reply , whenever Mr Lawrence can satisfy us what the functions of the brain are , without begging the question in dispute , or relinquishing his favorite doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the several arguments , or assertions under this head . They prove sufficiently what was never doubted , that the varieties of organization , whether original or accidental , exert a powerful influence upon the mental phenomena ; but the point which they are supposed to prove , namely , that these phenomena are the result of material arrangement , is wholly incompatible with the mental identity of individuals . We hoki with Dr Brown , that the belief of one 's personal or mental identity is one of those impressions , which , being universal , immediate , and irresistible , ' are antecedent to and beyond the influence of any process of reasoning ; that the fact of this identity is one of which we have as good evidence as we can have of any thing that we know ; that all mankind believe this because they can not help it ; and that , since it is thus certain that the mind of any individual continues the same , whether his cerebral jelly be hard or soft , shooting out into fungi , distended and macerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , by the natural processes of absorption and nutrition , disintegrated and repaired like the bark of the Argonauts till no part of the original composition remains ; this cerebral jelly is not the mind , but the nidus , or , to pursue the metaphor , the bark that bears and is nobler being . , * directed by a We leave this old and beaten field of controversy , to proceed to the arguments drawn from the various minds and dis . similar structure of different individuals , or races of mankind . To enable such of our readers , as are unacquainted with anatomy , to appreciate the force of these , we premise that all such brains are , in a general view , alike in the formation of the whole or of any particular portion . Except in a comparatively small number of cases of monstrous formation , or alteration by disease , it is not pretended that any part or process is dif // ferent in different individuals , any otherwise than in point of telat ye size , nor that the relative size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the relative power or excellence of any particular faculty . This last position , indeed , is supported by Doctors Gall and Spurzheim , but of the doubtful authority of these writers , we shall speak hereafter ; it is sufficient for our present purpose that our author does not found any argument upon their supposed discoveries , but speaks of them , as resting hitherto upon their authority alone . The only difference , which he depends upon in this division of his subject , is the greater or less development of the cerebral hemispheres . Which development , as it relates only to the form of the upper part of the brain , we may illustrate by observing , that the upper outline of the profile of a skull , in which the hemispheres are most developed , will be more rounded upwards than that of any other , and that a high and upright forehead and rounded skull indicate great devel .. opment , whilst a low , retreating forehead and flat skull are evidences of the contrary . Nothing more , therefore , is meant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our author , than that an individual of high intellectual powers has a larger head , in proportion to the face , than one of inferior capacity . That this is not universally true , any man may satisfy himself by examining the heads of his acquaintance ; indeed it seems too obvious to require any other evidence than the most common observation ; and the following quotations may seem to many of our readers altogether superfluous . The exceptions to this general rule , that men of most genius have the largest head , have been so numerous , that many have doubted its truth . ' - Richerand 's Physiology . Opportunities have been afforded me of examining the brain in a considerable number of persons of high standing in our country , and such as were remarkable for talents . In some instances it has appeared that a large brain had been connected with superior mental powers ; in about as great number , the reverse ; and one individual , most distinguished for the variety and extent of native talent , had an uncommonly small brain.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the difference in this particular between males and females , very acute anatomists have been unable to detect any . Soemmering , however , asserts , that the head in women // is larger and the brain heavier than in men , but as the individuals were of equal size , it is evident that he was comparing the brain of a tall woman with that of a short man ; not to mention that the consequence of this sort of difference , according to Mr Lawrence 's theory , would be rather unpal*atable , and one to which we should not be desirous , for obvious reasons , to give currency . We take *ccasion here to express our annoyance at the frequent recurrence of the words develop , ' and ' development , ' in this work . We believe these terms were introduced into fashion by Dr Gall and his disciples ; they may occasionally be useful , but to meet them at every turn , when simpler terms are equally eligible , is really distressing . We can assure Mr Lawrence and some other modern writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal is long , or his teeth large , would be quite as intelligible and a great deal more agreeable , than to say that these appendages were more developed . We come next to the consideration of a subject , which occupies a large portion of the lectures , and which , considered in all its bearings , is one of the most curious and interesting in the natural history of man . We mean the different families or races of mankind . Blumenbach , who is universally admitted to be the first authority on this subject , proposed to arrange the several tribes of our species under five great divisions or varieties ; viz , the Caucasian , or white variety , supposed to have originated near Mount Caucasus , and comprehending the Georgians , Circassians , Turks , Jews , Arabians , Moors , Greeks , and the European nations generally ; the Mongolian , or olive , comprehending most of the Asiatics ; the Calmucs , Chinese , Japanese , Hindoos , Laplanders and other inhabitants of the hyperborean regions ; the . dfrican , Ethiopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except those already mentioned as belonging to the white variety ; the . flmerican , or red , containing the greater part of the inhabitants of our continent ; and the Malay , island , or tawny race , who inhabit the islands of the Pacific , Southern , and Asiatic oceans . Of these , the Caucasian ranks highest , according to Mr Lawrence , in the scale of intellect ; next to this on the one hand , if we understand him , comes the Malay , and on the other the American ; to the former succeeds the Mongolian , and to the latter the Ethiopian ; the original or white // race deviating thus into the two extremes of inferior capacity . We are not certain however that is a correct representation of his opinion , as there is much obscurity and some inconsistency in his representations of this matter . Thus , at page 476 , he observes , that the Malay comes in between the Caucasian and Ethiopian , ' but at page 431 , that of the dark-colored races none approach more nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Amidst the variety of discussions , which ari*e from the consideration of these different races we are continually meeting with inferences in support of the favorite doctrine , and one whole chapter , on the differences of their moral and intellectual qualities , ' is entirely devoted to it . We refrain at present from any extracts , but shall state only the general argument , which is , that the white are , and always have been superior to the dark races in mental improvement and the arts of civilization . The full consideration of this argument would require a volume , and as our author excuses himself from entering into it more minutely , from want of the necessary information , as well as the limited length of his lectures , ' we shall , for similar reasons , decline the task , and with the less reluctance , as it seems impossible in the present state of our knowledge , or perhaps ever , to determine the degree of influence which is exerted on the mind by the circumstances of government , soil , climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The instances of China , Peru , Mexico , Hayti , and in our own country the Cherokee nation , are sufficient to show that the dark races are susceptible of improvement , and that , in as favorable circumstances , they could not advance as far as the whites , is an assumption which is opposed to the analogy of individuals of those races . A striking instance of the great influence of government and peculiar form of society in opposition to Caucasian formation is afforde&amp;by the clans of the Scottish Highlands , many of whom were , within the memory of individuals now living , in a state of the most deplorable ignorance and barbarism , nearly resembling that of some of the savage tribes of our own country , and this too while they were scarcely a day 's march from four universities . It is granted that there are all varieties of form in the skulls of different individuals of the same race , and that the peculiaY // characteristics of this part in all the varieties run into each other by such imperceptible gradations , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely possible to decide with certainty , to which of the five , each and every individual had belonged ; and this difficulty can not be better illustrated , than by the fact that Mr Lawrence , at page 307 , ventures to dispute the opinion of such a veteran gauger of skulls , as Camper , in relation to a. particular individual which the latter considered a Mongolian and the former assures us is an Ethiopian ; the two extremes of Variation . Certain tribes of the dark families increase the natural and congenital flatness of the skull by artificial means ; but it does not appear that any deterioration of mind is thus prod9ced . We have the evidence of Lewis and Clarke to the contrar*y , in their account of the flat heads of the Columbia river ; of Dr Warren in that of a boy from the Queen Charlotte islands , and of Mr Lawrence himself in his remarks upon a Carib skull from the island of St Vincents , which had undergone this process . This . individual had been chief of the Red Caribs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intel .. ligent , well-informed , and prudent character . ' p. 324 . We think his inch of brain , ' if it was in the right , ' was certainly not in the usual place . Further , it is not pretended that those individuals of the black races , who have at any time distinguished themselves by evidences of great natural powers of mind , had skulls of a Caucasian formation . On the contrary , two at least of the four individuals selected as specimens of the several black races , are noticed as having given evidence of considerable Intellectual vigor , one especially , J. J. E. Capitein , an African , wrote sermons , poems , and a Latin book , which went rapidly through four editions , and that , we assure Mr Lawrence , is what many a good Caucasian head would find a very difficult matter . Such instances are incompatible with the doctrine we are opposing ; exceptions which , instead of strength. * ening , destroy the rule . The third point of view in which the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to The whole animal creation . // The mind of the negro and Hottentot , the Calmuc and Carib , is inferior to that of the European , and their organization is also less perfect . The gradation of organization and of mind passes through the monkey , dog , elephant , and horse to other quadrupeds ; thence to birds , reptiles , and fishes , and so on to the lowest links of the animal chain . In ascending these steps of one ladder , where shall we find the boundary of unassisted organization ? where place the beginning of the immaterial adjunct ? in that view that assimilates the functions of the brain to those of other organic parts , this case has no difficulty . p. 95 . We see some ( animals ) sagacious and docile , capable of instruction , exhibiting mental phenomena analogous to our own ;  --  the germs or imperfect state , of what when more develo ed is human intellect . ' p. 41. p But is this a fair statement ? is there any such gradation except in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dog Diamond only in degree ? Compare one of the lowest in the scale of humanity , according to Mr Lawrence , a deaf and dumb Mongolian child , with the Chimpanzee or the Man of the Woods ; will he pretend that the Abbe Sicard could teach the latter to read and write , to communicate abstract ideas by signs , give him the notion of a Deity , or the moral relations ? Can one conceive of any possible process by which such development could he accomplished ? The beaver and the bee want neither schools nor col*leges to teach them to construct ramparts or geometrical cells , Whose adaptation to their purposes excite our admiration ; but in these things they neither deteriorate nor improve ; there is no gradation , no apprenticeship ; the cells of a new swarm are as perfectly hexagonal as those of the most veteran inhabitant of the hive ; and all are the effect of a blind instinct , or rather of a single and overruling mind , of which these forms of matter are but the instruments  --  the puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires are too delicate to be detected . But the essential differences between the displays of instinct and of mind are too obvious to require further illustration* Nothing seems to us clearer than that this doctrine of gradation , however plausible in the general , can never stand the test of individual comparison . We shall only add the words of our author , in another part of his work : // Man stands alone : his faculties , and what he has effected by them , place him at a wide interval from all animals . ' p. 204 . ; The points of difference between the Negro and the European do not affect those important characters , which separate man in general from the animal world ; the erect attitude , the two hands , the slow development of the body , the use of reasOn and consequent perfectibility , are attributes common to both . ' p. 484 . There is then a wide gap in the scale ; a difference , not in degree only , but in kind , between the mental phenomena in man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident , that the vulgar never confound them . None but a philosopher mistakes a man , however humble his intellect , for an improved variety of monkey , or thinks of searching for the vestiges of a tail . We are next therefore to inquire , if there is a corresponding vacancy in the chain of organization ; any striking or uniform difference , or any organs , or parts of organs , enjoyed by man , which are not common to him and the four-handed or four-footed tribes ; and since the brain is the organ of which the intellectual phenomena are supposed to be functions , it is here that we are to seek for this difference . In spite of metaphysical subtlety , of all the chimeras and fancies about immaterial agencies , etherial fluids , and the like ; and all the real or pretended alarms so carefully connected with this subject , the truth , that the phenomena of mind are to be regarded physiologically , merely as the functions of the organic apparatus contained in the head , is proved by such overwhelming evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this examination and the great similarity between the brain of man and that of the higher orders of animals , even from our author 's own account of the matter , seems to us so decidedly unfavorable to his position , that we can not help suspecting that in this point ' his wish was father to his thought . ' It is found that the human brain has no part , which is not present in some animal ; that it is not specifically larger , nor larger in proportion to the body , than that of all other animals ; the elephant excels us in the first respect , and several birds , beasts , and even fish , in the latter . The only differ* ences , which the comparative anatomist has hitherto been able to discover , are , that the human brain has its upper outline more rounded upwards , the convolutions of its surface somewhat deeper , and the bulk of the whole greater in proportion // to the size of the nerves that issue from it . With respect to these differences , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates of the skull and brain of the orang-utang , in the work of Dr Tyson , the best authority on this subject , with those of the same parts of the human structure in any anatomical work , will be satisfied that they are of more magnitude and importance to the theorist , than the sincere inquirer after truth ; and the following comments of Tyson himself , who had no hypothesis to support , may satisfy those of our readers , who have less curiosity , that they are neither prodigious , ' wonderful , ' nor even very obvious . From what is generally received , viz , that the brain is reputed the more immediate seat of the soul itself ; one would be apt to think , that since there is so great a disparity betwixt the soul of a man , and a brute , the organ likewise , in which it is placed , should be very different too . Yet by comparing the brain of our pygmie , with that of a man ; and with the greatest exactness observing each part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great a resemblance of the one to the other , that nothing could be more . So that when I am describing the brain of our pygmie , you may justly suspect I am describing that of a man , or may think I might very well omit it wholly , by referring you to the accounts already given of the anatomy of a humane brain , for that will indifferently serve for our pygmie , ' &amp;c . Again , The anfractus ( convolutions ) of the cerebrum were alike , as also the substantia corticalis and medullaris . On the basis of the brain , we may view all the ten pairs of nerves exactly situated and placed as in a human brain ; nor did I find their originations different , or any particularity that was so . ' Tyson 's . /lnatomy of a Pygrnie . We have chosen to take the comparison of the human brain , with that of the orang-utang , as a strong illustration of the futility of Mr Lawrence 's argument . We might go on to show , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of fishes , are marked by a resemblance to that of man , which is surprising to those , who have regafded the latter only as the remote cause of the mental phenomena ; and which is any thing but hostile to the doctrine , which supposes the existence of some cause of these phenomena , other than any material arrangement . But we consider this illustration sufficient for our present purpose , leaving our readers to decide whether it is philosophical or natural to conclude that those // faculties , which place their possessor but a little lower than the angels , ' are but the active state of organs , which he has so nearly in common with orang-utangs , pongos , monkeys , and the rest of the tribe of disgusting caricatures of the human species . But the first of these differences , the development of the cerebral hemispheres , ' and consequent upward rounding of the skull , is the same in kind and not very different in degree , whether we compare the Ethiopian with the Caucasian , or the orang-utang with the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect is less in the latter case . But the abominable inference , which has sometimes been drawn from this resemblance , is resisted by our author with laudable energy . I do not hesitate to assert , that the notion of specific identity between the African and orang-utang , is as false , philosophically , as the moral and political consequences to which it would lead are shocking and detestable. ' p. 108 . But why is this notion so absurd ? because the Negro is gifted with the use of reason and consequent perfectibility . ' The gradation of mind , then , in this part of the chain , is interrupted while that of organization is regular ; on the other hand , comparative anatomy teaches us , that of all the mainmalia , the ape and monkey tribes alone possess in common with man the posterior lobes of the cerebrum . Here the gradation of organization is in its turn interrupted , without being accompanied by any corresponding interval in that of mind . For if we allow the properties of mind to exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will hardly be pretended that the beaver , the dog , or the half reasoning elephant , are very remarkably inferior in the display of them , to the above*. mentioned antic generations . With respect to the second point of difference , we observe , that the convolutions of the brain are to be found in the hog , whilst they are entirely wanting in an animal , whose shrewdness is almost proverbial , we mean the common rat . The third circumstance , the larger size of the human brain in proportion to the nerves that issue from it , we consider first as a sort of forlorn hope . it was long asserted that the human brain was absolutely the largest ; then that it was so in propor // tion to the body ; then that it was so , when compared with the cerebellum or medulla oblongata ; but to all these were produced exceptions . The comparison with its nerves was at last resorted to as the only tenable point . But this statement of the dB " ' erence is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves of animals are , in general , larger than human nerves in proportion to their brains , and this might have been expected a priori in conformity with the general rule ; that every organ is more extensive , as the function which it serves is more perfectly executed . Thus the muscles of animals , being proportionally more active than those of man , the nerves going to the muscles should be larger , and this is well illustrated in the large nerves of motion in the carnivorous animals . The senses also in animals are generally more perfect than in man , and the nerves larger . When this is not the case , they are proportionally small , as in the whale tribe , where the blowing holes occupy the place of the nose , the olfactory nerves are so small that their existence has been denied by great authorities in comparative anatomy ; and the optic nerves of the mole are about the size of hairs and can not be traced to the eyes . The nerves being the conductors of external impression to the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the skin , muscles , &amp;c. we should expect them to be large where sensibility is great and motion quick , and this appears a sufficient explanation of the fact which Mr Lawrence produces in support of his theory , viz , that the nerves are , in the foetus and child , proportionally larger than in the adult . It may be asserted , though it can hardly be proved , that the foetus has not great seusibility , because it would be unnecessary . But allowing this to be the truth , it may be replied that , as it would be manifestly contrary to all analogy to suppose , that these nerves are in a few hours , or even minutes , increased , or as our author would say , developed , to the size in which they appear in the child , we must conclude that they are prepared beforehand for the offices , which they are so soon to be called on to perform . Finally , the importance of this proportion between the brain and nerves , depends ' upon an assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brain for the execution of its office  --  a datum by no means self-evident . ' u. 169 . We pass over those pretended cerebral differences , which our // 1823.1 Lawrence 's Lectures . author either alludes to , without specifying , or acknowledges to be untenable , to notice the argument drawn from the difficulty of explaining the manner and time of the connexion of an immaterial soul with the body . As this argument is an old one , and derives no additional force from anatomy or physiology , it is unnecessary to notice it farther than to observe that the difficulty is none of our making ; that , finding no material arrangement which , according to the premised definition , can be considered the immediate cause of the mental phenomena , we conclude that this cause is not material . This conclusion can not be affected by our inability to explain the manner in which a cause , of which we profess to know nothing but the effects , should produce those effects . To such sneers as the question whether the brain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the etherial lodger , ' the reply is , we are ignorant , and what is more disagreeable , are . pretty certain to continue so . That the soul is only known to us by bodily manifestations is an argument of as little force ; it seems impossible , from the nature of the case , that it should be otherwise with the souls of others , to which alone the objection applies . On the whole , we are*of opinion that Mr Lawrence has adopted an hypothesis from certain general views , which is by no means confirmed by a closer investigation , and that the existence of a cause of the phenomena of mind , distinct from mere matter , so far from deriving its only support from revelation and the general belief of mankind , as our author insinuates , and being opposed to , or differing from the opinion we should derive from the study of anatomy and physiology , will be continually strengthened by our increasing acquaintance with those sciences . Another subject which we think proper to notice , is the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing in its signification the ideas of all those circumstances which are peculiar to one of the two great divisions of sensible objects . There is none exactly opposed to it , unless we may be allowed the use of such an one as inanimation ; death not being sufficiently comprehensive , since it is commonly applied to beings , which have at some time displayed the phenomena of life , It is evident , therefore , that the term will mean more or // less , according to circumstances . Thus , in common conversation , we include in it only a few obvious qualities of the being spoken of , as motion , warmth , respiration &amp;c. if an animal , or verdure , succulence , &amp;c. if a tree or shrub* in a physiological view , it includes many more particulars , such as growth by nutrition , coexistence of solids and fluids , opposition to chemical affinities , &amp;c. or the possession and integrity of organs adapted to those purposes , in other words , organization . When we say that any being has life , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is organized . Organization , therefore , is the invariable antecedent of the living phenomena , and whether such organization be more or less perfect or extensive in one being than in another is of no consequence ; the fact , that it is organized , is sufficient to place it in the class of animated beings . To interpose any thing between these circumstances , organization and living phenomena , is unphilosophical , because it is unnecessary . The arciteus , the materia vite d*fJitsa , the spirit of animation , all these may be realities ; we can not prove the contrary ; but we do not know that they are so and see no reason for supposing it gratuitously , when their existence , if granted , evidently adds nothing to the sum of our knowledge , beyond the single fact . It explains nothing and removes no difficulty . We therefore cordially agree with Mr Lawrence , that such fancies are useless , and worse than useless ; that each in its turn has been the ignisfatuus , that has plunged its deluded followers in the mire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost the world and been content to lose it ; that they have obscured the records of science with vain imaginations , and rendered the study of many a voluminous author equally profitable with the labor of him , who seeks for two grains of wheat in two bushels of chaff ; and we trust that the period is not far distant , when these opprobria of science , and particularly of medicine , shall rest forever with the substantial forms , the entities apd quiddities of our fathers . A consequence of our author 's notions respecting the mind , is an occasional confusion of the ideas of this and of life . This is *n one instance shown by an improper attempt at ridicule . Speaking of the hydra , or fresh-water polypus , each part of which , when cut in two , becomes a perfect animal , he asks , ? if the soul can thus be divided with a knife ? ' // In the commencement of the inquiry , whether all the varieties of the human family are probably descended from the same or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquisition will perhaps be deemed superfluous by those who regard the Hebrew Scriptures as writings composed by the divine inspiration &amp;c. ' - ' But the entire or even partial inspiration of the various writings comprehended in the Old Testament is doubted by many persons &amp;c. ' p. 215. with several others of a similar nature , and a sufficiency of biblical criticism in the notes to this chapter . Now the result of this inquiry being entirely consonant to the account given in the scriptures , namely , that the whole human race did derive their origin from a single pair ; this discussion of the inspiration of the sacred writings was unnecessary , and so far reprehensible , as it was likely to give offence to many readers . We were reminded by it of an opinion expressed towards the beginning of the work , namely ; that Divinity and morals however excellent in their time and place , do not exactly suit the theatre , audience , or subjects of these lectures . ' p. 8 . As some of our readers may be curious to know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in support of the belief that all men have descended from the same stack , a position which , at first view , seems improbable , and the more so , to those who believe , with our author , that differences produced by climate and other external circumstances are confined to the individual , we shall endeavour to give a concise account of it . Any number of animals , that are characterized by the same fixed and definite external forms and constant and permanent difference from all others , are considered as belonging to the same species ; but this notion of species admits of some variations in individuals . These in wild animals are commonly slight , being confined to differences of texture and color of the fur , length of the mane , tusks , &amp;c . In domesticated animals they are much more numerous and important , and by the contrivance of man are perpetuated , varied , and aggravated , till the original stock becomes doubtful , as is remarkably th' case with the dog . // What amount and kind of difference may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific difference . has been frequently a question , and several tests of identity of species have been proposed , but have been found insufficient , and that particularly when applied to domesticated animals , where their assistance is most needed . Analogy and probability , therefore , can only be depended upon in determining questions of this kind , and the rule proposed by Blumenbach seems to be the best , namely ; that when we find the difference between individuals , that agree in general , to be not greater than we know to be sometimes produced by accidental circumstances , it should be considered as denoting only a variety of the same species . Man is eminently a domesticated animal and exposed in the greatest degree to the various effects of such a mode of existence , and among others to variations in the appearance and structure of individuals . When , therefore , we find , as may be sufficiently proved , that there is no point of difference between the several races of mankind , which has not been found to arise , in at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety , from the usual causes of degeneration , ' ( p. 232 , ) it is conformable to the rule to presume that these races are but varieties of one species , the original characters of which are generally supposed to be present in the most perfect individuals of the Caucasian formation . This presumption will be strengthened by the accounts of Albinos , porcupine men , an6 families with six fingers on one hand ; since there can not be the small- ' est doubt , that if it were possible and allowable to practise with such persons the same expedients , as are employed with the common domestic animals , varieties might be produced , which , in point of difference from the Caucasian formation , should vastly exceed those of which we have any knowledge . Mankind then , being all of one species , may have descended from a single pair ; and since nature does jiothing in vain , it is the part of philosophy to believe that they did so . Though the general tone and manner of the Reply to the charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr Lawrence , that he was provoked by the harshness of the attack , and tempted by the feebleness of the reasoning in many parts of it . Weak and unphilosophical , however , as many of Mr Abernethy 's arguments were , we think the charge of // having propagated opinions detrimental to society , ' is not suffi-. sufficiently disproved , or rather that good ground for it may be found in these lectures . The doctrine of materialism we believe to be such an opinion , since it leads to conclusions which are incompatible with peace and good order , to say nothing worse of them . It is true that our author asserts only that this doctrine is true , physiologically , or that it is the result which we arrive at from the study of physiology and anatomy only ; hut this , if it were the fact , would he a powerful argument for the truth of materialism , considered in any other light , as well as in a physiological one ; and he should not have adopted a position likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its probability and possible influence . We agree , however , with Mr Lawrence , though for different reasons , that a greater outcry has been raised against him , than was at all necessary . We can assure those who tremble at the prospect of the final accomplishment of his grand purpose , the complete emancipation of the mind , the destruction of all creeds and articles of faith , and the establishment of full opinion and belief , ' that there is not the smallest danger that it will ever be accomplished . It implies a revolution , not in external circumstances only , but in the very nature of man , which will be effected when all mankind are wise and good ,  --  and not till then . We are sorry to observe , at p. 78-9 , a sneer at an opinion of Mr John Hunter . For obvious reasons we do not extract it ; but our physiological readers , who may choose to consult the work will perceive that it is founded on a misrepresentation of Mr Hunter 's reasoning , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to in the latter part of the paragraph , strengthens instead of weakening that reasoning , since the hepatic ducts , though they may , and frequently do , enter the intestine separately from the cystic , yet in such cases always communicate by *branches with the gallbladder itself , a parallel to which will not be pretended to exist in the other case . We hinted above our opinion of the doubtful authority of Gall and Spurzheim ; in proof of this , we shall borrow the notice of two mistakes respecting important organs , from Dr Warren 's late work on the Sensorial and Nervous Systems . These authors say , that the organ of courage resides in the // space behind and between the ears , and that courageous animals have the head between and behind the ears large . ' This is probably founded on a hasty examination of powerful animals , such as the lion , whose head in this part is really broad , on account of the large muscles which cover it . When these are stript off , the skull is seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ of amativeness is in no way remarkable in the baboon , the most extraordinary of all animals for this propensity . Lastly , when Dr Spurzheim , at his lectures in Edinburgh , was several times publicly defied , by the late learned Dr Gordon , to demonstrate some pretended discoveries respecting the course and origin of the nerves , he was unable to return any satisfactory reply . Our limits will only permit us to remark upon two more passages in this work . We have known many good and pious people , who are sceptical in regard to the expediency of sending missionaries to the Hindoos ; but the objection brought against this practice by our author , will probably be as surprising to them , as we acknowledge it was to us . The retreating forehead and the depressed vertex of the dark varieties of man make me strongly doubt , whether they are susceptible of these high destinies ; whether they are capable of fathoming the depths of science ; of understanding and appreciating the mysteries of our religion . ' p. 433 . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Egyptians belonged to the Caucasian variety . Can we deem it possible that Homer , Lycurgus , Solon , Pythagoras , and Plato , should have resorted to Egypt to study the sciences , religion , and laws , discovered and framed by men with black skin , woolly hair , and slanting forehead ? ' p. 294 . In concluding our remarks upon these lectures , we can not help observing , that , besides those advantages of a divine revelation which are common to all christian* , two classes of philosophers , we speak with reverence , have some peculiar ones ; since the materialists find in the sacred scriptures the only evidence of the existence of their souls , and the Malebranchist* , f their bodies .
