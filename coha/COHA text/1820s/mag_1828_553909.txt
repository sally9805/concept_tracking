txt ART . IV. - Hope Leslie ; or Early Times in . Miassachusetts . By the Author of Redwood . ' 2 vols. l2mo . New York . 1827 . WE hold it to be a fortunate thing for any country , that a portion of its literature should fall into the hands of the female sex ; because their influence , in any walk of letters , is almost sure to be powerful and good . This influence appears to us to be so peculiar in its nature , and so important in its action , that we venture to demand the attention of our readers to some remarks upon it , however unworthy of the subject our exposi* tion may be . To speak first of the influence of female literature on females themselves , we presume that the mere fact of the existence of such a literature produces a very sensible effect on the mental character of those , whom , if it were only for gallantry 's sake , we must call the best part of our race . A woman feels a laudable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an intellectual career ; has won a prize in the competition of mind ; has vindicated for her sex that equality with the other , , which has been both doubted and denied . Her success is an argument which can be wielded at pleasure , and doubtless with * We make this remark , notwithstanding the effect , which the letter k is said , on page 890 , to have upon the adjectives . We incline to think , that the translation there is too free to give a just notion of the idiomatic form of the language . // pleasure , against all who would underrate feminine capacity . And it is something more and better than an argument . It is a stimulus ; acting on the generous ambition of the whole sex ; prompting all to an exertion of their highest faculties ; inducing a general disposition to read , to study , to think ; making something desirable beside personal attraction , and something enviable , which shall last longer , and be more attainable , than beauty . The objects of pursuit will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce self-respect , and self-respect will lead to improvement . Nor will this be the end . Woman , at the same time that she is thus raised in her own estimation , will be necessarily lifted up in the good opinion of man . He will acknowledge her claims on his respect , for the sake of the proofs she has offered of her spiritual endowments ; and his behavior will tell her that he regards her neither as the queen nor the plaything of an hour , but as the real companion of his life . Then look at the happy light of this sentiment , as it is reflected back on the man . How much his own worth is increased , by the better opinions and more respectful feelings which he is obliged to entertain towards woman , and by the deportment and conduct which will be the natural result of those opinions and feelings . How much more estimable , useful , enlightened , he is like to be with an accomplished fellow creature , than with a brainless idol in his house and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according as be is united to a companion , or tied to a plaything . And who perceives not that the influence of woman , thus stimulated and directed , extends yet further , and acts on another generation ; on the future men and the future women who are now infants under her care ? Who can estimate the power of a mother over the mind of her offspring ; and who will say , that this power will not be exerted , with far happier prospects and probable consequences , if she is capable of becoming the instructer , than if she is only the nurse of her child ? If we have reasoned justly , it follows that the successful literary efforts of a few females , have a direct tendency to raise the whole mass of human intellect , in a manner , and to a degree , which could not otherwise be accomplished , and which are not to be estimated by common rules of calculation . That some bad consequences may follow a sudden taste or fashion for literature , is neither to be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make themselves exceedingly troublesome to their acquaintance by the annoying perseverance of their high discourse at all times and tides ; that a few more may prove too often and too glaringly how little good their reading has done them , by the questions they ask and the answers they give ; and that a very few indeed may culpably and ruinously neglect their domestic duties for the circulating library or the goose-quill , are matters of undoubted fact and sad experience ; but in a general view of the subject , their importance is inconsiderable . They are hardly worth an estimation , when we are weighing the quantity of good with which they come mixed up , the unavoidable refuse and dust . Who will be so uncourteous and illnatured as to refuse to make for them a due allowance ? Who so perverse as to prefer a stupid and stationary ignorance without these evils , to a state of diffused cultivation and intelligence with them ? Will any one forego all the advantages which must necessarily accrue to himself and society , from the intellectual improvement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mothers , merely through the fear of a little pedantry or pretension ? And is pretension confined to one sex alone ? Are there no male pretenders ? Are all the smatterers and idlers in literature , women ? Not if our ears have given us a true report of the matter . Listen to a bean and a belle discussing one of Sir Walter 's novels , or mayhap some graver book or subject , during a morning call , or the pauses of a cotillion ; and you will find , where both parties are not on a melancholy equality , that , half the time at least , the advantage in judgment , discrimination , taste , and pertinent remark , will be on the side of the fair one . Throw us into promiscuous society anywhere , and for an hour 's literary talk we are quite willing to take our chance with the ladies . The truth is , that wherever literature is at all in vogue , there will be literary pretenders and literary nothings ; but the gentlemen will furnish a full quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of female literature , but only of its existence ; for its existence alone , whatever may be its character and objects , is capable of exerting , and does exert , all the influences which have already been noticed . A Carter and a Dacier may exalt the whole mental standard of the sex , to which they belong , although few or none of those who feel the honor of their celebrity may be able to enter into their studies , and examine the grounds of their re // putation as classical scholars . It is enough that their merit is allowed and respected ; enough that their fame is shared with their sex , that emulation is kindled , and that attention is directed to intellectual acquisitions , employments , and pleasures . But when . the impetus has been given , and the noble pride of mind is brought into action when an authoress is no longer a rarity , and many a titlepage has borne a female name , it will then appear , that female literature has its proper walks that it is peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will appear , too , that these walks are exactly those in which the greatest moral power may manifest and most directly exert itself . Into the paths of abstruse learning , few of the sex will bend their steps . Their situation , habits , and feelings lead them not there . They will he found in greener and more pleasant places , whither their own inclinations and capabilities will most naturally conduct them , and where their enchantmeats will exercise the most potent sway . A single glance at the library of female writers , which , by the way , is now a large as yell as a respectable one , will satisfy us , that it comprises two main divisions ; the instruction of youth , and what is called , though in some respects improperly and unjustly , the lighter kinds of literature . Books for the nursery and the school will occupy a conspicuous station on one side , while on the other we shall see novels , tales , essays , and poetry . And if we were asked to point out those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active on the manners , principles , and tastes , mental and moral , of a community , we think that these are precisely the kinds which we should name . The power which well adapted books may exert on the minds of children , can hardly be stated in extravagant terms , and will be allowed by every one to be great . And when we consider further , that early impressions , though often weakened , are seldom entirely erased ; that good seed on good ground affords an abundant return at the harvest time ; that the child is father of the man ; ' that a strong direction once given is long , and , in a majority of cases , always retained ; and , to put the subject in one other point of view , when we consider that the mother 's influence , which , next to the influence of Heaven itself , is the best and dearest and most heavenly , and has been the most frequently and gratefully acknowiedged by its objects , may be so effectually aided in its // operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores of auxiliary instruction and entertainment which are placed at her disposal , in judicious books for children , we shall regard such books not with pleasure alone , but with respect ; we shall esteem it no act of condescension in ourselves , in any one , to turn over their pages ; we shall perceive more solid instruction , more beauty , truth , power , in many a little work stitched up in colored paper , bearing a simple wood cut on each side , and thrown about the nursery with as much freedom of dissemination as the most ardent republican could desires than in many a proud octavo , redolent of Russia , and tenacious of its standing on shelves of mahogany . Such being the importance of juvenile books , who are the best qualified to make them ? and who do make them ? To the first question we answer , Women . They are the best qualified to make books for children , who are most in the company of children ; who have almost the sole care of children ; whose natural sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as have never been mothers them selves ; who best know the minds , the wants , the hearts of children ; and whose tenderness and gentleness gracefully bend to the ignorance of children , and assimilate most easily and happily with their soft and confiding natures . The child , in its earlier years especially , has no guardian like woman , no friend like woman , and can therefore have no instructer like woman . And , when we come to answer the next question , Who have really devoted their best talents and most anxious care to the education of children ; who have written the best books for and about children ? we are thankful that we again can answer , Women . Thirty years ago ( if we had been in existence then ) , we could not have answered thus . We should have been compelled to say , There are no books for children ; these important members of the human family are destitute ; this immensely valuable , and infinitely fertile field lies neglected and runs to waste ; no seed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain has yet to be deposited ; the weeds are yet to be eradicated ; both man and wotnan pass it by , and take their labor to other places , and think not of redeeming it , nor know that by care and culture it may be made to blossom like the rose , and fill the earth with its fruits . This we should at that time have been *bliged to say . But now // we can say , that those whose part and province it was to do this work , have done it , and done it well . We can point to the names of Barbauld and Edgeworth , Taylor and Hoffland , and confidently ask , where there are worthier . Men talk of eras in literature . The era of the two first named of those ladies , the era of the Hymns for Children ' and the Parent 's Assistant , ' was a golden era , pure and bright , and full of riches , and deserving of a rank among the most glorious dates of improvement . Since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have worked well ; though we must still say , that those who came first worked best . Our own countrywomen have been neither tardy in advancing to this delightful task , nor inefficient in their services . We believe that the best children 's books which we have , and we have many which are excellent , are the composition of females ; and if we felt ourselves at liberty to do so , we could repeat an honorable , and by no means a scanty list of the names of those who have earned something better than mere reputation , by contributing to form the minds and hearts of our children . Those who are conscious that they belong to the catalogue , have little to ask of fame , and certainly nothing to receive from it half so valuable as that which they already possess , the gratulations of their own hearts . The department of juvenile literature , then , is almost entireJy in female hands . Long may it remain there ! Long , for the interests of virtue , and the improvement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to nurture the growth , and watch over and direct the early puttings forth of youthful intellect and feeling . While she retains the office , so delightful in itself , and so grave and momentous in its ends , and even adds to its beautiful dignity by the graceful and effectual manner in which she has hitherto performed its duties , she inspires us with an admiration of a deeper , and more lasting , and , we must also believe , more flattering character , than was the most glowing and romantic love of the days of chivalry . Talk not to us of chivalry , unless it be in poetry , and with the usual latitude and license of poetry . In truth , and in prose , the most refined devotion of knighthood and chivalry is no more to be compared , in purity and elevation , to the sei1timents which female excellence now commands , than are those fair ones who then presided at the great duels which we read of under the poetical name of tournaments , and who by their presence and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struggling beneath them , to be compared to the females of our own time , who , as beautiful , no doubt , and accomplished as they , find it their more appropriate privilege and pleasure to stimulate the fresh powers of childhood to the competitions of knowledge and virtue , and to hold out the meed of approbation to the exertions of innocent and ingenuous minds . To pass from this department of woman 's literary labors to the other , we come to a field , which , though she does not occupy It so exclusively , she occupies with honor , and in which she has done much good , and still may do more . It is a field , too , which , in common with the former , has been undervalued . We shall not stop to argue with those who contend that novels , and romances , poems and plays , should not be read . It is enough that people will read them as fast as they are written ; that beyond other kinds of literature , they are widely diffused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , if in no other , they are truly light ; for , like those seeds to which nature has given wings , they fly abroad with the four winds , rejoicing in their buoyancy , and disseminating themselves through every land . This lightness is of itself a vast advantage , and the true inquiry is , not whether the advantage shall be used , for that we can not help , but how it may be best used . As thistle down , and nettle seed are in full possession of it , we ought to turn our attention to those worthier plants , whose seeds are also winged , and favor their culture , and encourage their maturity . The interest , the natural , irrepressible interest , which the passions of men will always take in lively descriptions of passion ; the absorbing heed which their affections will render , while the world stands , to writings which address and excite them , should be turned to virtuous ends by all those who love virtue , to useful ends by all those who honor truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country or his kind , should rejoice whenever he sees those , who , with the magic wands of poesy and fiction and the potent spells of genius , might lead the spirits of men almost whither they would , and who yet would rather snap their wands asunder , and abjure their spells for ever , than wield them for a moment in league with the powers of darkness ; who would rather die , than lure men , by any charms of theirs , from the paths of uprightness and life . // The purity and the goodness of woman have here done their proper work . They are seen and felt in the elegant literature of the times . They have greatly contributed to chasten the morals of literature , and establish a code of laws , by which offences against decency are condemned as offences against taste . We would hazard the opinion , that to their absence the prevailing licentiousness of old English literature is in some degree to be ascribed . There were no female authors in those days when ribaldry was deemed essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing ; and when a novel was thought none the worse , perhaps all the better , for describing scenes , which we trust would now be the proscription of any book whatever . They have now come in , following the conduct of their own taste and peculiar powers , to try their skill in providing the intellectual entertainment of society ; and a chaster tone of public sentiment has been , in part , the consequence of the trial . We would not give an unreasonable share in the reformation to the influence of female literature ; but we have no doubt whatever , that the cooperation of that with other meliorating influences has been of the utmost importance to the final effect . How should it be otherwise ? Why should not the modesty and delicate feeling of woman refine and soften the character of society as much in her writings , as in her manners and conversation and life ? That some females seem to have forgotten their sex , and to have prided themselves on throwing off their peculiar qualities , and adopting the coarser habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But such eases are happily , and as we think , necessarily rare . The masquerade is out of nature , and gives no pleasure to those whose approbation is valuable . It is like the occasional adoption of masculine attire by heroines of the stage . All may not be disgusted with the metamorphosed individual , but certainly none can respect , and few can approve . If there is a poison more subtle , more deadly , and , alas , more palatable than all others , it is the poison of passion , which is communicated far and wide through the medium of books of amusement . If there is a medicine more healthful , pleasant , and precious than others , it is the antidote of virtuous principle conveyed through the same medium , acceptable to all tastes , and spreading wherever the poison had spread . The hand of woman has been doing its proper office in largely administering the healing potion . The gentle and faithful // nurse of our bodily sicknesses has extended her care to our mental and moral constitution , assiduously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in both capacities she is at home . She can not be false to- her nature . The cause of virtue must always find in her an advocate . While she uses the pen , she must always use it to inculcate the graces which she loves , and in which she herself excels . If our literature needs a preservative against the deleterious infusions of licentiousness and folly , we look confidently to her , for we shall find it in the enthusiasm of her heart , and the strength of her good principles . But if our confidence should prove to be misplaced ; if our anticipations should be disappointed ; if woman should ever turn recreant to her own interest , her own happiness , her own nature ; if she too should begin to blot the fair page of letters with unseemliness , and make the mind and soul instru-* ments of their own degradation ; then , though we are not apt to despair of anything that is good , then we should either give up the cause , or look for direct interposition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are our sentiments with regard to what we have called female literature . We fear not for their truth , but only that we have not done justice to their truth and the importance of the subject . The authoress of Hope Leslie ' must not . accuse us of neglecting her beautiful book , because we have not yet alluded to it ; for our remarks were suggested by it , and , if they are worthy , may be applied to it , and to the rest of her writings . She has been a laborer in both of the departments of which we have spoken , and in both she has merited , and we believe received , the cordial approbation of the public . Hope Leslie* is the last of this lady 's three larger works , and , in our judgment , the best . It bears the lineaments of the two others , so far as to entitle them to claim a family resemblance to it ; but it is written with an easier , freer spirit than the others ; its chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater number of prominent characters ; its styleis more matured . In the whole three , however , there is the same purity and delicacy ; the same generous , lofty sentiment* the same deep and solemn breathings of religion without parade , and of piety without cant or censoriousness ; the same love of thegrand and the lovely in nature , together with the same power so to express that love as to waken it up ardently , devotionally in others ; the same occasional touches of merry wit and playful // satire ; the same glowing fancy ; and , spread through all , and regulating all , the same good sense , leading to a right apprehension of human life and human motives , restraining genius from extravagance , giving an air of reality to the narrative , and securing our constant respect for the narrator . There is a natural advantage , if we may use such a phrase , belonging to the last of these tales , which , if the two former had been equal to it in other respects , would yet have clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage is its date ; the times and the scenes in which its plot is laid . At the same time that there is greater danger incurred , and greater care and skill demanded in writing an historical than any other kind of novel , yet when the care and the skill have been successful , and the danger obviously and confessedly escaped , the work makes a stronger appeal to our sympathies , and keeps a more tenacions hold on our memory , than a work of mere imagination from the same hand . The danger is in caricaturing , or feebly representing those men and manners of which there exist true portraits , so far as history is true , in the public mind . A caricature , or a weak , stiff , chalky delineation of a Cmesar or an Alfred , a Bonaparte or a Washington , is intolerable . We can not pardon the stupid mimicry . But let them be brought out into bold , masterly relief , authentic , spirited , living , and breathing , and we confess the artist 's power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we immediately install in our own historical galleries , and make the gems of our memory . It has been fully demonstrated by many an orator and writer of our country , that the characters of our first se*ttlers , the peculiar features of their age , their troubles , their struggles , their wars , government , manners , opinions , and institutions , all fresh and singular , with the wild scenes amidst which they moved , and the wild men by whom they were surrounded , furnished the most admirable materials for literaryfabrics of purely national manufacture , and original patterns , both in poetry and prose . What they said was as true as truth itself . Neither could any fault be found with the recipes which they kindly wrote out ; for these were as correct and clearly worded as could reasonably be desired . But the difficulty was to follow them . The article in request was not forthcoming . A few attempts were made , and one or two of them were not entire failures . The authoress of Hope Leslie , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our satisfaction , completely successful . She has had the industry to study the early history of New England , the costume and carriage , the spirit and temper of the settlers and aboriginal inhabitants , and the talent to combine the results of her researches with the embellishments of her own resources , and present to us the whole , a beautiful work , to verify our theories , to enliven our ancestral attachments , to delight , instruct , and improve us . The book has been so long before the public , and so generally read , that we do not intend to offer an abstract of its story . If there are any who have not read it , we advise them to do so at once ; and in order to excite their curiosity , we will copy a few pages , which , on a second rapid perusal of the work , seemed to us to be fair specimens of it . Very soon after the opening of the story , we are brought into what was then , 1630 or thereabouts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more of a wilderness than another and are introduced to the family of Mr Fletcher , a friend of Governor Winthrop , who has settled near the infant village of Springfield , on the Connecticut river . During the absence of the head of the family , they are all , with the exception of his son Everell , massacred by the Indians ; a scene which the authoress describes with powerful effect . On the retreat of the hostile party , which consists of the chief Mononotto , two or three warriors , his son and daughter , Oneco and Magawisca , who had for some time been inmates of the Fletcher family , with the prisoners , Everell Fletcher and Faith Leslie , the sister of Hope , the following scene occurs . As the fugitives emerged from the narrow defile , a new scene opened upon them ; a scene of valley and hill , river and meadow , surrounded by mountains , whose encircling embrace expressed protection and love to the gentle spirits of the valley . A light summer shower had just fallen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen from the western horizon , and hung their rich draperies about the clear sun . The horizontal rays passed over the valley , and flushed the upper branches of the trees , the summits of the hills , and the mountains , with a flood of light , whilst the low grounds reposing in deep shadow , presented one of those striking and accidental contrasts in nature , that a painter would have selected to give effect to his art . The gentle Housatonic wound through the depths of the valley , in some parts contracted to a narrow channel , and murmuring over the rocks that rippled its surface ; and in others , spreadVOL. xxvr. - . No. 59. 53 // ing wide its clear mirror , and lingering like a lover amidst the vines , trees , and flowers , that fringed its banks . Thus it flows now  --  but not as then in the sylvan freedom of nature , when no clattering mills and bustling factories threw their prosaic shadows over the silver waters-when not even a bridge spanned their bosom-when not a trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe that glided over them , or lay idly moored along the shore . The savage was rather the vassal , than the master of nature ; obeying her laws , hut never usurping her dominion . He only used the land she prepared , and cast in his corn but where she seemed to invite bun by mellowing and upheaving the rich mould . He did not presume to hew down her trees , the proud crest of her uplands , and convert them into " russet lawns and fallows grey . " The axman 's stroke , that music to the settler 's ear , never then violated the peace of nature , or made discord in her music , Imagination may be indulged in lingering for a moment in those dusky regions of the past ; but it is not permitted to reasonable , instructed man to admire or regret tribes of human beings , who lived and died , leaving scarcely a more enduring memorial , than the forsaken nest that vanishes before one winter 's storms . But to return to our wanderers . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Housatonic around a hill , conical and easy of ascent , excepting on that side which overlooked the river , where , half-way from the base to the summit , rose a perpendicular rock , bearing on its beetling front the age of centuries . On every other side , the hill was garlanded with laurels , now in full and profuse bloom ; here and there surmounted by an intervening pine , spruce , or hemlock , whose seared winter foliage was fringed with the bright tender sprouts of spring . We believe there is a chord , even in the heart of savage man , that responds to the voice of nature . Certain it is , the party paused , as it appeared from a common instinct , at a little grassy nook , formed by the curve of the hill , to gaze on this singularly beautiful spot . Everell looked on the smoke that curled from the huts of the village , embosomed in pine trees , on the adjacent plain . The scene , to him , breathed peace and happiness , and gushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked clusters of laurels , and decked his little favorite , and the old chief fixed his melancholy eye on a solitary pine , scathed and blasted by tempests , that rooted in the ground where he stood , lifted its topmost branches to the bare rock , where they seemed , in their wild desolation , to brave the elemental fury that had stripped them of beauty and life . // The leafless tree was truly , as it appeared to the eye of Mononotto , a fit emblem of the chieftain of a ruined tribe . " See you , child , " he said , addressing Magawisca , " those unearthed roots ? the tree must fall-hear you the death-song that wails through those blasted branches 1 " " Nay , father , listen not to the sad strain ; it is but the spirit of the tree mourning over its decay ; rather turn thine ear to the glad song of this bright stream , image of the good . She nourishes the aged trees , and cherishes the tender flowrets , and her song is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eternity . " " Speak not to me of happiness , Magawisca ; it has vanished with the smoke of our homes . I tell ye , the spirits of our race are gathered about this blasted tree . Samoset points to that rock - that sacrifice-rock . " His keen glance turned from the rock to Everell . Magawisca understood its portentous meaning , and she clasped her hands in mute and agonizing supplication , lie answered to the silent entreaty . " It is in vain-ray purpose is fixed , and here it shall be accomplished . Why hast thou linked thy heart , foolish girl , to this English boy ? 1 have sworn , kneeling on the ashes of our hut , that I would never spare a son of our enemy 's race . The lights of heaven witnessed my vow , and think you , that now this boy is given into my hands to avenge thy brother , I will spare him for thy prayer ? No-though thou lookest on me with thy mother 's eye , and speakest with her voice , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a final and fatal resolution ; and prompted , as he fancied , by supernatural intimations , and , perhaps , dreading the relentings of his own heart , he determined on its immediate execution . He announced his decision to the Mohawks . A brief and animated consultation followed , during which they brandished their tomahawks , and cast wild and threatening glances at Everell , who at once comprehended the meaning of these menacing looks and gestures . He turned an appealling glance to Magawisca . She did not speak . " Am I to die now ? " he asked ; she turned shuddering from him . Everell had expected death from his savage captQrs , but while it was comparatively distant , he thought he was indifferent to it , or rather , he believed he should welcome it as a release from the horrible recollection of the massacre at Bethel , which haunted him day and night . But now that his fate seemed inevitable , nature was appalled , and shrunk from it ; and the impassive spirit , for a moment , endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corp'ral sufferance . " The avenues of sense were closed , // 416 April , and past and future were present to the mind , as if it were already invested with the attributes of its eternity . From this agonizing excitement , Everell was roused by a command from the savages to move onward . " It is then deferred , " thought Magawisca , and heaving a deep sigh , as if for a moment relieved from a pressure on her overburthened heart , she looked to her father for an explanation ; he *said nothing , but proceeded in silence towards the village . ' pp. 138-143 . In the bosom of poor Magawisca , during her residence , or captivity , at Bethel , as Mr Fletcher 's house is called , there had grown up a strong affection for young Everell , and she is determined to save his life , which the Indians are as firmly determined to sacrifice . In order to prevent her interference , her father confines , her , on their arrival at the Indian village , in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage procession moving to the sacrifice-rock , where Everell is to meet his death . She finds means , however , to elude the watchfulness of her guard , and arrives to the rescue in the manner thus described . Seated around their sacrifice-rock-their holy of holies-they listened to the sad story of the Pequod chief , with dejected countenances and downcast eyes , save when an involuntary glance turned on Everell , who stood awaiting his fate , cruelly aggravated by every moment 's delay , with a quiet dignity and calm resignation , that would have become a hero or a saint . Surrounded by this dark cloud of savages , his fair countenance kindled by holy inspiration , he looked scarcely like a creature of earth . There might have been among the spectators , some who felt the silent appeal of the helpless , courageous boy ; some whose hearts moved them to interpose to save the selected victim ; but they were restrained by their interpretation of natural justice , as controlling to them as our artificial codes ' of laws to us . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Pequod described his wrongs , and depicted his sufferings , brandished their tomahawks , and would have hurled them at the boy , but the chief said- " Nay , brothers  --  the work is mine-he dies by my hand-for my first born-life for life-he dies by a single stroke , for thus my boy was cut off . The blood ' of sachems is in his veins . He has the skin , but not the soul of that mixed race , whose gratitude is like that vanishing mist , " and he pointed to the vapor that was melting from the mountain tops into the transparent ether ; " and their promises are like this , " and he snapped a dead branch from the pine beside which he stood , and broke it in fragments . " Boy , as he is , he fought for his mother , // as the eagle fights for its young . I watched him in the mountain-path , when the blood gushed from his torn feet ; not a word from his smooth lip betrayed his pain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreathed theirs with flowers . He brandished his hatchet over Everell 's head , and cried , exultingly , " See , he flinches not . Thus stood my boy , when they flashed their sabres before his eyes , and bade him betray his father . Brothers-My people have told me I bore a woman 's heart towards the enemy . Ye shall see . I will pour out this English boy 's blood to the last drop , and give his flesh and bones to the dogs and wolves . " He then motioned to Everell to prostrate himself on the rock , his face downward . In this position the boy would not see the descending stroke . Even at this moment of dire vengeance , the instincts of a merciful nature asserted their rights . Everell sunk calmly on his knees , not to supplicate life , but to commend his soul to God . He clapsed his hands together . He did not-he could not speak ; his soul was " Rapt in still communion that transcends The imperfect offices of prayer. ** At this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell athwart his brow and hair , kindling it with an almost supernatural brightness . To the savages , this was a token that the victim was accepted , and they sent forth a shout that rent the air . Everell bent forward , and pressed his forehead to the rock . The chief raised the deadly weapon , when Magawisca , springing from the precipitous side of the rock , screamed " Forbear ! " and interposed her arm . It was too late . The blow was , levelled-force and direction given  --  the stroke aimed at Everell 's neck , severed his defender 's arm , and left him unharmed . The lopped , quivering member dropped over the precipice . Mononotto staggered and fell senseless , and all the savages , uttering horrible yells , rushed toward the fatal spot . " Stand back ! " cried Magawisca . " I have bought his life with my own . Fly , Everell-nay , speak not , but fly-thitherto the east ! " she cried , more vehemently . Everell 's faculties were paralyzed by a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of mingled gratitude and admiration for his preserver . He stood motionless , gazing on her . " I die in vain then , " she cried in an accent of such despair , that he was roused . He threw his arms around her , and pressed her to his heart , as he would a sister that had redeemed his life with her own , and then tearing himself from her , he disappeared . No one offered to follow him . The voice of nature ' rose from every heart , and responding to the justice of // Magawisca 's claim , bade him " God speed ! " To all it seemed that his deliverance had been achieved by miraculous aid . Allthe dullest and coldest , paid involuntary homage to the heroic girl , as if she were a superior being , guided and upheld by supernatural power . " pp. 154-157 . This escape is almost too wonderful , but it is countenanced by the best authority in numberless instances , and also by a few such marvellous occurrences in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , is one of those creations of genius of which it is hard to speak one 's impressions in adequate terms , and therefore we shall say of her only a word . Some have questioned her verisimilitude as an Indian . They assert that she is too noble , too delicate , too spiritual for an Indian . This we are disposed to deny . That there were ever many Magawiscas , we indeed doubt ourselves , and there-. fore we would not propose her as a fair sample of the Indian character ; but that the best features of her character have had a real existence in savage life , that she is a possible Indian , we have no doubt whatever ; and this is all which is claimed for her in the truly modest preface of our authoress . Possible or impossible , she is a glorious creature , and even if she had no right to her creation , we welcome her to our heart of hearts . Sir Philip Gardiner we detest . We are sorry that the writer meddled with a rascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to the apprehension , imprisonment , and trial of Magawisca , we can not spare even him ; though we should still think that Rosa might be left out with advantage . A part of this trial scene we will here insert , as our last extract . The governor replied , with a severe gravity , ominous to the knight , " that the circumstances he had alluded to certainly required explanation ; if that should not prove satisfactory , they would demand a public investigation . In the mean time , he should suspend the trial of the prisoner , who , though the decision of her case might not wholly depend on the establishment of Sir Philip 's testimony , was yet , at present , materially affected by it . " " He expressed a deep regret at the interruption that had occurred , as it must lead , " he said , " to the suspension of the justice to be manifested either in the acquittal or condemnation of the prisoner . Some of the magistrates being called away from town on the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court till one month from the present date , " " Then , " said Magawisca , for the first time speaking with a tone of impatience , " then , I pray you , send me to death now . // Anything is better than wearing through another moon in my prisonhouse , thinking , " she added , and cast down her eyelids , heavy with tears , " thinking of that old man-my father . I pray thee , " she continued , bending low her head , " I pray thee now to set my spirit free . Wait not for his testimony " - she pointed to Sir Philip- " as well may ye expect the green herb to spring up in your trodden streets , as the breath of truth to come from his false lips . Do you wait for him to prove that I am your enemy ? Take my own word , I am your enemy ; the sunbeam and the shadow can not mingle . The white man cometh  --  the Indian vanisheth . Can we grasp in friendship the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fall by the tempest that lays the forest low , or are cut down alone by the stroke of the axe . I would have thanked you for life and liberty ; for Mononotto 's sakcr I would have thanked you ; but if ye send me back to that dungeon-the grave of the living , feeling , thinking soul , where the sun never shineth , where the stars never rise nor set , where the free breath of heaven never enters , where all is darkness without and within " - she pressed her hand on her breast- " ye will even now condemn me to death , but death more slow and terrible than your most suffering captive ever endured from Indian fires and knives . " She paused-passed unresisted without the little railing that encompassed her , mounted the steps of the platform , and advancing to the feet of the governor , threw back her mantle , and knelt before him . Her mutilated person , unveiled by thin action , appealed to the senses of the spectators . Everell involuntarily closed his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurs of the crowd . She spoke , and all again were an hushed as death . " Thou didst promise , " she said , addressing herself to Governor Winthrop , " to my dying mother , thou didst promise , kindness to her children . In her name , I demand of thee death or liberty . " Everell sprang forward , and clasping his hands exclaimed7 " In the name of God , liberty ! " The feeling was contagious , and every voice , save her judgen , shouted , " Liberty ! - liberty ! grant the prisoner liberty ! " The governor rose , waved his hand to command silence , and would have spoken , but his voice failed him ; his heart wan touched with the general emotion , and he was fain to turn away to hide tears more becoming to the man , than the magistrate . The same gentleman who , throughout the trial , had been most forward to speak , now rose ; a man of metal to resist any lire . " Are ye all fools and mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here together , that like the men of old , ye shout , Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! ' For whom would you stop the course of justice ? for one who is charged before you , with having visited // every tribe on the shores and in the forests , to quicken the savages to diabolical rexerige ! - for pne who flouts the faith once deUvered to the saint* , to your very fiLces ! - for one who hat*h entered ) nt6 an open le*igue arki confederacy with Satan against you ! *. - for one who , as ye have have testimony within yourselves , in that her looks and wor4* do so prevail over your jud*nents , is pr&amp;*siitly aided and abetted by the arch enemy of mankind ! -L cailiipon you , my bi*ethren , " : he . kidded , turning to hi* assoeiates , ; " *zzid most especially oil yo*- , *ov ? rnor Wir*ttIx0p , to . pnt* *4dew*nd to this confusion by the formal adjournment of our court .
