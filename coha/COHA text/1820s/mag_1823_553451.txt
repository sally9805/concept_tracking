ART . XX. - The Life of Francis Bacon , Lord Chancellor of England . By Mr Mallet . A new edition . London , 1822 . THE name of lord Bacon , with the single exception of that of sir Isaac Newton , is the first in the modern philosophical world . Mr flume , indeed , whose habitual moderation seems in this instance to have gone to the extreme of coldness , has suggested the idea , that the English , out of national feeling , have exaggerated the merits of their illustrious philosopher . He compares him with Galileo , and seems inclined to place him below both that philosopher and Kepler . Italy , ' says he , not united in any single government , and perhaps satiated with that literary glory , which it has possessed , both in ancient and modern times , has too much neglected the renown , which it has acquired by giving birth to so great a man as Galileo . That national spirit , which prevails among the English , and which forms their great happiness , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on Bacon among the rest , such praises and acclamations , as may often appear partial and excessive . ' The general truth of this observation is indubitable . We feel unwilling to acquiesce in its application to Bacon . And as that great man , in his will , has appealed to posterity in these pathetic terms : for my name and memory , I leave it to men 's charitable speeches , and to foreign nations , and the next ages : ' we take the greater interest , after this interval of time  --  and in a quarter of our country , which was first settled by civilized men , a few months before the fall of Bacon - in examining into the justice of the stigma left on his name . In the first place , we can not but remark , that the intimation , which Hume has given , that lord Bacon 's reputation has been produced by the extravagant commendations lavished on him by his countrymen , is manifestly unjust . The learned of foreign iatlons certaiily took the lead in his praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophical literature of the continent of Europe , since the age of Bacon , to produce as numerous and as animated testimome* to his merits , as are to be found in the British writers . At the present day , as is well known , the Baconian philosophy has become synonymous with the true philo*ophy , and there is certainly no perceptible difference in the manner , in which it is commended by foreign and British writers . That the remark we just made is correct , beginning from the age in // which lord Bacon himself lived , down to the present time , will appear from one or two citations , which we give as we find them , in the Biographia Britannica , under the article of Bacon . Puffendorf says of him : The late most wise chancellor of England was the chief writer of our age , and who carried , as it were , the standard , that we might press forward and make greater discoveries in philosophic matters , than any with which the schools had rung ; so that if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in philosophy , there has been not a little owing to that great man . ' - Voltaire , in his letters to the English nation , calls him the father of experimental philosophy , and expresses his surprise at finding the doctrine of attraction , usually regarded as the foundation of the Newtonian philosophy , expressly taught in the writings of Bacon . Considering that Mr Hume has ascribed a portion of his high reputation to the partial and excessive praises of his countrymen , it is curious to observe the author of the learned life of Bacon , in the Biographia Britannica , reproaching the English with neglect of their great philosopher 's merits , and with leaving to foreigners to study and applaud his philosophy . But it is not into a controversy with regard to the philosophical character of Bacon , that we propose to enter . The coolest of his admirers are ready enough to commend him in that respect ; and the general confession of his countrymen and of foreigners , of his own age and of posterity , assigns him a rank high enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all acknowledgment so high as a philosopher ; because he was and is the scientific boast of his country and age ; and of all who speak the English tongue ; because to his literary studies and attainments-of themselves enough to fill a common life-he added an eminence in the most difficult profession attained by few , a rank in the legal world , a reputation as a statesman , an orator , a lawyer , a judge , that compares honorably with that of any of those who aspire to this reputation alone ; because with these splendid intellectual endowments and public qualities , he united the most happy and polished manners , and all the graces of private life ; and because , finally , he had the rare skill of*eing able by his pen to set forth all his wonderful talents and mighty acquisitions it is because he is allowed , almost without a dissenting voice , to have been and to have done all this , that we would fain go . N'cw Series , No. 14. 39 // further , and ask whether too ready a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have not men , willing to credit so much to the glory of lord Bacon , been too willing to attribute to him weaknesses and crimes , which one would gladly think incompatible with all the noble qualities he possessed ? In short , having saluted him as the wisest , brightest , ' - have not men been too ready to take the epigram of the poet on trust , and call him the ' meanest of mankind ' ? The ordinary principles of human nature would suggest an answer in the affirmative . We are often shocked with astonishing mixtures of the good and bad , the great and mean in character ; but the best and the worst , the greatest and the meanest , if they met in Bacon , never perhaps met in any other individual . We do not wish , at the same time , to play the panegyrist of his character . At this distance of time and of place , to wish to do this would be an amiable , but a puerile weakness . We do not wish , because lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the other extreme , and maintain that he was as conspicuous for stern , unbending Roman integrity , as for eloquence and science . The heroism of virtue , like the heroism of the cabinet and the heroism of the field , is partly a matter of temperament . No quality excites so high admiration , as none perhaps is on the whole so rare . But we do not hold it necessary to the character of a good man , that he be able to approve himself a Regulus or a Cato ; and especially under arbitrary governments and in semi-barbarous ages , when the axe and scaffold are the ordinary paraphernalia of state , it is quite too much to say , that no one is entitled to be called a good man , if he do not stand ready to seal his integrity by laying his head upon the block . Many great men are obliged to seal their integrity by this sacrifice ; having been cast into so narrow , so arduous , so desperately defined a path of duty , that their whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forfeit their name or die . This was the case with Sydney . His bright name could not have shone a moment , had he faltered in the trial . But had Socrates , at the advice of his disciples , broken his prison and escaped , who would have condemned him ? The philosophical but homely poet of the present day says , That all men would be cowards , if they dare , some men have had the courage to declare . ' // And it was precisely this courage , which lord Bacon exercised , and to which he sacrificed , or at least put in jeopardy , his moral standing , rather than disobey his master , by defending himself . When then we deny to lord Bacon this heroism or chivalry of virtue , we have perhaps done all that is required by truth . To proceed , however , as far as possible on conceded ground , we may agree with Hume , that he wanted that strength of mind , which might check his intemperate desire of preferment that could add nothing to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be requisite neither for his honor nor entertainment . ' Admitting this to be fairly stated , and we shall take occasion , in the course of the present article , to show , that it would bear qualification , we need not point out to our readers , that if carefully weighed , it is less reproachful than it seems . To want that strength of mind , which could check the intemperate desire of preferment , is , we presume , in briefer terms , to be very ambitious . ' We readily grant this to be an infirmity of character , but instead of making a person the meanest of mankind , ' it has been declared to be the last infirmity of noble minds . ' There is no proof , that Bacon carried his ambition higher , than to the first dignities of the profession , to which , from his youth , nay from his cradle , he had been destined . Queen Elizabeth , in his infancy , used to pat his head , and call him her little lord keeper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inordinate ambition for a man , who at every stage of his course had evinced powers equal to this early promise , to aspire to the place , which he so long filled and adorned . That he aspired to any other , we behold no indication ; that in attaining to this and some of the previous stages of his preferment , he was obliged to resort to solicitations , which we now read with pain , is true ; but signally entitled to be considered in his own words as one of the vitia ten*poris , not vitia Itominis . It is the most unquestionable curse of all governments , not strictly popular , that so much power and patronage are in the hands of the individual prince ; who , if he be as weak as James , may bring all the great minds in his dominions to the footstool of himself and his favorites . We have but to read the history of any monarchy , absolute or limited , to behold the greatest men obliged to bow to the caprices of weak or perverse sovereigns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliza // beth , under the influence of her unworthy passion for Leicester and Essex . We shall see Marlborough , after breakin the power of Louis XIV , obliged to put up with insults from irs Masham ; and Walpole taking the lie from George I , with the remark , that my memory must fail me , when his majesty says to the contrary ;  --  a reply which Mr Coxe is pleased to call manly and spirited. * Lord Bacon was forced to that alternative , which so many other great men have been called to  --  the choice between being deprived of the honors and rewards , to which his talents were entitled , and for which Providence formed and marked him out , and submitting to the degrading conditions attached to their attainment , adulation of their royal dispensers . There is but one happy land where no degree of this necessity exists . It lieth near to Plato 's republic , and its name is Utopia . In all other regions , with which history and observation make us acquainted , the lords sovereign or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through their gate into the elysium of office ; and so far is merit from being the only qualification , that even in our own country , and in reference to an o ice within the people 's gift , the infamous maxim is proclaimed and acted on , that the characters of all candidates for place are fair game to be hunted down . ' That lord Bacon , however , really was guilty of the intemperate desire of place ascribed to him , may certainly admit a doubt . Though his patrimonial fortune was slender , and he was obliged to seek his subsistence by the profession of the law , and the sting of necessity was thereby added to his ambition , yet he sacrificed his great opportunities of rising under queen Elizabeth , either to his principles of duty or gratitude . That his letters to Burleigh , who was his uncle , should contain requests for employment , may well be true of such an uncle and such a nephew , without fixing a reproach of grasping ambition on the latter ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament , and his attachment to the unhappy Essex , that cost him his hopes from the queen . This brings us to the first charge against the character of lord Bacon-1iis ingratitude to Essex . We shall relate it in the words of Mr Mallet . Essex , to whose* use and service Bacon had for many years , to use his own words , dedicated his travels and studies , ' had solicited a place for Bacon , and Life of sir Robert Walpole , i. 15$. // having been refused , through the interest of the Cecils , had presented Bacon an estate , which the latter afterwards sold for eighteen hundred pounds . A bounty so noble , ' says Mallet , accompanied too , as we know it was , with all those agreeable distinctions that , to a mind delicately sensible , are more obliging than the bounty itself , must kindle , in the breast of a good man , the most ardent sentiments of gratitude , and create an inviolable attachment to such a benefactor . What , then , are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nobleman 's unhappy fate , publishin .. , T to all England a declaration of the treasons of Robert , Earl of Essex ? This behaviour drew upon him a heavy and general hatred at that time , which was not extinguished even by his death , but continues still , in the writings of more than one historian , a reproach on his memory. * It is not necessary to repeat this well known and interesting portion of English history , and fortunately for the reputation of Bacon , he has left a formal apology for the part which he took in the trial of Essex . The circumstances are briefly these . The court and kingdom were divided between two powerful parties , that of the Cecils on the one side , and that of Essex , the personal favorite of the queen and the popular idol of the people , on the other . Bacon was of the Essex party , and personally the confidential friend of this unhappy nobleman ; and this circumstance cost him his advancement at court , though lord Burleigh , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of eighteen hundred pounds , which Mr Mallet calls a bounty so noble , ' was the only specific obligation which Bacon owed to Essex ; * and as for the favor of his intimacy and friendship , however these things may be estimated at court , it may be thought perhaps , that Bacon conferred as great a favor on Essex , as Essex did on Bacon . We know how these things are usually stated* The powerful , noble , wealthy patron , whom age , birth , and office , give a control over all within his reach , is thought to do all the favor , and confer all the honor . The young , industrious , ingenuous candidate , devoting his precious hours , his talents , his heart , to the hard service of a master , is under ' all the obligation . But in this there is no justice . For every ac* of friendship that " passed between Essex and Bacon , we protest we think the'ob * Perhaps not more than Bacon 's rightful share of the ? 300,000 lavished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 494. // ligation on the nobleman 's side . To talk of the great favor done by a nobleman , whose birth , fortune , and person , are his only endowments , to a mind like Bacon 's , is to talk the language of a court almanack , or a book of peerage ; and is in truth poor adulation of wealth and place . It appeared on Essex 's trial , that Bacon had been his faithful friend ; and , as we have already remarked , he sacrificed his prospects with the queen and the Cecils partly to this friendship . Nor is there any ground to charge him with deserting Essex , till Essex had deserted himself , and engaged in those mad schemes which brought him to the block . Even after his return from Ireland , Bacon labored both with the queen and with Essex , to retrieve the desperate affairs of the latter , and it was only when Essex formed his last preposterous project of seizing the queen , for which he was found guilty of high treason by every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve him . The trial , which is contained in the first volume of the state trials , was managed by sir Edward Coke , the attorney general , and by Bacon , as one of the queen 's council . Called thus officially to assist in the prosecution of the unhappy earl , he discharged his duty in a manner honorable to his feelings . It ought not to be forgot , ' says Mallet , that sir Edward Coke treated this unfortunate nobleman with a strain of petulant dulness and scurrility , that makes us contemn his talent as a pleader , while we abhor the purpose to which he made it subservient . Bacon was moderate and decent . ' The truth is , that Bacon was more than moderate and decent ; he scarcely made his appearance in the trial . The report of it , in the state trials , appears to be very exact , and the speeches evidently given as they were spoken . From this report it appears , that Bacon opened his mouth but once , till appealed to by the earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be called a speech in the course of the trial . In fact he took virtually the course which he is usually condemned for not taking ; that is , he forbore to bear an active part in the prosecution . Indeed , the charge made against Bacon by his enemies , at the time , was , not that he assisted at the trial , or was guilty of severity to the earl in the mode of conduc4ng it , but he was slanderously accused of having solicited the queen to be employed on that service . That this was the charge at the time* appears sufficiently from his reply . // For that I performed at the bar in my public service , your lordship knoweth by the'rules of duty , that I was to do it honestly and without prevarication ; but for any putting myself into it , I protest before God , I never moved either the queen or any person living , concerning my being used in the service , either of evidence or examination , but it was merely laid upon me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged this , in some measure , in consequence of a remark by Mallet , that , as sir H. Yelverton , at the risk of offending the king and Buckingham , refused to conduct the prosecution against Somerset , who had procured him the office of solicitor ; so Bacon ought to have refused to conduct the prosecution against Essex . The truth is , that he did not conduct it ; it was managed by the attorney general , sir E. Coke ; and Bacon , moreover , owed the earl of Essex no such favor , as Yelverton had received from Somerset . The account which Hume has given of this transaction is not distinguished by his usual perspicuity , and lie appears to have confounded , in some degree , the circumstances of Essex 's examination before the council , on his return from Ireland , with the trial of Essex and Southampton for treason , after the uproar in London . He observes , that Bacon appeared against Essex before the council , in obedience to the queen 's commands ; but he afterward says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial for high treason , not being of the crown lawyers . Besides that Bacon most solemnly denies this fact , and protests that the duty of taking a part in the trial was laid on him with his fellows ; it is not easy to perceive what difference flume meant to set up , in his official duty , at the examination and at the trial , by which Bacon was constrained to appear at the one , and not at the other . It appears also , that flume confounds the report of the proceedings of the council , which Bacon , by command of the queen , drew up , but which was suppressed , aud , as Bacon says , never seen by five persons , with the declaration of the treasons of the earl of Essex , a formal statement made by Bacon , also at the queen 's command , of the crimes of Essex , and the proceedings against him . This important document , on which the charge of ingratitude against his patron has by some writers been maiftly founded , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report of the doings of the council , so in the declaration after the trial , Bacon , instead of aggravating the crimes of his friend , // 3013 April tind urging his fate , as he is charged with doing , employed all his masterly skill and eloquence to put the best face on his actions . With regard to the first , we quote the words of flume : Bacon , who wanted firmness of character more than humanity , gave to the whole transaction the most favorable turn for Essex ; and in particular painted out , in elaborate expression , the dutiful submission which that nobleman discovered in the defence which he made for his conduct . When he read the paper to her , she smiled at that passage , and observed to Bacon , that old love she saw could not easily be forgotten . He replied , that he hoped she meant that of herself . ' This account flume has transcribed from Bacon 's apology , as contained in the Cabala , nor do we know why flume should refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the works of lord Bacon . Be this as it may , the same remark may be made of the formal declaration of the treasons of the earl of Essex . Bacon himself thus mentions it : It is very true also , about that time , her majesty taking a liking of my pen upon that , which I had formerly done concerning the proceed*ngs before the council , and likewise upon some former declarations , which in former times , by her appointment , I put in writing , commanded me to pen that book , which was published for the better satisfaction of the world ; which I did , but so as never secretary had more particular and express directions and instructions in every point how to guide my hand in it . Not only so , but after that I had made a first draught thereof , and propounded it to certain principal counsellors , by her majesty 's appointment , it was perused , weighed , censured , altered , and made almost a new writing , according to their lordship 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and curious of truth as desirous of satisfaction ; and myself indeed gave only words and form of style , in pursuing their directions , and after it had passed their allowance , it was again exactly perused by the queen herself , and some alterations made again by her appointment . Nay , and after it was set to print , the queen , who , as your lordship knoweth , as she was excellent in great matters , so she was exquisite in small , and noted that I could not forget my ancient respect to my lord of Essex , in terming him ever my lord of Essex , my lord of Essex , almost in every page of the book , which she thought not fit , but would have it made Essex , or the late earl of Essex ; Whereupon of force it was printed de noro , and the first copies suppressed by her pe*. remuptory command. ** J3ncon 's Works , iv . 441. // If this affair then is candidly weighed , it will not , we apprehend , appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex . It is plain that the obligations of Bacon to Essex are overrated , that Bacon served him as long as it was possible to do it , without being implicated in his mad schemes ; that he actually injured himself with the Cecils and the queen , by his fidelity to Essex ; that so far from taking an active part in his downfall , he did nothing but discharge his official duty as a crown lawyer , and that without severity or harshness ; on the contrary , that he softened and extenuated the crimes of his friend and patron . One more remark only we make on this subject . Mallet , with various other authors , affects to speak of this supposed treacherous behavior of Bacon , as bringing him into universal odium ; and they would represent his apology , which we have already quoted , as extorted from him by the voice of the indignant world , condemning his breach of faith . For all this there is no foundation in fact ; neither is it in itself probable . The court was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex was one . No one can suppose that the conduct of Essex , which brought him to the block , added to the number or zeal of his friends ; or that his party , at the moment that he , its leader , was cut off , had any claims to be identified with the nation . The most that can be claimed for it is , that it was still a powerful party . And this party it was that clamored against Bacon , as it was very natural they should do ; not that his conduct was in itself reprehensible , but because it was a matter of course , that a man of his prominence , once a friend and counsellor of Essex , should , by appearing against him on his trial , give umbrage to his violent friends . In all party controversies , one side or the other , and accident often decides which , gets possession of the confidence of posterity ; and it has happened , in this case , that the Essex party , unable to defend their chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having , as they say , deserted him . This does not go beyond the fair limit of party clamor ; but not to perceive that this is party clamor , to call it the general voice , to suppose , upon the whole , that Elizabeth and the Cecils thought meanly of Bacon for having supported the governrAent on this trying occasion , at their command ; or that the mass of intelligent minds in England , who attach many sacred feelings of duty to // the sovereign 's person  --  and did so doubtless much more in the days of Elizabeth than now , were disgusted that Bacon not only did not conspire with Essex , but actually appeared in his place as a crown lawyer on his trial , argues extreme simplicity . How much injustice has been done , throughout this affair , to Bacon 's character , and how uprightly and independently he carried himself in the difficult path , which all in high place were obliged to tread , is plain from his conduct in the house of commons against the demand of the triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , and the implied obligation of not opposing the measures of the ministry in the house , he defended the popular side , on the demand of this subsidy , and thereby incurred the displeasure of Burleigh . In short , the whole history of lord Bacon , in Elizabeth 's reign , is that of a mild , moderate , conscientious man , estimated by all parties , but unwilling to sell himself to either , and , as usually happens in such cases , coldly looked on by both . Under James the advancement of Bacon was regular and rapid ; and having passed through various steps of honor and . office , he received the seals as lord keeper in 1617 , and in 1619 the title of lord chancellor ; having previously filled the offices of attorney and solicitor general . In this course of advancement , lord Bacon had acquired or preserved the favor of the king and his favorite , without sacrificing the good will of the house of commons . We give this in the words of the treatise before us : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor with the ministers in general , distinguished Bacon by an uncommon mark of favor and confidence . An objection having been started in the house of commons , that a seat there was incompatible with the office of attorney general ( which Bacon at that time held ) which required his frequent attendance in the upper house ; the commons , from their particular regard to sir Veancis Bacon , and for that time only , overruled the objection , and he was accordingly allowed to take his place among them . If I observe further , that the king raised him to the dignity of a privy counsellor , while he was still in this very office , is will be instead of many instances to show , with what an addressful prudence he steered his course betwixt the court and the nation . He was thus favored by a prince , who exacted from all his servants an implicit submission to his maxims of government : // gave no umbrage to a parliament , whom these maxims had rendered jealous of the prince and of almost every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of chancellor in 1619 ; in 1620 he published his most famous philosophical work , the . fVovum Organum ; in 1621 he fell from his honors and offices into disgrace and ruin . This is the memorable event in his life , on which the charges against his moral character are chiefly founded . As he had no opportunity to defend himself against the charges and was never confronted with the witnesses as the witnesses against him were examined chiefly by the committee of parliament ; as he was driven by the will of his master to plead guilty to the charges and wave his defence ,  --  we can not but think it a matter of justice to a great and honorable name , to look carefully into the causes which have fixed a stigma upon it . At any rate , if we mistake not , the details of this important trial will be interesting to our readers . It is unnecessary to relate at length the state of England at this period . The king , besotted with his prerogative , and despotically ruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorite , his family , and creatures . The most oppressive monopolies were granted by royal patent ; and the grossest frauds added to the oppression of the privileges themselves . The indignation of the people was at length roused , and as the irregular and extraordinary means , by which James and Buckingham had sought to raise money without the aid of parliament , began to fail , it was found necessary in 1621 to call them together . They met accordingly , and having with great promptitude voted two entire subsidies , for the purpose of supporting the rights of the king 's son-in-law in the palatinate , they went into a strict inquiry into those arbitrary impositions , that for seven years had been practised upon the people , till they had become insupportable . The wrath of the commons first fell upon . Mompesson and . /lIicliel , who had rendered themselves odious and infamous by their frauds as patentees of the monopoly of gold lace . The proceedings of the house of commons in this case were highly popular ; and though the investigations disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite , was associated with the patentees , it was beyond the power of Buckingham to arrest the proceedings . The disposition , which the commons showed to search into abuses , invited all the discontented to // prefer their complaints , and lord Bacon intimates , in his letter to the lords , that particular industry was exerted to bring up the complaints against himself . These complaints were at length urged too loudly to he disregarded ; and a committee was raised on the twelfth of March to inquire into abuses in the courts of justice . On the fifteenth of March 1 6*2O , this committee reported by sir Robert Phillips , that abuses in the courts of justice had been presented to them . His report in part is as follows I am commanded from the said committee to render an account of some buses in the courts of justice , which have been presented to us . In that which I shalt deliver are three parts . 1st . The person against whom it is alleged . 2d . The matter alleged . 3d . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it is alleged is no less than the lord chancellor , a man so endued with all parts , both of nature and art , as that I will say no more of him ; being not able to say enough . 2d . The matter alleged is corruption . 3d . The persons by whom this is presented us are two , Au* brey and Egerton . ' These two cases of Aubrey and Egerton were the only ones at first presented . That of Aubrey was as follows . Aubrey had a suit in chancery against sir William Bronker . Thinking that his cause went on slowly , he was advised to compliment the lord chancellor with one hundred pounds . Being poor , Aubrey raised the money with difficulty , and gave it to sir George Hastings , his counsel , to deliver to the lord chancellor . Sir George was a member of parliament , at the time the investigation took place , and gave his testimony by request before the committee . He testified that he delivered the lord chancellor the one hundred pounds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it not in Aubrey 's name , but in his own . ' Aubrey 's cause advanced none the better for this gratuity . He wrote many letters to the chancellor* but got no answer , and the cause went against him . Such briefly w 's the leading case . In his short answer to the charges , lord Bacon replies to this ( which , from standing at the head of the articles , was finally engrossed as the sixtee*ith ) merely as follows I do confess and declare , that the money was given and received ; but the manner of it I leave // to the witnesses . ' We suppose here that lord Bacon ' alluded to the testimony of sir George Hastings , that he had given him the money as from himself ; and we argue from the withdrawing of this article from the place it filled , at the head of the list , that it was thought of less moment on investigation , than it had at first appeared . The second case , that of Egerton , was more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , in the cause between sir Rowland Egerton and Edward Egerton , the lord chancellor received three hundred pounds , on the part of sir R. Egerton , before he had decreed the cause . ' To this charge , in the only brief defence he was permitted to make , lord Bacon replies : I do confess and declare , that , upon a reference from his majesty of all suits and controversies between sir Rowland Egerton and Edward Egerton , both parties submitted themselves to my award , by recognisances reciprocal in ten thousand marks each . Thereupon , after divers hearings , I made my award , with the advice and consent of my lord Hobart . The award was perfected and published to the parties , which was in February . Then , some days after , the three hundred pounds mentioned in the charge were delivered to me . Afterwards Mr Edward Egerton flew off from the award . Then , in midsummer term following , a suit was begun in chancery by sir Rowland to have the award confirmed . . Ilnd upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' From this statement , two things appear relative to the three hundred pounds : first , that it was not given pendente He , the us being in fact closed , when the award was made ; and secondly , that Edward Egerton , incensed at losing his cause , stirred up the complaint against the chancellor , for having been bribed by his kinsman and opponent . The second article of this charge is , that in the same cause he received from Edward Egerton four hundred pounds . ' - This , we presume , is the case , which has led to the common remark , that lord Bacon took bribes from both parties , Edward Egerton being the other party in this suit . To the charge , as we have just stated it , lord Bacon replied as follows : I confess and declare , that soon after n*r first coming to the seal , being a time when I was presented by many , the four hundred pounds mentioned in the said charge was delivered unto me in a purse , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; // but as far as I can remember , it was expressed by them that brought it to be for favors past , and not in respect of favors to come . ' Our limits do not permit us to go through all the specifica .. tions finally made out , twenty-eight in number , and of which these two , originally the first made , afford a fair specimen . We will quote one or two only , which will lead our readers probably to the opinion , that a good deal of disingenuousness was used against lord Bacon by personal enemies , apparently by discontented and malicious servants , in raking up , ( to use an expressive vulgarism , ) under the name of bribes , what in common fairness could not be so considered . Thus the third article in the charge is for receiving in the case of Hodie and Hodie a dozen of buttons , ( after the cause ended ) of the value of fifty pounds . ' To this lord Bacon replies : I confess and declare , that as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ended , it being a suit for a great inheritance , there were gold buttons about the value of fifty pounds , as is mentioned in the charge presented unto me , as I remember , by sir Thomas Perrott and the party himself . ' In like manner ,  --  ' In the cause between Kenneday and Vanlore , he received a rich cabinet from Kenneday , appraised at eight hundred pounds . To this charge lord Bacon replies : I confess and declare , that such a cabinet was brought to my house , though nothing near ha ? f the value , and that I said to him that brought it , that I came to view it and not to receive it , and gave commandment that it should be carried back , and was offended when I heard it was not . And about a year and a half after , as I remember , sir John Kenneday , having all that time refused to take it away , as I am told by my servants , I was petitioned by one Pinkney , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood engaged for the money , that sir John Kenneday paid for it ; and thereupon sir John Kenneday wrote a letter to ray servant Sherborne , with his own hand , desiring I would not do him that disgrace , as to return that gift back , much less to put it into a wrong hand . And so it remains yet ready to be returned to whom your lordships shall appoint . ' But we return to the progress of the trial. - As we stated above , the committee appointed by the Commons to inquire into abuses in the courts of justice , on the 1*3th of March 1620 , reported the lord chancellor to be charged with corruption , alleging the two cases of Aubrey and Egerton . The subject // was recommitted , without comment , to the same committee , with directions to resume their sitting the afternoon of the same day . Two days after , they reported again , stating , that the principal thing wherein they had desired to be satisfied was , whether at the time of giving those gifts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This they affirm to have been the case in Aubrey 's affair ; and in Egerton 's they detail somewhat more at length the circumstances mentioned above . They also produce testimony , from which it appears , that in Aubrey 's case the lord chancellor had been exceedingly urged to give a favorable decision , with the menace , if he did not , of making known , that he had received a bribe , to which it was testified , that lord Bacon replied , he should deny it upon his honor . ' No detail of evidence , nor cross-examination is extant , by which the limitation of this denial can be ascertained . As the main fact was susceptible of proof , that he had received the three hundred pounds , it is probable the lord chancellor meant to deny that he had received it as a bribe ; it having been brought him with other presents , shortly after hi* accession to the seals , and avowedly in acknowledgment for past favors . The committee close their second report as follows , the chairman saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this business singly to the Lords , and deliver it without exasperation ; 10 . Because there is but one precedent for it , * in the like case for a chancellor in a case of corruption . 20 . Because the party accused is a peer of the kingdom , sitting in the higher house , whom we can not meddle with . 30 Because we have no power to give an oath . ' A short debate ensued , in which sentiments favorable and hostile to lord Bacon were uttered , and in which his old enemy , sir Edward Coke , spoke against him , but without bitterness ; and it was ordered , that the complaint of A*ubrey and Egerton should be drawn up by sir R. Pbillips , sir Edward Coke , and two other members , and the same be presented to the Lords , without prejudice or opinion , at a conference ; and that a message be sent to the Lords for that purpose , on Monday next ; ' this being Saturday . Accordingly on Monday , March 19 , a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ference , whic4h proposal was acceded to The king at the same time sent a message to the house intimating , that he * This seems to be the case of cardinal Wolsey . See 3 Co . Inst. 148. -4 // intended to adjourn them for a recess . This measure is supposed to have been devised by the king and Buckingham , by way of affording an opportunity and time to avert the dis .. asters , which were threatening the lord chancellor . The recess did not , however , then take place . With respect to lord Bacon , the king 's message was couched in cautious terms : The king also took notice of the complaints against the lord chancellor , for which he was sorry , for it hath always been his care to have placed the best ; but no man can prevent such accidents ; but his comfort was that the house was careful to preserve his honor . And his majesty thought not fit to have the affair hang long in suspense ; therefore would not have any thing to hinder it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six of the higher house and twelve of the lower house , to examine it upon oath . This proposition , if the house liked , he would send the like to the Lords , and this he thought might be done during this cessation , and though he hoped the chancellor was free , yet if he should be found guilty , he doubted not but you would do him justice . ' On the reading of this message , sir Edward Coke cautioned the house to take heed the commission do not hinder the manner of our parliamentary proceedings . ' The house thanked the king for his gracious message , and with respect to the commission , desired him to propose it to the other house , with whom they were already connected in the affair . In the af .. ternoon , the conference with the Lords was held , which on the following day was reported by the lord treasurer . Before proceeding to relate the steps adopted in the House of Lords , we would observe , that on Tuesday the twentieth , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to that body , and through the medium of their committee. - The House of Lords also requested the Commons to reduce their complaints to writing , which they refused to do . The Lords farther desired the attendance and evidence of two members of parliament , which the house permitted them to give on request , as private gentlemen . The next day , new complaints were reported , on the evidence of Keeling , ( formerly in the service of the chancellor ) and Churchill which led Mr Mewtys , a member , to observe : Touchino* the persons that inform , I would e treat this boa. orable house to consider , that Keeling is a common solicitor , ( to s*y no more of him ) Churchill a guilty register , by his own confession . // I know , that fear of punishment and hopes of lessening it may m*k* them say much , yea more than is true . For my own part I must say I have been a witness of my lord 's proceedings . I know he hath sown the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , that the envious man hath sown those tares . ' We now go back one day to the proceedings in the House of Lords . The lord treasurer , on the twentieth , reported the result of the conference to the Lords , and closed as follows : They the Commons humbly desire , that forasmuch as this concerneth a person of so great eminency , it may not depend long before your lordships , that the examination of the proofs may be expedited , and if he be found guilty , then to be punished ; if not guilty , the accusers now to be punished . ' This report being made to the Lords , the lord admiral ( Buckingham ) presented to the house the following letter from the lord chancellor : My very good lords , I humbly pray your lordships all to make a favorable and true construction of my absence . It is no feigning nor fainting , but sickness , both of my heart and of my back , though joined with that comfort of mind , which persuades me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fruits ; and because , whether I live or die , 1 would be glad to preserve my honor and fame as far as I am worthy , hearing that some complaints of base bribery are coming before your lordships , my requests unto your lordships are : First , that you will maintain me in your good opinion , without prejudice , until my cause be heard . Secondly , that in regard I have sequestered my mind at this time in great part from worldly things , thinking of my account and answer in a higher court , your lordships would give me convenient time , according to the course of other courts , to advise with my council , and to make my answer , wherein nevertheless my council 's part will be the least , for I shall not by the grace of God trick up an innocency with cavillations , but plainly and ingenuously , as your lordships know my manner is , declare what I know or remember . Thirdly , that according to the course of justice , I may be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move questions to your lordships for their cross-examination , and likewise to produce my own witnesses for the dis*overy of the truth . And Lastly , that if there come any more petitions of like na-. lure , that your lordships would be pleased not to take any preju // dice or apprehension of any number or muster of them , especially against a judge that makes two thousand orders or decrees in a year , not to speak of the courses that have been taken for hunt out complaints against me , but that I may answer them according to the rules of justice severally and respectively These requests I hope appear to your lordships no other than just ; and so thinking myself happy to have so noble peers and reverend prelates to discern of my cause , and desiring no privilege of greatness for subterfuge of guiltiness , but meaning , as I said , to declare fairly and plainly with your lordships , and to put myself upon your honors and favors , 1 pray God to bless your councih* and your persons ; and rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This letter bore date , March nineteenth , the preceding day . Answer was immediately returned to it as follows rhat the Lords received his lordship 's letter , delivered to them by the lord admiral . They intend to proceed in his cause now before their lordships , according to the right rules of justice ; and they shall be glad if his lordship shall clear his honor therein ; to which end they pray his lordship to prepare for his just defence . ' The next day , a message was received by the Lords from the Commons , containing the additional complaints , to which we have already alluded . A committee of the Lords was appointed to continue the examination begun by the Lords in the house , and to report the charges against the lord chancellor with the proofs , which they did in twenty-eight articles . The list of these articles is given in the state trials , but as they stand without proofs , we forbear to transcribe them . Five of them we have already given , with lord Bacon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . Here the proceedings of parliament rested , for more than a month , till the twenty-fourth of April , during which time the houses had a recess , which the king and Buckiugham are , perhaps erroneously , thought to have devised , for the sake of gaining time . It was in this iu*erval that the course adopted by Bacon was fixed upon . The few documents we have do not allow us to say certainly with what advice or under what compulsion . By his letter to the Lords we find him preparing himself for the defence of his conduct and the cross-examination of witnesses . When he next appears before them , we shall see , that it is with a plenary confession . We shall first // give an account of all that is known of his proceedings in the interval . We left the proceedings in the House of Lords at the twenty-first of March , being Wednesday . On Sunday following , the twenty-fifth , we find the following letter to the duke of Buckingham : * My very good lord , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall hear from your lordship , who are my stay in these floods . Meanwhile , to ease my heart I have written to his majesty the enclosed ; which I pray your lordship to read advisedly , and to deliver it or not to deliver it , as you think good . God ever prosper your lordship . Yours , ever , Fr . St Alban , Cane . ' We are induced to abridge our own observations for the sake of extracting as largely as possible from the interesting letters of lord Bacon in the agonies of this crisis . We first present our readers with a part of that to the king , enclosed in the foregoing to Buckingham . It may please your most excellent majesty , Time hath been when I have brought unto you ge ? niturn columbw from others ; now I bring it from myself . I fly unto your majesty with the wings of a dove , which once within these seven days I thought would have carried me a higher flight . When I enter into myself , I find not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; I have been as your majesty knoweth best ) never author of any immoderate counsel , but always desired to have things carried suavibus modis . I have been no avaricious oppressor of the people . I have been no haughty nor intolerable nor hateful man , in my conversation or carriage . I have inherited no hatred from my father ; but am a good patriot born . Whence should this be ? For these are the things that use to raise dislikes abroad . For the House of Commons I began my credit there , and now it must be the place of the sepulture thereof ; and yet this parliament , upon the message touching religion , the old love revived , and they said I was the same man still , only honesty was turned into honor . For the upper house even within these days before these troubles , they seemed as to take me into their arms , finding in me ingenuity , which they took to be the true straight line of nobleness , without any crooks or angles . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books of hearts shall be opened . I hope I shall not be found // to have the troubled fountain of a corrupt heart , in a depraved habit of taking rewards to pervert justice , howsoever I may be frail , and partake of t e abuses of the times . ' On the next day the king repaired to the house of Lord* , and , in the words of the author before us , in expressions of studied popuk rity owned the errors of his government , exclaimed against the patents complained of ; frankly gave up to justice the lesser criminals coacerned in them ; ad all for the sake of his f2vorite , whom in the of him , ho was the greatest criminal , and without whose concurrence , the wretches in question could not have been guilty . ' Before the meeting of parliament after the recess , lord Bacon had an audience of the king , as we learn by a letter of thanks to his majesty , in which this audience is alluded to . This letter bears date April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be perhaps the second . There is a remarkable passage in this letter to the king to this effect : It is not possible , nor it were not safe , for me to answer particulars , till I have my charge , which , when I shall receive , I shall , without fig-leaves or disguise , excuse what I can excuse , extenuate what I can extenuate , and ingenuously confess what I can neither clcar nor extenuate . ' We may collect perhaps from this passage , that the king had cautioned the chancellor against engaging rashly in his defence ; as we learn also , that up to this date , lord Bacon cherished the only purpose consistent with his honor-that of meeting his accusers , and engaging in his defence . At what time he was unfortunately induced to relinquish this design , we are not informed . That he did so , in consequence of the mingled threats and promises of the king and Buckingham , is nearly certain ; threats that they would desert him , should he persist in his defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes , if he would make confession to the Lords , and avoid the scandal and disclosures of a trial . Mr Mallet , whose style is by no means that of a panegyrist , thus states this matter . After having related the ee*jsnres passed in parliament on the patents granted to Michel and Mompesson , he adds : // But the commons did not stop here . They were for carrying their search up to the prime cause of all grievances , in order to discover by whose influence the patents had been procured , and how they had passed the seals . Complaints were brought into the house about the same time of corrupt practices even in the high court of equity . This alarmed the kin* fo his chancellor , and still more for his minion , as . private intimations had been sent to Buckingham of a severe scrutiny that was making into all his management , and of frequent meetings that were held with great secresy , by certain members of the lower house , in order to fix on him the guilt of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious and alarmed at this intelligence , persuaded him that he could secure impunity to himself and them , only by bringing his master forthwith to dissolve the parliament ; and James had certainly been frightened into that rash and hazardous step , but for the sober remonstr nces of Williams , dean of Westminster . That politic courtier advised him to cancel at once , by proclamation , all monopolies and vexatious grants ; to sacrifice inferior criminals to the public resentment ; and to soothe the parliament with the assurance that this reformation was first proposed by his favorite , on finding how much he had been abused by designing and knavish projectors . This counsel the king resolved to follow . But it did not wholly free him from the perplexity he was under . The chancellor , whom his interest led him to preserve , was openly accused of corruption . The favorite , whom his tenderness would not resign , was secretly and therefore more dangerously attacked , as the encourager if not the author of whatever was deemed most illegal and oppressive . To save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found he must either part with the object of his inclinations , or the oracle of his counsels . How such a prince would determine is easy to guess . His passion prevailed over his reason , and my lord St Alban was made the scape goat of Buckingham . He was even obliged to abandon his defence . As he had gained universal esteem by his learning , and as his eloquence was equal to his parts , superior and commanding , the king would not hazard his appearing before the lords to plead his own cause . In the course of such an enquiry , he might have diverted the public odium from himself , by laying open the long series of bad administration to which he had been privy ; the many illegal patents he had been compelled to pass ; and all this came full home to Buckingham , the great object of national vengeance . The faults too imputed to himself , he might have extenuated , so far as to procure a great mitigation of the censure which must otherwise fall upon him in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the king absolutely commanded him // not to be present at his trial ; promising on his royal word to screen him in the last determination ; or if that could not be , to reward him afterwards with ample retribution of protection and favor . He obeyed , and was undone . ' As this is a matter of great moment in the character of the chancellor , it is important to ask on what authority it is asserted . This is , upon the whole , less indubitable than could be wished , though perhaps as clear as could be expected in a case by its nature secret and confidential . Lord Bacon himself , in some of his letters , intimates that he fell a sacrifice , though not with sufficient distinctness of itself to justify the broad statement we have quoted at length from Mallet . His solemn request to the lords to be heard in his defence , and his repeated assurances to the king , with regard to the manner of making it , are much more conclusive that some influence was exerted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to these presumptions is the positive testimony of Bushel , a person in the service of lord Bacon at the time , and who ruined himself , by engaging in the working of some mines , upon pretence of following what he called lord Bacon 's philosophical theory . In a work called Mineral Prosecutions , in the appendix , in a piece called the Abridgment of Bacon 's Philosphical Theory , Bushel states as follows Before this could he accomplished to his own content , there arose such complaints against his lordship , and the then favorite at court , that for so me days put the king to this quere , whether he should permit the favorite of his affection , or the oracle of his council , to sink in his service . Whereupon his lordship was sent for by the king , who after some discourse gave him this positive advice , to submit himself to the house of peers , and that ( upon his princely word ) he would then restore him again , if they ( in their honors ) should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord saw his approaching ruin , and told his majesty there was little hope of mercy in a multitude when his enemies were to give fire , if he did not plead for himself , yet such was his obedience to him from whom he had his living , that he resolved his majesty 's will should be his only law , and so took leave of him with these words : " Those that will strike at your chancellor* it is much to he feared , will strike at your crown , and wished , as he was then the first , so he migJ*it be the last of sacrifices . " // circumstances of the case , the known temper of the commons , the unaccountable change in lord Bacon 's determination , with respect to his defence ; the hints in his own letters ; the relation in which Bushel stood to lord Bacon at the time and the air of minute accuracy which marks this account descending to the words uttered by the chancellor , we are strongly inclined to believe that this account is the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable from the passage in lord Bacon 's letter to the king , misdate d April 20 , that it was not till after the charge had been exhibited at length to the chancellor , by the committee of the lords , in the recess of the house , that the chancellor received orders not to stand on his defence . It is probable that Buckiugham wait ' d to see what the charge should contain , before he advised conclusively to the steps to be pui sued , as it would be obviously impossible to tell how dangerous the trial was likely to be to himself , till ho had seen the specifications against the chancellor . As soon as these charges were exhibited ; by the committee of the lords , to the chancellor , it would appear that he received orders to resign his defence . These orders seem to us alluded to , in the following letter to the king , dated April 21 , after the lord chancellor had received his charge , but before the assembly of the house . Your majesty can bear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not so much as move your majesty ( by your absolute power of pardon or otherwise ) to take my cause into your hands , and to interpose between the sentence of the house . But now , if not per omnipotentiam ( as the divines speak ) but per potest at em suweiter disponentem , your majesty will graciously save me from a sentence , with the good liking of the house , and that cup may pass from me , it is the utmost of my desires . ' Without particular attention to the train of circumstances , the reader will be in danger here of mistaking the prayer of the chancellor , and conceive him to be urging the king to do , what we have maintained was compulsorily forced on Bacon . It was the chancellor 's wish , when he found he was not to be permitted to defend himself , to have the king interpose , and prevent the lords from coming to a sentence . It was the king 's design , on the other hand , that the chancellor should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s the course accordingly pursued . Parliament met. // after the recess , on the twenty-fourth of April , and their com* mittee reported a charge , with twenty-eight specifications , against the chancellor , the same which had been already communicated to him . As soon as the charges were read , the king 's son , afterwards Charles I. arose and presented a letter from the chancellor , and its being communicated by the prince is confirmation of the opinion , that this course was pursued by command of the king . We have not been willing to omit any part of this letter , which for its beauty and pathos deserves to be read by all who would make themselves acquainted with the stores of eloquence contained in our language . May it plea*e your lordships : I shall humbly crave at your lordships ' hands a benign interpretation of that which I shall now ivrte ; for words that come from wasted spirits and an oppressed mind are more safe in being deposited in a noble construction , than in heir * circled with and reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained in the nature of a protection for all I shall say , I shall now make into the rest of that wherewith I shall at this time trouble your lordships a very stran*'e entrance : for in the midst of a state of as great affliction as I think a mortal man can endure , honor being above life , I shall begin with the professing of gladness in some things . The first is , that hereafter the greatness of a judge or magistrate shall be no sanctuary or protection of guiltiness , which , in a few words , is the beginning of a golden world . The next is , that after this example , it is like that judges will fly from any thing that is in the likeness of corruption , though it were at a great distance , as from a serpent ; which tendeth to the purging of the courts of justice , and reducing them to their true honor and splendor . And in these two points , God is my witness , that , though it be my fortune to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I take no small comfort . But to pass from the motions of my heart , whereof God is only judge , to the merits of my cause , whereof your lordships are judges under God , and his leutenant ; I do understand there hath heretofore been expected of me some justification , and therefore I have chosen one only justification , instead of all other , one of the justifications of Job : for after the clear submission and confession which I shall now make your lordships , I hope I may say , and justify , with Job , I have not hid r*y sin as did Adam , nor concealed my faults in my bosom . This is the only justification which I will use ; it resteth therefore , that without disguise I do ingenuously confess and acknowledge , that h ving understood // the particulars of the charge , not formally from the house , hut enough to inform my conscience and memory , I find matter sufficient and full both to move me to desert the defence , and to move your lordships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lordships by singling those particulars which I think may be easiest answered . Quid te exempta juvat spinis de pluribus una ? Neither will I prompt your lordships to observe upon the proofs where they come not home , or the scruples touching the credit of the witnesses ; neither will I represent to your lordships how far a defence might in divers things extenuate the offence in respect of the time or manner of the gift , or the like circumstances ; but only leave those things to spring out of your own noble thoughts and observations of the evidence and examinations themselves , and charitably to wind about the particulars of the charge here and there , as God shall put you in mind , and to submit myself wholly to your pity and grace . And now that I have spoken to your lordships as judges , I shall say a few words to you as peers and prelates , humbly commending my cause to your noble minds and magnanimous affec* tions . Your lordships are no simple judges , but parliamentary judges . You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your lordships be not tied by the ordinary course of courts or precedents in points of strictness and severity , much less are you in points of mercy and mitigation . And yet if any thing , which I shall move , might be contrary to your honorable and worthy end to introduce a reformation , I should not seek it but herein I beseech you give me leave to tell your lordships a story . Titus Manlius took his son 's life for giving battle against the prohibition of his general . Not many years after , the like severity was pursued by Papirius Cursor , the dictator , against Quintus Maximus , who , being upon the point to be sentenced , by the intercession of some principal persons of the senate , was spared . Whereupon Livy makes this grave and gracious observation : Ateque minus firmata est disciplina militaris periculo Quinti Maximi , quam miserabili supplicio Titi Mcmlii , the discipline of war wa* no less established by the questioning of Quintus Maximus , than by the punishing of Titus Manlius . And the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tioning men of eminent place hath the same terror , though not the same rigor , with the punishment . But my case stayeth not there ; for my humble desire is , that his majesty would take the seal into his han*js , which is a great downfall , and may serve , I hope , in itself , for an expiation of my errors . Therefore , if mercy and mitigation be in your powers , and du // no way cross your noble ends , why should I not hope of your lordships favors and commiseration ? Your lordships will be pleased to behold you chief pattern , the king , our sovereign , of most incomparable clemency , and whose heart is inscrutable for wisdom and goodness . Your lordships will remember , that there sat not , these two hundred years before , a prince in your house , and never such a prince , whose presence deserves to be made memorable by records and acts mixt of mercy and justice . Yourselves , either nobles ( and compassion ever beats in the veins of noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him that would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax . You all sit upon a high stage , and therefore can not but be more sensible of the changes of the world , and of the fall of any of high place . Neither will your lordships forget , that there are vitics temporis as well as vitict hornimis ; and that the beginning of reformations hath the contrary powers of the pool of Bethesda , for that had strength to cure only him that is first cast in ; and for my part I wish it may stay there and go no further . Lastly , I assure myself your lordships have a noble feeling of me as a member of your own body ; and one thing there was , that , in this very session , had some taste of your loving affections , which I hope was not a lightning before death , but rather a spark of that grace , which now in conclusion will more appear . And , therefore , my humble suit unto your lordships is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of the seal my punishment , and that your lordships will spare my farther sentence ; but recommend me to his majesty 's grace and pardon for all that is passed . God 's Holy Spirit be among you . Your lordships ' humble servant and supplicant , Fran . St Albans , * Notwithstanding the submissive tone of this address , and the powerful patrounge , under which it was presented , the lords were not satisfied . They directed a copy of the charge without the proofs to be sent to the chancellor , with this message That the lord chancellor 's confession is not fully set down by his lordship in the said submission , for three causes . 1st . His lordship confesseth not any particular bribe or corruption . 2d . . N'or sheweth how his lordship heard the charge thereof . 3d The confession , such as it is , is afterwards extenuated in the same submission . And therefore the lords have sent him a particular of the charge , and do expect his answer to the same with all convenient expedition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this message , that he would return an answer with all convenient speed . ' It would appear from the second of the exceptions stated by the lords , that they were dissatisfied with the communication of the articles , which had been made to the lord chancelbr during the recess . At any rate , on the following day , we perceive in their doings , symptoms of growing impatience , as they sent him word again , by Mr Baron Denham , and the attorney general , that the lords having received a doubtful answer unto the message their lordships sent him yesterday ; therefore they now send to him again to know of his lordship directly and presently , whether his lordship will make his confession or stand on his defence . ' To this peremptory message the lord chancellor replied by the same messengers , that he will make no manner of defence to the charge , but meaneth to acknowledge corruption , and to make a particular confession to every point ; and after that , an humble submission ; but humbly craves liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the fact , he may make declaration of the truth in such particulars , the charge being brief and containing not all circumstances . ' The same messengers were sent back to the lord chancellor by the lords , to let him know , that their bordships have granted him until Monday the thirtieth of April , by ten in the morning , to send such confession and submission as his lordship intends to make . ' Accordingly , on the twenty-fifth of April , the unfortunate chancellor sent in a paper to the Lords , which is given at length in the state trials , making particular confession of each of the twenty-eight articles , but extenuating most of them , byway either of showing , that the value of the alleged bribes was overrated , or that no cause was pending , or that they had been received by his servants without his knowledge , or that they were bond Jide loans on ordinary security . The length of the document forbids our transcribing it , and the five articles we have copied from it above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having gone through with his replies to the specifications , the chancellor thus closes the confession : This declaration I have made to your lordships with a sincere mind , humbly craving , that if there be any*mistake your lordships would impute it to want of memory , and not to any desire of mine to obscure truth or palliate any thing ; for I do now // again confess , that in the points charged upon me , though they should be taken as myself have declared them , there is a great deal of corruption and neglect , for which 1 am heartily sorry , and submit myself to the judgment , grace , and mercy of the court . For extenuation , I will use none concerning the matters themselves ; only it may please your lordships out of your nobleness to cast your eyes of compassion upon my person and estate . I was never noted for an avaricious man , and the Apostle saith covetousness is the root of all evil . " I hope also that your lordships do the rather find me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are few or none , that are not almost two years old ; whereas those that have a habit of corruption do commonly wax worse . So that it hath pleased God to prepare me by precedent degrees of amendment to my present penitency ; and for my estate it is so mean and poor , as my care is now chiefly to satisfy my debts . And so fearing I have troubled your lordships too long , I shall conclude with an humble suit unto you , that if your lordships proceed to sentence , your sentence may not be heavy to my ruin , but gracious , and mixed with mercy ; and not only so , but that you would be noble intercessors for me to his majesty likewise for his grace and favor . Your lordships ' most humble servant and supplicant , Franc . St Albans , Cane . ' The Lords , having heard this eonfession , sent a numerous deputation of peers and bishops , who shewed to the chancellor the said confession , told him , that the Lords do conceive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , whether it be his own hand subscribed to the same , and whether he will stand to it or not . ' The lord chancellor replied , Y41 lords , it is my act , my hand , my heart ; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed . ' This answer being returned to the house , the Lords sent a deputation to the king , at the head of which was the prince , requesting him to sequester the seal , with which request the king immediately complied . On the first of May , ( the day following these events , ) as appears by a very particular account of the whole transaction drawn up by the king 's order and enrolled in chancery , his lordship delivered up the great seal with the greatest decency , as well as with the highest signs of gratitude to the king for the many favors conferred upon him , and of the utmost sorrow for his own ahu*es of those acts of his sovereign favor . ' * According to the account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Federa , xvii. 296. see Biogi**-phia Britannica , i. 4O* // was sent by the chancellor to lord Windsor , to know the effect of his submission on the house . From him he learned , that the only act of grace he could expect was procured him by the interposition of the bishops , viz , that he should retain his titles of honor ; upon hearing which the lord chancellor remarked , that he was only bound to thank his clergy . ' - Tha seals being sequestered on the first of May , and put in commission the second , the Lords resolved , that on the day following they would proceed to give sentence . The gentleman usher and sergeant at arms were commanded to wait upon the lord chancellor , and the sergeant at arms to take his mace with him and shew it to the chancellor , and so to summon him to appear in the House of Lords to receive sentence the next morning at nine o'clock . These officers found him sick in bed , and having summoned him , he answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any excuse , for if he had been well he would willingly have come . ' The Lords determined nevertheless to proceed , and sent a message to the Commons , that they were ready to give sentence , whenever the Commons , by their speaker , should come and demand it . The Commons immediately waited on the Lords , and the speaker from the bar moved the Lords for judgment , which was rendered by the lord chief justice , as follows : Mr Speaker : Upon complaint of the Commons against the viscount St Albans , lord chancellor , this high court hath thereby , and by his own confession , found him guilty of the crimes and corruptions complained of by the Commons , and of sundry other ? rimes and corruptions of like nature . And therefore this high court having first summoned him to attend , and having his excuse of not attending , by reason of infirmity and sickness , which he protested was not feigned , or else he would most willingly have attended , doth nevertheless think fit to proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the lord viscount St Albans , lord chancellor of England , shall undergo the fine and ransom of forty thousand pounds . That he shall be imprisoned in the tower during the king 's pleasure . That he shall forever be incapable of any office , place , or employment in the state or commonwealtib That he shall never sit in parliament , nor come within th' verge of the cotirt ' // 330 April , It has been supposed , that the Lords were moved to this tremendous severity , by the belief , that the sentence would he mitigated by the king ; and that in reality the punishment would be made as completely nominal , as it was in the power of the king to render it . This actually took place ; after a short confinement in the tower , he was discharged from imprisonment . In a letter to the prince , dated June first , we find him expressing his thanks to the prince for the use of sir John Vaughan 's house at Parson 's Green . I am much beholden , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughan , the sweet air and loving usage of whose house hath already much revived my languishing spirits . I beseech your highness thank him for me . ' Three days after , we find the following letter to the king , which does great credit to the feelings of James , and shows that he was sincerely attached to lord Bacon : I humbly thank your majesty for my liberty , without which timely grant any other grace would have come too late . But your majesty , that did shed tears at the beginning of my trouble , will , I hope , shed the dew of your grace upon me in the end . Let me live to serve you , else life is but the shadow of death to your majesty 's devoted servant . ' Soon after this , he was permitted to have access to his majesty , and being still restrained by his sentence from coming within the verge of the court , this part of it was for the present not abrogated but suspended . We find from a letter of sir Antony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that great offence was taken by the enemies of Buckiugham at the promptness with which Bacon was released from the tower . As this letter is dated May twelfth , and Bacon was sentenced the third , it would appear that he was confined but a few days . The king had so long been used to resorting for advice to Bacon , that we find him calling for his counsel as to public affairs , even in this moment of his ruin ; and a memorial exists of Bacon , written a week or two after his release from the tower , at the request of the king , touching the best mode of procedure with the reforms , of which his own ruin was the solemn inauguration . The king being deterred bythe clamors of the hostile party from allowing him immediate release from the ' still existing restraints on his liberty , lord Ba.on retired in June to his seat at Gorhambury . On the thirteenth of September , ihe king granted him a license to remain six weeks at sir John // Vaughan 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant for assigning to his friends the fine of forty thousand pounds by way of protecting him to that amount from his creditors , and , October twelve , signed his pardon , except in respect to the last article of his sentence . Being therefore still unable to appear within the verge of court , he was obliged , when his license expired , to return to Gorhambury . In a letter to the king , dated March 1622 , we find him expressing his thanks to James for his release from the prohibition to appear within the court , which we may suppose accordingly to have been granted about this time . A letter is also extant to the king , apparently written in September of the same year , and in the most touching strain , from which we must find room for a few sentences . For now it is thus with me ; I am a year and a half old in misery ; though I must ever acknowledge not without some mixture of your majesty 's grace and mercy ; for I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be totally miserable . Mine own means , through mine own improvidence , are poor and weak , little better than my father left me . The poor things That I have had from your majesty are either in question , or at courtesy . My dignities remain marks of your past favor , but burdens of my present fortune . The poor remnants which I had of my former fortunes , in plate or jewels , I have spread upon poor men unto whom I owed , scarce leaving myself a convenient subsistence . So as to conclude , I must pour out my misery before your majesty , so far as to say , si deseris tu , perirnus. - Your majesty shall not feel that n gift , which I shall extremely feel in help , for my desires are moderate , and my courses measured to a life orderly and reserved , hoping still to do your majes ty honor . Only I most humbly beseech your majesty to give me leave to conclude with these words , which necessity speaketh : Help me , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , as that I , that have borne a bag , be not now in my age forced in effect to bear a wallet ; nor that I , who desire to live to study , may not be driven to study to live . ' In consequence of this and other letters , some pecuniary favors were bestowed upon lord Bacon , though the great amount of his debts rendered his situation anxious and unhap. * py . That his poverty , however , has been exaggerated , we can scarcely doubt , particularly in the following atrocious account , at the close of hi* casc in the state trials . Hin height // of abundance was reduced to so low an ebb , as to be denied beer to quench his thirst ; for having a sickly stomach , and not liking the beer at Grays-Inn , he sent now and then to sir Fulk Grevil lord Brook , who lived in the neighborhood , for a bottle of his beer ; and after some grumbling , the butler had order to deny him . ' As Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds a year , and had a landed estate of a third as much , it is incredible that he should have been reduced to this abject poverty . Equally dubious do we regard the opposite tale , that he retained , after his fall , all the splendor which he had assumed in the height of his honors , and provoked the prince , who had passed him , driven in his carriage with great state and attendance , to say , Well , do what we can , this man scorns to go out like a snuff . ' No part of his life , on the whole , does him more credit than that which he passed after his fall . He devoted himself unremittedly to his philosophical and literary pursuits . The very next year he published his history of Henry VII . Under the discouragement , ' says Mallet , of a public censure , broken in his health , broken in his fortunes , he enjoyed his retirement not above five years ; a little portion of time ; and yet he found means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the glory too , of a long and fortunate life . ' One anecdote from this period does him so much credit , iii a point of view in which his reputation has suffered moststrength of mind-that we can not but quote it One day his lordship was dictating to Dr Rawley some of his experiments in his Sylva . The same day , he had sent a friend to court , to receive for him a final answer , touching the effect of a grant which had been made him by king James . He had hitherto only hope of it , and hope deferred , and he was desirous to know the event of the matter , and to be freed , one way or other , from the suspense of his thoughts . His friend returning , told him plainly , that henceforth he must despair of that grant , how much soever his fortunes needed it . Be it so , said his lordship , and then he dismissed his friend very cheerfully , with thankful acknowledgments for his services . His friend being gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to him , Well , sir , yon business wont go on , let us go on with this in our power , and then he dictated to him afresh for some hours , without the least hesitancy of speech or discernible interruptio*i of thought. * * Quoted from Abp Tennison 's account of his writings , in Biographia Britan. // He received a full pardon from James about three years after his fall , and , in consequence of the death of the king , was summoned to the first parliament under Charles I. He himself , however , died soon after . He seems to have spoken in the spirit of prophecy , in telling the king that those who struck at his chancellor would take a higher aim . His impeachment may be regarded as one of the first indications of that spirit , which cost Charles his life . The same volume of the state trials contains both their cases . The remarks which we have to make on the character of lord Bacon must be confined to a few heads , rather than carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject might deserve , if our limits permitted it . In order not to be misapprehended in the conclusions we would draw , we would say , without hesitation , that lord Bacon stands convicted , though not in the most unexceptionable form , of practices inconsistent with the purity of a court of justice , and that an exemplary punishment was therefore merited by him . Having admitted this , we venture to suggest some considerations in extenuation of his offence , and by way of rectifying the extravagant ideas , which prevail of his guilt , principally , we believe , on no better foundation than that of Pope 's line. - In the first place , then , we derive our knowledge of lord Bacon 's guilt from ex parte evidence , and that in the most exceptionable form . He was himself never confronted with the witnesses , had no opportunity of crossexamining them , no opportunity of calling his own . In addition to this , we possess , for the most part , only general results of their testimony , on many of the charges without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just or safe to condemn a prisoner under these circumstances ? It may be replied , indeed , that lord Bacon was condemned by his peers , and that on his own confession . But we have made it more than probable , we have produced one express authority to prove , that this confession was compulsory ; that lord Bacon was brought to it by the mingled threats of the king and his all powerful favorite ; and this fact alone deprives lord Bacon 's confession of any legal weight . If the confession itself be scanned , it will be found , that every article is palliated , extenuated , excused , or shown in some degree to be different from the allegation ; and it is quite plain , that lord Bacon could have gone much farther in this way , but for the miserable dilemma , in which he was placed . // Secondly , his impeachment originated in private malice . Wrenham , a disappointed suitor at chancery , had some years before petitioned against lord Bacon , and sought to do him ill offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was found not only , that lord Bacon had behaved with integrity and done no other and no more than his duty , but that he had been very ill-treated by Wrenham . This man 's pri-. vate malice could not digest the loss of his suit , and again the disappointment of his vengeance , and he was the instrument of forwarding , collecting , and pursuing the complaints against the lord chancellor , which ended in his impeachment . We hold , that in any moral inference to be drawn against the character of lord Bacon , in consequence of his trial , it is a matter of great moment , whether he was called to it in the ordinary march of vigilant , but even justice , or whether it was stirred up and forwarded by private malice . Thirdly , the prosecution was strongly associated with the political odium , in which Buckingham was held . It is true , that lord Bacon personally had been a favorite in either house It is equally true , however , that the Commons-not sufficiently conscious yet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord chancellor with a jromptness of justice , which had evidently been whetted up , for another victim . The letter of sir A. Ashley , to which we have alluded above , abundantly testifies to this feeling on the part of the Commons , and the whole plot-as we may call it-* -- *of lord Bacon*s forced confession , was predicated on the necessity of turning off the vengeance of the Commons from Buckingham to the chancelbr . This fact is equally important , nay far more so , than the former ; for if that prove , that lord Bacon was dragged to trial by a malicious informer , this shows , that his trial was prosecuted before prejudiced judges . Fourthly , the crime itself , of which lord Bacon was guilty , must not be estimated by a standard inapplicable to the age , in which he lived . It is well known , that the chancellors who preceded him were in the habit of taking presents from suitors ; a habit of most , dangerous example , and deserving to be broken up , even at as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we speak , not of the justice* of his punishment , but of the moral character of his conduct , the circumstance , that preceding chancellors had taken presents , is of material // importance , in ascertaining what degree of guilt was incurred by lord Bacon in doing it . Here , too , the manners of the age are to be considered ; the taking of presents was a very extensive practice . On new year 's day , the sovereign was presented by all the wealthy subjects about his court . Quite as many abstract arguments could be framed on the impropriety of a kL*g 's taking gifts of his subjects , as of a lord chancellor 's of his suitors . In an age when it is not practised , the crime is monstrous ; when it is , it loses its criminality . Our readers may see the extent of these practices in an extract from the Reign of Elizabeth , ' by Miss Aikin , an authority the less suspicious here , as that lady has exercised her gifts , which are but small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sovereign , who scrupled not to accept of bribes from parties engaged in law suits , for the exertion of her own interest *xith the judges , could scarcely be expected to exhibit much delicacy on this head . In fact , the venality of the court of Elizabeth was so great , that no public character appears even to have professed a disdain of the influence of gifts and bribes ; and we find lord Burleigh inserting the following among rules moral and prud'ential , drawn up for the use of his son Robert , when young : - " Be sure to keep some great man thy friend . But trouble him not for trifles . Compliment him often . Present him with many , yet small gifts , and of little charge . And if thou have cause to bestow any great gratuity , let it be some such thing as may be daily in his sight . " ' In connexion with this , Miss Aikin quotes the following letter of Hutton , archbishop of York , to the lord treasurer Burleigh : I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill success I had in a suit for a pardon for Miles Dawson , seminary priest , whom I converted wholly the last summer from popery . Upon his coming to church , receiving the holy communion , and taking the oath of supremacy , I and the council here , about Michaelmas last , joined in petition to her majesty for her gracious pardon , and commended the matter to one of the masters of requests , and writ also to Mr Secretary to further it , if need were , which he willingly promised to do . In Michnelmas term nothing was done . And therefore in Hilary term , I being put in mind , that all was not done in that court for God 's sake only , sent up twenty French crowns of mine own purse , as a remembrancer of the poor man 's pardon , which was thankfully accepted of . ' // 236 April , This argument derives new force , when we consider , in the next place , that though lord Bacon were punished for bribery and corruption , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is understood of unrighteous judgments . Out of the two thousand orders and decrees published by lord Bacon annually , Rushworth assures us , on the authority of some learned in the law , that no decree of lord Bacon was ever reversed ; and one of the profession also said of him , that if he sold justice , he sold not injustice . ' In fact , there is no crime chargeable to lord Bacon 's account beyond those , which the conventions of society create . The moral duty of the judge is absolved , if he render equal justice to all ; and lord Bacon is not charged with not doing so . Finally , that we may not omit any portion of the truth , out of supposed tenderness to his fame , the true source of his extravagant taking of presents was his bad husbandry , he being without a large fortune , of expensive habits , no thrift , and given up to his servants . The twenty-eighth article against him in the charge was , that he hath given way to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private seals , and otherwise for sealing injunctions ; ' and to this he replied with equal candor and justice , I confess it was a great fault of neglect in me , that I looked no bc*tter to my servants . ' It is in allusion to this , that , when his servants rose up at his entrance , he said , sit down , my masters ; your rise hath been my fall . ' It is probable , that abuses were practised to a great extent in his house , and under cover of his authority , of which he knew nothing , but of which the odium was thrown upon him* And justly in a legal point of view , for it was his duty to protect his suitors from the rapacity of his servants ; justly in a moral point of view , for a man certainly shall bear the blame of the wrong , that comes of his neglect ; but charitably speaking , it is surely less to be weakly negligent as a master , than wilfully corrupt as a chancellor . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly without weight . We confess we have made them , from having sought ourselves in vain , in the history of lord Bacon 's fall , for the grounds of that abandonment , with which he is given up as the meanest of manki*id . ' Fatal as his great weakness was , there is neither truth nor justice in the fippellation ; it does not even tolerably well describe the gene** // ral kind of his moral defect . Comparing his character with that of men in much stricter times , we could fix on some of the proudest names in English story , to which deeper moral exceptions might be taken . We will not violate national courtesy , so far as to name the frail and illustrious living , but Pitt and Fox , if they fell into the hands of an epigrammatist , like Pope , would either of them serve to point a moral , as dark as the meanest of mankind . ' When we consider , moreover , that in the same poem , in which Bacon is thus hung up to proverbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lord Bolingbroke is crowned with all the honors of a poetical apotheosis , we can not but feel indignant at this perverse distribution of posthumous renown .
