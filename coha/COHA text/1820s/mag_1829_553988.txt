txt ART . IX. - Catalogue of Pictures in the . *1thena*urn Gallery . Boston . 18c29 . THE exhibition of pictures , which has been open the last two months , has been attended with circumstances most gratifying to the amateur , and most encouraging to the artist . It was hardly // 259 anticipated that so large and good a collection could be made , for the third time , without the repetition of a single picture , and with so little aid from other places ; for although some of the best have come to us from abroad , more than seven eiThths in value , as well as in number , belong to Boston and the vicinity . We take pleasure in saying too , that the great merit of the collection is to be found in the works of our native artists . It is essentially American . There are specimens of the works of nearly every eminent American artist , and it can only be necessary to mention the names of Copley , West , Stuart , Allston , Trumbull , Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy those who have not seen the collection , that it must possess gratifying evidence of American talent . Another pleasing fact , is the obvious improvement of those artists who have heretofore exhibited their works at the Athen*um . They have all felt the influence of the exhibition . The criticism to which they have been exposed , the liberality with which they have been encouraged , and still more , the opportunity they have enjoyed of comparing themselves with other and greater masters , have stimulated them to efforts which have been to a great degree successful . We perceive with much pleasure , that one of the leading objects of establishing the exhibition , the improvement and encouragement of the young artist , has thus been so far attained . We think we perceive too , in the increased number of those who visit the gallery , an indisputable evidence of the growth of a taste in the community , for the beautiful art which is there exhibited . We hope that the public and the artists will continue mutually to excite each other by the attainmerit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , and may be said , of the dangers of luxury and the debilitating influence of refinement , they are dangers which none of us are very anxious to avoid , and which the progress of society renders inevitable . Luxury , or the indulgence of imaginary wants , is an offence with wlich every man in every state of society is chafgeable . It is a very narrow use of the word to confine it to pictures and statues , gold and silver , houses and furniture . The indolence of the savage , the inebriating draught of the laboring man , the afternoon cxcursion of the industrious citizen , are no less luxuries than the easy chair , or the splendid equipage of the wealthy ; and we conceive there can be no doubt , that the pleasures of taste and imagination are rather to be encouraged , than those grosser and // 260 Boston E hihition of Pictures . more corporeal indulgences , which are almost sure to be their substitutes . The question is not whether we will be luxurious , for that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will indulge ; whether we will have bull-baitings , and cockfighting , epicurism and gluttony , or fine arts and literature . Fortunately the natural taste for art is almost universal , and requires only opportunity for developernent . Every one is pleased by a beautiful landscape , a fine statue , or any skilful representation of an agreeable natural object . Skill alone is always interesting , whether it be in the construction of a ship , or a double-speeder , or in painting a picture . Commercial and manufacturing skill have been pretty well developed among us , and we hope the time is fast approaching when the fine arts may claim their share of interest . The exhibition at the Athena*um , is an omen of good augury in this respect . Talents of a high order , and skill of no ordinary kind , have been shown by several of our artists ; and it appears to us that the public are by no means backward in appreciating or encouraging merit . The reputation which is obtained by the deserving is extended through the community at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured . Indeed , we can think of no way in which the plan of the exhibition could he improved , and we have only to declare our pleasure at its past success , and its hopeful prospects . We feel some reluctance at expressing an opinion as to the merits of individual pictures ; for of the great variety of persons who have seen the collection , with tastes as various as their characters , we can expect but few to agree with us . As we shall do it , however , without fear , ' so we shall hope to escape without reproach . ' Among those by the old masters , which occupy the first side of the room , we were attracted by an excellent Ruysdael ; two very pleasant pictures by Ommeganck ; an Interior of a Chapel , ' by Peter Neefs , which is quite a b ' *jou ; and a picture by an unknown hand , called in the catalogue , Fishermen at Evening . ' The large picture by Copley , which occupies the centre of that side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us to have little interest for the public . The scene , the figures , and the faces are of remarkable tranquillity ; the coloring is fresh and brilliant , and the finish , as usual , very careful . But they pictures , which we think the most valuable among the older ones , are the two which arts called , and we have no doubt , are // rightly called , by the names of Guercino , and Salvator Rosa . The Christ healing the Blind , ' has the most prominent merits and defects of Guercino , so far as we are acquainted with them . It is full of expression of face and attitude , finely drawn , and in parts beautifully shaded , and the drapery is singularly rich and brilliant . At the same time there is a want of perspective , and a brown hue in the darker parts of the picture , which , while they are disagreeable are characteristic of the artist. * The Salvator Rosa has all the force , spirit , and grandeur , which are known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldness , yet harmony of coloring of this picture , seem to us decisive marks of Salvator Rosa , and would be sufficient to make it a work of great merit , were the name of its author unknown and unsuspected . Our attention was next called to the Sortie of Gibraltar , ' Trumbull 's chef-d'ceuvre , and we congratulate the Athen*um on the acquisition of a picture of so much value . The composition , drawing , and coloring of this work , seem to us nearly unexceptionable . The fault , if there be any , lies in the subject , which is prosaic , and rather unmanageable ; but the group of officers who occupy the principal station , is well arranged , and all the subordinate parts are in excellent keeping . There is so much truth , so naturai'an air pervading the picture , that the effect upon us is like that of a well told tale ; we can not but believe that some such scene actually took place . We turned from that to the Lear , ' by West , the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Indeed , we do not see how a stronger contrast could well have been presented . The Lear is the embodying of a poetic fancy , an extravagant delineation of an extravagant character ; and , for ourselves , we confess it is far from being an attractive picture ; we do not dwell upon it with pleasure , for die conception seems to us radically wrong , and the execution in some respects bad . Lear is too violent and too Herculean a madman , and the other figures we think ill disposed . They are confused and crowded in a manner which is painful to the eye and to the mind . We are aware that this picture is much praised , and that we may be expressing a * We are glad to learn that the Atherneum has purchased this picture . It is so rarely that we have an opportunity of procuring a genuine work of a good master , that none should be neglected by a public institution . // singular opinion ; but we think the conception and composition of it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur and majesty in the figure of Lear , something of the divinity doth hedge a king , ' which are imposing ; and the coloring is rich and vivid . We are glad that the Athen*umn has obtained possession of it , were it only as a memorial of the excellent man who painted it .. An American gallery would be quite incomplete without a West . Under the Lear , are hung two pictures , the Dull Lecture , ' by Newton , and Anne Page , Slender , and Shallow , ' by Leslie , which we consider the best cabinet pictures in the room . Both are delightful , though marked by very different characteristics . The coloring of the Newton is a feast to the eye . The effect is like that upon the ear of a rich and perfect chord of musical instruments , with this advantage , that the spectator can recur to it and repeat it at pleasure . The artist has arranged his colors with most charming effect , though with some disregard to probability in. the lights and shadows . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . The drawing , too , is liable to exception ; but we have no pleasure in finding fault with this picture ; its coloring , so brilliant , so rich , so harmonious , makes us forget everything else in the pleasure of contemplating it . Leslie , on the other hand , has taken great care to be correct in his drawing ; and his lights and shadows are arranged precisely as they would be by nature , in a room like the one represented . His coloring is colder than Newton 's , though the tone is so different , that it ought not to be brought into direct comparison with it . It is more correct , without being so striking a picture as NeWton 's ; and the humor of the scene , which is strictly Shakspearean , makes it , we think , as popular and attractive as the other2 We are grateful to the liberal proprietor , Mr P. Hone of New York , for the pleasure he has afforded us by the sight of these two capital works . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not room to enumerate . But we must not omit the Lake of the Mountains , ' by Doughty , which is full of the soft , rich coloring , which seems to be peculiarly his . It is a picture which affords a most agreeable repose to the eye and the mind , at the same time exciting the fancy and soothing the feelings . The Outlet of the Lake , ' by Fisher , is a fine composition , but the effect of it is injured by scattered lights , and by a tone of coloring somewhat too brilliant . Both these // artists have improved greatly , and well merit the popularity they have obtained ; we should like to see , however , one change in the style of both , which we venture to su*gest to their consideration . They paint too many clouds in their skies . Doughty , especially , seems to be fond of mist and vapor in every variety of appearance . For ourselves , however , we greatly prefer a clear sky to a clouded one , a warm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to have our sky always overcast and shadowy , nor even loaded with passing clouds . There is a picture by T .. Cole , called Evening , ' which possesses a great charm for us in the soft and warm sky , with just cloud enough to show its clearness . It is a picture we like to look upon , though its merits consist principally in its tranquillity and its sky . Pratt has a landscape , in which the subject requires clouds of the densest form , and the most striking contrasts of color . We refer to his ' Mount Sinai , ' which seems to us to show great power of imagination , and very considerable skill of execution , in the style of Martin , so celebrated for his lightning and tempest . We like it much better than his other prod uclions , whether bowers , or mountain scenery , or portraits . We are constrained to wish , when we look at the last , that he would put a little more warmth and health into his flesh . Of the portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the Independent Beggar , ' by Waldo , a picture of remarkable force and truth . The tone of coloring is excellent , rich , and natural , the outline bold , and the shades well managed . The conception of the whole , the attitude and expression are extremely happy , and are well combined to produce the intended effect . Another excellent portrait is by Fisher , and we confess we were surprised at the spirit and the correctness of coloring , with which it is executed . The hue of the flesh is that of nature , and the drawing is so good that we are quite sure it must be a striking resemblance . Stuart also has been recalled to us by two of his admirable works . It is very agreeable to see the portrait of so true a gentleman , as the late Dr Lloyd , executed in a manner which shows that the artist duly appreciated the benevolence and dignity of his subject , and knew how to represent them . It is this happy talent , which , combined with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he will ever maintain . The portrait of Dr Holley , though not so richly colored , shows the same power of mind and hand . Thomas Dixon , Esquire , by Inman , and James Cox , Esquire , // 264 July , by Harding , merit notice for the spirit and correctness of their coloring and execution . We are happy to perceive , as we think , in this , and two other portraits by Harding , those of Mr Carroll and Mrs Smith , that he continues to improve . We wish we could dwell upon many others of the pictures which are great ornaments of the collection , such as the Dying Greek ' by Weir , the attractive portrait of Mrs Hemans by West , and that of Houqua by Chenery , several of Salmon 's views , and others by Fisher and Doughty , and the beautiful collection of miniatures ; but we fear we have already taxed too heayily the patience of our readers , by a criticism , which , to those certainly who have not seen the exhibition , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , without expressing our deep feeling of regret , that we find but one picture by Allston in the catalogue , and that an old one . How is it , that he alone , of all our artists the most distinguished , and the most valued , has not produced anything for either of the three exhibitions we have had ? The first year , indeed , there were many of his works ; and how highly they were esteemed , he must be well aware ; but they were sent by those who had long possessed them , and from that time to the present we have seen nothing , and heard of nothing , which has come from his easel . We would not , on any account , use an expression which would grate harshly on the delicacy of a refined and sensitive mind ; but our admiration of his genius , and our almost irrepressible desire to see more of his productions , lead us to suggest to him the propriety of showing that he is not insensible to the universal homage which his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man of his celebrity , has become , in some degree , public property ; at least he should not treat with neglect , year after year , the anxious expectations of a community that ask only for something from his pencil , however slight a production of his genius , which they are ah'eady prepared to admire . But we are unwilling to believe that there is anything like a feeling of indifference in his mind ; and we merely mean to express , in the strongest manner , our regret that any feeling , or any course of events , should have deprived us for so long a time of the pleasure we are sure of enjoying , when looking at a picture by Washington Allston.
