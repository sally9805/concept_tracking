txt ART . IV. -1 . .1 Statement by the Council of the University of London , explanatory of the Nature and Object of that Institution . London . 1827. 2 . Report of a Committee of the Overseers of Harvard College , January 6,1825 . Cambridge . 1825 . PoLITIcAL wisdom has to solve the difficult problem of directing the industry of the people , under the limitations of their constitutional compacts , to the advancement of the public good . The public felicity which attends the accomplishment of this task , bestows the means of private prosperity on every individual , whom the laws protect . The means used for the attainment of this end , are suggested by sound , practical reason , and ratified by successful experiments , which will ever outstrip philosophy in her fanciful visions and speculations . The acquisition of property , made accessible to a whole nation on equal terms , and guarded by a wise constitution , opens the richest sources for the free and unlimited exercise of talents , industry , and enterprise . Wealth accumulated by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same degree , that acquired in all other ways it it dishonorable , and directed against the public good . The great difference in the capacities and occupations of men iuiust , from natural causes , give rise to inequality of worldly advantages , notwithstanding the level on which the whole nation stands in a l ) Olitical view ; and the same reasons operate upon the formation of // the various stages of society in different communities . Equal rights and privileges may be equally enjoyed by a whole community , without giving a monotonous uniformity to civil life , which , were it practicable , would not be desirable . Frugality and integrity are the two guardians of popular institutions . They must impart strength and stability to the political fabric in its steady progress . They are inseparable and support each other . If they should cease to be respected and cultivated , licentiousness will begin to prey upon the vitals of the frame , and prepare its decline and ruin . It must , therefore , be the sacred duty and highest aim of patriotic , zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the continuance of popular institutions in their native purity , by obstructing the strong current of abuses and vices which may break in upon them . Societies formed by charity for the suppression of various vices are honorable in their purposes , and laudable in their exertions . They check , at least , an inveterate evil , by a system of temporary restraints . Thus , intemperance , the base mother of many other vices , may , in some degree , be restrained , through the vigilance of those respectable societies . But this perhaps is the most that can be expected . The evil , to a great degree , will remain . Great precaution may likewise put a similar check upon other abuses . But restraints and checks , salutary as they are , will soon lose their power over a crowded population , as has been proved by the experience of all countries . The moral influence of individuals decreases proportionably with the augmentation of numbers . A numerous population is , undoubtedly , one of the true causes of national prosperity , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these allies it annihilates that moral force , which is and must he the basis of popular governments . Rome , and more especially the Grecian republics , disregarded this principle and their crowded population became , consequently , a great calamity to them , of which , at various times , they attempted to rid themselves , by encouraging the surplus of the people to seek a new home in different climes of Europe , Asia , and Africa . But the extermination of an evil can never be effected by measures of temporary benefit . Military force , when all other means prove ineffectual , has generally taken the place of moral force , and terminated in licentious despotism ; an infallible sign of moral debility and the entire loss of freedom . It is a most useful study to investigate the origin of such evils as // have been prejudicial to republics of all times and countries , in order to avert them from our own . How accurately the political forms and governments of the ancient states were known to the framers of the constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records of their deliberations ; and the result of their labors shows , how well they have succeeded in erecting the republican fabric on a highly improved plan . Its maintenance in its primitive purity is committed , as the most sacred trust , to the discretion of each successive generation ; whose duty it is to do something , for the promotion of humanity , as a legacy for ages to come . Whoever has looked deeply into the interior of the ancient republics , will discover the origin of their dissolution , in the neglected education of the youth . We are dazzled by the splendor of some shining characters , which appear in the decline of most of the popular governments of former times , and this circumstance sometimes leads to an erroneous inference in favor of the high mental improvement of the majority of the people . But we forget that luminous bodies shine the brighter for the surrounding darkness . A large majority of the Grecians , in the time of Demosthenes , and by far the greater part of the Romans , after Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tyranny raises her iron sceptre over ignorance ; liberty rests on knowledge . For knowledge is power , and liberty , founded on such power , is the purest liberty ; but without this , it soon degenerates into licentiousness . Sound knowledge expands the mind , strengthens virtue , enlarges the sphere of liberty , and is in fact its very soul . The understanding , like the soil , is softened , improved , and rendered fertile , by constant and industrious cultivation , that is , by learning and thinking ; while it becomes hard and sterile by negligence . A solid and liberal education , therefore , guided by religious and moral sentiment , is the most invaluable boon that a country can confer on her youth . In our own country , universal education will contribute more than any thing else to stay the powerful currents of national jealousy , rushing against each other from the north and south ; to combine the energies of so great a nation , occupying an immense territory , in one common cause ; to strengthen the ties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which arise from our history , our institutions , and our prospects . What , then , can be of greater moment for an age of public // tranquility and domestic happiness , than to improve and to diffuse the means of education . What more worthy of imitation than the example of our fathers in the early ages of New England , who , relying upon the sound principle , that the maintenance of good literature tended most to the advancement of the flourishing state of societies and republics , secured by law , a hundred and sixty years ago , the blessings of public instruction for all their children ; and appropriated a considerable part of their means for the purpose of popular education . rfhey knew that the equal diffusion of general knowledge , through the mass of the people , is more powerful in awakening energies and liberal ideas , and in preparing for a great catastrophe , than the exertions of individuals even of the greatestTtalents , who have concentrated within themselves , and monopolized all the information which their age affords . With the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her liberties was laid . The same cause has pmduced the same effect in other countries . What fuel nourished the flame of liberty in the breasts of the modern Grecians , before it burst out into a general conflagration ? It is matter of recent observation , that large numbers of high-minded Grecians , after the bloody contest of Europe against the power of Napoleon had come to a fortunate issue , were seen in the Italian and German universities , gathering the seeds of knowledge to be sown in the new schools , established in various parts of their own country , the fruits of which the ignorant Turk did not foresee . The greatest zeal for the diffusion of knowledge was shown in the year 1820 , when Corfu , the university of Greece , began to flourish under the influence of the young men who had been educated in Italy and Germany . What else but the irresistible power of liberal ideas , kindling in the heart of Europe , and calling ex -- asperated nations to arms , anaihilated the unconquered forces of Napoleon ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the numerous literary institutions of Germany . They were more dangerous to him than her military array . Several of them sunk , in consequence of the innovation , which his policy led him to force upon them ; while those which survived them , kept alive the principle of resistance in those disastrous times , when arniies were routed , when courts were struck with perplexity and despair . Whoever is acquainted with the spirit of German education in universities , knows how // direct the influence is , which the instructers exercise over their hearers . The exchange of liberal ideas was , in spite of the secret police , never more rapid and more general than in the two years p* ' ***ious to the great events of 1813 and 1814 , in which the hurricane rose to such a height as to sweep down almost at a blast the fortresses of military oppression . Such are the effects of knowledge , which in its very nature revolts at tyranny slowly but surely . We all know how much our own independence owes to this eternal truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of others , impose the highest obligations on each succeeding age . The talent must be improved and doubled , and not be transmitted from age to age unaugmented . Has this been done by us in proportion with the advancement of the other interests of life ? A careful examination , recently held on that important subject , will convince every impartial observer , that popular education has not only been stationary for a long time , but that it is even on the decline . The causes are apparent . There are no adequate means to prepare an instructer specifically for his profession ; arid this all-important department is entirely left to chance . Where can an instructer be educated , arid study the principles of his art ? A public institution for this purpose does not exist in this country . Private efforts , which have been made , are highly honorable in themselves , but have as yet had little effect , for want of encouragement and patronage . The legislatures of the different states should consider this subject with greater earnestness , and should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taste can not be primary objects of political institutions . They should feel , that the education of youth , on which the xvelfare and destiny of the state depend , is a primary object of their attention . It is an undoubted fact , that a teacher needs as serious and thorough a preparation for his practice , as a divine , or lawyer , or physician for his ; and education is surely as of great public utility , as any of the professions which are dependant on it . In fact the standard of these professions will be raised , in proportion to the general improvements in education . Great dissatisfaction has , in different parts of the union , been expressed with our public institutions for the purpose of preliminary education , that is , such as precedes the study of the professions . The chief objection to them appears to be , that they are too limited in their literary sphere , not sufficiently // popular in their spirit , and inadequate to satisfy the interests of the present state of society , whose claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . The defects in the present organization and modes of instruction of our colleges are well known , and have , in some instances , been the subject of serious discussions . A few alterations in the old system have been adopted in consequence of these discussions , and an enlargement in the plan of usefulness has recently been attempted in Harvard college to bring it nearer to the model of a university . But the very nature of a university requires , that the study of the professions should form its basis and its principal object , to which all other pursuits ought to be placed in remote or immediate relation , as contributing to the liberal education , or to the ornamental accomplishments of a professional student . In this respect , also , the new institution of London , strictly speaking , does not possess the qualifications of a university , however extensive and excellent its plan may otherwise be . The statement lately published by the Council of that establishment , explanatory of its nature and object , shows that the studies , which constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional course , are the leading object , and occupy the first division of the seminary the second division comprehends the various branches of polite and general literature ; and under the last head are arranged those subjects which belong to legal and medical education . In regard to the legal department in that establishtnent , though its success may be considered as certain , with the extent of its present means , that success will be perhaps more owing to the inherent t*mptatious of the legal profession in England , than to the adequacy of the system pursued in the London university , in a philosophical point of view . The profession of medicine is , in fact , the only one , for the benefit of which great efforts and effectual provisions have been made . We have had occasion to speak in the preceding article of the state of medical education in England . London , like other large cities , concentrates all the advantages , from which alone the systematic knowledge of this science , and medical skill and experience can be derived . The success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now lecturing on the medical sciences in different parts of that immense city , will place this dleparttnent above all other establishments of the kind in Great Britain . Nothing exceeds the efficacy of the united // powers of able men stimulated to the utmost exertion of their faculties , by closer rivalship , larger emolument , and wider reputation . ' There is one inconvenience in the system of the London institution ,  --  the entire exclusion , not only of theology , but of any religious instruction or discipline whatever . Necessity , it is true , produced this defect . For a great majority of persons dissenting from the established church , render a uniform system of religious education far less practicable in England than in Scotland , which has but a small minority of dissenters . Since the fundamental principle of the institution is , that it shall be accessible to students of all religious denominations , and not exclude dissenters , as Oxford , or admit them under degrading restrictions , as Cambridge , it has been found utterly impossible to introduce the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan , or giving offence to the public . The education of the clergy of the established church is , of course , left to Oxford aud Cambridge , which offer superior advantages for that purpose . The greatest claim , however , which the London institution has on the gratitude and patronage of the English public , is the good preliminary education it affords to those who intend to devote themselves to the learned professions of law and medicine . The extravagant abuses into which the practice of these two professions has sunk , on account of the want of a liberal education , which alone renders men , engaged in those professions , worthy of the confidence the public must place in them , will , no doubt , under the influence of the new establishment , gradually decrease , and finally , as far as possible , be abolished . It is , indeed , matter of great surprise , that England has , till now , borne with the existing state of things , without the least effort to obviate its pernicious tendency . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact , that among the whole number of physicians , only one hundred ; among the six thousand members of the College of Surgeons , only six ; and among the eight thousand attorneys , only eight , are graduates of either of the English colleges . Does this fact leave any doubt in regard to the causes , that have operated upon the present state of the English popula-tion ? But we return to our more immediate subject . The great solicitude expressed by Washington , in the last days of his eventful life , on the subject of scientific education in this coun // try , shows the depth of his philosophical mind , the extent of his philanthropy , and his ardent desire to secure the welfare of lis country by giving a salutary impulse to all its great interests . The subject , which has , several times , been submitted to the consideration of Congress , and is , at present , acknowledged by many to be of paramount importance , the establishment of a national university , in a central part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following expressive words , as written in his will ; It has always been a source of serious regret with me , to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for the purpose of education , often before their minds are formed , or they had mibibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own ; contracting , too frequently , not only habits of dissipation and extravagance , but principles unfriendly to republican government , and to the true aud genuine liberties of mankind , which thereafter are rarely overcome . For these reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised , on a liberal scale , which would have a tendency to spread systematic ideas through all the parts of this rising empire ; thereby to do away local attachments and state-prejudices , as far as the nature of things would , or indeed ought to admit , from our national councils . Looking anxiously forward to the accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is ( in my estimation ) , my mind has not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the establishment of an university in a central part of the United States , to which the youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof , may be sent for the completion of their education , in all the branches of polite literature , in arts and sciences , of acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good government , and ( a matter of infinite importance in my judgment ) by associating with each other , and forming friendships in juvenile years , be enabled to free themselves , in a proper degree , from their local prejudices and habitual jealousies , which have just been mentioned , and which , when carried to excess , are never-failing sources of disquietude to the public mind , and pregnant of mischievous consequences to the country , under these impressions , so fully dilated . ' Had this noble plan been carried into effect at a period , when the evils foreseen by the father of his country were still at a greater distance than they are now , the Union would , at the // present time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intuitive perception anticipated . One generation would have grown up , the children of this benign , intellectual parent . How much fierce contention , arising from the insanity of party spirit and mercenary politics , might have been spared ! But we trust that it is not yet too late for the accomplishment of the end , notwithstanding the powerful tendency of the separate states to an insulated political existence , and the multiplication of powerful local interests , which make it next to impossible to devise acceptable plans for any object of general concern . The course of these remarks now leads us to some observations on the nature , sc6pe , and usefulness of universities , especially of those established on the continent of Europe . The richness of this subject must lead us to be brief , in dwelling on the separate topics comprised in it . Our remarks will be general , with a view to afford our readers an opportunity of discussing the comparative merits of the literary institutions of different countries , in such a manner , as may assist in rendering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , attracted the attention of the English public ; What most effectually administers to the present wants of the nation ? The institution of new universities on a different plan , or the enlargement of the plan of the old ones ? ' We begin with an historical sketch of universities in general , to which we shall annex a concise description of a German university . The latter division of our subject may perhaps be postponed to a future number of this journal . Universities were , originally , privileged communities of instructers and students , invested with limited or unlimited power of establishing statutes and laws for their discipline and modes of teaching ; with the rights of exercising their own jurisdiction ; of appointing magistrates , instructers , and other academic officers from their own body ; of conferring degrees , and of sending delegates to the seat of government . They , besides , enjoyed immunity from certain taxes and other onerous duties , and were independent in all their proceedings , as far as they did not interfere with the law of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great abuse and extravagance . Italy , the mother of universities , first bestowed these liberal advantages on Bologna , the oldest literary establishment in Europe . Theodosius the younger , laid the founda // tion of the Inst it uto delle Scienze in that city , of which the study of the law was the main object , as early as the year 425 . The period , however , at which Bologna assumed the constitution of a university , is to he dated from 1140 , when the legal faculty began to confer degrees on distinguished members of its community . At this time and during the three subsequent centuries , similar Italian colleges constituted themselves into bodies , and were endowed by the pope or by princes . Padua , Lucca , Pisa , Pavia , Parma , Florence , Cremona , Mautna , Milan , and Siena , once famous seats of learning , and rich colonies of scholars , have , ages since , passed through all the stages of existence , and have either declined , or are now lingering under a jealous or despotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first experiments of this kind , which not rarely , however , disturbed her own tranquillity , and involved her states in considerable dangers , against which other countries could guard themselves , by limiting academic liberty , and by reducing the too great prerogatives of the students . The legal privileges and exemptions of the academic population have been nowhere greater than at Padua , surnamed la Dotta . Some thousands of students , divided into distinct nations ( a general custom of the oldest universities on the continent of Europe ) , were not only exempted from paying duties , taxes , and tolls , but the public treasuries even granted them compensations for everything of which they happened to be robbed . The little restraint , under which an indulgent discipline placed them , and the independent spirit with which they managed their own affairs , often extorted bitter complaints from the inhabitants of the cities in which the universities were established . The students at Padua elected the representatives of their nations , the president and counsellors of the university , and , for some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consequences resulting from this wild extravagance , were severely felt by the rulers , who had proceeded with an inconsiderate liberality , in order to procure popularity to their institutions , principally among foreigners , who were allured by greater privileges than the home students . The early records of Bologna inform us , that the students from the north of Europe were placed on an equal footing with the senators of that city . The numerous literary institutions of Spain , venerable for their antiquity , flourished when everything else was flourishing // in that beautiful country . The same causes that have imparted a torpor to her political frame , have benumbed her mental energies . Several of her universities have . disappeared , as that of Toledo , in New Castile , since 1808 , formerly celebrated for its medical faculty . Others have been stationary for centuries , or declining , as that of Salamanca in Leon , of Barcelona in Catalonia , and of Santiago in Gallicia . Ecclesiastical education is their principal object . The hierarchical government , watching over their constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter within their walls . The same observation applies to Coimbra , the only university of Portugal , transferred to that city in 1308 from Lisbon , where it had been in operation since 1291 . It contains , however , in spite of the wretched political state of the country , one thousand students , and all the requisites of a good university , except the spirit . The most richly endowed universities of Europe are , as is well known , Oxford and Cambridge , the only establishments of the kind in England , before the recent organization of the London institution , the success of which is already such as to satisfy the most sanguine hopes . Oxford surpasses Cambridge in the amount of its funds and revenues , and in the extent of its privileges . Oxford has nineteen colleges and six halls ; Cambridge , but twelve . Oxford has nearly three thousand students ; Cambridge , one thousand five hundred . The library of Oxford is said to contain , besides thirty thousand manuscripts , five hundred thousand printed volumes ; that of Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the city , four delegates to Parliament ; Cambridge , two . Both universities , however , have , from the time of their foundation ( Cambridge adopted its present constitution in 1280 ) to this day , faithfully defended and preserved their independence in the administration of their affairs . Their jurisdiction , in fact , not only extends over their own academic population , but partly , also , over the cities in which they are established . This prerogative , together with the right of sending delegates to parliament , is peculiar to England , in which the other parts of Great Britain have no share . The university of Dublin has never risen to great notice , although its graduates are admitted ad eunde2n at Oxford . It has hut one building , with three hundred students living in it . The Irish gentry , from motives of pride and fashion , still continue to prefer the English colleges . Theological education // for the Roman catholic church , is conducted with success in the royal college of St Patrick , at Maynooth , in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is most thorough at Edinburgh , the first of the universities of Scotland , which are both schools and colleges , as the English universities formerly were . The college was founded in that city in 1681 , and has been particularly famous , at all times , for distinguished professors in the medical department . A large huilding , for the use of the university , was commenced in 1789 , hut is not yet finished . The library contains hut fifty thousand volumes , and the number of students is ahout one thousand seven hundred . The classical High School , in the same city , teaches the preliminary branches of knowledge requisite for admission into colleges . Great exertions have been recently made for the improvement of the system of education at Glasgow ; and the late professor Jardine describes its success , as chiefly owing to the heneticial influence , which public lectures derive from private tuition . But the general acquaintance possessed in this country of English institutions of every description , leads us to pass the more hastily over them all , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany are very different from those of Great Britain , in their general spirit and their modes of instruction . Paris may justly be called the prototype of the literary institutions of Germany ; and these again have become models for the universities of Holland , the Netherlands , Denmark , Russia , and Poland . A brief sketch , therefore , of the rise and progress of the university of Paris , can not but give pleasure to those who take an interest in the advancement of learning . This institution owes its fame and prosperity to the liheral principles , on which its constitution rests ; principles , that will be the main spring of success , wherever they are used for a good purpose , and put into vigorous operation . Paris exhibited an illustrious example of a free and independent community of instructers and students , who had constituted themselves into several bodies , without the aid or interference of the royal government , as early as the beginning of the twelfth century . A number of literary men , hy the novelty of their lectures on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hy the charms and usefulness of their instruction , attracted crowds of pupils not only from France , hut from many other countries of Europe , // which their celebrity had reached . No princely influence exercised power over its origin ; no charters were petitioned for ; no grants and privileges requested . The professors , in the successive ages , established their rights , and confirmed their prerogatives , by their own zeal and fidelity , and framed their own constitution , which met with the tacit assent of the higher authorities ; till king Philip Augustus acknowledged and sanctioned their jurisdiction , and proclaimed their independence of all royal courts . In the beginning of the thirteenth century ( 1206 ) the professors of the various departments of science and art , who had hitherto formed several bodies , and elected their several presidents , formally agreed to choose one president in common . From this time they formed one community . The students of the institution , then for the first time styled universitas magistrorum et scholarium , were divided into four nations , the French ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Norman , and the English , to which last the Germans , and those from countries north of Germany , belonged , and which was afterwards styled the German . Each of these four nations , so called , had its own principal ( procurator ) , its own treasury , and its own statutes and laws , and was considered as a literary association or fraternity . The first instructers in Paris did not receive salaries from the state . Regular professorships and fixed salaries were unknown before the sixteenth century . The students paid certain fees for each lecture , and attended , at their own discretion , as many as the plan of their studies required . The pecuniary advantages derived from lecturing , depended exclusively on the knowledge , ability , and popularity of the teachers . A man of talents and high reputation commanded a large audience , which procured him an ample income . The early records of Paris mention , also , liberal presents occasionally offered to the most eminent instructers , by the magistrates of the city , who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the permanent residence of distinguished literary characters , as the greatest ornaments of their metropolis . The rapidly increasing number of students and instructers , however , rendered , on the part of the government , several regulations necessary for the security of the city . An encroachment upon the academic rights , and a public offence , for which the due satisfaction , solicited by the principals , was refused by the royal court , exasperated the students , and occasioned a rebellion , the re // suit of which was , that , in 1229 , the greater part of the instructers and students quitted Paris . Several of the instructers , men of great talents and great fame , accepted the liberal offers of Henry the Third of England , and went over to Oxford . The French government , soon conscious of its obstinacy , felt deeply the loss it had sustained , and proposed a reconciliation , which was effected through the mediation of Pope Gregory the Ninth . The rights and privileges of the university were now established with greater firmness , and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the energies of the university , and it shone forth with brighter lustre than ever , under the supervision of the government . The origin of academic degrees , and of the faculties , is involved in obscurity . The first doctor of divinity is said to have been nominated in 1150 . It is , however , an unquestionable fact , that examinations , disputations , and promotions to the highest honors , were common as early as in the beginning of the thirteenth century , and indispensable for a public teacher . In order to maintain the authority and dignity attached by the first professors to their stations , the state and the then existing faculty of the seven liberal pursuits *facultas artium ) , namely , grammar , dialectics ( logic ) , rhetoric , music , arithmetic , geometry , and astronomy , passed a law , which required evidence of the competency of any man , who offered himself as an instructer , either public or private . For this purpose , the aspirants were obliged to submit to several successive examinations ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications , an appropriate degree was conferred on them , under certain solemnities and ceremonies , congenial with the spirit of the age . A graduate of the lowest degree was called baccalaureus , and , by virtue of this rank , allowed , under the protection of the academical laws , to give private tuition to the students . He himself derived as great benefits from the performance of his duties , as the pupils did from receiving his instructions . For the continuation of his studies soon enabled the baccalaureus*to aspire , by a second examination , to the degree of a licentiatus , which procured him a license to appear before the public , as an accomplished instructer , no longer under the control of the laws of the faculty ; and after the payment of a certain amount of money for the insignia of his new station , he became the colleague of the professors , and partaker of all their rights and privileges , and // bore the name , at Paris , of artium liberalium magister ; at Bologna , of pitilosophice doctor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The philosophical faculty of the seven liberal pursuits maintained the preeii*ineiicc of rank and honor , even after the incorporation of the faculties of theology , law , and medicine . But soon after this union , intellectual superiority yielded , in civil and political preponderance , to her younger , more prac* tical sisters . The four nations remained in the possession of the facultas artiurn , and continued to elect four procuratores , who , together with the deans of the faculties , represented the university , under the executive power of the president . Thus early did Paris enter upon the splendid career , which has , in the course of centuries , operated so favorably on the character of man , and all the civil and political institutions of the civilized world . It has undergone many temporary changes and serious misfortunes , the greatest of which was its total abolition during the French revolution ; but it , likewise , has enjoyed the constant veneration of the kings of France , who have distinguished it by a liberality almost incredible . The restoration to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has now five faculties , namely , of theology , law , medicine , philology , and of the natural sciences . The number of students is about four thousand . The public lectures are gratis . Paris contains , moreover , four colleges , each of which is larger than the largest college in America . The national university of France had already assumed a regular and solid form , when the German emperors undertook the foundation of similar institutions . Accordingly , Charles the Fourth copied the constitution and organization of Prague and Vienna from that of Paris , rather than from the Italian and English universities . Even the ancient division into four nations ( namely , into those of Bohemia , Poland , Bavaria , and Saxony ) , was retained in both cities . A contest for preeminence among these four nations , caused at Prague an emigration of several thousands , who established a university at Leipsic , and divided themselves into four nations , those of Meissen , Saxony , Bavaria , and Poland ; which division is still preserved at Leipsic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a strange anomaly in the present order of things . None of the other numerous German universities , founded since the end of the fifteenth century , has admitted that division . The privileges // granted to the oldest institutions , were of a very comprehensive nature , including legislative power , which has since been taken from them . Nor has political precaution thought it consistent with prudence , to confer this power on any of the new ones . There is , in other respects , a great diversity in the rights of the various establishments ; yet an independent jurisdiction and free choice of new modes of teaching are common to all . The popes confirmed , sanctioned , and protected these privileges for three complete centuries. , After the destruction of the power of the popes in Germany , by the success of the Reformation , the emperor succeeded to their authority over the universities ; and since the dissolution of the German empire by Napoleon , every petty prince possesses and exercises it within his own jurisdiction . Two ever memorable events breathed a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ends ; the invention of the art of printing , and the reformation of Luther . The vast multiplication of books , since the invention of the art of printing , has shortened the time formerly spent in a professional course of study , and has brought the scattered intellectual treasures of every science under one comprehensive view , so as to be easily surveyed by the student , who is thus led more directly to the sources of knowledge . Seven years , at least , were , before that period , necessary to attend upon and to write professional lectures . Soon afterwards the whole academical course was finished in six years , and then in five years ; the same time , which is still devoted to ecclesiastical education in Ireland and other Roman catholic countries . At present , four years are sufficient at Glasgow for the same studies ; and a course of law and medicine is completed in four years at Paris , Padua , Barcelona , and Coimbra . The regular time of professional study in protestant Germany is three years , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is spent in other liberal pursuits , and in the acquisition of general information . Difficult , indeed , would be the task of obtaining , in so short a space , the large amount of knowledge required by the governments , for admission to the various offlees in civil life , unless the student entered the university rich in preliminary acquirements . Accordingly , the German schools , gymnasia , or academies , lhy a solid foundation of thorough classical knowledge , mathematics , logic , history , geography , and , as there is in that country no such intermediate // establishment as a college , include all those studies that are pursued in the English institutions of that name . The universities are established iu Germany for the purpose of professional education , accompanied by all the auxiliary branches of art and science , which are of equal importance , and have an equal claim on public patronage , with the professions . Dr Johnson 's positive remark , that the invention of the art of printing had completely destroyed the value of lectures , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized on the same plan ; but it is most erroneous in respect to the continent of Europe , especially Germany , where lectures are the very soul of instruction , and the spring of the rapid success and celebrity of her literary institutions . The art of speaking well before an audience on a scientific subject , is , on account of the honor attached to that art , and on account of the great competition in all the branches of science , wrought up to the same degree of perfection , as with us the art of speakin' well at the bar . The interest which the instructer feels in his subject , and the animation which he shows in explaining it , operate most powerfully on the hearers . Lectures read , can , for want of this animation , have but an indifferent effect . The branches of theology and law , logic , philosophy , mathematics , history , general literature , natural history , belleslettres , are and must he communicated to the auditors , by means of that academical art . Manuals , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attendance on lectures , either by a previous perusal , or subsequent reperusal of the subject in question ; but without the animating influence of oral communication , a scientific compendium will remain a dead letter , which the memory perhaps retains , but which does not enlighten the intellect . Let the faithful instructor have unlimited freedom in his department , and let him elevate it by constant application , fervent zeal , and external encouragement . The injuries done to the advancement of learning , by laws or habits confining the acquisition of a science to the study of a l ) articular book , or some established method , are sufficiently known from the history of colleges and universities . Sir Isaac Newton 's synthetical modes of teaching , in his time the best method in Europe , were secured to Cambridge by the institution of the mathematical tripos . The consequence of this has been , that this science has become stationary in England , while the continental nations , who are not restrained by any // laws or text-books in their modes of instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and carried it to greater perfection . The honors , however , that are held out at Cambridge to students of a certain proficiency in mathematics , have powerfully operated on ambition , in that department , although they have repressed the other studies , for which no adequate encouragement existed . The classical tripos recently established in the same university , for the purpose of restoring the balance , does not seem as yet to have proved successful . The neglect of the art of oral communication has frustrated all attempts at procuring popularity for philosophical pursuits at Oxford and Cambridge . Dr Whately complains bitterly of the fact , that the study of logic , which is one of the most popular pursuits in the German universities , could never gain ground at Oxford . The cause of this lies in the organization of the English colleges , where the professors are in the situation of petty , comfortable monarchs , who have no competitors to fear ; and where the tedious labor of training and hearing recitations ( a labor entirely unknown in German universities ) devolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiGh an English professor , in reading his course of lectures , can derive excitement . It has.frequently been remarked , that the prohibition of receiving a fee from the students , has reduced the lectureships at Oxford and CarnbriQ , e to sinecures . In the present state of affairs , observes an intelligent reviewer , the professor can neither hope for remuneration of a pecuniary nature , nor for fame , nor , above all , for the proud consciousness of usefulness . His powers , whatever they be , will remain a secret to himself ; extraordinary exertion is out of the question , and his faculties must be stinted in their growth , for want of that genial and vivifying principle , which alone can expand them into full maturity . The effect of the Reformation , to which we attributed another impulse given to the progress of the sciences , has manifested itself most satisfactorily in the Protestant universities of Germany , which , since the beginning of the eighteenth century , may be considered the first in Europe . Previously to this period , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ruin , by the general devastations of the thirty years ' war . It is a well known fact , that Germany surpasses all other countries , both in the number and excellence of her universities ; and no country is under greater obligations to such insti // tutions , than she is to hers . Thirty years ago she could boast of more than forty universities in a prosperous condition. * Seriously affected by the wars of the French revolution , the flourishing state to which most of them have again arrived , since the restoration of peace in Europe , must be highly gratifying to every philosophic observer . German universities have , at all times , been objects of great curiosity and deep interest to travellers of different countries . Intelligent foreigners , who have had an opportunity of forming an intimate acquaintance with their scope and excellence , and who , for this reason , ought to be considered as competent judges , have expressed the highest admiration for them . Englishmen , who seldom learn to look , with an impartial eye , beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preference in this particular to Germany , whither they repair for the purpose of finishing their education . It is true , they have sometimes attempted to sti matize their unruly spirit , which , however , is made to appear in a very invidious light , from the dishonest and exagg crated reports of the public prints and books of travels . It is not to be wondered at , that occasional riots take place in cities , where , not rarely , two thousand students , between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four , are as- * We annex here a list of the most distinguished of them ; some of which are now annihilated , while others have since been added to the number . Prague ( 1348 ) , Vienna ( 1356 ) , Heidelberg ( 1386 ) , Cologne ( 1388 ) , Erfurt ( 1392 , annihilated in 1816 ) , Leipsic ( 1409 ) , Rostock ( 1419 ) , Greifswalde ( 1456 ) , Freiburg(1457) , Triers ( 1472 ) , Ingolstadt ( 1472 , since 1802 transferred to Landshut ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1798 ) , Wittenberg ( 1502 , united with Halle since 1815 ) , Frankfort ( 1506 , united with Breslaw since 1810 ) , Marpurg ( 1527 ) , Dillengen ( 1549 ) , Jena ( 1558 ) , Helmstaedt ( 1576 , annihilated in 1809 ) , Altdorf ( 1578 , annihilated in 1807 ) , Wurzburg ( 1582 ) , Giessen ( 1607 ) , Rintela ( 1621 , annihilated 1809 ) , Strasburg ( 1621 ) , Salzburg ( 1623 , annihilated in 1810 ) , Bamberg ( 1648 , annihilated in 1804 ) , Kid ( 1665 ) , Inspruck ( 1672 , annihilated in 1810 , and reCstab-. lished in 1814 ) , Halle ( 1694 ) , Breslaw ( 1702 ) , Goettingen ( 1734 ) , Erlangen ( 1743 ) , Berlin ( 1810 ) , Bonn ( 1818 ) , Munich ( 1825 ) . The organization of the German universities was adopted by Alexander in establishing ( 1803 ) a new military university at Dorpat , for the henef*t of the four provinces of Finland , Livonia , Esthland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , was organized in a similar manner ( 1816 ) . The same spirit prevails in Copenhagen . Leyden ( 1575 ) , and other institutions of Holland , formed themselves in imitation of Paris , which example was followed by Utrecht ( 1634 ) , and other universities of the Netherlands . // sembled in the full bloom and vigor of youth . Unfavorable judgments have also been formed by superficial observers , from the appearance among the German students of many , for the most part foreigners , whose object is amusement and some general information , and who are free from the cares of a professional course of study . While this class of students is surrendering itself to all the indulgences of youthful excess , by far the greater part enjoy , in their closets , the purer delights of intellectual improvement . It is the former class of students , to which unprepared and heedless English travellers , generally , confine their acquaintance , either from an inability to perceive the interior organization and scope of German universities , or from the shortness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing their countrymen with anecdote and gossip . It is not to be denied , that there is more or less extravagance committed in different German universities ; but this is not to be considered as the measure of all the rest . The faults of one or two institutions can not be charged on all the others , which may owe their peculiar reputation to their freedom from prevailing vices . Thus the students of Halle and Jena have the vulgar practice of drinking an immense quantity of beer or ale , a practice which the genuine student of Goettingen breatly abhors . An air of decency pervades that city , which is its fairest prerogative above other universities . Since Goettingen is neither distinguished for commerce nor manufactures , the professors and students form the first rank of society , the inhabitants of the city being , in a great measure , dependent on both . Where the students are compelled to play an inferior part in society , as in Leipsic , a city in which the mercantile spirit has the preponderance ; or where they are lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich capital , as in the imperial residence of Austria ; or finally , where they are overbalanced by the luxurious habits of courtiers , and come into powerful collision with the officers of the royal army , as in Berlin ; their character inevitably conforms to their situation . Secret associations and clubs are rare in other institutions , and are at present unknown in Coettingen . Whenever they have , in a small degree , existed at this place , it has always been discovered , that they were brought to it by students who bad previously been at oilier universities ; they never originated in m . Conspiracies arise from imaginary or real oppression ; and since the University of Goettingen is the favorite daughter of // a government which carefully avoids all offence , and most zealously promotes its welfare ; its prosperity has very rarely been interrupted by any such serious disturbances , as have shaken other seats of learning . The only time , after the expulsion of Napoleon , at which Goettingen partook of the spirit of rebellion , then prevailing in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in 1817 . The number of students was then for a stort time reduced to seven hundred , but increased rapidly with each succeeding term , and in 1822 bad again risen to more than fifteen hundred , and has continued to rise ever since . The practice of duelling , the origin of which loses itself in the middle ages , is common to all the German universities . The laws enacted for the suppression of this evil , vary under the different governments , hut are generally ineffectual . Reprehensible as the practice is , it is there attended with less mischief than might be supposed . These contests present a praiseworthy combination of discretion and valor . They are fought with a peculiar kind of swords , in the use of which the young men generally display great dexterity , because they practise this art as a branch of gymnastics , in the schools of skilful masters , authorized by the government . The duels are , accordingly , for the most part , harmless , or inflicting now and then a wound in the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the body being carefully protected against all danger . The cause of these duels lies in a premature affectation of the delicate sense of honor , which revolts at the least offence . The transition of a youth froni the strict discipline of a German gymnasium to an university , leaves him independent , and his own master . The point of honor , therefore , with him , often takes a wrong direction , under the influence of the prevailing idea , that the students of the several states of Germany , or of the several nations of Europe , are the representatives of their respective states or nations , for whose glory they must fight , whenever their personal feelings are injured . Any improper remark is accordingly considered a provocation , and followed by a challenge . It is matter of regret , that these feelings are too inveterate to be remedied at once . They do not , however , injure the state . The government punishes all offences of this sort accordino- t law ; but its measures are too weakii* 60 the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ri0or with which the severest laws are // enforced in the military department , has made duels between officers of the army very rare . An equal severity has never been applied to universities . Its effect would be unquestionable . But as the fact now is , great surprise has been expressed by foreigners , that this spirit of chivahy expires with thc academical years . For at the entrance upon practical life , the young men devote themselves entirely to their vocation ; and a duel in civil life is as great a rarity in Germany , as it is in New England . The low practice of boxing , so degrading to a gentleman , is detested in Germany , as much as it is approved in Great Britain . Men of a professional education are individually engaged in distinct pursuits which claim their whole energy , in order to arrive at reputation , which is no easy task among the crowded population of Germany . From the time they leave the University , their predominant desire for literary distinction is directed towards a certain object ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every profession , and department of knowledge , all the intellectual powers are stimulated to their highest action . Hence they have raised learning , in all its branches , to that degree of usefulness which combines the soundest systematic ideas with profound practical knowledge . This latter position is proved by a number of the best improvements , discoveries , and inventions , in the enjoyment of which the whole civilized world now rejoices . Universality of knowledge , the highest aim of German ambition , and general independence and tolerance of opinions , absorb all private animosity and national prejudice . Liberality in discussing the merits of domestic and foreign affairs , either in a civil , political , or literary point of view , has given great popularity to their impartial decisions . Excellence of any kind , of any age , of any country , is ncknowledged and revered by them . In regard to literature , the Germans not only cultivate a taste for the classical productions of ancient and modern times , but they have , in fact , domesticated both , and imbibed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soften down the national hatred , with which political neighbors formerly regarded each other . Their 6enius and philanthropy have , among the learned portion of the different nations , produced that intellectual alliance , which the Holy Alliance must respect , in order to preserve the power of the laws , and the security of the government . A serious attack upon these intellectual rights would surely be followed by fatal consequen // ces . The rapid exchange of generous ideas given to the world as common property , through the medium of the public prints , and gaining vigor fin m the personal intercourse of men of different countries ; the highly improved state of navigation , the great facilities of travelling , the universal interests of commerce ,  --  all these causes have already been too powerful in their operation on civil society , and have produced a spirit too liberal , to be ever again subjected to the sway of absolute power . In this condition , the decrepid body politic of Europe may enjoy general prosperity under constitutional kings , while the western hemisphere rejoices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of which Europe is probably too old . The foregoing remarks on the general character of institutions for education , on their history in Europe , and on their peculiar spirit in the states of Protestant Gerniany , will prepare us for a more specific and detailed examination of some one of the Gerinan Universities as a specimen of the class . But this we are compelled by our limits to postpone to the next number of this Journal .
