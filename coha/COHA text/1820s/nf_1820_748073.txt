txt Fellow Citizens , I HAVE perused , with great satisfaction , the Address of your Society , which was transmitted to me by Mr. Crolius on the 29th of last November , and I am sensible that you had a right to expect an acknowledgment at an earlier period . As some apology for the delay , I take the liberty to mention , that since my retirement from New- York , in 1815 , I have wholly withdrawn from active business , except what concerned the management of a farm ; and as my correspondence has been very limited , I have been willing to wait for that development of the state of our public affairs , which the meeting of Congress would produce , before I expressed any opinion on the interesting subjects of the Address to which my attention has been invited . /z/ It is too evident , that during the last five years a great change has occurred in all the relations of property , throughout our country ; but it is observable , that at no period have the seasons been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people more tranquil and united , than at this time , when the suspension of business is so universal as to menace a subversion of the public industry . The present embarrassment extends to men who have been prudent in the management of their affairs , and embraces alike the industrious farmer , mechanic , manufacturer , and merchant ; the borrower and lender ; in short , every description of men , except the mere hoarders of money . The disorder is not local , but universal throughout our country . If greater distress is experienced in the Western States , than among the frugal inhabitants of New England , it is not because a greater abundance of money is circulating in these states , but owing to a more dense population and varied industry , by which the people are enabled more conveniently to supply their mutual wants , by a barter and exchange of commodities . Nor is the evil confined to the United States , but co-extensive , in different degrees , with the civilized world . If the condition of the different countries of Europe could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those regions which suffered most from the oppressions and extortions of war , ( without experiencing its devastations , ) and where the governments are at present administered with tolerable equity , have hitherto derived the greatest advantages from the peace ; while on the other hand , it is certain , that the victorious states are the most turbulent , uneasy , and distressed . The sudden and extravagant persecution of the Jews , in several of the Germanic cities , has probably no better reason than a suspicion that they possess and retain an undue proportion of the circulating medium . This , if true , is certainly a very venial error , when the state of commerce and the unjust restrictions of most governments , in respect to that people , are impartially considered . An effect so universal as the general stagnation of commerce and industry , must proceed from a cause of extensive and powerful operation . In my opinion , as it respects ourselves , it ought to be ascribed to the perhaps unavoidable connection which has long subsisted between our system of commerce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , it is far from my intention to advance a railing accusation against the government or people of that country : this would be wholly foreign to the purpose of this letter ; but as the evil of which we now complain has been long ac- cumulating , it is necessary that its origin should be distinctly traced . The peace which ensued the revolutionary war , in 1783 , left the country rich in glory , but greatly exhausted by its exertions . Two years afterwards we read of nothing from North to South , but complaints of hard times , debts and taxes , the want of a circulating medium , efforts to establish new settlements , insurrections against government and paper money , essays attributing the sufferings of the people to the illiberal system of British commerce and revenue , the imbecility of the confederation , the insufficiency of many of the remedies proposed and adopted , united with eloquent exhortations , recommending frugality , the establishment of domestic manufactures , forbearance in the collection of debts , combinations against the cupidity of British agents and factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National Government . It is indisputably certain , that it is owing to the distresses and alarming dangers of this period , that the formation of the Federal Government must be ascribed . Its avowed and well-understood objects were , among others , to restore and perpetuate public credit , and to establish manufactures and commerce , on sure foundations . Public credit , as being the basis of every social institution , received the first attention of the new government . Commerce and manufactures were also encouraged , and both were gradually improving . The first efforts of domestic industry were , however , feeble , as cotton was not then a staple production of this country , and as numerous flocks of sheep had not yet been formed . While the political systems of the United States were thus acquiring solidity , the elements of a great explosion were preparing in Europe ; and , to a view of the present condition of British and American finance , it is important to recollect , that a treaty was negotiated w r ith France , in the year 1786 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manufactures of the two countries , according to a fixed tariff of duties . The effect of this treaty was greatly to stimulate and increase the industry of England , and to depress that of France . Its influence was , indeed , so great , that though it was one of the most powerful causes of the French revolution , it enabled Mr. Pitt , in the same year , to propose and execute a plan for extinguishing the national debt of Great Britain . The effect of this system , was so to advance the British credit , that in 1792 , it had progressively arisen to a higher point of exaltation than it had ever attained , except during a short time prior to the war of 1755 , /z/ when the interest of money was low , and the national debt comparatively inconsiderable . Although the war against France , which commenced in the year 1793 , arrested the farther reduction of the debt , the system of finance continued , and the sinking fund was converted into an engine for supporting the market prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government was able readily to effect , in consequence of the high state of public credit , the disturbed condition of adjacent countries , the increasing manufactures of the nation , an active commerce , a powerful marine , and unexampled taxation . The year 1797 was distinguished by a great event , of which the consequences are still felt by Europe and America , and of which the most important results are , perhaps , yet to be developed . In that year , in consequence of excessive issues of paper , the bank of England was compelled to suspend its payment , in specie . This measure produced no explosion of British credit , as was by many expected . The circulation of the paper was supported by combinations of the opulent bankers and merchants , and by the spirit of the nation ; and the premier , with a profound knowledge of the principles of finance , dexterously applied these circumstances to augment the resources and power of the government . /z/ Although the bank notes were no longer exchangeable for specie , the private bankers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could command notes of the bank of England . These notes , of course , became the local money of the nation . Whenever appearances of a tendency to depreciation were observed , which was instantly indicated by the eourse of exchange with foreign countries , the excess of paper was withdrawn from circulation , and vested in funded stock . The prices of stock were preserved from sudden and great vibrations , by a steady application of the sinking fund to purchases of stock in the market . By the combined influence of this system , the paper money of England , aided by resources derived from the oppression of neutral commerce , became , during the war , the standard of value for the commercial world , and the government was thereby enabled to command and mortgage the whole of the property of the people ; to purchase the co-operation of foreign powers ; to accumulate a debt , and to exert a force never before wielded by a single nation . Soon after the French revolution commenced , the United States engaged in an active and lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly from manufactures . A surprising activity was , however , imparted to agriculture ; new settlements expanded in every direction , resting principally , /z/ if not solely , upon operations of foreign commerce for the sale of their produce , and for the importation of clothing and other articles of manufacturing industry . During most of this period , British finance rested on the basis of paper credit/ Though our commerce produced a greater supply of metallic money than it had done at any former period , yet this supply was deemed unequal to the demands of a growing commerce , extending settlements , and the improvements which were forming in every part of the country . This state of things led to the establishment of new banks , and was favoured by public opinion , from their tendency to increase the price of exports , and divide more equally , as was supposed , the profits of agriculture and commerce . The changes were gradual , and appeared to be safe , as the rates of foreign exchange were not essentially affected . It was sufficiently considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the exchange with foreign countries was regulated by a comparison of our currency with the paper credit of England , and not by that of the permanent standard of the world , and had been gradually decreasing in value . The embargo of 1 807 gave the first shock to this system . It is in the recollection of most men , how powerfully this measure affected all the relations of price and value throughout the civilized world . y The embargo , though injurious to some interests , was , in my opinion , advantageous to the country . It arrested commerce , which had generally become a losing concern ; it disengaged our merchants from a too intimate connection with British finance , and compelled them to settle their accounts ; it secured a great capital from the rapacity of foreign nations ; it disclosed the weak parts of our public policy ; above all , it was the cause of a great number of manufacturing establishments , which , though now inactive , can be easily revived with immense benefit to the country . It is unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that event became inevitable . The justification , perhaps sufficient , of the government is , that public opinion was not sufficiently matured for the adoption of these measures . During the embargo , a considerable commerce , though principally illicit , continued to be prosecuted . This , though greatly advantageous to Great Britain , was not highly injurious to us ; the exports served to sustain some demand for the produce of the country , and to weaken the force of the public discontents . After the war Commenced , the illicit trade became exceedingly pernicious . The imports were principally of British manufactures , for which payment was made wholly in money . It was to arrest the progress of this , trade , and not for the want of specie , that the banks of /z/ New- York and Philadelphia suspended payments in money . If this measure had been adopted at an earlier period , a great capital would have been preserved to the country , which was worse than lost by checking the progress of domestic manufactures , and diminishing the ability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments in specie , the public expenditures rendered the current money too abundant . A great number of new banks were also established by men who possessed neither capital nor experience , the credit of which rested solely on the breath of public opinion . When the war terminated , the navigation of the commercial world was principally divided between Great Britain and the United States . To supply the demands which its long continuance had occasioned , an active , though ephemeral commerce commenced . Its efforts to restore the equilibrium between supply and demand , price and value , which had been long disturbed by war , or suspended by force , have swept a great capital of the metallic money from Europe and America , to Asia , from which it will not soon , if ever , return . The scarcity of money has been farther increased by the wars in Spanish America , which have prevented the customary supplies of gold and silver from the mines . The states of Europe which have been most provident , have protected themselves from excessive importations , by restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the United States have been , in a great measure , suspended by those of Great Britain ; every where external commerce has been arrested , and the balloon of unsupported paper credit is descending to the earth . This summary review of historical facts has appeared to me necessary , before we contemplate our situation , and discern the remedies of which it is susceptible ; while it evinces that our embarrassments are not without precedent even in this country , it demonstrates how much the comfort , tranquillity , and peace of nations , are effected by systems of commerce and finance . It may be observed , that the price of stocks is now high , and that of most articles of produce low ; this indicates a stagnation of commerce , with confidence in public engagements . That though the circulation of money and of commodities is at present greatly diminished , bank notes are still the current money of the country ; this evinces the extent of credit . That exchanges are nearly at par with Europe ; this shows that our currency is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed , few of those which ever possessed any considerable sums of metallic money in proportion to their issues of paper , and which have also been honestly managed , have yet forfeited their credit . With these facts in view , I proceed to state , that , in my opinion , money , commerce , and credit , are governed by the following laws , except as they are varied by the power , or policy of governments : Money is the universal agent for regulating commerce , and at all times , and in all places , it is equal to the difference of the prices of the commodities , or articles of commerce exchanged . Where the prices of the articles so exchanged are equal , the agency of money during that time is dormant . Where the difference is great in proportion to the sum of money which can be commanded , the price of the articles exchanged is low , and the price of money proportionably high . The contrary relation takes place where money is more abundant than the articles sought in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , always correlative ; and , like the flux and reflux of the ocean , constantly tending to an equilibrium , but seldom at rest . Gold and silver are , with all civilized and commercial nations , the conventional signs of money . The properties which recommend these metals for this purpose are , that they are imperishable , divisible , without waste , uniform , and scarce , to which may be added , their intrinsic value in manufactures . /z/ It is the constant effort of all commerce to supply the wants of mankind on the cheapest terms ; to equalize the prices of money and commodities , and to reduce the balances thereon , to the least sums possible , payable in money . A par of commerce exists where the articles exchanged are equal in price . A par of exchange signifies equal masses of gold and silver in different places . Credit is the only substitute for money . It exists only in the reliance which is reposed in punctuality . Happily for mankind , the full advantages of this last refinement of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , and by individuals who unite wisdom with integrity . The inferences are , that a commerce mutually advantageous in different commodities may exist between two places having no money , or possessing it in very unequal proportions , with or without a resort to credit . That between two places , possessing only similar commodities , there will be no commerce , unless the prices are different , which will terminate when the prices become equalized by such commerce . The demand for exchange indicates the credit which has been obtained ; and its rate , the reciprocal demand for money and commodities , /z/ The rate of exchange , though generally , is not always regulated by deviations from the par of commerce . Public or private debts , taxes , extortions of government , new discoveries and inventions in short , any cause which renders money more profitable or safe in one country than in another , will attract it , independent of , and even contrary to , the influence of commerce . In countries which produce gold and silver , these metals perform the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different years , and to the fluctuations of commerce . But as gold and silver are at all times costly materials , of which the value is uncertain , the ingenuity of men , in modern times , has been employed in deriving substitutes , without varying the standard . Hitherto Great Britain and the United States have afforded the most successful examples of the use of credit . It however yet remains to be seen , whether the use can be guarded against great abuses ; and if so , what are the limitations required by justice and the public security . Credit , as a substitute for money , has been employed in the form of bills of exchange , bank notes , and bills of credit , issued on the faith of governments and corporations . Of these modes , that of bills of exchange is , by far fl the least exceptionable. /z/ The price or rate is determined by the relative value of money at the place where the bill is alienated , and that where it is made payable . This price is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce , and other causes , and is further regulated by the necessary expense and risk of transporting money to the place , from which an equilibrium can be established , at the least expense . Nothing more is , therefore , necessary , to render bills of exchange equal in all , and superior in many respects , to money , but to provide such penalties , in all cases where they are not punctually honoured , as will fully indemnify for disappointments . Bank notes , according to the original intention and proper use of these establishments , were merely tokens or evidences of equal sums of gold and silver left in deposit in the banks as places of security , from whence they could be claimed on demand . While they were , confined to the central points of commerce and exchange , they were highly useful , by increasing the activity and security of negociations , and by diminishing the risk , labour , and expense , attending receipts and payments of considerable sums in metallic money . It was soon discovered by the bankers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of sums reserved by their customers for personal expenses and small payments , amounted , in the aggregate , to a /z/ considerable capital , which they might safely add to the active stock of the community , without impairing the credit or security of their establishments , or affecting the course of exchange as regulated by commerce . Even within these limits , banks , if not positively advantageous , were not injurious to the public . The have , however , both in England and in this country , proceeded much farther . By issuing small notes , they have engrossed nearly the whole of the circulating specie , for which they have substituted bank notes , which have of course become the local money of both countries , the value of which money is regulated by the general laws which govern the rate of exchange . The inconvenience resulting from this state of things is , that whenever gold and silver are demanded by an unfavourable state of exchange , it can only be obtained from the banks , which are then compelled to recall their circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the exchange in their favour , and thereby avert the demand . When this change can not be effected as fast as the notes are returned for payment , the banks forfeit their credit , and subject the public to loss ; even when the credit of the banks is preserved , the oscillations between the plenty and scarcity of money , created by their operations , are more sudden , and perhaps in some degree more extensive , than would have happened if the course of exchange /z/ had been regulated , without the intermediate agency ol banks . But it ought not to be denied , that the banks , notwithstanding the mismanagement of many , and the frauds of some of these institutions , have been the means of preserving to the country a great specie capital , which would otherwise have been lost by the operations of commerce . This capital , with prudent management hereafter , is sufficient to reinstate our affairs . The stockholders are innocent sufferers by the mistakes which have been committed , and the public are bound in justice to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction of the errors of banks would be to impose gradual restraints on the issue of small notes , commencing with notes of one dollar , and increasing the restriction until it arrived at the limit required by public policy and the real interest of these institutions . A third mode of employing credit , as a substitute for money , is by issuing bills of credit on the faith of government or corporations . Upon this point , it must be sufficient to remark , that its use presupposes a deficiency of funds derived from revenue , or from loans on specific pledges of property ; and as the extent of the use is itself controlled by the principles which regulate the value of money and the rate of exchange , it must exhaust some part of these resources , which are in their /z/ own nature limited . Bills of credit are , therefore , at best , but a temporary remedy , adapted only to periods of public danger and difficulty . It is presumed that it has been sufficiently proved , that metallic money and its substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the joint and several agency of each are constantly exerted , either to increase or limit their reciprocal powers , and create an equilibrium or par . The activity of these powers is excited by the various wants of men . If cases can be imagined where these wants are fully gratified , or where their indulgence is restrained by force , commerce , credit , and money , must immediately cease . These observations lead to a brief examination of the present relations of commerce in this country , especially with Great Britain , as being the point to which our attention ought to be constantly directed . Without entering into minute details , it is sufficient to remark , that the estimated value of all our exports is about equal to those of our imports from Great Britain alone ; of course , the general results of all our commerce with the world center in that country . Of the articles which support the direct trade , a part only of those derived from the forest and from agriculture , are received ; those from the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Of all our exports , cotton is by far the most valuable /z/ article of commerce . The quantity is most abundant , the value the greatest ; at the same time it is the least perishable of all agricultural productions , and it likewise affords the most regular support to our navigation . Tobacco is a considerable article , not very liable to perish , but its fluctuating prices render it an unsafe production , both of agriculture and commerce . Of wheat the market is both limited and unstable . It is never received into Great Britain except during years of scarcity , and during such years wheat is commonly scarce in the northern states , where much more would be consumed if the prices were less fluctuating . Although it remains a considerable article of commerce , yet for the reasons which have been mentioned , it is becoming less and less an article of culture for domestic use as our settlements consolidate . On the subject of provisions generally , it may be remarked , that the paramount law of self preservation dictates to nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible . It is sufficient for the present purpose to show , that our imports from Great Britain exceed our exports to that country . In whatever degree they fall short , the deficiency must be supplied by our exports to other countries , and that , as between them and us , it must create an impoverishing commerce , which , if not somehow counteracted on principles which it has leen at- /z/ tempted to explain , will exhaust the money and credit of those countries , and then terminate . It is doubtless owing to this cause , and not to unfriendly motives , that our commerce finds so many obstacles . The relations of commerce between Great Britain and the world , and especially with this country , have , in my opinion , not been sufficiently considered . The power derived from the application of machinery , mechanical arts , and chymical discoveries , unquestionably renders Great Britain , for many purposes , the most efficient combination of men which ever existed . All this power is derived from the skill and labour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paupers , and unproductive inhabitants of every class , add nothing to , but greatly diminish its influence , and yet , with all this counteraction , it remains the first state in Europe . It is difficult to speak with truth , in terms which will not be deemed extravagant exaggerations , of the effects which certain modern discoveries and improvements have occasioned , and still more so , of the future consequences which they must produce . The discovery by Whitney , of a convenient mode of preparing green seed cotton as an article of commerce , has added more to the value of property in America than any other invention since the age of Columbus . The improvements in the Fabrication of cards and carding machines , wliich are of /z/ American origin ; the British inventions for spinning ) knitting , and weaving cotton and wool with the steam engine , in connection with various chymical and other scientific discoveries , have unquestionably enabled that nation to effect more than fifty millions of people could have accomplished without those inventions : and if the territory had permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have procured the means of comfortable subsistence for that number . I dare not express the belief I entertain of the increase of numbers , industry , wealth , comfort , and civilization , which these discoveries , when generally diffused among mankind , are destined in future ages to produce . The advantages of which the discoveries of the Ias6 fifty years are susceptible , and which have been constantly developing , are yet principally confined to Great Britain , and as the present condition of that country presents some views which are afflicting to humanity , they have been frequently considered as inevitable results of the manufacturing system . A critical view of the whole policy of that nation will however evince , that the distresses of the poor are wholly owing to other causes , and that , without manufactures , the government must have sunk under the pressure of its enemies . Of these causes a few onlv will be mentioned . /z/ All the vigilance , and much of the power of the go rernment , has been steadily exerted to restrain emigrations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local limits . The frequent wars and public debts have introduced excessive taxation ; and as a great proportion of the public burdens has been levied by excise duties , upon articles of consumption , the taxes have not been proportioned , either to the property or to the income of individuals . The corn laws , though well calculated to prevent great depressions in the prices of bread , and to enable the landholders to contribute liberally towards the expenses of government , have , in ordinary periods , increased the pressure upon the poor , and served to aggravate their misery and depress their spirit . The public debt has created a great number of annuitants , who add nothing to the public stock , and who introduce luxury , and its concomitants , poverty and vice . As these causes are sufficient to account for the increase of pauperism in England , it is manifestly unphi losophical to ascrib ethis evil to employments which encourage industry , order , docility , and the development of intellect ; these remarks must , therefore , be sufficient to vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality . The British government appears to be at present employed in establishing measures for regulating their public currency , and for reducing the public debt ; of the tendency of this system , it is important to all countries having commerce with England , and especially to this , to be well informed , and to take heed . It is not known what quantity of metallic money exists in Great Britain , nor what sum , if any , the government will deem it necessary to acquire , before the bank of England will be permitted to make payments in specie . It is however known , that gold and silver , and foreign exchanges , are now nearly at par ; that the public credit is unimpeached ; that the government possesses an immense revenue , and resources for supporting a great commerce , derived not only from domestic industry , but from extensive foreign possessions . If the government wish to accumulate gold and silver , they will so regulate foreign commerce as to create an exchange in their favour : if the pressure should bear directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some lucrative commerce , which will create a fund adequate to the demand : if this should be found impossible , specie will be drawn from our banks , and an equivalent sum of circulating notes will be recalled from circulation : if the pressure is made upon some other country with which we have commerce , this will at least diminish the profits of our trade with that country ; in any event , the final effect must be to ren- der it more expensive and difficult to pay debts already contracted in England . It shall , however , for the purpose of illustration , be supposed , that the British government perceive the necessity of commanding , by their commerce , a certain fund in gold or silver , and are willing to sacrifice for this purpose some part of the interests of their subjects in India , where they possess a paramount authority . In such case , it is certain , that the effect of the regulation would be , to depress the prices of all commodities at Calcutta and Bengal , and to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This depression of the prices of commodities , and increase of the value of money , might be equalized by exporting money from New-York , to be there expended in the purchase of Asiatic manufactures , which , when returned to this country , might procure wealth to the adventurers , but with an equivalent loss to the holders of like goods purchased at higher prices , and to the farther depression of the prices of American manufactures and the general industry of this country . If the money carried to England , in the case which has been supposed , should be placed in the bank of England , it would there remain wholly inactive , until the bank was authorized to commence payments in specie ; even in such case , it would not be withdrawn , if the foreign and domestic exchanges were in favour /z/ of the bank , and its credit remained unimpeached : if the whole should be withdrawn , and invested in some commerce or domestic business , lucrative to individuals , without impairing the property of the nation , it would so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of reducing the public debt would be precisely the same as an issue of bank notes , or other money , equal to the amount of debt redeemed . If the same amount should be applied to the extension of profitable manufactures , or to any other branch of national industry , without thereby impairing any other equivalent branch , it would form a new accumulation of wealth , power , and revenue : it might merely increase the price of the stock remaining unpaid ; and if this increase was accompanied by an unfavourable exchange with foreign countries , it would prove , that though the public credit remained unimpaired , and was , for the time , increasing , yet that some branch of commerce or industry was suffering and could receive no farther excitement by an increase of the circulating medium . To equalize the exchange , it would be necessary to retrench the circulating medium , by calling in some part of the loans which had been made by the bank ; if , notwithstanding this retrenchment , the activity of commerce and industry suffered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both would bear some diminution , or that when compared with the commerce and in- industry of rival countries , those of Great Britain Were relatively increasing . The question of expediency , how rapidly , and to what extent the public debt can be reduced , must therefore be governed by a view of all the effects which would follow from an equivalent increase of the circulating medium . Of its tendency to create an unfavourable course of exchange with foreign countries , there can be no doubt ; that this would soon be corrected by the operations of commerce , is equally certain While our banks retain a considerable fund of metallic money ; while the cultivation of cotton , and other productions which nourish British industry , and contribute to their revenue , are increasing , and especially while we are endeavouring to establish rival manufactories , it may well consist with a temporary policy to permit the exchange to remain at par , or even to decline in our favour : The first effect certainly would be , to stimulate commerce with this country , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , to increase our debts ; and when payment became necessary , in consequence of an unfavourable exchange on our part , to exhaust our banks , and render a still farther reduction of the circulation indispensable to the support of their credit . But whatever may be the expedients of a temporary policy , yet as commerce , credit , and money , when left to their natural operation , are governed by laws as invariable as those of gravitation , the time must arrive , when the resources of the British government will be limited , either by the policy , or by the poverty of other nations , to those means which can be derived from the industry of their own subjects . Such is the wonderful combination of that industry , that it is not easy to perceive its limits ; its effects , and the mode of application , can not however be concealed from observation . It ought to be assumed as a principle , that British commerce will remain restricted to such articles as are essentially connected with the support of the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed by necessity . A decline of British commerce may therefore be expected with all countries , which no longer produce the articles demanded , or which , entertaining similar views of public policy , will no longer permit them to be exported ; it will of course decline with the neighbouring countries of Europe , and will thrive only in countries of recent establishment , or of immature civilization . In proportion as British commerce is so regulated as to nourish particular branches of industry , will the public revenue operate directly or indirectly as a tax on such industry , and as a premium , or bounty in favour of the like industry in other countries , not subject to similar burdens . so This effect can be no otherwise counteracted than by superior skill derived from machinery , new inventions , or other like causes , and even this advantage will be diminished by a redundant population . That England is , in some degree , afflicted with this evil , can not be doubted ; that it is increasing , is probable ; the waste of superfluous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of the poor ; when the one can not be corrected , nor the other diminished , and when both , with the demands of government , are equal to the profits of industry and commerce , it is certain that they will have arrived to the acme , from which powerful and prosperous nations have hitherto commenced their decline . It will not be safe for any nation to presume that England has already arrived to this point , although several symptoms of approximation must have created inquietude in the government of that country . As the currencies of England and of the United States , essentially consist of credit in the form of bank notes , we are deeply interested in the results of British finance , as they may affect our commerce and the course of exchange with foreign countries . It is certain that our money must rise in value here at the same rate as in England , and unless great care is taken , it will depreciate with every deviation from the true standard . It has been seen that bank notes are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained in circulation by industry and commerce , of which the only true test is their convertibility into silver and gold . It also appears , from British accounts as published , that the notes issued by the bank of England , in 1797 , when payments in specie were first suspended , amounted to about eleven millions , and in December , 1817 , to more than twentynine millions sterling . What amount of notes were issued at different periods by private bankers is not known , but as their credit was sustained only by being convertible into notes of the bank of England , the whole amount in circulation ought to be added to twenty-nine millions , to ascertain the circulating money of Great Britain . As the business of many private bankers has been extensive , and as the trade of banking has at all times been sufficiently profitable to attract a great proportion of the national wealth , it is a moderate estimate to consider the circulating money or credit of Great Britain , as equal , at least , to sixty millions of sterling money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential point of inquiry : whatever may be the sum , as the exchanges at the dates of the last information , and the price of gold and silver bullion were nearly at par , they fully evince that the whole was required for the circulation of British industry and commerce . During the last two years , there has been a great /z/ suspension of commerce , which must have arisen , in a considerable measure , from operations of British finance . It is well known that the government is endeavouring to increase its metallic money , and to discharge some part of its debt . These objects tend to counteract each other ; but the government probably deems it necessary to accomplish both , so far , at least , as to make the bank of England independent of the vibrations of commerce , and to enhance the value and security of the national funds . The means for effecting these objects are limited only by the power of the government , and the degree of pressure which the people can bear : if , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least equal to sixty millions sterling , a less proportional reduction of the currency will accomplish any definite object , than will be necessary to counteract the pressure in countries where the circulation is less abundant ; hence arises the danger to this country , where the circulation is not only far less considerable , but is principally dependent on the credit of our banks . If the estimate before made is tolerably correct , it abundantly confirms the calculation , that British industry , exerted in manufactures , has increased in a triplicate ratio since the year 1797 : that the circulating notes of the bank of England have increased in that proportion is certain . /z/ A reduction of the amount of British money , to what it was in 1797 , would exhaust the circulation of Europe and America to such a degree , that if no equivalent supplies of gold and silver were cotemporaneously produced , the value of money might , for a time , be equal to what it was during the oppressive reign of Henry the Seventh . An event of this kind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of England could not bear the pressure , nor the government enforce the necessary reduction of credit . They may , however , enforce regulations which will be greatly inconvenient to rival countries , and they may judge that such regulations will promote their national interest ; that they may even mistake their own interest , is the less improbable , when we consider that the United States is at present their most profitable customer , and that our growth and prosperity are more owing to their wars and restrictions , than to any results of our own policy , uninfluenced by those events . It may now be proper to inquire into the truth of that principle , which asserts , that national industry and foreign commerce ought to be free from political regulations , and suffered to influence each other as private interest may appear to direct . The effect of every tax on an article of commerce or consumption is to increase the value , and most commonly the price of the article so taxed , and is , so far /z/ as it diminishes the consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation of commerce , and a violation of the principle . If any government should adopt this principle in its full extent , it would be compelled to assess all its taxes upon lands or other immoveable property . This was , in fact , the rule proposed by the French economists ; but as it would be insupportable in any nation , unless adopted as the system of all nations , it has for some time been exploded even as a theory , and it is now unnecessary to examine and prove its fallacy . The system of political economy , which has been most generally adopted in this country , is that of Dr. Adam Smith , which asserts that the revenue of individuals is derived from rent , profit , or wages ; that taxes ought to be levied in proportion to the ability of the people as derived from these sources ; and that industry and commerce ought to be left to pursue their unrestrained course , as being that which will result in the greatest prosperity of society . It was doubtless the object of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice of a great part of the systems of European nations , not excepting those of Great Britain . He however expressly admits , that it will be generally advantageous to lay a burden upon foreign , for the encouragement of domestic industry , whenever such encourage- /z/ ment is necessary for the defence of the country ; upon this principle alone , he vindicates the British act of navigation . The principle of this exception from the general freedom of commerce and industry , is all for which any American should contend , and all which ought ever to be permitted . That every man ought to be suffered to elect , or renounce his profession , to be exempt from monopolies and from partial and unequal taxes or restraints , is certainly proper . The only exceptions to this general liberty perhaps are , the sale of dangerous drugs and compositions , and of ardent spirits , which should be entrusted only to persons of discretion and responsibility . Though many of the illustrations of the principles of Dr. Smith proceed much farther , especially in respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it should be recollected , that these opinions were expressed prior to the French revolution , and before the effects of modern inventions on the industry of nations had been ascertained , and then , with a due allowance for the effects produced by these causes , a critical examination will evince , that every illustration was intended to be understood as subservient to the great principle of national security , in every form , in which that security could be endangered . /z/ Any other construction would , indeed , impute to tire learned author the absurd opinion , that with reference to the present condition of Europe and of the world , it is the interest of all nations to submit to the power of Great Britain , and for that nation to remain under the absolute control of a minor part of its population . Food , clothing , and iron , in the forms in which they are applied to human use , by civilized nations , are to us necessaries of life ; we can no better dispense with any one than with both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than enough : /z/ even at the present time , there is no scarcity in any district of our country . Of our grain , a large proportion is wasted by distillation , with a view to preserve it from perishing , and to render it a more convenient article of commerce . For clothing and iron we are , in a great measure , dependent on foreign countries , and the distribution of what we possess is rendered difficult by the present state of our currency . To preserve our national union , and to secure our country from the enterprises of foreign nations , it has been necessary to give an artificial expansion to our settlements . Our natural boundaries , embracing the valley of the Mississippi with its tributary rivers , and extending to the lakes and to the ocean , are sufficiently extensive to support one hundred millions of freemen , without any of those collisions , which an exces- /z/ sive population has a tendency to produce . The sales of our new lands have not yet defrayed the expenses of acquisition and defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumption of articles of foreign growth or manufacture . It has been proved , that this commerce is limited by the vendible productions of our industry , and that this industry is. in a great measure , stagnant , by being directed to objects which do not , and can not , support foreign commerce . The expenditures of our government , general and local , are now considerable , and must increase . To the national government is committed the public defence by sea and by land , and the support of public credit , on which repose all our strength and all our hopes . We owe a considerable debt , of which the interest is payable to foreign countries . Most of the national expenditures , therefore , tend to drain the interior country , and our oldest settlements , and thereby create a centrifugal movement to all our resources . o That this representation of the state of our affairs is true , will not be denied ; that it is sufficiently appalling to render a national effort , such , as more than once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous embarrassments , is , I hope , proved . If it fails to produce a conviction , that it is not safe to permit the passions and private interests of individuals to prescribe remedies for political evils : especially if , con- /z/ trary to the experience and practice of all nations , and to the undeniable fact , that it was chiefly for the purpose of enabling Congress to regulate money and commerce , and to encourage domestic industry , that the federal government was established , then the inference must be , that the founders of our nation have , at all times , been wholly mistaken , and that union , justice , security , and public welfare , do not in fact depend , as they believe , upon the wisdom and efficacy of social institutions , but , on the contrary , that public disorders will produce their best remedies , by the operation of sanative principles inherent in the nature of man . Though this doctrine is flattering to the pride of our nature , yet experience has evinced , that it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of patriotism , or of any real concern for public liberty . It was not thus that our fathers reasoned ; and if I do not greatly mistake , such opinions will afford no passport to popularity with the American people . Among the many proofs , that the tone of the public mind has not relaxed , the address of the Tammany Society of New- York , affords a striking example . It has been recently demonstrated , that the revolution itself was produced by a spontaneous effort of the American people ; and that the merit of the illustrious actors in that great event consists in the fidelity and perseverance with which they executed the resolutions of the /z/ public will . The revolution delivered us from foreign oppression , but left us without a national government . It required but a short period for consultation , before the people perceived the difficulties and danger of their situation . A convention was called : the result was deliberately ratified , and in two years a constitution was formed . When the first congress assembled , in 1789 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost the whole of the country north of the Ohio , were covered with their native forests . A few hundred troops were stationed on the north-western frontier ; these composed the whole military force . There was no semblance of a navy , and the confederation possessed neither money nor credit . I pass over the arduous duties which attended the organization of the systems of government , both domestic and foreign , till the year 1797 , when the national feelings were strongly excited by aggressions on our commerce . It is within my knowledge that the frigates were first armed with cannon , which were borrowed of the state of New- York , or with guns which had been left by the British army , and buried on the commons of Philadelphia during the revolutionary war : that the public arsenals did not at that time contain the means of armament for the revenue cutters , and that the commerce of Philadelphia remained for some time block- /z/ aded by two or three privateers , one of which could not be prevented from repairing a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding this humiliating condition , in less than three years , by energetic and well directed efforts , the United States possessed a respectable navy , which was distinguished by acts of gallantry , the auspicious presages of that glory of which ft is now unnecessary to speak. * The last war gave a perfection , and , I trust , a permanency to the arts necessary to the defence of the country , and laid the foundation for a manufacturing system , which , if fostered by the government for a few years , will insure a permanent revenue , an extended and prosperous commerce , and , while public virtue continues , security to the liberty , tranquillity , and union of the people . Hitherto our revenue has depended on the success of our commerce . This is necessarily limited by our exports , and these in turn depend , in peace , on the wants * It is to this period , and to Henry Foxall , that we owe the rudiments of almost all the skill we possess in the fabrication of cannon , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fortifications , steam-boats , and manufacturing establishments ; to Russell Hunt and Brothers , the earliest perfect specimens of large machinery of wrought iron , including anchors for our principal slhips ; and to Eli Whitney , models of muskets , which have never been surpassed . All this skill has since been protected , encouraged , and diffused by the government , and its present value to the country exceeds the cost of the military and naval efforts of every subsequent period . /z/ and policy of foreign nations ; and in war , on the efficiency of our naval power . If we rely much longer on this system , the government will evaporate , and the sooner the necessary consultations take place , the more easy will the transition be from a state of insecurity and languor , to that of activity and vigour . The means of effecting the requisite change have been wisely indicated by the spontaneous voice of the American people , and so far as depends upon their voluntary efforts , they are already in a train of exertion . They consist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and justice , which are every where prevailing ; in the diffusion of agricultural improvements in the encouragement afforded to manufactures and general industry ; what is wanting is merely a direction of that industry tothe most advantageous pursuits . Hitherto the economical systems of the government have been principally directed to the accumulation of revenue from foreign commerce ; but they are now evidently recoiling , and must be supported by new measures . Our fast-sailing ships , which traverse the ocean ; our steam-boats , which ascend our magnificent and rapid rivers ; our improved roads and canals of interior communication all of which were devised for our peculiar benefit are at present employed principally /z/ to aid our rivals , and to transport commodities into the central regions of this great continent , which check every effort of profitable industry , and blast every germ of patriotic enterprise , It remains for congress to arrest these evils to turn back the current and to direct the activity which is now exhausting the country into sources of permanent convenience and wealth , I hope it will not be deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , and be ready to support , a system of internal revenue , never to be hereafter abandoned . It seems to be an admitted fact , that our revenue must be increased ; and I think it is evident , that it would be vain to expect the sums which will be required from a decayed commerce . Merely to increase the rate of duties on imposts , so as to encourage evasions , would disappoint the public wishes , and only operate as a tax on honest men for the benefit of smugglers : whenever the fair merchant can pay no more , and articles continue to be introduced , which are hurtful to the country , they should either be prohibited entirely , or be subjected to an extra tax , to be collected of the venders . I know that the name of an excise is odious in this country , but it is only so in consequence of the objects on which it has been levied , and the manner in which it has been usually collected . /z/ An excise on articles of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered odious , and it will be the fault of the people if such taxes are ever levied in this country ; but excise duties on articles which interfere with domestic industry , on the luxuries of the rich , and the vices of the improvident , are the most beneficial sumptuary laws which can be devised , and nothing would be so advantageous , at present , as to charge the expenses of government upon such objects . It may seem paradoxical , but I have no doubt that such taxes would encourage foreign and domestic commerce , and the circulation of money in the interior country ; promote stable and regular prices for agricultural productions ; confirm a just equality of condition , and exempt our lands from taxation , except in periods of war , beside furnishing resources , constantly increasing with every accumulation of national wealth and civilization .
