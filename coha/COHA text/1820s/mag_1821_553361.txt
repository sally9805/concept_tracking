To every reader , who carefully notices the title page of this book , it must appear surprising , that so many subjects of such extent and difficulty could all be despatched in a thin duo .. // 1821 . ) Bssay eoncerntng Free . /lgen.ey. d e cimo volume . The author has , however , at least an unques .. tionable right to the praise and gratitude of his readers for his conciseness . It is not our intention to give an analysis of the book , nor to notice the opinions advanced on every subject . We shall confine our remarks to a few principal points . The first chapter is wholly employed by the author in the definition of important terms , and in stating the principles on which his reasoning is to proceed . Both these are contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish . In some of the definitions , we think , there is a want of precision and correctness . Sensation is confounded with perception ; reflection with memory ; and choice with the greatest apparent good . Of reasoning the following definition is given . Reasoning are the several steps taken by the mind to attain a knowledge of truth . ' To say nothing of the clumsiness of this definition , it is far from being correct , for there are other means employed in the discovery of tr1lth besides reasoning . Perception , simple comparison , definition , and chemical analysis , are methods used for the attainment of truth , neither of which can with propriety be denominated reasoning . This term has a technical and more limited meaning . It is exclusively applicable to those operations in which relations are traced by the instrumentality of proofs . There are several other definitions to which we might object ; but we pass to articles of more importance . Our author adopts the ancient division of the mind into two leading faculties or powers , which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there are many states of mind , which can not properly be ranked under either of those heads . The understanding he calls the passive power , and the will , the active power of the mind . He thinks each of these powers may act without the assistance of the other , and makes frequent mention of the passive operations of the understanding . So the will is thought to act without know* ledge . I believe , ' says he , the first volitions of every mind are at random . They take place before knowledge exists. -l do not apprehend that knowledge is necessary for the existence of youtions ; that is , volition may exist without knowledge , as it does in the minds of infants and ideots. ' p. 31. // When the understanding , will , memory , and the like , are called powers or faculties of the mind , the language must be regarded as wholly figurative . These names are applied in consequence of the different actions which the mind performs , and must not be considered as implying separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the limbs and organs of the body . From the singleness of conciousness , it is manifest that the mind is simple and uncompounded ; in every act , therefore , its whole substance must be employed , though the energy , with which it acts , be not always the same . One half the mind can no more be engaged without the other , than one half of a ball can move while the other half is at rest . But though the mind be in its nature simple , its operations are often complicated . The understanding and will reciprocally guide and assist each other . Even in the recep .. tion of ideas from external objects , as in hearing , seeing , &amp;c. the mind is not entirely passive , as some have supposed . Without some degree of attention , which is an act of the will , no perceptions are required . The reason why the mind has been thought passive in such cases is , that we can not ordinarily avoid the effects produced by material objects on the senses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive , when thus affected ; and that it is not so is manifest from this circumstance , that in proportion as our attention is called off from particular objects , the impressions we receive from them will be feeble and imperfect . We are sometimes so deeply engaged in thought , as to be unaffected by sounds , which usually attract our notice ; and a sudden fright may render us for a while insensible to all surrounding objects . The thing most insisted on in the book we are examining i*the free agency of man . The author endeaVors to establi*h this important doctrine on an immovable foundation , and in order to this he examines the principles advanced on the subject by Locke in his chapter on power , and by Edwards , in his treatise on the will . He is equally dissatisfied with the theories of both these philosophers , in respect to the successive acts of the will , the first of whom proposes uneasiness , ' and the other , the strongest motive , ' as the immediate cause of volition , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will in the - slightest degree swayed by the judgment of the understandIng , or by the influence of motives . This is manifest from the following expressions . // Liberty or freedom , is the mind beginning , regulating , continuing , and ending its volition , without any thing to act on the mind , so as therein to produce , or prevent volition ; also there being nothing to hinder or impede the intended external effect of volition . ' Again . The mind has an active power ; but I do not consider this alone , though it is taken into the account , to be freedom ; but the absence of things , that the mind may exercise its active power in beginning , re a ing , continuing , and ending its volition , without compulsion or restraint . ' - ' The phrase , to exercise one 's liberty , when speaking of the mind , must mean that there is nothing acting on the mind , so as therein to produce or prevent youlion . If any one should inquire why the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an active power . But how do you know that it has an active power ? Because I do not feel that I am acted upon , and made to will . It is absurd for any one , who believes that the mind has an adive power , to inquire what makes or causes the mind to will ; for if any thins makes or causes the mind to will , it has no more activity in willing , than in feeling , but must be passive in both . Volitions are not effects , unless something acts on the mind , and therein produces them . But , if they are so produced , then the active power to begin action is not in the mind , but in something else , which begins the action . Before any one undertakes to decide , that volitions are effects , produced by uneasiness of desire , or by the strongest motive in the mind 's view , or by any thing else , let him seriously consider , whether the mind has an active power , by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' p. 25 . From these extracts it is manifestly the opinion of the writer , that if the mind be active in willing , it must not , itself , be influenced by any thing extraneous . This we think an erroneous supposition ; and we see no good reason why volitions may not be called effects . They have precisely the same claim to that appellation , as other things to which it is applied . Cause and effect are relative terms , and have reference only to changes , which take place . That is denominated a cause , which immediatcly and uniformly precedes any new appearance ; and the new appearance itself is called an effect . All the material substances around us are undergoing continual alterations in their component particles ; and in organized bodies sensible changes are rapidly taking place . But in all this // ceaseless variety of mutations , there is not a single instance in which we are able to discover any real efficiency , or to trace any necessary dependence of one quality , or one event on another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive appearances . Thus a spark of fire is said to be the cause of the explosion of gunpowder : not on account of any knowledge we possess of the secret process which suddenly takes place in the minute particles of the powder , but because the contact of the spark was the event which immediately preceded the explosion . In like manner we speak of beat and cold as the causes of innumerable phenomena in bodies , merely because they are the uniform ante-. cedents of the phenomena which occur . The intellectual , like the material world , is subject to perpetual changes . Our present thoughts and feelings immediately give place to others , and consciousness is perpetually shifting from one subject to another . Lu the successive changes of the mind , as in the phenomena of material objects , we employ the terms cause and effect , to denote merely the relation of antecedence and subsequence in the order of events . The varying states of the mind are subject to the influence of general laws . It is for this reason that we are enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how men will act in any supposable circumstances , by knowing how men have *before acted under circumstances of a similar nature . In every country and in every period of the world. , men have endeavored to avoid hurtful objects , and to obtain those which are agreeable . This fact can in no way be accounted for , if we deny that the volitions of men are in any degree influenced by their hopes and fears , their desires and aversions . We are ready to go any reasonable length with our anonymous friend , in the support of human liberty ; but we can not espouse such notions of freedom as are inconsistent with the rational character of man . Volitions , that are not produced by motives , must be wholly fortuitous and irregular . This doctrine renders both the understanding and the will useless . It can be of no service for us to know what actions will promote our happiness , unless this knowledge has some tendency to produce those actions ; and the power of willing and acting , without the guidance of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctrine in question is // opposed to the common sense of mankind . Ask any person , young or old , learned or ignorant , why he performed a particular action , and he xviii name some reason or motive as the true cause , without which the action would not have been performed . Without the causal influence of motives on volitions , there would be no consistency in the conduct of men , no accountableness for actions , no justice in rewards and punishm cuts . However plausible the doctrine xve are examining may he made to appear in theory , it has not yet been attempted in practice . Its stoutest advocates , we are persuaded , xvould act like the rest of mankind in the common business of life . The only dii *erence between them and others xvould be in the explanation they would give of their conduct , and this must make them ridiculous . Let us suppose a person , fully impressed with this theory , to be called to an act of benevolence. lie sees a fellow-being struggling in the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flood , and , by a successful effort , rescues the unhappy sufferer from his fate . The relieved person , on recovering strength , pours out his soul in gratitude to his benefactor , who replies to him , in the spirit of his philosophy , 1 have no claims to these expressions of thankfulness , and you oxve me nothing for the assistance I have rendered you . If actions are prompted by volitions , volitions themselves are not effeus resulting from motives , or any previous circumstances . Be assured that in this , as in all other cases , my mind has been jPee ; and that I have not been influenced , in the slightest degree , by any sympathy for your sufferings , or concern for your welfare . ' We are not able to discern the difference which our author finds between the acts of choosing and willing . In the latter , he says , the mind is entirely active , and in the former wholly passive . But we contend that a volition is required in every act of choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities to exist in objects , as we wish them to possess . We are under the necessity of seeing them as they are . When , therefore , several things are presented to us at the same time , some will appear more pleasin6 than others , and we are naturally led to fix on that which is the most pleasing . But the choice is usually made with caution . The mind compares and deliberates , and the balancing is at last terminated by a decree of the will . The folloxving illu*tratiou is given us by our author . // A man may choose or prefer the doing of an action proposed , and at the same time not will to do it . Suppose walking is proposed . Now walking may be more pleasing or agreeable to one 's mind , than not to walk ; therefore , as soon as it i2 proposed , he may prefer or choose to walk ; and at the same time , he may sit still , because he does not will to walk . The choice or preference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind has compared walking with not walking ; but the necessity of choice does not make volition , which is an act of the will , necessary . The mind may freely will not to walk , although it is under a physical necessity to choose to walk . in this way necessity and freedom can exist together ; and in this way , a man may be bound and free at the same tune . ' p. 52 . What is the reason , we would ask , why the man , in the case here stated , does not will to walk ? The most natural answer seems to be , because he does not choose it . Walkin6 is a complicated act , consisting of a series of muscular exertions in the limbs ; and to each of these a separate volition is necessary , which is manifest from the care practised at each step in walking , not to pitch the foot into water or filth , nor against any obstacle that might lie in the way . When , therefore , the man , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be supposed to choose the whole of a connected series of efforts , and , at the same time , not to choose the first , on which all the rest depend . Or , in other words , since every act of choosing requires a volition , he must will to walk and not to walk at the same time . This doctrine , that volitions are not caused by any thing acting on the mind , has long since been advanced by some advocates for liberty , though in a little different form . They have contended for an indi*fferency in the mind , remaining till the acts of the will are past . But this notion appears to be wild and paradoxical . It is hardly possible to conceive , that the mind should remain in a state of indifference , that is , of neutrality , suspense , or equipoise , with regard to acting or not acting , in a case it has fully examined , and in which it has found strong reasons to determine its judgment . While we reject these extravagant notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the opposite extreme , and to admit all the dogmas and theories , which have been advanced by the champions of necessity . In admitting that volitions may be called effects , resulting from previous states of mind , we // do not assert , that all human volitions are necessary . There is a manifest difference between a real and a necessary cause . That may be denominated the real cause of a particular voli* tion , which did in fact excite it , and without which it would not have taken place . Bitt at the same time , it may not have been a necessary cause , and such as would be always followed by the same effect . We disclaim that doctrine , which annihilates all human freedom and power , and admits a universal fatality in the actions of men . The mind in willing is not mov*d* by the same principle as a balance , to which it has often been compared . Moral causes do not operate with the same undeviating uniformity , as physical . The minds of men are differently affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , where the reasons for acting are clear , and the motive urgent , that we can trace a uniformity in the conduct of men . No person would hesitate to move from his place in order to save himself from being crushed by a falling tree or building . In such extreme cases , all people would act alike . But where the reasons , which determine the choice of actions , are slight and feeble , different persons will take different courses , aed the same person act differently , at different times . In those cases , which moral writers have called indifferent , that is , where outward circumstances present no distinct grounds for determining the choice , volitions appear to be produced by an . arbitrary power of the mind . We experience no difficulty in directing our actions in these cases , and it is in these , that our freedom appears the most perfect It is not pretended that the mind ever exerts a self-determining power in opposition to motives ; but we are sometimes called to make an election in. things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two guineas , equally bright , pure , and heavy . The motive for making the choice is the worth of the coin offered ; but as the two presented to our option are regarded as of equal value , and may be obtained with equal ease , we can have no motive for taking one in preference to the other . In selecting the objects to he pursued , and in all the more important decisions of the will , we are influenced by special reasons for each separate act ; but this is not the case in all the subordinate acts of the will , as in determining the exact order and manner in which a number of unconnected actions shall he performed , for the attainment of an end proposed . The object is not lost , because different means may be employed with equal advan-. // tage in procuring it . Unless the mind had power to act in these minute affairs , without being impelled in each instance by a superior motive , the ordinary business of life could not be performed . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of our author , formerly stated , correct , viz. that the mind in willing is not influenced by any causes ab extra . For the truth of what we have said on this subject , every one must judge for himself , by carefully watching the operations of his own mind . This is the only tribunal to which an ap .. peal can he made . The moral freedom of man is not a question of speculation , to be settled by abstract reasoning . It is a question of fact to be decided by feeling . It is on this ground , that we admit the doctrine as true . We believe we are free , because we feel that we are so . We have the same evidence of our freedom , that we have of our accountableness , our merit or demerit . It is an original principle of our constitution , for which we have the clear and intuitive evidence of consciousness . Having detained our readers longer than we intended , on this first article of human liberty , we will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that follow . The author examines with attention and ability the sentiments of Doctors Edwards , Dwight , Hopkins , and others , on severid controverted subjects of morals and theology . We agree with him in most of his criticisms on these authors , though some of them are minute and merely verbal . We are gratified with the candor and deference with which he examines their doctrines , evincing thereby , that , while he differs from them in sentiment , he has a deep respect for their characters . The author of the little volume we have been examining , has seen fit to conceal his name from the public , though for what reason we , can not tell . There appears to be nothing in the character of the book , which need make its author very solicitous on this point , one way or the other . There are no swolling pretensions to uncommon powers , or extensive erudition . The style of the book is by no means elevated , nor even , rn all places correct . We should judge , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy , than with works of taste . His mind seems to be naturally formed for dry and abstruse investigations ; and in many places he gives evidence of mental strength and discrimina** // tion . We are not pleased with the manner , in which he commences his work . He attempts to enumerate and define the various powers and operations of the mind . There is something very imposing in this method , and which must naturally lead inexperienced readers into error . They would be led to view the mind , not as an uncompounded substance , but as an assemblage of various parts , to which separate functions were allotted , and which had not an inseparable connexion with each other . Many writers on pneumatology have committed the san*m fault , and some have displayed their ingenuity in multiplying the number of original principles belonging to the mind . All such attempts are worse than useless . Instead of advancing mental philosophy , they serve rather to retard its progress , by introducing into it darkness and confusion .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
