txt ART . VI. - Reports of cases argued and adjudged in the Supreme Court of the United States , February term , 1822 . By Henry Wheaton , Counsellor at Law . New York , 1822 . WE regard the publication of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States as a most important accession to our juridical learning . To those of the profession who do not confine themselves to the narrow walks of the common law , and whose desires are not fully satisfied by adjudicated constructions of local statutes , the reports of Mr Wheaton must be extremely valuable . There are many , we would hope , who are far from being edified by the grave discussion of the trifling and ludicrous questions , with which so large a portion of our books is occupied . We are slow to believe that any lawyer 's comprehension is much enlarged , or his taste much improved by reading the solemn decisions of the king 's bench , that an indictment for fraudulently selling goat 's hair is bad without a venue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn ( because more contested ) decisions of the highest tribunal of an ancient commonwealth , that a dead hog is a swine , and that three small boys may sleep in one bed. * It is not , we trust , a mere blind attachment to an honorable profession , which induces our belief that its members will rather seek and peruse with avidity the volumes that record the masterly discussions of constitutional and international law . Such are the volumes with which Mr Wbeaton has furnished us . It is not our purpose to analyze the book before us ; nor will we enlarge upon the manner in which the reporter has executed the task which peculiarly belongs to him . This was cursorily done , in a notice of a former volume ; and we have now only to add , that if he has not since indulged in the prodiga c'pia , ' he has at least avoided the damnosa concmnitas , ' which of old provoked the malediction of sir Ilarbottle Grirnston . Our object rather is , to call the attention of the // profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , and to suggest a few of the reasons which influence our judgment concerning their paramount importance . It is an unmanly squeamishness to pretend that the jurisprudence of the northern states is not in an unhopeful condition . Of the causes , which are different in different states , we have at present nothing to say . But this we affirm without hesitation or fear , that the prospects of legal science are , at this hour , worse in every state north of Pennsylvania , than they have been at a former period. * It is not to be disguised ; and it is weakness , or something more pitiful , to affect ignorance or want of observation on this subject . There may be some boldness in the avoival , but there is little sagacity in the discovery . A moderate acquaintance with recent decisions will show that there has been of late a gradual departure from the old highway of the common law , a disposition to decide on principles ( if they deserve the name of principles ) of notional equity and imaginary convenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to array a supposed common sense against immemorial usage , and to impute to legal learning the effect charged by the Roman governor upon the pupil of Gamaliel . We are aware that there are compurgators about every tribunal , who are ready to attest the accuracy and profoundness of its judgments , and champions to defend by tongue and pen , and other devices , the resources and the infallibility of the forum to which they are attached . De'il ha'e Caleb Balderstone , if the family shall lose credit , if he were as mad as the seven wise masters . ' We are equally aware that there ever have been and ever will be malecontents , who will attribute the loss of a cause to any misjudging but their own ; who will alternately complain of expanded views as lax , and of strictness as narrow ; whose heads are muddy from mdigested learning , and whose tempers . are soured by the disappointinent of hopes which they never ought to have cherished . We dread the auspices of this latter class more than the resentment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the state courts seem to be infected , the judges of the national court We would guard against an inference , of arsy sort , from our silence respecting the other states in th' Union . // are wholly free ; and we avow our sanguine hope , that their profound eruditioji , their encouragement of research , their commanding talents and influence , joined with their paramount authority , will yet recall the course of justice , in those states that have heretofore boasted of an enlightened judiciary , to its old and deep-worn channels . We hope the time will again come , when the most eminent counsel will not feel imperatively bound to carry to this court every cause of which it may have jurisdiction ; or if they do , that it will not be , as now , because they have greater confidence in the sound*. ness and stability of its faith , and its reverence for authority . While , however , we deprecate wanton departures from the common law , we would disclaim that professional narrowness which discerns no difference betwee*i improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fountains of this law were obscure and scanty , and that it has often been polluted in its progress ,  --  that it has received additions from a thousand different sources , and by length of time worked itself into clearness , and flowed in an abundant stream to enrich and adorn the whole land of our fathers . Even at this day , we rejoice to see it swelled by the opening of new springs , and applied to the novel operations which the inventive genius of the age has devised . But we protest against obstructing or diverting its course , as we would against any other nuisance . Instead of inculcating forbearance , we would invoke the earliest and most summary redress . On this point we would adopt the sentiments of Burke . I am not of the opinion , ' says he , of those gentlemen who are against disturbing the public repose . I like a clamor whenever there is an abuse . The fire-bell at midnight disturbs your sleep , but it keeps you from being burned in your bed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the property of the province . ' Decorous animadversions upon judgments of doubtful accuracy are not to be reprehended . So long as they exhibit strong reasoning and sound learning , their effects must be salutary . The dernier resort is to the suffrages of an able and enlightened profession , whose voice no court can contemptuously disregard without furnishing irrefragable proof of its own incompetency or corruption . Many considerations give weight and importance to the decisions of our national court . The sphere of their movements , // and the extensive territory from which they are selected , greatly diminish the probability that the law , under their administration , will partake of the complexion of the individual judges . In the state courts , it is almost impossible to avoid this evil . New judges are the pupils of their predecessors ; have practised under their observation aijd guidance , and have imbibed their views . They are , in many instances , indebted to their associates for promotion , and must be expected of course to unite in their fraternity . This , it is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gives no flattering promise of legal improvement . My law , ' says the orator before quoted , should not depend upon the fluctuation of the closet or the complexion of men . Whether a blackhaired or a fair-haired man presided in the court of king 's bench , I would have the law the same ; the same , whether he was born in domo regnatrice , and sucked from his infancy the milk of courts , or was nurtured in the rugged discipline of a popular opposition . This law of court cabal and of party , this mens qua3dam nullo perturl$ata affectu , this law of complexion ought not to be endured for a moment , in a country whose being depends upon the certainty , clearness , and stability of institutions . ' This law , however , has sometimes made its appearance in our state courts ; but to those courts it has hitherto been confined . The suggestions already made , and numberless others which will readily occur to the intelligent reader , sufficiently account for the fact , and furnish ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be in these courts , if in any , that personal antipathies will exert their unhallowed influence , even on the judgment*-seat . By the responses of these oracles , if of any , will political and religious cabals be inspirited to urge their factious and intolerant career . Under the sanction of these courts will private rights become the sport of popular clamor and legislative usurpation ; and to the justices of the national court must the eloquent and effectual ap*real again be made-A'isi apud vos , nihil est pra*terea quo confugere posssrnus . The manner in which questions are argued and opinions delivered , in the supreme court of the United States , gives to their judgments an imposing authority . No case is allowed to pass without discussion ; and the arguments , when made , are full and thorough . Counsel are not interrupted and // catechised like schoolboys , in order to impress on a vulgar audience a sense of the court 's acumen , and its discipline of the bar . Where the most ancient books of the law are cited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vacant wonder at the names of the last English reporters . In their consultations , they do not take for granted that their first impressions are correct , merely because they are unanimous , and therefore dispense with further examination ; nor do they attempt to resolve all their doubts-dum fingere nesciunt-by looking into Espinasse 's Digest and Blackstone with Chrishan s notes . In delivering their opinions on important points , they do not seek to foreclose future discussion of kindred topics , by an affectation of exhausting the subject and stating the whole law in a series of slovenly generalities , which they are afterwards compelled to retract or modify . They do not elude the pressure of authority by their mere lubricity , nor misstate and treat with persiflage and sarcasm , arguments Which they can not meet and answer . And though last , it is not , in our judgment , the least of these negative recommendations , that they never have occasion to conceal the soft and spongy texture of their reasoning , under the varnish of a puerile rhetoric . We have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which foreigners have so freely indulged , would be better met by producing works of unquestionable merit , than hy braggart assertion and angry recrimination . Our countrymen were formerly called cowards . Bunker Hill and Saratoga more effectually refute the calumny , than the boastful defiance of half a century . In reply to the charge of semi-barbarism brought against our jurisprudence-instead of sneering at the wager of battle , so recently declared to be a part of the common law of England , we would exhihit the reports of Cranch and of Wheaton . When told that our judges are the creatures of the adminjstration , instead of reviling the memory of Scroggs and Jeffries , we would point to the trials of Burr and of Smith and Ogden . If the competency of our judiciary should again be denied by British lihellers , instead of a noisy altercation , we would produce our documents and readily submit the question to their own law-lords , whether any of his majesty 's courts of law now display greater patience of research or depth of learning , a higher reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of the United States . To the benchers of Lincoln 's Inn we would as readily refer a decision upon the comparative eru* dition , talents , and eloquence of the bar . And if estoppels were not odious , we should incline to rely on the cominendation of Mr Dallas 's first reports , bestowed more than thirty years ago by lord Mansfield , and the recent opinion express-. ed by lord Stowell of the ability and learning of our national judges . There is scarce any object of curiosity more rational , ' ( says the author of An essay towards a history of the laws of England ' ) than the origin , the progress , and the various revolutions of human laws . Political and military relations are , for the greater part , accounts of the ambition and violence of mankind ; this is a history of their justice . And surely there can not be a more pleasing speculation than to trace the , advances of men , in an attempt to imitate the Supreme Ruler in one of the most glorious of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prerogative , which it wonderful to find entrusted to the management of so weak a being . in such an inquiry , we shall indeed frequently see great instances of this frailty ; but at the same time we shall behold such noble efforts of wisdom and equity , as seem fully to justify the reasonableness of that extraordinary disposition , by which men in one form or other , have been always put under the dominion of creatures like themselves . For what can be more instructive than to observe the first principles of RIGHT springing up , involved in superstition and polluted with violence ; the laws sometimes lost and trodden down in the confusion of wars and tumults , and sometimes overruled by the hand of power ; then victorious over tyranny-growing stronger , clearer , and more decisive by the violence they had suffered enriched even by those foreign conquests which threatened their entire destruction ; softened *mnd mellowed by peace and religion ; improved and exalted by commerce , by social intercouse , and that great opener of mind , ingenuous science ? ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar history of American jurisprudence . There are great encouragements to search this history , and no lack of materials or help for the work . Whoever shall look deeply into this subject , will find , if we mistake not , that if the stream // has sometimes been irregular and turbid , it has not been from any commotion or impurity in the fountain . It will be found that among the first fathers of our country , the law was no narrow and inglorious study , that their jurists were imbued with its true principles , and deduced its spirit from original justice , and that in claiming magna charta as the charter of the American forests , their judgment was no less enlightened than their temper was resolute . it will be found that the sorry logic , the refuse of the schools , which so grossly disfigures the contemporary legal publications in England , never disgraced even the earliest of our judicial tribunals . Could he from whom we have cited the above interrogatory-he who forty-eight years ago portrayed , with unrivalled beauty , the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws brought by the pilgrims across the ocean and cherished as their birthright , stripped of their feudal character , attempered to the fundamental maxims of English liberty , now retrenched and now amplified by enactments , modified and adapted by common consent to the exigencies of their colonial state , he might furnish a lesson of admirable interest and instruction , and such as the first century and a half of no other people 's history can exhibit . The state of the laws *iuring the war of the revolution , and the remaining years of the confederation , when displayed by a master of such comprehensive and philosophizing sagacity , would teach us that where the fierce spirit of liberty is duly chastened and regulated , there may be temporary anarchy without endangering future subordination : but the subject , on which all his exalted powers could find scope for their highest exercise , would be the modelling anew of the state constitutions , the consequent revision of the state laws , the adoption of a national compact predicated on an existing common law , binding all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom of this compound system , and the liquidation and adjustrnent of all the parts in a harmonious and consistent whole . The power and duty of the national court to declare void and arrest the enforcement of legislative acts , which violate the constitution of the United States , though long and stoutly denied , are now most fully settled . It is , as was early said by Mr Justice Iredell , an authority of a delicate and awful nature ; ' but it necessarily results from the simple principl*s , // that the nature and ends of legislative power must limit its exercise ; that the nature and terms of the constitution are the foundation of this power , and must determine its objects ; that the will of the people declared in the constitution must control the will of the legislature declared in its statutes ; and that the interpretation of the laws , fundamental and superstructive , is , in the last resort , the exclusive province of the judiciary : that legislative is a delegated authority ; that all acts , contrary to the tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void ; and that neither the constituent nor the delegate is competent to decide ultimately on their validity . These principles seem not less valuable than clear . We have always believed that the sanctity of private rights and the stability of our public institutions essentially depend upon the firm and enlightened exercise , by the judiciary , of the power of deciding on the validity of the national and state enactments . The few years that comprise Mr Wheaton 's rep0rts have fully confirmed this belief . The judgments of the supreme court , within that period , on questions that regard state pretensions and legislative power , have greatly relieved the fears of the friends of our republican establishments concerning their permanency , and repressed the boding spirit which once so often warned the people that their federal grnTernment must eventually be prostrated in a conflict with the state authorities . On no subjects are the dignity and importance of the judiciary so manifest , and on none have the strength of their faculties and the sublimity of their fortitude been so illustriously displayed . Two of the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent and objects of the federal judicature , which were so clearly exhibited and ably defended in their incomparable writings , embodied as in a national creed , taught in our universities , made the text-book of our ripest scholars , cited as authoritative by our profoundest jurists , and carried into effect by the united efforts of all the coordinate branches of the government . flaying received . the highest earthly honors , and voluntarily retired , the one from the head of the judicial , the other from the executive department , they find the reward of their former labors and anxieties in the happiness and glory of their country . In their joyful retrospect , however , an intermittent shade of sadness must pass across their souls as they call to mind the chief contributor to // those writings , the coadjutor of those toils and partner of those anxieties , who was ' treacherously slain in the midst of his unfinished labors , ' and denied the vision of those scenes , for which his patriotic spirit panted , and of the full maturity and effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of questions , next in importance , which come before the federal courts , are those of admiralty jurisdiction . The history of that jurisdiction in this country is anomalous and interesting ; but this is not the appropriate place to examine it . The authority of the courts , erected or empowered by the colonies , under a resolve of congress , in November , 1775 , to determine concerning captures , and the appellate power reserved by that body ; the jurisdiction of the court of appeals established by congress , under the articles of confederation , and the effect of the adoption of the constitution on causes then pending in those courts , would admit an ample and instructive discussion . A work , embracing these and their connate topics , is a desideratum ; and we know no man who could accomplish it with greater facility or talent than Mr Wheaton . We will hazard a suggestion , that when he shall publish another edition of his valuable treatise on prize law , he will greatly enhance the obligations of the profession , by adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us not be supposed , however , to have overlooked his excellent notes on the prize jurisdiction and practice , appended to the two first volumes of his reports . There is no systematic treatise on the jurisdiction of the admiralty , in England , or here , that is accurate and thorough . True and lasting fame awaits the jurist who shall produce one . Cases of admiralty jurisdiction are exclusively cognizable by the federal courts ; yet it was not till five years after the constitution of the United States went into operation , that it was definitively settled that these courts possessed all the powers of a court of admiralty , whether considered as an instance or as a prize court . This , which now seems so plain , was not discerned by the district courts . We are indebted for this doctrine , *nd its application , to the wisdom and firmness of the supreme court . A short account of one branch of this doctrine may be pardoned . In the year 1793 , a great number of French privateers were commissioned , armed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister of // the French republic . They left port , as was officially said by Mr Jefferson , then secretary of state , to cruise on our coast , and to brave the authority of the country , by returning into port with their prizes . ' Many libels were filed in the district courts , alleging that the ships , thus brought into our ports , were captured by these privateers , and claiming restitution to the owners . These lihels were dismissed , in at least five districts , on the ground that the courts had no jurisdiction , but that matters of this kind appertained to the executive department . This renunciation of jurisdiction by the courts caused great embarrassment to the government . President Washington recommended that congress should regulate their jurisdiction , and expressed a hope , that if the executive was to be the resort in those cases , he should be authorized 1by law to have facts ascertained by the courts , when , for his own information , he should request it . Before congress bad time to provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme court of the United States ( 3 Dallas 6 ) , who unanimously decided that the district courts had competent jurisdiction of all such cases , and remanded the cause to the court for the Maryland district , for a final decision . This , ' says Mr Chancellor Kent , was one of the most salutary decisions ever made by that court . The anomaly raised in the district courts disappeared forever , and the course of public and national law flowed in its accustomed channel . ' As the prize court of admiralty decides according to the law of nations and the course of the admiralty , and the instance court , according to the civil law , the laws of Oleron and the customs of the admiralty modified by statute , it is obvious that this jurisdiction of the national courts brings into discussion questions on which mere common law counsellors must be silent . The admiralty system is a beautiful one , when well understood and administered , but it is extremely neglected by the students of the common law , of *yhich it never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Story , quern cqpellasse , laudasse est , for his efforts to transfuse the prize law of Europe into our own , and for the great light which his researches have thrown on subjects of national and maritime law . Whatever may be thought of the justice , the policy , or the conduct of the war of 1812 , it certainly is a splendid epoch in the history of our national jurisprudence ; // and no one can read the opinions of the learned judge just named , without being convinced of the superior learning and more enlarged views , which are derived from an acquaintance . with the admiralty civilians . We deem it a scandal to the profession that the reports of the decisions of the federal courts have so limited circulation and can not but publish our astonishment , that they are to be found in so very few of the county law libraries in Massachusetts . Whether gentlemen covet the title of scholar , politician , or lawyer , we should expect them to be informed of the contents of those volumes . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is on questions of national and constitutional law that the highest powers of the mind are exerted , and the noblest efforts of forensic genius demanded . The common topics of litigation neither require nor permit these efforts . Crescit enim cum amplitudine rerum ins ir4genii , nec qussquain ciaram et zilustrern orationem efficere potest , nisi qui causam parern invenit . We are here reminded of statesmen and orators , whose eloquence we shall hear no more . The reputation of men like Dexter and Pinkney should be brought forward on all occasions . Their country has an interest in it . The character of the former has been portrayed by Mr Justice Story , whose sketch is prefixed to the first volume of Mr Mason 's reports . Mr Wheaton has thus delineated that of the latter in the volume before us : To extraordinary natural endowments , Mr Pinkney added deep and various knowledge in his profession . A long course of *tudy and practice had familiarized his mind with the science of the law , in every department ; and his attainments in the auxiliary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were of the most profound and elegant character . For many years he was the acknowledged leader at the head of the bar of his native state ; and during the last tea years of his life  --  the principal period of his attendance in this the supreme court of the United States-he enjoyed the reputation *of having been rarely equalled , and perhaps never excelled , in eloquence and the power of reasoning upon legal subjects . His mind was acute and subtle ; rapid in its conceptions , and singularly felicitous in the exposition of the truths it was employed in investigating . Ms* Pinkney had the command of the greatest variety of the most beautiful and peculiarly appropriate diction , and the faculty of adorning and illustrating the driest and most intricate discussions . // His favorite mode of reasoning was from the analogies of the law ; and while he delighted his auditory by his powers of amplification and rhetorical ornament , he instructed the court by tracing up the technical rules and positive institutions of jurisprudence to their historical source and first principles . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; its technical peculiarities and feudal origin , its subtle distinctions and artificial logic were familiar to his early studies , and enabled him to expound , with admirable force and perspicuity , the rules of real property . To this , and his other legal attainments , he superadded , at a later period of life , an extensive acquaintance with the theory and administration of public law . In the various questions of constitutional law , which have been recently discussed in this high tribunal , it may be said , it is hoped , without irreverence , that Mr Pinkney 's learning and powers of investigation have very much contributed to enlighten and fix its judgments . In the discussion of that class of causes especially , which , to use his own expressions , " presented the proud spectacle of a peaceful judicial review of the conflicting sovereign claims of the government of the Union and of the particular states , by this more than Amphictyonic council , " his arguments were characterized by a fervor , earnestness , gravity , eloquence , and force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he delivered his own sentiments as a statesman and a citizen , and was not merely solicitous to discharge his duty as an advocate . He exerted an intellectual vigor proportioned to the magnitude of the occasion . He saw in it " a pledge of the immortality of the Union-of a perpetuity of national strength and glory , increasing and brightening with age-of concord at home , and reputation abroad . " And in his argument on the constitutionality of the charter of the bank of the United States , he stated , that " the considerations which the question involved , imparted to it a peculiar character of importance ; and this tribunal , distinguished as it is for all that can give to judicature a title to reverence , is , in deliberating and adjudicating upon it , in the exercise of its most exalted , its most awful functions . The legislative faculties of the government of the Union , for the prosperity of the Union , are in the lists *against the imputed sovereignty of a particular state : and you are the judges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tilts and tournaments , but upon the sacred principles of the constitution . In whatever direction you look , you can not but perceive the solemnity , the majesty of such an occasion . In whatever quarter you approach the subject , you can not but feel that it demands from you the firm and steady exertion of all // those high qualities which the universal voice ascribes to those , who have devoted themselves to the ministry of this holy sanctuary. ** That intense application to his professional and public labors , for which Mr Pinkney was so remarkably distinguished , continued to animate his exertions to the last moments of his life ; and as he held up a high standard of excellence in this honorable career , he pursued it with unabated diligence and ardor , and still continued to speak as from the impulse of youthful ambition . His example was therefore of the greatest utility in exciting the emulation of the profession . But it is as an enlightened defender of the national constitution against the attacks which have been made upon it , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his loss is most to be lamented by the public . It is known to his friends that he was , a short time before his death , engaged in the investigations preparatory to making a great effort in the senate upon this interesting subject . The loss of such a commentary upon the constitution , by one who had so profoundly meditated its principles , may be regarded as a public calamity . It is also to be regretted that the great fame of his eloquence must rest mainly in tradition ; as it is believed that no perfect memorials of his most splendid efforts in the senate or at the bar have been preserved , and it is obviously impossible to form any adequate notions of the powers of an advocate from the sketches of the arguments of council contained in the books of reports .
