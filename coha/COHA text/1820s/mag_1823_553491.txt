ART . IV. - .4 Journal of Travels into the *rkansa territory dsxing the year 1819 , with occasional observations on the manners of the aborigines , illustrated with a map and other engravings . By Thomas JV'uttall , F. L. S. Honorary Member of the american Philosophical Society , *c . Philadelphia , Palmer , 1821 . ANY one who surveys the map of North America at the present day , and compares its features with those which it wore scarcely more than twenty years ago ; . can not fail to be struck with the great changes it has undergone . Those of us who , before this period , derived our initiation in geography from Morse or Guthrie , rec&amp;llect impressions which were very foreign from the state of things , that has since been ascertained to exist . The river Missouri , which has of late years been a fertile source of interest and wonder , was then only known as a tributary branch of the Mississippi of doubtful magnitude and extent . The Arkansa and other western streams were known little more than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath their real magnitude . On the other hand , the waters of the west , almost from the sources of the Mississippi and St Lawrence , were supposed to be gathered up by a fabulous Oregan or river of the west , a stream of great extent , which no European had seen , the existence of which depended on Indian rumors , and which , after crossing about half the continent , was supposed to discharge itself into the Pacific somewhere about latitude 43* . The expedition of Lewis and Clarke first removed the veil from these western solitudes . The journey of Pike , and the subsequent adventures of trading parties and military explorers , have given a new geographical aspect to this extensive country . We now see the Missouri stretching far to the north and west , not a tributary , but itself a principal and mighty river ; not of secondary or doubtful magnitude , but beyond doubt the largest river of the known world . The Platte , the Arkansa , and other tributaries of this prodigious stream , would in the old continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Ohio and other eastern branches , draw off the waters of a tract of country now familiarly designated as the valley of the Mississippi . ' To ears accustomed // to associate with the term valley the idea of a low ground between hills , ' in which a few shepherds might feed their flocks , or a few tenements find shelter from the wind and storm , this name , first applied to the country of the Missis-* sippi , we believe , by Volney , sounds singularly large . Here is a valley , in whose fertile shades there repose more inhabitants than the United States contained at the beginning of the revolution . A valley , over which two thirds of the continent of Europe might be spread out , and hardly suffice to cover it . We have spoken of the Missouri as the largest river known upon the face of the globe . We shall be understood of course as including the part of the Mississippi which is below its confluence , and of which the Missouri is undoubtedly the true continuation . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common channel four times as much water as the Mississippi ; it is at least twice as long , and some of its principal branches are even longer than the last named stream . The length of this majestic river from its remote sources in the Rocky mountains , to its outlet in the Gulf of Mexico , is between four and five thousand miles . During three thousand miles of this course its apparent size is hardly diminished , and even at the Mandan villages Mr Breckenridge informs us , that its full channel appeared to him not less broad or majestic than that of the Mississippi at New Orleans . Still higher up , it receives tributary branches , which might compare with the Danube or the Indus in magnitude . We know of no other river which draws from such an extent of country or connects together climates so remote and dissimilar . The Amazon , formerly accounted the chief of streams , hardly exceeds three quarters of the length of the Missouri . The Macquerrie of New 1-lolland , which from its size and distance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years since imagined to exceed all other rivers in extent , has since been ridden down into bogs and morasses . ' There remains but one stream which , for the palm of superiority , may hereafter come into competition with the Missouri , and this is the Niger . But when shall we know the course , the destination , or the outlet of the Niger ? No modern geographical problem has excited so much enthusiasm for its solution , and none has more completely set at defiance the // efforts of enterprise and perseverance . Like a mysterious divinity , the Niger holds its course in a wilderness impenetrable to civilized man , and slaves and savages are the only attendants on its way . A hundred Europeans have laid down their lives in African deserts with their faces towards this goal of expectation , but hitherto only one of them all has tasted the waters of the Niger , and returned to tell it . We owe much to those individuals , who from love of science or love of fame , become our guides and pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from distant quarters , at the expense of personal hazard , sacrifice , and privation . The journal of a traveller , in an unexplored country , sets forth adventures and scenes far different from the itinerary , which portrays the abodes and characters of civilized society . The one is often a record of pastime and gratification , the other is the diary of toil , exposure , and suffering . The voyageur of the forest has not the choice of inns , of packpts , or of mail coaches to expedite his course and remove inconveniences from his path . We are not called to sympathize with him for imaginary grievances , and for the disappointment of artificial wants , encountered from jolting vehicles , poor beds , and ill furnished tables . Our interest in his career is kept alive by real evils and endurings , of which the secure and luxurious part of the community can have little conception . We behold him foregoing for months and years the indispensable comforts of civilized society . We see him with incredible toil and difficulty threading his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon unknown waters ; now temporizing with thirst and hunger in the uncertain hope that chance may throw an animal or a rivulet in his way , now terminating his day of toil by a night 's slumber on the wet ground without food or fire ; now staking his life on the precarious faith of savages ; now straining his powers of flight and stratagem to escape from plunder or destruction . These adventures are not rare concomitants to journeys of discovery . So common are they , that journals are sometimes monotonous from the very frequency of their recurrence . We need not look to foreign countries for examples of the difficulties to be overcome in wild or unsettled regions . The adventurous journey of Lewis and Clarke , and ihe romantic expeditions of Pike , are replete with details of // hardship and danger , which the highest intrepidity , perseverance , and good conduct , could alone have overcome . We may place the author of the volume before us in the list of those travellers , who have pursued a favorite science with singular devotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Nuttall , from an early attach-. ment to natural history , and from the attractions offered by the unexplored wilds of North America , has followed our plants and minerals with indefatigable perseverance , not only to the confines of civilization and cultivation , but into the remote and desert recesses of the continent . We have few individuals , at least men of education , whose survey of our territory has been equally extensive . The present volume offers us but a small part of the author 's scientific peregrinations . From his other publications we learn that he has visited the maritime parts of the United States , from New England to Georgia , ann to New Orleans . The tour of the lakes he has also made , passing round lake Erie on foot , through lakes Huron and Michigan by canoe navigation , thence afterwards by the Fox and Guisconsin rivers into the Mississippi , and down that river to St Louis . He was one of the party which in 1810 ascended the Missouri as far as the Mandan villages , of which expedition an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge . Mr Nuttall is spoken of , in the work of Mr B. , as a young man of genius and acquirements , singularly devoted to his favorite pursuits , which seem , ' says he , to engross every thought , to the total disregard of his personal safety , and sometimes to the inconvenience of the party he accompanies . When the boat touches the shore , he leaps out , and no sooner is his attention arrested by a plant or a flower , than every thing else is forgotten . ' An inquiry is made for him by the Canadian boatmen , when impatient to proceed , not without reproachful epithets ; and the uniform reply is , II est apr*s rarnasser des racimes . The volume before us contains the narrative of a journey made chiefly in the year 1819 from Philadelphia to Pittshurg , thence down the Ohio and Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansa , thence up that river as far as the Grand Saline . A digression to the banks of the Red river by the Pottoe and Kiamesha , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constitute the remainder of the journal . // Mr Nuttall left Philadelphia the 2d of October 1818 , and arrived at Pittsburg on the 15th . From this place he proceeded in a skiff to Louisville , where after waiting in vain for the descent of the steam boats , which the lowness of the water detained , he determined to purchase a flat-bottomed boat , and set sail for the Mississippi with only two companions . This measure he afterwards found to have been an imprudent one , since the destruction of his boat , a kind of event by no means uncommon , and which , as it afterwards proved , * was several times very narrowly escaped , would probably have plunged him into embarrassment and distress . The narrative of the voyage down the Ohio is much like the accounts we are accustomed to hear from other travellers in that quarter , excepting that Mr Nuttall intersperses geological and botanical information with his other remarks . His stops for the night are made , sometimes at a flourishing village , and sometimes at a miserable tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drunken and profligate backwoodsmen . He finds himself mixed with a tide of emigrants of various characters and views , some hoping and some repenting , but all carried forward by a sort of conta*ious impulse . A stranger , who descends the Ohio at this season of emigration , can not but be . struck with the jarring vortex of heterogeneous population , amidst which he is embarked , all searching for some better country , which ever lies to the west , as Eden did to the east . Amongst this crowd are also those , who , destitute of the means or inclination for obtaining an honest livelihood , are forced into desperate means for subsistence . ' On his way , Mr Nuttall is subjected to various frauds and impositions from his transient acquaintances , both resident and migratory . At times his boat is aground and he can not procure , from a fellow canoe-man , a lift of an oar to set him afloat again , without a douceur of eight or ten dollars ; at other times he is well nigh being robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should gather from ' his book , that it is customary in this western country to denominate rogues , knaves , and outlaws of evew description , by the general title of Yankees and New Englanders . How far this epithet m ' *y be deserved , we take not upon us to decide . It will be conceded , we believe , that the states of New Eng-. // land do not themselves so abound with characters of this de-* scription , but that justice and social order are still able to maintain their ground . And if rogues , who spring up among us , find it at any time more convenient and safe to remove their residence into other parts , where the arm of the law and the tone of morals are more favorable to the successful exercise of their callings ; far be it from us to complain of their absence , or urge their return . Mr Nuttall arrived at the mouth of the Arkansa about the middle of January , after a voyage very perilous to his little skiW among the snags and sawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Arkansa , through which the water runs iu opposite directions at different seaeons of the year . Leaving this bayou , ' says he , we entered the Arkansa , which was very low , but still red and muddy with the freshets of the Canadian . Most of the larger streams , which enter into it from the south , are charged with red and turbid water , while those of the north are clear . Every where I observed the chocolate or reddish brown clay of the salt formation deposited by the southern freshets . The . Arkansa had here a very gentle current , and was scarcely more than 200 yards wide , with its meanders on a small scale similar to those of the Mississippi . In consequence of the unrestrained dominion of the inundation , no settlements yet appeared in this quarter. * With painful exertions the boat was forced up the river , several days being requisite to ascend the first sixteen miles , in some of which they were obliged to wad9 more than three hours in the water to tow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden falling of the river produced by a corresponding ebb of the Mississippi . No change , ' says he , yet exists in the vegetation , and the scenery is almost destitute of every thing which is agreeable to human nature ; nothing yet appears but one vast trackless wilderness of trees , a dead solemnity , where the human voice is never heard to echo , where not even ruins of the humblest kind recal its history to mind , or prove the past dominion of man . All is rude nature as it sprang into existen* still preserving its primeval type , its unreclaimed exuberance . ' Over a large tract of country no settlement or even habitation has been attempted , the lands being wholly overflowed in freshets as // far as the Mississippi . On one side of the Arkansa the floods cover the whole intermediate space to White river , a distance of thirty miles . Within this tract cultivation can never take place without recourse to the same industry which has redeemed Holland from the ocean . The singular caprice of the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meandering through its alluvial valley , is truly remarkable . The variation of its channel is almost incredible , and the action which it exercises over the destiny of the soil can scarcely be conceived . After pursuing a given course for many ages , and slowly encroaching , it has at length cut through an isthmus , and thus abandoned , perhaps , a course of six or eight miles , in which the water , stagnating , at length becomes totally insulated , and thus presents a lagoon or lake . ' A few miles higher up is the post or town of Arkansas , situated on a prairie as elevated as the Chickasaw bluffs , and containing thirty or forty houses . Cotton and rice are cultivated here with success , but the growth of the place proceeds slowly , owing in some measure to the uncertain titles of the neighboring lands . Several enormous Spanish grants remain still undecided , that of the Messrs Winters of Natchez calling for no less than one million of acres . This claim , besides a great portion of the neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern border of the river , and extends for nearly one hundred miles along its hank . From Arkansas to Cadron ( or Quadrant ) a distance of about three hundred miles by water , there is a succession of small settlements or plantations , the greatest uninhabited interval not exceeding thirty miles . Mr Nuttall proceeded up the river in a large skiff bound to Bairdstown settlement . An account of the country , its Indian tribes , its botany , geology , and a description of some remarkable hills , constitute this portion of the itinerary . Above Cadron , at the distance of about two hundred miles , is Fort Smith , the highest garrison of the United States on the Arkansa river . It consists of two block houses , and lines of cabins or barracks for the accommodation of seventy men whom it contains . It is situated at the junction of the Pottoe , on a rising ground of about , fifty feet elevation , surrounded by alluvial lands and uplands of unusual fertility . After Mr Nuttall had remained some time at Fort Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Series , No. 13. 9 // ness which separates the Arkansa from the Red river . A company of soldiers was despatched by order of government , to expel some white residents , who had settled beyond the Kiamesha , on the territory ceded by the United States to the Osage Indians . To this expedition Mr Nuttall attached himself . The country between the two rivers , sometimes level , and sometimes rough and mountainous , afforded a rich botanical harvest of new and interesting plants . The traveller , enchanted by the beauties of these untrodden regions , seems to forget fatigue and danger , in contemplating the luxuriant scene around him . Our route , ' says he , was continued through prairies occasionally divided by sombre belts of timber , which serve to mark the course of the rivulets . These vast plains , beautiful almost as the fancied Elysium , were now enamelled with innumerable flowers , among the most splendid of which were the azure larkspur , gilded coreopsides , rudbeckias , fragrant phloxes , and the purple psilotria . Serene and charming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist but what contributes to harmony . ' B y the beginning of June the prairies began to be parched with drought . All the lesser brooks and neighboring springs were dried up , and the arid places appeared quite scorched with the heat . Still there prevailed throughout these prairies , as over the sea , a refreshing breeze , which continued for the greatest part of the day . The swarms of musquitoes which prove so troublesome along the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri , are here almost unknown , and never met with , except on the immediate*alluvial borders of the rivulets . In my solitary , but amusing rambles over these delightful prairies , I now for the first time in my life , notwithstanding my long residence and peregrinations in North America , hearkened to the inimitable notes of the mocking bird ( turdus polyglottus . ) After amusing itself in ludicrous imitations of other birds , perched on the topmost bough of a spreading elm , it at length broke forth into a strain of melody the most wild , varied , and pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than human . In the midst of these enchanting strains , which gradually increased to loudness , it oftentimes flew upward from the topmost twig , continuing its note , as if overpowered by the sublimest ecstacy . ' The chief population , except Indians , which is met with in these western wilds , consists of fugitives from justice , or perSons // whose moral character renders an abode with civilized society uncongenial to their habits . The condition of these people is represented as sufficiently deplorable . Situated on a sort of land debateable , ' between the Osage Indians and Cherokees , they are the subjects of continual abuse and plunder from both these tribes , without having the means of security or redress . At the Red river , Mr Nuttall became a sufferer for the indulgence of his botanical propensities . Having delayed about two hours behind his party , then on their return* he was led astray by a false track , and was never afterwards able to rejoin his companions . He was too remote to hear the guns fired as signals for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their camp half an hour after the party had left it . Not a moment was to be lost , and a guide was hired to find their trace , and if possible to overtake them . We travelled , ' says he , as fast as possible for about ten miles through a horrid brake of scrubby oaks , but all to no purpose , and , after firing a gun which was neither heard nor answered , we returned again , as I dared not venture alone and unprepared through such a difficult and mountainous wilderness . My botanical acquisitions in the prairies proved , however , so interesting as almost to make me forget my situation , cast away as I was amidst the refuse of society , without money and without acquaintance ; for calculating upon nothing more certain than an immediate return , 1 was consequently unprovided with every means of subsistence . ' In consequence of this disappointment , Mr Nuttall was obliged to remain two or three weeks at the cabin of a settler , and at length , as the best convoy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites going in pursuit of their horses stolen by the Cherokees . After wandering a week in the mountains with great toil and difficulty , they succeeded in gaining the garrison at Fort Smith . On the sixth of July Mr Nuttall continued his voyage up the Arkansa . After passing the mouths of the Canadian and Grand rivers , he entered a stream called the Verdigris . An interesting account is given of the country about these rivers , also a description of the customs and manners of the Osage Indians , too long for us to transcribe . An excursion was made up the Grand river to visit the Osage salt works , situated near // the residence of a white hunter , Mr Slover . This excursion is described as follows : This morning I walked with Mr Slover to see the salt works , now indeed lying idle , and nearly deserted in consequence of the murder of Mr Campbell , by Erhart , his late partner , and two ac-* complices in their employ . Melancholy as were the reflections naturally arising from this horrid circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps a similar fate . At the Cadron I had made application to Childers , one of these remorseless villains , as a woodsman and hunter , to accompany me for hire , only about a month before he had shot and barbarously scalped Mr Campbell , for the purpose of obtaining his little property , and in spite of the friendship which he had uniformly received from the deceased . But to return to the subject . We proceeded two miles , along the hilly and woody skirts of the river , and through the adjoining prairie to the saline , which appeared to be a gravelly alluvial basin , of about an acre in extent , and destitute of all vegetation . A small fresh water brook , now scarcely running , passed through this area , and the salt water , quite pellucid , issued copiously to the surface in various directions . In one place it boiled up out of a focus of near six inches diameter , emitting fetid bubbles of sulphuretted hydrogen , which deposited a slight scum of sulphur . All the springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bed of bituminous and sulphuretted slate-clay , visible on the margin of the stream , and , probably , underlaid by coal , through which the water rises to the surface . In the adjoining heights , a coarse grained sand stone occurs , answering the purpose of mill-stones . The stream then contracts at the entrance of a ledge of slaty rocks , and , about half a mile from its immediate outlet , the water is perfectly fresh . The only well dug upon the premises for the salt water , was about five feet deep , and quarried through a bed of dark coloured limestone , containing shells and nodules of black hornstone , similar to the chert of Derbyshire . This salt appears to be concomitant with a coaly or bituminous formation . No marine plants appear in this vicinity , as at Onondago , where we meet with the salicornia of the sea marshes . When the works were in operation , one hundred and twenty bushels of salt were manufactured in a week , and the water is said to be so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the lye . No mother water , or any thing almost but what is volatile , appears mixed with this salt , which is of the purest whiteness on the first boiling , and only takes about eighty gallons of water to produce a bushel . Hitherto these springs have been unaccompanied by any fossil remains of quadrupeds. * // Mr Nuttall had already been visited with attacks of a remittent fever , which , while it lessened his ability for the further prosecution of his enterprise , seems not to have damped his resolution . august 1 lth. - To day I left the trading establishment of the Verdigris , to proceed on a land journey up the Arkansa , accompanied by a trapper and hunter named Lee , who had penetrated across this country nearly to the sources of Red river , and followed his present occupation for upwards of eight years . We crossed the river , and proceeding through the alluvion , entered the prairie , over which we continued in a westwardly course , encamping in the evening upon the banks of a small creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prairies or grassy plains which we entered upon , a mile from the river , exhibited the same appearance as below , and on the opposite side of the river . The rock of the hills , like those of the prairies near the garrison , consisted of a ferruginous sand stone. - Our route was directed towards the Salt river , or first Red river of the Arkansa , called by Pike the Grand Saline , and about eighty or ninety miles distant from our encampment . 121h. - We continued our journey about sunrise , proceeding over the plain in a southwest direction. -.  - -   - -  The day being oppressively hot and thirsty , I very imprudently drank some very nauseous and tepid water , which immediately affected my stomach , and produced such a sicJ*ness , that it was with difficulty I kept upon my horse , until we arrived at the next creek for shelter , where we encamped and remained for the rest of the afternoon . Our horses were still tormented with the clegs or green-headed flies of the prairies , which goaded them without intermission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Osages had made , going out to hunt in a body of two or three hundred men and their families . Its direction was south or towards Red river . Two or three miles further we crossed their returning track . We were no way anxious to meet with Indians , as they would , probably , rob us of our horses , if not of our baggage , and ill treat us besides , according to the dictates of their caprice and the object of their party . To day we came about twenty miles . l3th. - We were again on our way soon after sunrise , and still continued through plains destitute of timber . No change yet appears in the vegetation ; and the superincumbent rock continues arenaceous . No mountains or picturesque prospects present themselves to amu* the eye . Occasionally indeed the monotonous plain is diversified by the view of low and broken ridges , often presenting isolated hills , deserted by the more friable materMs with which they were once sur // rounded , and presenting the fantastic appearance of artificial tumuli and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we passed three or four of these hillocks , of considerable elevation . About six miles from our encampment , to the right , there are two of them nearly together , and two also which are separated from each other , nearly opposite to the others on the left . The Indians remark them in the regulation of their routes , and , on some of them , they have made elevated interments . This fondness for burying in high places has not subsided among the aborigines , and , probably , gave rise to the erection of artificial hills over the remains of the dead . Blackbird , the chief of the Mahas , was interred , at his particular request , on the summit of a hill which overlooked the village ; and both the Mahas and the Arikarsees made choice of the summit of a neighboring ridge for their general place of sepulture. - 1 4th. -. - . We remained to day on the banks of the Little North Fork , to recruit our horses , that of my companion being from the first totally unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now experienced a relapse of the remittent fever , attended with delirium . Being about three o'clock in the afternoon when it came on , I was.exposed to a temperature of between 900 and 1000 . It was with difficulty that I could crawl into the shade , the thin forest being every where pervious to the sun , so that I felt ready to burn with heat ; by forcibly inciting a vomit , I felt relieved . Mr Lee , profiting by our delay , began to trap for beaver , and the last night caught four of these animals . Scarcely any thing is now employed for bait but the musk or castoreum of the animal itself . As they live in community , they are jealous and hostile to strangers of their own species , and following the scent of the bait , are deceived into the trap . 1 5th. - At night I again experienced an attack of fever , without any preceding chill , and attended with diarrho*a . It continued thirty-six hours , the paroxysm being only divided for a short space by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my companion , for the purpose of trapping , we went about five miles lower down the rivulet . In proceeding this short distance , I fain ted with the effort , and was near falling off my horse . All the remainder of the day , and the succeeding night , I experienced the fever under the exposure of a burning sun and sultry air . Shade was not to be obtained , and the night brought with it no alleviation but darkness . In the evening , Mr Lee suggested the propriety of our returning to the Verdigris , before I became so iik*ak as to render it impossible ; but the idea of returning filled me with deep regret , and I felt strongly opposed to it , whatever might be the consequences. - // 2Oth. - Mr Lee now said *nothing more about returning , as his horse was become incapable of carrying either himself or his baggage . We had no method left of proceeding , at present , but by making double journeys , and employing my horse to convey the whole . The flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen , and almost every thing about us with maggots . To compensate , however , in some measure , for these disgusting and familiar visitors , we had the advantage of the bee , and obtained abundance of excellent honey , on which , mixed up with water , I now almost entirely subsisted , as we had no other food but venison , and were without either bread or vegetables. - 2lst. - The fever had now rendered me too weak to bear any exercise ; and it was become impossible to find any thing which would suit my feeble appetite . In the commencing coolness of the weather , I had , however , a reasonable hope of recovery. - 26th. - While Mr Lee was absent this morning , examining the beaver traps , which he had set , to my surprise I observed on the opposite side of the creek , an Indian busily examining our horses ; after viewing them a few minutes , he chased them down the creek in a gallop towards our encampment , and after looking at me also with caution , instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say how unwelcome this intelligence was to my cautious companion , who had not now to learn the rapacity of the savage hunters , having nearly lost his life , and all his property , last autumn , by falling in with the Cherokees near the banks of the Canadian . We delayed not a moment to leave our encampment , expecting nothing more certain than an unfriendly visit or clandestine theft : My own situation was indeed extremely critical , as I could not possibly walk , and even required assistance to get on and off my horse : thus to have had it stolen would have been to leave me to perish without hope . As we passed along , something , which I imagined to be an Indian , dodged near us twice , from amidst the high grass , like some unfriendly animal of the forest , and slunk from our observance . This evening I felt extremely unhappy , and became quite delirious ; when reclined , it was with difficulty that I could rise ; a kind of lethargy , almost the prelude of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pain . 27th. - Three days were now elapsed since I had been able to taste any kind of food , and to add to the miseries of sickness , delirium , and despondence , we experienced as many days of unremitting gloom , in which the sun was not vis4Ae even for an hour . 3Oth. - Being a little recovered , we now ventured out some distance into the priarie hills ; but , after travelling a few miles without much pain , my mind became so unaccountably affected // with horror and distraction , that for a time , it was impossible to proceed to any convenient place of encampment . This evening my companion killed two bison , the first we had seen on the route , but neither of them were fat , or any thing like tolerable food . I here spent a night of great misery and delirium , and felt exceedingly cold from the sudden decrease of the temperature . September lst. - We proceeded about ten miles over wooded hills , with the expectation of soon arriving at the Salt river , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or southwest , but were entirely deceived , and my companion now appeared to be ignorant of the country . We saw nothing far and wide but an endless scrubby forest of dwarfish oaks , chiefly the post , black , and red species . 3d. - We continued on about twenty-six miles through the same kind of deeply undulated country , abounding with clear , grit springs , but the land poor , and covered with scrubby oak , except occasional prairie , openings , and narrow valleys . At length we arrived on the banks of a small clear brook , dammed up by the beaver , where we obtained a ford . Towards evening , greatly fatigued , and with our course directed more towards the west , we observed clouds of sand to arise at a distance , which we were satisfied must originate from the beach of some neighboring river , and. , in about an hour after , we came upon the rocky bank of the First Red Fork or Salt river , which , though very low , was still red and muddy , bordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not greatly differing from it apparently in point of magnitude . Along the argillaceous banks I observed saline incrustations , and , on tasting the water , I found it to be nauseous , and impotably saline . Our horses , however , naturally fond of salt , drank of it with the utmost greediness . Though gratified by the sight of this curious stream , which we had so tediously sought , I now lamented the loss of the fine spring water lately afforded us by the barren hills . This extensive stream constitutes the hunting boundary of the Pawnees and Hietans . Its first view appeared beautifully contrasted with the broken and sterile country through which we had been travelling . The banks of cottonwood ( populus monilifera ) bordered by the even beach , resembled a verdant garden in panorama view . A few days journey to the west , Mr Lee informs me , that there are extensive tracts of moving sand hills , accompanied by a degree of sterility little short of the African deserts . 4th. - We continued a few miles up the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . BAit the following day ( 5th ) we concluded on leaving it , studying our safety from the Osages , whose traces became now more and more evident . We pursued our course along the sand beaches of the river , now op .. // pressively hot , and about noon turned out into a shade . Here , unfortunately , while iVir Lee was busied about his beaver traps , his horse got into a miry gully , and could not be extricated . In this dilemma , no resource for proceeding remained for my companion , but to construct a canoe , and so descend by water. - On the 8th , my companion launched his canoe , which so exactly answered his purpose , that it would have sunk with any additional loading . Although I had now so far recovered as to possess a little appetite , we were , for several days , destitute of any kind of food , except the tails of the beaver , the flesh of this animal being now too lean and musky to be eaten . The game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of the Indians . I still continued my route along the beaches of the river , which proved almost insupportably hot , and I severely felt the want of fresh water , though it now , from necessity , became possible for me to swallow this tepid brine. - 9th. - About noon we arrived at the entrance of the Arkansa , and were once more gratified with the taste of fresh water . Here the stream , now at its lowest depression , was almost colorless , and scarcely any where exceeding the depth of three feet . We travelled down it nine or ten miles , and saw the ascending smoke of the general encampments of the Osages , whom , if possible , we wished to avoid . By the multitude of traces upon the sand , it was easy to perceive that the whole village and its accompaniments were in motion . lOth. - We still saw the smoke uf the Osage fires in all directions , and hourly expected a discovery . As I passed along contiguous to the river , now alone , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to come up , dodged out of sight , and then ran along with haste towards his encampment . This wolfish behavior , it may be certain , was not calculated to give me any very favorable anticipation of our reception . I could not help indeed reflecting on the inhospitality of this pathless desert , which will one day perhaps give way to the blessings of civilization . The scenery was not without beauty ; wooded hills of gentle slope every where bordered the river ; and its islands and alluvions , still of considerable extent , are no way inferior to the lands of the Ohio . 1 lth. - To- day with all our caution , it became impossible to avoid the discovery of the Indians , as two or three families were encamped on the borders of the river . They ran up to us with a confidence which was by no means reciprocal . One of the men was a blind chief , not unknown to Mr*Lee , who gave him some tobacco , with which he appeared to be satisfied . About the encampment there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old woman , resembling one of the imaginary // witches of Macbeth , told me , with an air of insolence , that I must give her my horse for her daughter to ride on ; I could walk ; - that the Osages were numerous and could soon take it from me. - At length , they got to pilfering our baggage ; even the blind chief , who had showed us a commendatory certificate which he had obtained at St Louis , also turned thief on the occasion . We had not got out of the sight of these depredators , before another fellow came after us on the run , in order to claim my horse , insisting that it was his , and I could no way satisfy his unfounded demand , but by giving him one of my blankets . Mr Lee , as he descended , now observed two men on the shore , who hid themselves at his approach , and began to follow him as secretly as possible . They continued after us all the remainder of the day , till dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob us ; and endeavoring to elude their pursuit , we kept on in the night , amidst the horrors of a thunder storm , the most gloomy and disagreeable situation I ever experienced in my life . In consequence also of the quicksands and the darkness , it was with the utmost difficulty that I could urge my horse to take the river , which it was necessary repeatedly to cross . In one of these attempts , both myself and it were on the point of being buried before we could extricate ourselves . Dressed in leather , I came out of the water drenched and shivering , almost ready to perish with cold . After some persuasion , I prevailed upon Lee to kindle me a handful of fire , by which I lay alone for two or three hours , amidst the dreary howling of wolves , Mr Lee not wishing to trust himself near such a beacon . Nothing , however , further molested us , and , after cooking and eating a portion of a fat buck elk , which my companion had contrived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our journey by the light of the moon . After proceeding about twenty miles farther down the Arkansa , unable to keep up with Lee and his boat , at noon we agreed to part . I took with me some small pieces of the boiled elk , with a portion also uncooked , and furnished myself , as I thought , with the means of obtaining fire , but when evening arrived I was greatly mortified to find all my attempts to obtain this necessary element abortive . My gun was also become useless , all the powder having got wet by last night 's adventure . 1 4th. - Fatigued with the sand-beaches , as hot and cheerless as the African deserts , I left the banks of the river ; and after travel. * ling with extreme labor through horrible thickets for three miles , in which the *mbrosias were far higher than my head on horseback , I at length arrived amongst woody hills , art*l a few miles further came out , to my great satisfaction , into the open prairies , from whence , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night , though late , I arrived on its wide // alluvial lands , lined with such an impenetrable thicket , that I did not attain the bank , and had to lie down alone in the rank weeds , amidst musquetoes , without fire , food , or water , as the meat with which I had been provided was raw , and spoiled by the worms . 1 5th. - With all the advantage of daylight , it was still difficult to penetrate through the thicket , and ford the river . Towards evening , I again arrived at the trading establishment of Mr Bougie , an asylum , which probably at this time rescued me from death . My feet and legs were so swelled , in consequence of weakness and exposure to extreme heat and cold , that it was necessary to cut off my pantaloons , and at night both my hands and feet were affected by the most violent cramp. * We have confined ourselves chiefly to the narrative part of this volume , and have omitted to notice a great deal of curious information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting of condensation . Besides a multitude of new and previously undiscovered plants , our author met with the *xia celestina , a beautiful plant discovered long ago by Bartram , in Florida , but not seen since by any one until now . The bow wood , or osage apple , ( called by Mr Nuttall maclura , ) a tree which has excited much curiosity , was met with in thickets upon the Red river . Among other curiosities was a species of ritus , perfectly resembling the rhus cotinus , or smoke tree of our gardens , and perhaps identical with it . Concerning the Indian tribes who still maintain their foothold in our forests , Mr Nuttall has furnished minute and characteristic information . To the various traits drawn of them in the body of the work , he has subjoined an appendix of several sections , containing , 1 . An account of the ancient aboriginal population on the banks of the Mississippi and contiguous country ; 2 . The history of the Natchez ; 3 . Observations on the Chickasaws and Choctaws . We understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected vocabularies and formed comparisons of the languages of the numerous tribes he has visited ; and made extensive observations on the aboriginal antiquities of the western country . To the public in Europe as well as America Mr Nuttall is advantageously known by his scientific publications . His work in two volumes on the Genera of North american plants , the fruit of much industry and research , is replete with comprehensive // and philosophic views of natural affinities ; although we could wish , for the benefit of the already cumbersome science to which it belongs , that its innovations on previous nomenclature had been made with a more sparing hand . His Geological sketch of the valley of the Mississippi embodies information , which probably no other individual was qualified to give . Besides various scientific papers of a very creditable kind in the different journals and transactions already published , we are yet to expect from him a Flora of the Arkansa territory , and the work already alluded to on aboriginal antiquities and language . Iu the recent appointment of Mr Nuttall as curator and lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find a resting place from his wanderings , as pleasant and advantageous to himself , as it will be welcome to those who may receive the benefit of his instructions .
