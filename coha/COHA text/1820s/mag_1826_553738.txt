THE advances that have been made in education , during the present century , so far as elementary books are concerned , are among the most noticeable things of the age . We do not speak merely of the increase of such books ; for this , apart froni their increasing merit , is no inconsiderable evil . But there has been , from the humblest schools up to our highest academical institutions , much actual improvement in books and modes of instruction , which are so intimately connected , that they may be expected to advance with equal steps . Scholars have not been disposed , in general , to acknowledge , that there are many dis. * // coveries to be made in the methods of imparting a knowledge of what mankind have been constantly learning , ever since the dark ages , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ; but whatever may have been our belief on the subject in our reasonings a priori , there are examples enough of recent improvements , not indeed to justify the visionary theorists , who look forward to a summary process for all sorts of learned acquirements , but enough to satisfy the reasonable expectations of wiser men , who have grieved over the elaborate processes gone through by leam*rs for the obtaining of slender results , and the lamentable mechanical contrivanees resorted to for learning that , which ought to be the work of the understanding . We are not among those who think that children and young people will ever find , that they can play their progressive course through all learning and knowledge ; but we know and have seen how much encouragement they want , and how unreasonably their elders sometimes presume upon their capacities , and power of attention and of reasoning from one example to another , little remembering the bitter tears , and disappointments , and mortifications of their own boyish years from the same source . Knowing these things , we would encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacrifice of anything valuable *in what is to be learned . It is with this view of the case , that we are always pleased to see every useless incumbrance thrown off ; to see logic despoiled of is old barbarous terms ; to see the rules in our Latin grammars , expressed in our vernacular language ; to see everything techninal rejected , except so far as it is subsidiary to the understanding and memory , in acquiring and retaining valuable truth . Not that we approve of perpetual change , without evident practical benefit . roo much of caprice has been witnessed in this respect , in the multiplication and introduction of school books ; and a foolish vanity has often instigated a teacher to issue his spelling book , or grammar , or arithn*etic , of which the highest praise is , that it is harmless or superfluous . But while the market has been filled with these small and easily wrought wares , there has , till of late , been wanting an elementary work on ancient and modern history . Tytler 's Elements , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice , has been regarded , as it descrves to be , with respect . Formed from the abundant materials furnished by a course of lectures on general history , which he delivered // for a succession of years in the University of Edinburgh , it might be expected to display all the learning and fidelity , which the subject demands . And in these respects , the reader is not disappointed ; for the work manifests much diligent research , and a good deal of philosophical reflection . It imparts a just knowledge of the progress of literature and the arts , and of the state of society and government of different countries at different periods . All this is done so much better than it had been done before , in a small compass , that the work is a very useful addition to the class of books to which it belongs , though not calculated for the earlier stages of education . It too frequently indicates , that its origin was in the lecture room ; for while it is sufficiently full of the philosophy of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples , to comport with the ancient definition of history given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus , which is so often quoted to this day . The speculations are too often dry and uninteresting , and not sufficiently intelligible to the young pupil , whose attention must be lured by easy and simple narrative , and who can not be expected to gain much from abstruse reasonings upon causes and consequences , either physical or moral . The style of this history partakes of the general character of the work itself ; and is wanting in that simplicity , which is necessary to adapt it to youthful minds . Well conducted philosophical discussions concerning persons and facts , arc indeed among the higher excellences of the historian ; but considerable maturity of mind is requisite , in order to estimate their value , and to derive from them the instruction they are intended to impart . We are persuaded that many of these discussions in Tytler 's Elements are above the reach of learners , and anticipate much more historical knowledge than the book itself furnishes . This is a great blemish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest mistakes , and a mistake among the most difficult to avoid , both in books and in modes of teaching , is the presuming of too many things as already known , which are known only to the writer or preceptor . We are too apt in imparting instruction to children and youth , to come too suddenly to results , forgetting some of the steps by which we ourselves arrived at the knowledge we would convey ; and the learner strives and perplexes himself in vain , to supply the defects of his teacher . One other defect of this work , considered as an elementary // book , is the arrangement of its materials . It is divided into chapters , the subjects of which are often but slightly , and sometimes not at all connected with each other . The thread of historical narrative is so frequently broken , that the interest of the pupil is not awakened and sustained , and he comes from his task with vague and indistinct impressions . After having studied the whole work with diligence , he will indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge will be confused and unconnected , and no regular outline of the history of any empire or state will be impressed upon his mind . We are confirmed in the justness of the foregoing remarks , by the testimony of several experienced teachers ; and it was probably the growing dissatisfaction with Tytler 's Elements , which was perceived to exist among instructers and their pupils , that induced one of our own countrymen to offer the public a work of similar kind , but of a character more pleasing and popular . The work to which we refer , is a Compend of History , by Samuel Wheipley . If Tytler , in his style , aiming to be didactic , is dry , and philosophically dull ; Whelpley , on the contrary , striving to charm too much , by the eloquence of his diction , is often verbose and declamatory . As it is impossible to tell at how early a period of life a false taste in the use of language may be formed , we do not think it unimportant , and we deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faults of style , which pervade this Compend . We have said it is declamatory , not in the worst sense of the word , but far too declamatory for history . It is seldom sufficiently simple , and everywhere abounds too much in epithets ; and the writer too frequently forgets , that there is any distinction between the province of the histo , rian , and that of the orator . Hence it is there are many passages , which would not disgrace a fourth of July oration , and some , which would be animated and not unseemly in the pulpit ; but which , in both kinds , are out of place in history . The directions of all the standard , philosophical critics require in narration a style at once concise and comprehensive , a style , which rejects superfluous words and circumstances . Redundant epithets are even sparingly allowed to poets ; least of all writers , perhaps , to the historian . But beside the multitude of epithets , in the Gompend of which we are speaking , they are often offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the // duty of the historian to give the proper moral distinctions between characters and between actions ; but having done this , without exaggeration , he has done his duty . There is no need of perpetually heaping up epithets , as if it were impossible to reach the full measure of panegyric or indignation , which the person or action seems to invite or provoke . Infamous , atrocious , and abandoned , ' are all linked together to brand one character ; another is an infernal monster , ' and his acts those of savage barbarity ; ' atrocities of a villain , who deserves to sink into the shades of eternal infamy , ten thousand degrees below Nero or Domitian . ' Now we must acknowledge , that these , and many other examples of the same kind , are not to our taste ; and we should fear they would rather give our children a relish for the language of violent crimination , than increase their abhorrence of the criminal or of his crimes . The arrangement of Wheipley is far preferable to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with much less interruption . Many chasms have been filled by the recent editor , who laments , that the author scarcely touched some of the most important topics of history . The additions thus made , comprise about a third part of the last edition , and a valuable part ; but they show the difficulty of completing a. work , projected , but not sufficiently filled up by a previous hand . Though most of the additions are such as belong to a book of this kind , according to its general plan , yet they are sometimes disproportioned to the other parts , and more prolix than the subjects themselves seem to require . There are some portions of the modern history , and those perhaps not the least entertaining and instructive , which do not come strictly within the plan of a compendious history . We mean those parts , which deal in generalities , which appear to belong to geography or itineraries , rather than to an elementary work of universal history . If the remarks we have made are well grounded ( and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned ) , the appearance of a compend of history , more elementary than any preceding , can not be unwelcome . We have , therefore , been induced to examine Mr Worcester 's Elements of History , with attention , in the hope , that its contents would vindicate its title . His well earned reputation , in works of a kindred sort , justly excited an expectation concerning its merits , in which we are not disappointed . Though at first sight it may // appear to be too small , and too limited in its details , yet it will be found to contain a great mass of facts ; for it is altogether historical , ; and shows that the author keeps in view the boundaries , which separate history , as well from geography , as from biography and travels , except so far as the ground is necessarily comiiion . Geography is unavoidably connected , in some degr*e , with history ; and in such a manner , that it has been significantly called , no less than chronology , one of the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new task with peculiar advantages , which will he more distinctly perceived , when we come to speak of the Charts , which accompany the History . Historical truth is obtained frequently with great difficulty . In modern , and even in recent history , much critical discrimination , no less than unceasing fidelity , is often required to separate the true from the false . But in ancient history the task is vastly greater . The real and the fabulous have come down to us so mingled , as to demand the severest exertion of judgment to distinguish them . If , however , the object of history be not something more than amusement , or something different from instructive fiction , the labor of distinguishing them would hardly be repaid ; and the credulity or want of discrimination , which mark the ancient history of Rollin , and which caused him to admit into it so much exaggeration , and so much of fictitious story , are not deserving of censure . But as a main object of history is truth , we can not but commend the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his elements of ancient history , what in his estimation is fabulous , or gives the necessary cautions against receiving it for truth . It will be thought by some , perhaps , that this work is too partial in its extent , and that , in modern history particularly , it should embrace all the principal states and empires ; giving to each a proportion of space corresponding to its relative importance , instead of confining its details to a few , whose history is the most interesting . This apparent defect , however , is supplied in a great measure by the Charts , in which is embraced a vast deal more than , from a cursory survey of them , we should be led to conclude . The foundation is therefore laid for an elementary history far more extensive , which the author can hereafter build upon , if it should be demanded . In. the mean time , the pupil , who shall become possessed of all the facts which are here offered him , will have made no small advances in historical . // knowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , not only in the charts , which assist the memory , by forming a kind of picture of history for the eye , but also by the style in which the Elements are written . It is a style uniformly neat ; without effort or perceivable ambition ; without exaggera* tion from the use of superlative epithets ; and unpolluted by any gross expressions . At the same time , it does not want for vivacity , and as far as we can judge for our juniors , we should expect to find the book read with great interest by them , and to he well understood by all , who are capable of entering on the stu ( ly of history . Connected with the Elements are nine large folio charts , comprising historical facts , combined with chronology , in such a way , that the great outlines of history may be learned with far greater facility , and by the power of association will be more permanently fixed in the memory , than in the ordiuary method . There is no forced analogy , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chart giving nearly the same kind of locality to persons and things , as the map does to places . Single charts of history and biography have been more or less used for many years ; and valuable collections , like that of be Sage , have been published in a manner much too expensive for zeneral use ; so that Mr Worcester is the first , who has given the American public an opportunity to try this mode of instruction to any great extent . We have carefully examined his charts , and are fully persuaded of their great utility , and of their general correctness . One gre at excellence of these charts is , that , when studied with the Elements , they will enable the pupil to attend at once in the connexion of time and subject , and thus remove a great difficulty , which has always been experienced in the arrangement of general history . By means of the charts , the author has been enabled to devote his book to the more important parts of history , and to some topics particularly useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the necessity of incumbering it with dates , to any considerable degree , and been enabled to trace a regular and uninterrupted outline of those empires or states , a knowledge of which is most important or interesting to the mass of readers and pupils in our own country . By presenting the whole skeleton of history ( if we may so speak ) in the charts , the necessity of treating of the minor states , in the book itself , is for the most part unneee*sarv : for by inspecting* // the charts , one may see when and how long these stafes flourished ; their rise , progress , and fall ; and what st*ites were contemporary with each other . The first of these charts is perhaps less original in its construction and plan , than any of the number , being , except in the ecclesiastical part , much like those of Priestley and Bailey . As a whole , they manifest great ingenuity of contrivance , and convey as much knowledge , and in a way as intelligible , as we can conceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conveying ; and being bound separately from the Elements , and accompanied by questions adapted to the use of them , they can be studied by themselves , or in connexion with any compend of history . The best method of teaching history , as well as geography , is a subject , which has been much agitated of late ; and though we can not give an opinion upon it from actual experience , yet we shall here advert to it for a moment , before closing our remarks . One of the most useful directions for facilitating the study of history , according to Dr Priestley , is to begin with authors , who present a eo ? hpendium , or general view of the whole subject of history , and afterwards to apply to the study of any particular history , with which a more thorough acquaintance is desired . This always appeared to us rational , and we have not , till recently , been aware , that pupils , who were disposed to learn at all , revolted with any disgust from the course thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemiis to us , between the inductive method of reasoning in metaphysics and intellectual philosophy , and the way of pursuing various arts , it is strenuously maintained by some , that in history , a well as in everything else , the learner must begin with what is nearest to him ; that he must commence with his own little precinct , as the centre of his circle , and pursue the radii and concentric circles , till he has compassed our whole sphere . Now this may be very amusing in its commencement , both to the instmucter and to the pupil ; but as to its practical superiority over the common method , if it is expected to be carried forward to its Pall extent , we are wholly incredulous . Even in geography , in regard to which the plan is more intelligible , we can not perceive its use beyond the merest incipient state of instruction , certainly not as a substitute for the mode of teaching by approved books and maps . In history its use*must be still more limited . Everything , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or remote , may be subsidiary to one 's progress in the knowledge of it , and the pupil may come to transfer the interest , which he feels in particulars , to the general study . If what we have now admitted , be anything like , or nearly the same as what is intended by the projectors of reform , in this part of education , then it is unreasonable in them to talk so much and so loudly against the books and modes of instruction in present use . But if much more is intended , it amounts to an innovation , as it seems to us , wholly groundless , and altogether hopeless as to practical improvement . We have seen no books formed on the plan proposed , to any great extent , for not even the geography of Pestalozzi has much to do with such a plan ; and apart from his definitions , and we approve of a liberal use of definitions , we can see nothing in the work , which claims a remarkable share of praise ; and as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , which is brought into view in the system of which we are speaking , is very agreeable , and has some great advantages ; but they are such pleasures and advantages as few have the means of enjoying to any great degree . Be they evem so great , however , this kind of instruction can not supersede , nor is it desirable that it should , in any stage of education , the use of books . Certain it is , that oral instruction in the arts and sciences , can never become general , till the return of the patriarchal age , when every parent shall be able to teach all , that it is important his children should learn . We do not fear , therefore , for our reputation , in recommending Mr Worcester 's History for what it claims to be , an elementary book ; and besides its general excellences , which we have mentioned , it will impart much information , not commonly found in treatises of this kind , which a young student needs to be furnished with ; such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and literature .
