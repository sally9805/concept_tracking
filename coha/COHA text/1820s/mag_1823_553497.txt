txt ART . X.-.I New System of Modern Geography , or a view of the present state of the world , with an appendix containing statistical tables of the population , commerce , revenue , expenditure , and various institutions of the United States ; and general views of Europe and the world . By Sidney E. Morse , .11 . M. dccompanied with an atlar . Svo. pp. 676 . Boston and New Haven . Tnis is the best treatise of universal geography , which we have seen published in this country . Within a few years several small works have been published , of a much higher character than those previously in use , but they are much too brief to give any adequate description of the different countries of the globe . To the imperfection of the elementary books on this subject in the English language , we are to attribute the very great neglect of the study of geography as a part of the education , even of those who are the most assiduous in the pursuit of useful learning . It could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world should be derived from the study of a mere summary of geography , comprised within the compass of two or three hundred duodecimo pages . The present work , although but a compendinin of universal geography , is much more extensive than those , to which we have alluded . It exhibits marks of extensive research , and of care and judgment in digesting and arranging the mass of materials , from which it is compiled . The part of it devoted to a description of the United States of America is perhaps executed in a more satisfactory manner , than any other part . The author has consulted in general the most recent documents , which have been published , for information relative to the country at large , and to the several states . There are , however , some parts of the work , which we think susceptible of material improvement . Tim part , which we consider liable to the greatest objection , is the introduction. , consisting principally of an imperfect treatise upon astronomy . // A great part of this treatise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solar system , as will serve to explain the different phenomena relating to the earth and which depend upon its being a part of that system , forms a proper and necessary part of a treatise upon geography . But every thing beyond this is superfluous , and belongs exclusively to a science which ought to be studied after that of geography . A description of the form , dimensions , and revolutions of the earth , and of the different circles of the sphere , is necessary to give a clear idea of what is meant by latitude and longitude , of the causes of the change of seasons , and of the variety of seasons in the different parts of the world , of the different degrees of heat and cold , and of the difference in the length of days . But a particular description of all the planets and their satellites , of the sun and its revolutions , and of the fixed stars , does not serve to illustrate any thing which belongs to the study of geography . We therefore consider the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this introduction , as irrelevant to the purpose , and calculated to prevent the young student from acquiring a clear understanding of those few principles of astronomy , which we have described as necessary to be understood . A work of this kind ought to give , either in the introduction or in the body of the work , a precise statement of the measures , weights , and monies of the different countries , or at least of those countries , whose books we read , or with which we have a frequent intercourse . This kind of information , which is often very important , is either not given at all , or given very imperfectly , in this work . The introduction contains a table of measures of distances , which is not very complete , and is quite inaccurate , and it is followed by a table of scripture measures , which appears to have nothing to do with the subject . We have not observed that the work before us states the number of miles to a degree , or the length of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The importance of such a table has induced us to subjoin the following , which we believe will be found accurate : // Comparison of the miles of different countries . German Swedish French myriametre Italian Arabian Turkish Dutch Spanish and Polish Danish Old French league English and French marine Irish English geographical mile Scotch Hungarian English statute mile 4.62 or 6.65 or 6.23 or 1.16 or 1.22 or 1.04 or 3.65 or 3.41 or 4.69 or 2.77 or league 3.46 or 1.25 or 1.16 1.39 5.78 15 to a degree 10.41 .11k 60 56* 66.67 19 20 14.79 25 20 54* or 60 or 49* or 12 or 69.36 We do not think that the arrangement is very judicious . Although to an American student a particular knowledge of his own country is more important than that of the other quarters of the globe , this does not furnish any conclusive reason for placing the description of America first in the arrangement of the work . There are several reasons why Europe should be described first ; one of which is , that many portions of America are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of its population derived from that quarter . The geography of Europe is more complete , and susceptible of being reduced to a more systematic order than that of America , and for this reason is more suited to occupy the front place in the work . There seems also to be a want of system in the order of arrangement of the different countries . In the description of the American colonies , those which depend upon the same European power should be placed ' by themselves . The order of arrangement of the different kingdoms of Europe appears to be entirely arbitrary . It may admit of doubt what principle of arrangement ought to be adopted , yet it can not be doubted that there would be an advantage in some systematic order . After the head of Germany , for example , . and a description of the minor German states , follows // Prussia , then Spain , Portugal , Italy , the Italian States , and Austria . It might have been expected that more regard would be had , in the arrangement , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their geographical position . There is also a want of distinctness in the account of the Turkish government , one of the most important , certainly , without the pale of Christendom . As the natural division of the earth into continents is assumed as the basis of the work , a difficulty of course presents itself in describing a government like Turkey , whose territories are divided between Europe , Asia , and Africa . Nevertheless , somewhere in the hook a table might be given of the Turkish empire , consisting of Turkey in Europe , Turkey in Asia , Turkey in Africa . The two former of these appellations are indeed retained ; but the African dominions of the Porte are not given with suflicient precision . The connexion of Egypt with the Grand Seignior is dismissed with the simple epithet of nominal ; while the relation of the Barbary regencies does not appear to be given at all . We may mention as a general defect , not of this work , but of all our geographical compends , that they afford too little information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of the codes or systems of law in the various countries , the distribution of estates , the privileges or incapacities of the different classes might be easily furnished , and impart more light on the state of man in the different countries , than all that is contained under the rubrics of education , religion , or government . Taking England , for instance , as an example , there is no question but the condition of that country depends far more on the statute of distributions , the laws prescribing the conditions on which a settlement is obtained , and the system of parliamentary elections , than on the great nomi** nal features of the constitution . We speak not of this , however , as particularly a defect in the present work . We may regard it as one , that the computation by pounds sterling is retained in most statements relative to all countries , as Germany for instance , which have been derived from English sources , Our decimal notation is in itself far more beautiful and convenient ; the pounds , shillings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a work like this , designed to go into the hands of the rising generation , every thing should be done to contribute to the diffusion of our admirable national notation . Having mentioned Germany , we can not but bestow great praise , ( with the slight exception now taken , ) on the account of this country . In no article have most preceding compends been more erroneous . In the present work , the main facts with regard to this important country are given from authentic sources . A few general views , however , remain to be corrected , as where it is stated that Saxony is more distinguished for literature than any other part i ) f Germany . ' This can not be regarded as correct in any acceptation in which Saxony is now used . Under the head of Turkey in Europe , we think the modern travellers in Greece could have furnished more information than is presented . The dependence of Wallachia and Moldavia on the Porte is not accurately stated , nor are the Greek governors , appointed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their most common names , Hospodar. - Athens is not a part of the province of Livadia , nor is it true in any sense , that its ruins remain for the most part in a state little inferior to their original splendor . ' The temple of Minerva ' is not converted into a mosque ; but a miserable structure , called a mosque , is built up on a part of the area of the Parthenon , of which only the porticos at the two ends and a portion of the cell are standing . The most perfect ancient building at Athens is the Theseum. - Plata*a , enumerated among the towns of Turkey , is a cornfield without a habitation near it . in several parts of the work attention has not been had to conform the traditionary geographical statements , which have stood their ground in defiance of all improvements , to the present state of literature in general . Thus , under the head of Malacca is a description given of running amok . This practice is certainly not confined to the Malays of the coast of Malacca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English language to be brought back to a foreign orthography . We could point out other little errors of this kind , but we would not be thought to find unnecessary , fault . Upon the whole we entertain a very favorable opinion of the work , and cheerfully recommend it to general use . It exhibits proofs of * See Crawford 's Indian Archipelago . // patient inquiry on the almost infinite number of topics , which come within the scope of such a work , and it has perhaps as few defects as ought to be expected in any production , the subject of which is perpetually changing .
