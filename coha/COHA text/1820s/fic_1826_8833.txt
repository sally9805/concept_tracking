Southern District of New-York , ss . BE IT REMEMBERED , That on the twenty-seventh day of May , A. D. 1826 , in the fiftieth year of the Independence of the United States of America , C. S. Van Winkle of the said district , hath deposited in this office the title of a book the right whereof he claims as proprietor , in the words following , to wit : " Richelieu : a domestic Tragedy , founded on fact .

" JAMES DILL , Clerk of the Southern District of New-York . TO WASHINGTON IRVING . My Dear Irving , It is about twenty years since I first had the pleasure of knowing you ; and it is not very often that people are found better friends at the later part of so long an acquaintance than at the beginning . Such , however , has been the case with us ; and the admiration which I felt for you when I was a boy , has been succeeded by gratitude for steady and intrepid kindness , now that I am no longer one . Although I have had better opportunities to know you than the world , by whom you are valued so highly , I should not have ventured to make a public display of our acquaintanceship , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth at present . I am under obligations to you beyond the common kindnesses between friends of long standing , which it is fitting I should acknowledge . In the little comedy of Charles the Second I have referred to the assistance you gave me , without venturing to violate your injunction with regard to the concealment of your name . But that aid has been repeated to such an extent in the present work , as to render it imperative upon me to offer you my thanks publicly ; and to beg you will suffer me to dedicate it to one from whose pen it has received its highest value . I only regret it is not in my power to make a more adequate return for the many encouragements amid discomfort which you have so frequently and so spontaneously bestowed upon , My dear Irving , Your sincere and grateful Friend , JOHN HOWARD PAYNE . Paris , No. 89 Rue de Richelieu , February 13 , 1826 . ADVERTISEMENT . The play I now offer to the perusal of my countrymen has been some time announced for performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall not know whether it succeeded or failed , until the present copy is on its way to the land I myself so anxiously long to see once more before I die . There are kind friends in that land who will be kind to it merely for my sake . How it may fare in England , it is impossible for me even to conjecture . I learn it was to be represented with material alterations ; but these alterations have been made without my privity , in compliance with the objections of the licensers , for some political reasons which can not prevail in America . The subject is historical , and it is a faithful picture of high life in France at the time in which the scene is placed  --  a state of manners and morals which led to all the subsequent sufferings of that country , and especially of that class . Those who wish to be more thoroughly apprised how far the present is an original work , will oblige me by comparing it with the French play of that excellent writer M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acted in Paris some thirty years ago . The opposition to it in the office of the Lord Chamberlain has been strong and unexplained ; and its final production in any shape is entirely to be ascribed to the zeal and spirit of my excellent friend , Mr. Charles Kemble . J. H. P. Paris , Feb. 13 , 1826 . CHARACTERS . The Duke of Richelieu . Dceois , his Secretary . Lamotte , the Duke 's gentleman . Dorival . Lacquey . Madam Dorival . The Countess Fleury . Janet , Madam Dorival 's Nurse . The scene is at Paris , and varies alternately from the house of Dorival to the palace of Richelieu , in the centre of the city , and a small palace of his in the suburbs . Main text ACT THE FIRST . SCENE . A parlour in the house of Dorival neatly , but not expensively furnished . A plain piano ; and materials for drawing and embroidery  --  unfinished sketches scattered about . Janet is discovered setting the room , and talking as she puts the things in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine mopes of late ,  --  neglects all her employments ; her paintings , her music , her embroidery , all never touched ! I 've caught her crying , too , and marked her wipe away the tears on seeing me , and try to smile . All this is not natural . I 've a mind to ask her ;  --  but no . Janet !  --  that 's no business of yours . And yet , why not ? Did I not receive her into these arms when she first saw the light ? Do I not love her better than any thing in the world ? And does she not love me too ? But stop . If she has a secret , and does not choose to let me know it , she has her reasons , and I would not teaze it from her by questions . even though I were to die of curiosity . ( knocking heard ) Bless me ! who can be calling at this early hour ? ( Opens the door . Lamotte enters , ) Lam . Lamotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  ( aloud ) Pray , my good woman , is Madam  --  I mean Mr.  --  Dorival at home ! Jan . Janet No , sir : my master is just gone out , but my mistress will be here presently . Lam . Lamotte That will do as well . I have a message for either from their old friend Lamotte . Jan . Janet Bless me ! From Mr. Lamotte ? The favourite protg of the duke of Richelieu ? And how is he ? Is he still with the army ? Lam . Lamotte Oh , no . He has just returned with the Duke . Jan . Janet The Duke of Richelieu in Paris ! Lam . Lamotte Aye , he arrived last night , covered with dust and laurels ! envied by all the men  --  adored by all the women ! Jan . Janet Well , then the women are not of my mind if they adore such a libertine  --  Lam . Lamotte Bless you , they like him the better for it . He is the universal lover and betrayer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies of the city ; maids of honour , milk maids or nursery maids , or maids of any kind ,  --  ' faith , ' t is all alike to him  --  he wooes and wins and abandons them by turns with an impartiality that makes him wonderfully popular ! Oh , trust me , my good dame , Richelieu is a man to make an epoch in history . Jan . Janet Perhaps he may , friend , with gentlemen of your taste . But to return to Mr. Lamotte . You say he is with the Duke . Lam . Lamotte Yes , and will be here to day . Jan . Janet He will be welcome ,  --  ten thousand times welcome ! He 's such a favourite here ! The house has been quite melancholy ever since he went away . Lam . Lamotte ( aside ) So , so ! A discreet , taciturn dame this ! I must extract a little intelligence out of her . ( aloud ) And your lady , you say  --  Jan . Janet Ah , poor soul ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamotte will hardly know her again . She 's fallen off sadly since he saw her . She pines and pines , and grows pale and discontented  --  Lam . Lamotte Often the case , they say , with young wives who have old husbands . Jan . Janet No reflections , friend , if you please . Mr. Dorival is not such an old man , neither ; and he makes her an excellent husband , and I am sure she loves him . Lam . Lamotte I ask pardon . I understood she had married him for his fortune , and that he was twice her age . Jan . Janet ( angrily ) Sir , she never cared for his fortune . She married him to please her parents , like a good daughter as she was . Ah , the sweet child ! She was too young to have a will of her own . She hardly knew what it was to have a will . Lam . Lamotte ( knowingly ) But when she came to have a will , Mr. Dorival did not exactly suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing . He was considerably older than she , to be sure ; but then he was amiable and kind and generous . She was the delight of his heart . He indulged her in every thing . Lam . Lamotte Ah , that is always the way with gentlemen considerably older than their young wives . Jan . Janet Hark ye , my friend . I do nt relish your slippery speeches . I do nt like people to talk by hints and nods and winks . I mean what I say .  --  Mr. Dorival made her a good husband , and she made him an excellent wife . Ah ! you should have seen her , when , by sudden misfortunes , he was stripped of all his property and reduced to the miserable salary of a small office  --  the dear child !  --  you should have seen her then ! Talk of marrying him for his fortune ? Why , she seemed to love him better when he was reduced to poverty . She went to work in secret to paint and embroider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never forget when she first surprised him with the earnings of her secret labours ! He gazed at the gold , then at her ,  --  the tears started into his eyes ,  --  he caught her in his arms , and wept with fondness and delight ! Lam . Lamotte ' Pon my honour , very affecting ! And Mr. Dorival was quite glad to find her turn her needle and pencil to such good account . Useful as well as ornamental  --  most exemplary indeed ! Jan . Janet No , Sir . He could not bear that she should task herself ; but she took a pride and pleasure in it ; so he yielded , and she has continued to paint and embroider ever since . Aye , and was always so cheerful !  --  singing at her labour  --  until of late , when she fell into this moping fit . But here she comes  --  as usual , downcast and melancholy ! Ah , poor soul ! Lam . Lamotte Poor thing ! poor soul ! very pathetic upon my honour ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Madam Dorival , her eyes cast to the ground . She does not observe Janet and Lamotte . ) Mad . D. Madam Dorival Three months ! Three dismal months of anguish ! Day drags on after day , and every hour is old by some new heart ache ! Oh , the misery , the mysry of concealment ! Jan . Janet ( who has partly advanced ) Concealment ! Pashaw ! It 's no business of mine  --  I 've no right to hear what 's meant to be concealed . ( comes forward and curtsies ) Good morning , ma'am . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Is that you , Janet ? Jan . Janet Aye , ma'am , your own poor Janet , and heavy hearted to see you so melancholy . But , come ; you must put on smiling looks again . I 've pleasant news for you . The duke of Richelieu is just returned to Paris , Mad . D. Madam Dorival Richelieu ! Jan . Janet Aye . Just from the army , covered with glory and laurels ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam Dorival ( with great agitation ) Heaven forbid ! Jan . Janet Bless me ! Why , I thought he was such a favorite with you and Mr. Dorival ! The elegant , the charming Mr. Lamotte.  --  Why , he was the life of the house when he visited here . Aye , and will be so again . Here 's a person with a message from him . Lam . Lamotte ( advancing ) Yes , madam , Mr. Lamotte desired me to inform you and Mr. Dorival of his arrival  --  ( in a lower tone ) Here 's a letter from the duke of Richelieu . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( with firmness ) Sir , if you have any message from Mr. Lamotte , my husband will be at home presently to receive it . Lam . Lamotte Do you not understand ? ( showing a folded paper ) I have a letter for you . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( agitated , but indignant ) Leave me. ( repels the letter , which falls to the ground . ) Jan . Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( picks it up and hands it to madam Dorival . ) Lam . Lamotte ( with a significant smile ) Thank you , my good woman  --  ( ( aside ) Admirably managed ! I could not have done it better myself ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( confounded and embarrassed ) The letter is not for me . Jan . Janet No ? For whom , then ? It has no address on it . Lam . Lamotte No matter . It will find its way , I 'll warrant it . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Sir , take back this letter . I can not receive it . Jan . Janet Oh , never mind . I 'll take charge of it . Lam . Lamotte ( a part ) Admirable ! Jan . Janet I 'll give it to Mr. Dorival . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Janet , I insist . Lam . Lamotte ( adroitly ) Thank you  --  thank you , most convenient of waiting women ! Good morning , madam . Farewell , handiest of handmaids ! A thousand thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , for what ? I 'm sure you 're very civil . A thousand kind things for us all to Mr. Lamotte . ( Janet returns . ) Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( walking up and down in extreme agitation ) Janet ! Janet ! What have you done ! I am bewildered ,  --  panick struck ! Jan . Janet Bless me , what is all this ? A mere message from Mr. Lamotte cause all this flurry ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival Who will shield me from this man ? Jan . Janet What , from Mr. Lamotte ? He whom you , ... whom we all are so fond of ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival He is the cause of all my misery ! Jan . Janet Lamotte ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival You have prevented my sending back this letter . Open it , and you will know my fatal secret . Jan . Janet You make me tremble ! ( opens the letter and reads ) " Three long months have I been in exile . Duty called me to Flanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and return in triumph ; but neither duty , glory , nor victory , have , for an instant , effaced your image from my mind . I only value my laurels in the thought of laying them at your feet . Your constant Lamotte. "  --  ( astonished ) Why , what in the world does all this mean ? Is the man mad ? What has Mr. Lamotte to do with laurels ? A mere follower in the train of a great man prating about laurels , forsooth ! And then to dare to write so impudent a letter ! I do n't wonder at your indignation !  --  Mr. Lamotte quotha ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival As yet , you know nothing . The Lamotte whom you praised a moment since .  --  the Lamotte whom you have so long seen an inmate in our house , is  --  Richelieu ! Jan . Janet Richelieu !  --  and  --  and  --  ( clasping her hands ) Oh , I see all now ! Oh , my poor , dear mistress ! What have you done ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you did but know half the stories about him ! Oh , what have you done ,  --  what have you done !  --  Mad . D. Madam Dorival Do not condemn me without a hearing . Yes , I have fallen ! but I have fallen ,  --  nay , I have been precipitated , into a pit artfully digged beneath my feet ! Jan . Janet But where and how did you first get acquainted with this Richelieu ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival You shall know all , for now I have need of your assistance . You know the circumstances of my marriage . Young , inexperienced , without knowing even that I had a heart , my hand was given by my parents to Mr. Dorival , but I lived happily with him . I esteemed , I honoured , I thought I loved him . Alas ! I little knew what love was ! When misfortunes overwhelmed him , I had recourse to my needle and my pencil to assist by my humble talents the husband who , in his better days , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetened the labour of my hands ! Oh , days of cheerful occupation ,  --  of balmy rest and passionless content ! Why , oh why . was your holy calm broken in upon , and turned to violence and tempest ! Jan . Janet Nay , nay , good mistress  --  do not let your feelings hurry you away . Mad . D. Madam Dorival I will be calm . A serpent stole into this innocent Eden . You recollect the first appearance of this pretended Lamotte . Simple in garb , but prepossessing in appearance , he announced himself as employed by the duke of Richelieu to order some of my drawings and embroidery . He called frequently to watch the progress of my labour . Imperceptibly , he became almost an inmate of our humble mansion . There was something irresistibly engaging ,  --  I may say , fascinating ,  --  in his demeanour . His frank , modest manner charmed my husband . His house , his heart , were open to Lamotte . Jan . Janet Aye , these husbands , these husbands ! They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival To me his conversation was new and delightful ; his mind was richly stored  --  his imagination lively  --  his taste congenial with my own . I thought , when he conversed , I could listen to him forever . Jan . Janet Ah ! that 's always the way with these talking men ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival By degrees , his manner changed . He ceased to be so gay and brilliant . He grew more serious and tender . There was a dangerous softness in his manner  --  an expression of the eye  --  a tone of the voice  --  that , at times , thrilled to my heart . I became alarmed at the unusual emotions I experienced . I found the accustomed quiet of my thoughts disturbed . Still I checked the growing conviction of my judgment . I tried to persuade myself that this was all esteem and friendship Alas ! I had felt esteem and friendship for my husband , but I soon became sensible that this was something more potent , more bewildering . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible of its power . Jan . Janet Well , I see nothing in this that might not have happened to any other young woman . Mad . D. Madam Dorival The worst is yet to come . The traitor saw the struggles that were destroying me . He knew his power over my heart ,  --  he vainly thought that it extended over my principles . He had the hardihood to declare his passion . Then it was my eyes were opened to my danger . For a moment my blood boiled with indignation ,  --  but he was so humble , so contrite , so broken hearted , that I could not help but pity him . I insisted on his absenting himself from our house entirely . With many a sigh and tear he consented . The duke was to set off the next day for the army . He was to accompany him , and he vowed to endeavour to forget his ill fated passion amid the din of battles . Shortly after his departure , I received a letter from the duke 's mother , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespoken by Lamotte . She had been interested by his commendations of me , and sent her own carriage to bring me to her , that she might consult me about further works . Without suspicion , I seated myself in the carriage  --  I was conveyed to an elegant mansion  --  passed through magnificent apartments  --  and found , instead of the dutchess.  --  Lamotte.  --  the perfidious Lamotte.  --  no longer simple in dress , but splendidly attired  --  glowing with triumph !  --  I started with astonishment . He threw himself at my feet , and acknowledged that the suppliant before me was Richelieu himself . Jan . Janet Ah , poor . dear mistress ! The hero of the day  --  the conqueror of all hearts on his knees before you !  --  Well . I do n't wonder you yielded . I should have had hard work to resist him myself . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Yielded ? Never ! I shrunk back with horror . He implored a hearing  --  declared that nothing but the necessity of departing for the army had drawn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He became frantic . I endeavoured to fly . Alas ! My efforts were in vain ! I was far from help , from hearing ! I was in his power . Overwhelmed with terror , I sunk senseless at his feet . I can not proceed . My thoughts recoil from this scene of perfidy and violence ! I returned to my home with shame upon my brow and anguish in my heart ; but I call heaven to witness , I was not an accomplice in my own dishonour ! Jan . Janet And do you suffer the crimes of another to prey upon your heart ?  --  Nay , cheer up , poor , dear mistress ! You have been unfortunate , rather than guilty ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( with agony ) Unfortunate , indeed ,  --  unfortunate ,  --  but guilty ,  --  guilty ,  --  oh , how guilty ! Jan . Janet Nay ,  --  even had you real cause for self reproach , some extenuation might be found in the charms of such a man . Mad . D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man but her husband . What right had my eye to scan the beauty of a stranger ? My ear to delight in the music of his tongue ? When first my thoughts made comparison between the homely worth of a husband and the splendid fascinations of a lover ,  --  when first my cheek mantled and my heart fluttered as I listened to his voice , that moment was the commencement of my fall . No , no ! It was my blinded security that betrayed me . Perfidious as he is , had I checked my heart when first it wandered from the strict path of loyalty , he never would have ventured on my ruin . Even now , wretched as he has made me , I can not but feel for the agony of his remorse ! Jan . Janet His remorse ? His remorse , indeed ! How little do you know these men ! No , my poor mistress ! While you have been moping and moping , and wasting away till every one grew unhappy about you ,  --  he has been flashing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capturing towns , winning ladies ' hearts , feasting , gailanting , and thinking nothing of the poor being he has ruined . But , come : rouse yourself from these gloomy fits . You must now exert your resolution . Richelieu is returned , and wishes to throw himself at your feet . You must begin by forbidding him your sight . Mad . D. Madam Dorival But how ?  --  When the letter which I refused , and which you forced me to receive  --  Jan . Janet You must send an answer to it . Mad . D. Madam Dorival What ! would you have me  --  Jan . Janet You must send an answer that shall put an end to any presumptuous hopes . Mad . D. Madam Dorival I give myself up to you . My only wish is to keep my husband ignorant of my dishonor . I would not have him involved in the ruin his resentment might bring upon him . Nay ; why should I disown it ? I would fain escape the shame discovery must bring upon myself . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Let me sink into the grave , it matters not how soon ,  --  but , oh ! not with infamy ! Jan . Janet I hear somebody at the door ! ' T is Mr. Dorival ! Do n't let him see your tears . Come , come , cheer up ! cheer up ! Exit Janet . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( alone ) Aye , let me check my tears , and , if I can , hide even their traces . Alas ! How wretched above all wretches is the guilty who dares not even ask for sympathy ,  --  who dares not indulge the miserable ease of weeping , lest it should betray ; but must feign an empty smile , while the poor heart is breaking ! ( Enter Mr. Dorival . ) Dor . Dorival Good morning , dearest . How are you this bright morning ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( languidly ) Well  --  very well  --  Dor . Dorival That 's right , that 's right . But put on your sprightliest looks to welcome an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Madam Dorival ( startled ) Who is it you mean ? Dor . Dorival Dubois ,  --  our old friend ,  --  our kind ,  --  our excellent friend Dubois . Mad . D. Madam Dorival But where is he ?  --  ( Enter Dubois . ) Dub . Dubois ( entering ) Here , my dear madam , and delighted to find that he is still remembered by the friends he loves . But  --  it strikes me , my good lady , you seem a little altered . How 's this , hey ?  --  You , who were always so blithe and smiling , and  --  ( nay , never mind me ! )  --  but sure I miss the bright sparkle in those eyes ; the gay smile with which you always met me . Nay , do n't turn away your head . I did n't mean to offend you ; but certainly there seems a sort of languor about you just now  --  Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( dejectedly ) For some time past I 've not been very well  --  Dor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how uneasy it makes me . She has such fits of dejection !  --  All I can say and do only makes her worse , and I can not persuade her to take advice . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( embarrassed ) Well , do n't let us talk about my weakness . Come ! Ask about our friend . What has kept you from us so long ? What have you been doing in the interval ? Dub . Dubois Oh , rising in the world ! Making my fortune  --  Getting into office  --  in the high road to promotion  --  Dor . Dorival What ! And so honest a man , too ! One who speaks his mind so frankly ! How in the name of wonder did you succeed ? Dub . Dubois Luck , luck . Accident introduced me to a patron conspicuous for his rank , his credit at court , his wealth and his munificence . He accepted me for his secretary . He is immersed in public affairs . I am the confident of his political secrets , and ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my old , my sterling friends ! Dor . Dorival But , after all , you have not told us who your employer is . Dub . Dubois Did I not ? Oh , ' t is the duke of Richelieu . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( involuntary ) Just Heavens ! Dub . Dubois ( to Madam Dorival ) Is there any thing extraordinary in that ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( recovering and affecting to smile . ) Oh , no !  --  nothing  --  nothing  --  Dor . Dorival But how comes it that you , who are so independent ,  --  not to say , blunt ,  --  in your manners ,  --  get on with a courtier like the duke ? Dub . Dubois Wonderful as it is , we do get on together , and very well too . I make no ceremony , but speak my mind ; and he likes what he calls my rough honesty . Dor . Dorival They say he is a perfect mad cap , and sets public opinion at defiance . Dub . Dubois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite with the public . He cares not to restrain or even hide his faults , conscious that the brilliancy of his merits will eclipse them . He is despotic in his temper , yet every body yields willingly to such commanding talents . The splendour of his genius both in the cabinet and the field secures to him the admiration of his equals ; and the populace love him for his daring bravery , his manly grace , his winning affability , his open-handed magnificence ,  --  and for the dashing spirit that gives a charm even to his faults . Dor . Dorival By the way , we have had occasion of late to know something of the duke . We are intimate with a young man , a favorite of the duke 's  --  Mr. Lamotte  --  a very prepossessing , fascinating man . Dub . Dubois ( surprised ) Lamotte fascinating ! Then you 're not difficult . Lamotte is pretty much what all creatures of great men are ,  --  an obsequious tool ,  --  a paltry pander to his master 's pleasures ;  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D. Madam Dorival ( aside ) Cruel situation ! Dor . Dorival It 's very strange . To me Lamotte ever seemed frank , independent , intelligent ,  --  brilliant even at times , when his modesty permitted him to shine ; and there was always a nameless , a winning grace about him , that gave a charm to his simplicity ; but perhaps I have been blinded by my partiality and by my gratitude for the good services that he rendered me with the duke . Dub . Dubois What , then ,  --  you have had dealings with the duke ? Dor . Dorival Yes , but without ever having seen him . He has purchased several of my wife 's drawings and embroideries , and she has lately a commission to execute some for a beautiful house he is furnishing not far from us , in the suburbs . Dub . Dubois I have heard of that house . ' T is the scene of his pleasures ,  --  where he entertains the numerous beauties who have the weakness to become attached to him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( aside ) Oh , that the earth would open and swallow me ! Dor . Dorival Now you mention these numerous beauties  --  ( turning to his wife )  --  what think you , my dear ? It is whispered about that he has an intrigue in our very neighbourhood . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( scarcely able to articulate ) What  --  what  --  do they  --  suspect  --  Dor . Dorival ' Faith , I know nothing certain . I fell in with a knot of gossipping neighbours who were talking of the affair . They say it is of some months ' standing ,  --  that the duke used to come constantly in disguise before he went to the army ,  --  and that the intrigue is still going on . Dub . Dubois And who , pray , is the lady ? Dor . Dorival That I know not . I did not even ask . The wiseacres were so full of mystery , and dealt so in nods and winks and inuendoes that it piqued me ;  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret from them , I e'en left it in their possession . Dub . Dubois You must be mistaken . I am told he is at present entirely devoted to the countess Fleury . Dor . Dorival ( surprised ) The countess Fleury ? Dub . Dubois Aye . Do you know any thing of her ? Dor . Dorival She has been a kind patroness to my wife . To us she always appeared correct and virtuous . Dub . Dubois And so she is  --  politely correct and fashionably virtuous . She is one of the beau monde ,  --  admired , flattered , sought after . Such women often fancy themselves above the vulgar restraints of law and gospel . And then her widowhood has given her a dangerous independence . Dor . Dorival ( with honest warmth ) I 'm glad she has withdrawn her countenance from us of late . I should be loth my wife should receive favors from such a woman . Dub . Dubois Nay , you put too strong construction on my words . The countess is a gay woman of fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chains ;  --  but they say she aims at his hand as well as heart . She aspires to fix this roving libertine . Dor . Dorival Well . Be that as it may . I wish no questionable patronage for my wife . Forgive me , my friend . I may be fastidious . but I hold the purity and delicacy of my wife in such cherished estimation that I can not endure the idea of her being subjected even to the patronage of the licentious . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( apart ) Death in every word ! Dor . Dorival ( fondly taking her hand ) Nay , do not blush my love . Dubois knows you well , and knows you merit all a husband 's fondness .  --  What ! Tears my love ? Ah ! such tears are luxury ! Dub . Dubois Well it does my heart good to see such a picture of married life , though , in truth , it almost puts me out of humour with being a batchelor . But , hold . It is growing late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorival You do nt stir till you 've engaged yourself for this evening to supper . Mad . D. Madam Dorival We shall expect you . Dub . Dubois To supper ? Be it so . Good day . Dor . Dorival Stop . I 'll walk with you . I 've business in your part of the town . Dub . Dubois Come along , then . ( To madam Dorival . ) ' Till supper time , fair lady , adieu !  --  Now , Dorival . ( Exit Dubois with Dorival . ) Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( alone ) At length , I am free ! Let me breathe for a moment . How have they racked my soul ! Alas , how wretched is that soul , weighed down by self reproach , to which kindness becomes a curse , and praise more bitter than upbraiding ! And this , then , is Richelieu !  --  this , the modest . broken hearted lover , whose outrage I ascribed to passion and despair ;  --  whom , even amidst the wretchedness he brought upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow for his pretended sufferings . How have I been deceived , how humiliated !  --  the mere object of transient triumph to a libertine ! but I deserve this pang ! Why did I ever suffer my heart to wander from the true path of its affection ? Break , wretched heart ! for thou hast not even the miserable aid of vanity to support thee ! END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT THE SECOND . SCENE . Study of Richelieu , very magnificently furnished . A splendid writing table in the centre , and smaller ones at the two sides : cases for papers , &c.; &c.; variously distributed .  --  Lamotte discovered alone , settling papers . Lam . Lamotte ( alone ) Now to arrange matters systematically . What a budget of billets-doux ! And all received since last night ! If my master had all this trash to read , and what is worse , to answer ,  --  the day would need a supplement . Realy there 's no trade going so laborious as that of a man of pleasure . Luckily for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaves his amatory correspondence to me ; and yet I remain merely the duke 's gentleman , while Dubois , forsooth , must be his secretary ! Nay , Dubois can say the bluntest things to the duke with impunity ,  --  while I ,  --  if in some of his grace 's familiar moments I venture upon a little  --  gentleman like pleasantry  --  whew ! he puts on one of his grandee airs , and looks me all to nothing !  --  I wish if noblemen will make confidants of their servants , they would treat them with proper consideration ! But here he comes . Enter Richelieu . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Why , how now , Lamotte ? Did I not overhear you murmuring ? Lam . Lamotte No , my lord . I was only calculating the troubles and perils that I encounter in your grace 's service . Truly , I lead a life militant of it . No knight errant ever run his squire into greater scrapes . Rich . Duke of Richlieu What , then does your courage fail you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair ? Lam . Lamotte The service of the fair may be soft enough for the master , but it is confoundedly hard for the man . Not a duenna but has rung the changes with her bony hands upon my tender ears ; and I have more scores upon my face from the nails of vixen beauties that your grace has jilted , than I have been ever able to run up at the tavern . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( laughing ) So much the better . Do you not know that to be cuffed and curried in a statesman 's service , gives a sure claim to preferment ? Every kick you receive sets you a step higher in favour Lam . Lamotte Ah . my lord ! You can not deny that if you have all the pleasure , I have all the pain  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu Aye , and all the profit , too . I shall be ruined by your castigations . Not a drubbing of yours but my purse shrinks for it ! And then what glory have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The irresistible Lamotte is the talk among all the city dames and demoiselles of Paris . Lam . Lamotte Yes , my lord ,  --  but while the false Lamotte is entertained by the mother and daughters . the real Lamotte is entertained by the fathers and husbands ! ( rubbing his shoulders ) I am in hourly hazard of being knocked on the head in mistake for your grace . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( laughing ) Well , if thou art , I 'll raise a monument of appropriate brass to thy memory ! ( sedately ) But now to business . Lam . Lamotte ( handing a pacquet of letters ) Here are a few billets-doux received since last evening . Rich . Duke of Richlieu What a collection ! Really , I have no time to get through such a mass of paper . Read and answer them yourself . Lam . Lamotte But had not your grace better  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu Prythee do n't be tedious . You know the rule . If they are over fond , be cool and cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of despair ; if they are merely sentimental , the usual proportion of flames , darts , hearts and cupids will answer . But tell me , ( with earnestness ) what effect did my letter have on madam Corival ? Lam . Lamotte I offered her the letter , but she refused it ; and had not the nurse taken it in charge , I should have been obliged to bring it back . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Refused it ? Refused my letter !  --  ( walks a little apart . ) Then she has not forgiven me ! I never met with such cruelty from any woman before ; and , somehow or other , I feel a kind of compunction for what I have done , that  --  that ' quite unusual .  --  Had I won her by mere skill , I should have felt a triumph ; but to take advantage of her helpless , defenceless , situation  --  Oh , fie ! fie !  --  A ruffian could not have done worse ! ' T was unworthy of the courtly Richelieu ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , and had no time to dally out a siege .  --  I wish I could get her out of my mind ! But she haunts my thoughts continually . Whether at court or in the camp ; in the midst of revelry or the midst of battle ,  --  still , still , her lovely image is constantly before me. ( to Lamotte ) Did she seem angry ? Lam . Lamotte She seemed rather troubled , my lord , and looked very sad . She is much paler than she used to be . Rich . Duke of Richlieu But still beautiful ? Lam . Lamotte I think your grace will find her more interesting than ever ;  --  though , to my mind , the gay widow , the countess Fleury , is ten times as charming !  --  so showy , so animated ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu I 'm half out of humour with the countess . She 's brilliant and fascinating , it is true , and has a strange power over me ; but she 's capricious and tyrannical , and torments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from her , written in a violent pique because I have not hurried to see her the moment of my arrival . She forbids me now to appear in her presence . Lam . Lamotte Shocking ! was ever woman so unreasonable ! And your grace , I 'll warrant  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu ' Faith , I 'm half inclined to take her at her word . There 's nothing like letting a woman see that her chains are not so firmly rivetted as she imagines . Lam . Lamotte ( simpering ) He ! he !  --  Very true , my Lord . How your grace understands the ladies ! But ( inquisitively ) the world does say that your grace intends to make her a dutchess . Rich . Duke of Richlieu The world is very officious and impertinent . I thought the world knew me better than to accuse me of such honest intentions . Lam . Lamotte Oh , vile ! Why , it 's levelling your grace with the vulgar ,  --  with common marrying folks . Rich . Duke of Richlieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same idea . She takes a pride in her conquest of me , and rattles my chains before all the world . But I 'll not be caught or controlled by any woman . Does she think to fix the roving Richelieu ? Lam . Lamotte Oh , fie ! Has she no conscience ? What a monopolizing spirit ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( partly talking to himself ) Yes . I 'll answer her letter . It will be a good pretext for not waiting on her . I 'll acquiesce in her banishment . It will give me more time to devote to the sweet madam Dorival . Lam . Lamotte Ah , she is indeed a woman ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( still talking partly to himself ) So gentle ,  --  so modest ,  --  of such exquisite sensibility ! Lam . Lamotte Oh , I never saw any thing equal to her ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( as before , not heeding Lamotte ) How often we find the rarest merit in these middling classes ! Generosity of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they term  --  virtue . It is a great blunder in nature not to keep the highest qualities among the highest classes . Lam . Lamotte ' Pon my soul , I 've no patience with it ! However , it 's some consolation , this virtue run wild is fair game for sportsmen like your grace to run down . ' Pon my honour , I think men of quality should be allowed a license for sporting among the vulgar . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( gives him an austere look . Lamotte bows obsequiously . Richelieu speaks aside . ) It 's cursed hard that a gentleman ca n't venture to be wicked in the eyes of his servant without the scoundrel 's growing familiar upon it ! ( To Lamotte ) You say that the nurse took my letter from you ! Lam . Lamotte Yes , my lord ,  --  and I 'll warrant , as soon as I was out of sight , gave it to her mistress . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( apart ) Well . I 'll see her at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's character in it . I like , too , her virtue and her indignation at the outrage it has suffered . I am sure she loves me ; and if I can once gain a hearing . I can make her forgive and forget all that has passed . What will not woman forgive in the man she loves ? Humph ! Love ! Love !  --  I 've heard a great deal of this same thing called love , and have possessed a great deal of it in my time ; but I suspect that now , for the first time . I am really feeling a little of it . Have a care , Richelieu ! Love , like fire , is a good servant , but a terrible master !  --  Ah ! here comes my philosopher ! Go your ways . ( to Lamotte ) If I want you . I shall ring . Exit Lamotte . Enter Dubois . So , Dubois , here we are again , after three months ' terrible campaigning  --  Dub . Dubois  --  In which your grace has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ! Is it possible ! A compliment from you ! It is the first that you have paid me since you entered my employ . Dub . Dubois That 's not my fault . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Well , well . Somehow or other . I relish your asperity . It serves to qualify the eternal sweets served up to me . Flattery  --  flattery  --  flattery  --  till I loathe it !  --  Upon my word a blunt speech from a cynic now and then is quite a stomachick . I wonder what gives you the courage to administer such bitter truths . Dub . Dubois My lord , I simply speak from my conscience . Rich . Duke of Richlieu That 's very right , very manly , no doubt  --  though not always very politic . However , you 're my true tonic , my wholesome monitor ! But be that as it may at present your philosophy deigns to be in good humour with me . You really think I behaved well in the last battle , do you ? Dub . Dubois Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with you and that is generally honest same . You fought in a just cause , my lord . If there be any excuse for shedding human blood , it is that , and that alone . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Hum .  --  Why , yes .  --  Yet , whatever the cause there 's something in war that stirs the blood and rouses the nobler qualities of our nature . A man lives years of common life in one short , glorious campaign . Yet , ' faith , we had hard fighting of it too  --  Twenty thousand gallant hearts left cold upon the field ! Dub . Dubois Twenty thousand human beings ! And all for what ? ( shrugging his shoulders ) War is a terrible evil ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with momentary feeling and half musing ) The most terrible part of it is the field of battle the day after an action . One is cooled down then .  --  To see so many brave fellows lying stiff and motionless , who , but yesterday , were all life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest impression on me was the havoc among the officers  --  to see the most distinguished warriors  --  gentlemen of the very first note , stretched on the bare earth , and confounded with the commonest soldiery . Dub . Dubois Indeed ! Is it that which struck you most ? Truly this death is a most insolent leveller ! It was exceedingly uncivil in the enemy to make no distinction between gentle and simple !  --  All the great folks should have been killed apart by themselves ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu A truce with cynic sneering ! You misunderstand me , Dubois . I can feel for the loss of the commonest soldier ; for , with me , every brave man has his value . But what is death to him ? It hurries him from no pleasures ; it mars no scheme of fortune or renown ; it only cuts short a life of paltry cares and vulgar vices ,  --  burthensome , perhaps , to the possessor ,  --  unimportant to society ,  --  and daily risqued for a trifle . But when the gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ,  --  a brilliant spirit is quenched ,  --  a career of glory is interrupted ,  --  a thousand ties of friendship , of love , of gallantry are rent asunder !  --  Oh ! do n't tell me that such a heart is to be trampled in the dust indifferently with the hearts of vulgar men ! Enter Lamotte . Lam . Lamotte Did you call , my lord ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu No . But you may stay . We must proceed to business . Dubois , I have a letter to dictate ; and you , Lamotte , place yourself at that table . There 's writing for you , also . Lam . Lamotte ( aside , taking his stand behind the table ) Billetsdouz , I 'll be sworn ! Dubois has the portfolio of politics , I of love . He answers the ministers . I the ladies . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Now , Dubois , write . ( Dubois has taken his seat at a table on the opposite side to that on which Lamotte stands . Richelieu walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , I have at length found a way to displace the gentleman who fills the situation you desire . He is so intolerably honest , and fulfils the duties of his office with such provoking correctness , that I have had the greatest difficulty to oust him . " Dub . Dubois ( lays down his pen ) Surely , my lord , you would not displace a man of such integrity . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( carelessly ) Why , to tell the truth , his integrity is a very ill bred integrity . It is always akimbo , elbowing his neighbours . Dub . Dubois But , can integrity  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu Harkee , Dubois : Integrity is a very honest , tradesman-like , virtue ; but it ought to be dressed up a little before it comes to court . ( Dubois shrugs his shoulders and takes up his pen . ) Now , Lamotte !  --  ( makes a sign for Lamotte to be seated ) Now for the countess . I 'll let her know what it is to tyranize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to banishment . Lam . Lamotte ( aside as he sits down ) Now for a tickler ! Now for a letter as sharp as words can make it . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Come , begin  --  ( dictating ) " Beautiful Fleury ! Your cruel letter has plunged me in the deepest distress . Thank Heaven , no one is by to witness the extravagance of my agitation . Twenty times have I began this reply , and twenty times have I torn the paper to atoms . The pen falters in my hand . The page is wet with my tears . " Lam . Lamotte ( staring ) Why I thought your grace meant to be severe upon her ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu Peace , blockhead , and write what I have dictated .  --  Now , my philosopher ! ( to Dubois ) Let me see . What have I already said ?  --  Hum  --  hum  --  " gentleman "  --  " situation "  --  " honesty "  --  " provoking correctness "  --  Have you written all that ? Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against that all his homely virtues have proved of no avail . " ( Dubois remains , biting the end of his pen . Richelieu , without noticing it , turns to Lamotte . ) Now , ' t is your turn . Lam . Lamotte Upon my word , your grace has wonderful versatility  --  to despatch a letter of business and a letter of gallantry in one breath ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Oh , ' t is my practice to make business and pleasure go hand in hand , like a pair of lovers . Come . Where was I ? " Beautiful Fleury "  --  hum-hum  --  " despair "  --  " atoms "  --  hum-hum  --  " write "  --  " blot "  --  " tears "  --  Go on . ( dictating to Lamotte ) " These struggles are too great for my constitution . I can not support the continual infliction of your tyranny . You forbid me to appear in your presence . Hard as is the doom , I acquiesce . Henceforth I renounce the sex , and devote myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The despairing  --  " and then leave a blank for my signature . Dub . Dubois ( aside ) What gross deception ! Lam . Lamotte He ! he ! he !  --  Excellent ! Admirable ! I should never have dreamt of such a mode of getting rid of a lady , ' Pon honor , your grace is too deep for the countess . Rich . Duke of Richlieu No comments if you please .  --  Now , Dubois.  --  Let me see  --  " homely virtues of no avail "  --  ( dictates to Dubois )  --  " they may console him , however in the bosom of philosophic retirement for the loss of a place which he never knew how to turn to account , and which , I am sure , will be ten times more profitable in your hands .

Duke of Richlieu The countess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord , with your permission , I 'll retire . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Oh , do n't go . do n't go . The countess is a dashing woman of fashion , not easily discomposed. ( half aside ) Who would have thought of her making her way to my levee ! But this is the inconvenience of being a public character . Dub . Dubois If you have no further commands , my lord , I would rather withdraw . Rich . Duke of Richlieu As you please . But bring me the letter to sign before I go out . ( Exit Dubois ) Quick , Lamotte . Throw that letter you have just written into the fire . ( Exit Lamotte ) And now to meet the storm . ( Enter the countess Fleury . Richelieu advances to meet her with affected eagerness . ) You here , my loveliest friend ! This is an unlooked for condescension . Countess . Countess Fleury And undesired , perhaps ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Nay , do me not such injustice . But , really , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to invoke your pity . Countess . Countess Fleury I felt that I had been hasty , and I braved all ceremony to hasten here and counteract my letter , But , confess , Richelieu , had I not cause for anger ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( laying his hand on his heart with affected tenderness ) None that my heart acknowledges . Countess . Countess Fleury Nay , appeal not to that heart , that traitor heart ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu That faithful heart , so deeply wounded by your charms . Countess . Countess Fleury Absence is a sad healer of such wounds ; and a brilliant campaign is apt to efface old wounds by new ones . Rich . Duke of Richlieu What ! Still doubting your true knight ? Countess . Countess Fleury There is a sad difference between the humble , devoted knight going to the wars , and the knight returning , crowned with laurels . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Upon my faith , I was on the point of hastening to lay those laurels at your feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been laying them at the feet of half the ladies of the court . Rich . Duke of Richlieu And this , then , is the secret of your indignation , and of that violent letter that almost broke my heart ! Countess . Countess Fleury Richelieu ! Richelieu ! I fear your heart is as cold as your compliments are ardent . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Could you but look into it , you would not say so . Countess . Countess Fleury Richelieu , your general gallantry is too well known to me . You have neglected me since your return , while I have heard of nothing but your visits and billets to various beauties of the court . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Pooh ! Those were more devotions of policy . There is an embassy at this moment vacant , and no time must be lost to secure it . I have been canvassing for it ever since my return ; and as the ladies are all powerful in our gay court , I have been interesting them all in my cause . The regent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to the fair . Countess . Countess Fleury Richelieu , I would fain believe you . Do not sport with my feelings . Gay and heedless as I may appear , there are points on which I feel acutely . I will not endure neglect , and I can not be content to share a divided heart . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Well then , seriously and frankly ,  --  and let it be convincing . I am a politician as well as lover . I am aspiring . I would make my way at court . There is no means so sure now-a-days as the favour of the ladies . Their eyes are the stars that influence all destinies . For that reason , I pay outward homage to them all , but only outward . My heart acknowledges but one  --  one brilliant  --  one ruling star . Need I tell you . lovely Fleury ( taking her hand tenderly and gailantly )  --  who is that ruling star ? Countess . Countess Fleury ( with evident pleasure ) Away , you dissembler . You deceive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My spirit , though light and gay , is resolute . I can not brook being kept in doubt , and will not patiently be trifled with . Enter Servant . Ser . Sevant My lord , there is a woman without who insists upon seeing you . She will take no denial , but will see yourself . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Show her in . Why should there be any difficulty ? ( Janet enters pettishly . ) Jan . Janet What a fuss about gaining admittance to a gentleman . Do they think I have any designs upon him ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu What is your business with me , my good woman ? ( aside , starting ) Confusion ! Janet ! Jan . Janet ( dryly ) I have no other business than to give this letter from my mistress . Countess . Countess Fleury ( eagerly  --  aside ) A letter ! from a female  --  A billet-doux I 'll be sworn ;  --  and , as I live , the beautiful madam Dorival 's servant ! Jan . Janet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleury Do n't be alarmed , my friend . And so you come from madam Dorival , do you ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( confused ) What ! You know madam Dorival then ? Countess . Countess Fleury I thought I knew her ; but I begin to suspect I did not . I patronized her once . I am sorry to find she has fallen under your grace 's patronage . I thought her modest  --  virtuous  --  devoted to her husband  --  Jan . Janet ( warmly ) And you thought right , madam . She is all that , and more . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( aside ) Oh , the mischief ! Here will be a jealous freak again ! Countess . Countess Fleury And so you have brought a letter from your mistress , have you ? Jan . Janet ( flurried , but trying to be calm ) Yes , madam . But I trust there 's no harm in that . Countess . Countess Fleury Oh dear , no . No harm at all  --  for a pretty woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Janet ( warmly ) Madam , my mistress is a respectable woman ; and if you did patronize her once , it gives you no right to injure her now . Countess . Countess Fleury ( loftily ) Keep your temper my good woman . ( To Richelieu ) Upon my word , my lord , your female friends are amazingly unceremonious with the tongue . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Indeed , you are under a mistake . This letter which I have just received  --  Countess . Countess Fleury Is from another of your female friends , no doubt , with whom you are canvassing for the embassy . Pray . has madam Dorival great influence at court ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( forcing a laugh ) Upon my word you are provokingly arch ; but do n't indulge your vein at a worthy person 's expense . I know nothing of this madam Dorival , except that she has a pretty taste in drawing and needlework , and has been employed by my gentleman to make some ornaments for my house , for which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mistress , friend , that Lamotte will call and settle with her .

Let me get out of this house , or I shall not be able to contain myself . ( Exit . ) Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( approaching the countess Fleury ) What ! Clouds upon that lovely brow ? Do you still doubt ? Upon my word , you are the most jealous , tormenting , delightful being  --  Countess . Countess Fleury Richelieu , you are all deception ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Is it possible that a dunning scrawl from a poor artist can agitate the brilliant countess Fleury . Countess . Countess Fleury Do not think to blind me . I noticed your confusion  --  the confusion of the messenger . I know this madam Dorival . Humble though she is in rank and circumstances , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duke of Richlieu Is she so indeed ? In faith , I must see her then . I 'll not send my gentleman . I 'll go myself . Countess .

I am not to be deceived . You know her too well already . Rich . Duke of Richlieu How ungenerous is this distrust . But you shall be convinced on evidence . Here ! Lamotte ! Lamotte ! ( Enter Lamotte ) Lamotte , who is this madam Dorival who sent the message just now . Lam . Lamotte Your grace must recollect the drawings and embroideries I ordered for you . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Aye , but this madam Dorival . Methinks I 've seen her ,  --  have I not ? ( giving him a significant look . ) Lam . Lamotte Not to my knowledge . I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the work . Indeed , I am sure you have not  --  for your grace has such an eye for beauty that I do n't believe , if you had once seen her , you could have forgotten her . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( aside ) The rogue lies with admirable precision and circumstance . ( aloud ) Is she so beautiful then ? Countess . Countess Fleury ( harshly ) Well , well . Enough of all this . Let us drop the idle subject . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Nay , but I begin to feel a little curiosity about this Madame Dorival whose beauty seems to have so much alarmed you . Countess . Countess Fleury Alarmed me ? Ha ! ha !  --  why you really do not think I was in earnest ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu Not exactly in earnest , but yet there was a little shade of jealousy . Countess . Countess Fleury Not in the least , I assure you . Ha ! ha ! ha !  --  Nothing but pleasantry . Rich . Duke of Richlieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . You may read it and satisfy your suspicions . Countess . Countess Fleury No . That would indeed be a mark of distrust unworthy of you and of myself . I do believe you ; or rather  --  I force myself to believe you . Ah , Richelieu ! how forgiving are we poor women ! Traitors as you are to us , we are worse traitors to ourselves . Sin against us a thousand times a day ,  --  but come to us with one of those fond , entreating ,  --  hypocritical looks  --  such as you are putting on now  --  ( giving him her hand friendly but archly )  --  and all is forgiven and forgotten . Farewell ! Farewell ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( kissing her hand rapturously ) Adieu , my only love ! Countess .

There 's no doing it with such a woman Her spirit wont bear tampering with . No , no . It must be done in a heat . There 's no breaking with her but by an explosion . Lam . Lamotte He ! he ! he !  --  ' Pon honour , your grace has the most charming variety of ways of cutting the ladies ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( giving him a silencing look .

I appreciate your talents and respect your integrity ; but even integrity may now and then be a little intrusive .  --  Besides ( still more aristocratically ) there are virtues for every rank .

I did n't mean to give you pain ; I could not have the heart to do it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the comfort of my dark ones !  --  well . well I see you are nervous , and I fear I am a poor comforter : but you know my heart  --  you know it is wrapped up in you . I 'll leave you to yourself . Perhaps you 'll be more composed when alone . But throw by your pencil . That Richelieu palace will be the death of you ! ( Exit Dorival . ) Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( Alone , clasping her hands in agony . ) The kindness of this worthy man ,  --  every soothing word and tender look is a dagger to my soul . And this Richelieu  --  should he still pursue his victim ! I tremble at the thought . How long Janet stays ! Hush ! Something moved upon the stairs  --  No . I was mistaken .  --  Hark ! It is , it is Janet ! I know her step  --  Now  --  ( gasping  --  enter Janet ) Well  --  well  --  Janet  --  you gave the letter ? Jan . Janet Give me time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I gave the letter . But who do you think I found with the duke ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival Whom ? Jan . Janet The countess Fleury ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( Anxiously . ) And did she recognize you ? Jan . Janet She did . Mad . D. Madam Dorival And saw you give the letter ? Jan . Janet Aye , and seemed to be in a terrible pique about it .  --  But the duke turned it all off with a jest and made mighty light , I thought , both of the letter and you . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Could he then make a jest of such a letter , and of a woman whose peace he has destroyed ? Jan . Janet Oh , I saw through it all . It was only because that fine lady , Madam Fleury , was in a jealous fit . She seemed disposed to say some tart things about you ; but I let her see that it would not he borne with . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Horrible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become a proverb ! I shall bring disgrace and ruin on the best of husbands ! Oh . that I had never been born ;  --  oh , that I could die ,  --  die ,  --  die and be fergotten ! Jan . Janet ( eagerly ) Die ? No . Live ! live to revenge your injuries ; live . if it 's only to cover the profligate with the contempt and confusion he merits . Mad . D. Madam Dorival No  --  no , ( wildly ) I want no revenge . On my head let contempt and confusion be poured down . I have deserved it all . But  --  oh , my poor husband ! ( a loud knocking heard . ) Jan . Janet Who can be making such a racket ? Somebody of consequence by the liberty he takes with the knocker . Some one accustomed to make a noise in the world ! Exit Janet . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( alone ) Richelieu ! Richelieu ! I thank thee for this contempt ! ' T is fit my pride be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he has plucked the poor flower and thrown it to the earth to trample on ! And yet  --  and yet  --  it might have been left in the humility in which it bloomed ! Why could he not leave me to my obscurity and my innocence ? Sure I did not seek his eye . My thoughts never strayed beyond my humble home till he bewildered them . No matter . Thank ! Heaven . he 'll now think no more of me ! He 'll leave me to my repose . The countes Fleury , too ; she 'll not betray me for her own sake . No , no . I shall remain secure in my insignificance . and quietly sink into the grave , and be forgotteu ! Janet runs in . Jan . Janet Fly . madam , fly ! The duke !  --  the duke himself is coming ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival Richelieu ! Merciful Powers ! what will become of me  --  whither shall I fly !  --  I can not move . My feet are rooted to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ! Enter Richelieu . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with the tenderest and most anxious manner ) Do we then meet once more ,  --  beloved , adored of my soul ! ( madam Dorival with great effort rises from the arm chair into which she had sunk  --  attempts to avoid Richelieu . and staggers towards the door , but has to support herself on a chair . ) But  --  Heavens ! what a state do I find you in ! What can be the matter ?  --  ( seizes her hand , which she tries to withdraw . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( scarcely audible ) Nothing  --  nothing  --  sir  --  let me  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( passes an arm under hers , while Janet holds her by the other ) You can scarcely stand . Sit down ,  --  let me conjure you to sit down and be composed . Jan . Janet ( pushing him ) Let her be , sir  --  Let her be  --  I can take care of her myself  --  I am strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Madam Dorival ( catching Janet 's arm ) Janet ,  --  do n't leave me ,  --  do n't leave me ! Jan . Janet Oh . never fear ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Her situation is alarming  --  somebody should be called in  --  Jan . Janet ( disengages the hand of Richelieu from that of madam Dorival , which he has contrived to get into his . ) You think so , do you ? Well , I 'll call in somebody ! ( calls ) Mr. Dorival ! Mr. Dorival ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu No , no  --  be quiet  --  I did not mean  --  ( he feels in his pockets ) Have you no salts at hand ? Jan . Janet ( abruptly ) We must have her husband , Sir ! ( calls ) Mr Dorival ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Be quiet , I say , my good woman ! Jan . Janet ( with all her might ) Mr. Dorival ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( To Janet ) Will you hold your tongue ? ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Madam Dorival ( repelling him ) Leave me  --  leave me  --  Jan . Janet ( calling ) Mr. Dorival ! Ah ! he 's coming at last ! I hear him  --  He 's on the stairs !  --  ( To Richelieu ) with all your cleverness , you see I 'm your match ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Meddlesome impertinent ! ( Enter Mr. Dorival . ) Dor . Dorival Why , what 's the meaning of all this outcry , Janet ? Jan . Janet Why , here 's my mistress ill , for one thing ;  --  and here 's  --  Mr.  --  a  --  Lamotte  --  who  --  who  --  wants to speak to you ,  --  for another . Dor . Dorival Lamotte !  --  Returned ?  --  Welcome home again a thousand times !  --  ( To madam Dorival )  --  But what ails you , my dearest life ?  --  Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( scarcely audible ) A dizziness  --  a sudden weakness  --  Pray do n't mind me.  --  It 's past  --  I 'm better now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart again , for Janet 's cries alarmed me . You can retire , Janet .  --  ( Exit Janet . ) Pardon a husband 's fondness , my dear Lamotte.  --  But how have you been for this long time past ? I presume you have just returned with the duke from the army . Rich . Duke of Richlieu I have , and this is the first visit I have made since my return . On entering ( he works towards madam Dorival , who is still sitting , and towards whom he bends with an air of the liveliest interest ) I found your good lady  --  in a state  --  ( inclining towards her , as if to read her real situation distinctly in her eyes , he says to her in an under tone ) I must have an interview  --  alone  --  ( aloud , merely turning his head towards Dorival )  --  in a state  --  which really alarmed me  --  ( inclining towards her  --  but I 'm delighted  --  ( low to madam Dorival )  --  I have something deeply important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive  --  ( low to madam Dorival )  --  contrive for a moment 's opportunity , I implore  --  ( turning to Dorival )  --  now to perceive  --  oh , yes ! I was not mistaken  --  the paleness is gone off  --  she is herself again ! ( he takes one of her hands which she tries to withdraw , recoiling from him with silent horror , yet fearing to betray her emotions to Mr. Dorival ) charming , excellent woman ! ( in a sentimental tone )  --  Really , I feel towards her  --  ( turns briskly and grasps Mr. Dorival 's hand also )  --  towards both of you ,  --  an attachment so sincere , so ardent  --  no , you can have no idea how thoroughly I am devoted to you ! Dor . Dorival And on our sides , Lamotte , believe me , we 're even with you . Some how or other , you 've quite fascinated us . Well . Peace brings you back to us at last . I hear your patron , the duke , behaved gallantly throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He only did his duty . Dor . Dorival No , no . Much more . The whole country rings with his name . Really , he 's an extraordinary being . They say he is excessively proud , and yet he can be one of the pleasantest creatures imaginable . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Yes . I am told some people think him so . Dor . Dorival I 've a great curiosity to see him , having received so many benefits from him at second hand . But . I presume , like most great men , he is difficult of approach . Rich . Duke of Richlieu I ca n't say that . He 's ; as you 've heard , a very whimsical character . With the men , indeed , he is proud as a lion ; but , with the fair ( looking insinuatingly towards madam Dorival ) he is gentle as a lamb . Dor . Dorival ( To his wife ) You have never seen him either ,  --  have you my dear ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( greatly embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Dor . Dorival ( To Richelieu ) I hear he 's a fine looking man . Is it true ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with a smile ) That 's for the ladies to decide . As your wife has seen him , she will be a more impartial judge . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( not during to raise her eyes , but with deep emotion ) We should look only to the moral character . The fairest form often covers the foulest heart . Dor . Dorival I believe that applies very well to the duke , for they say shocking things about him . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( half sportive , half earnest ) " They ? "  --  And pray who is there that " they " do not say shocking things about ?  --  It is a pity that that same knot of tattlers called they can never be caught and brought into court . Dor . Dorival Ah ! But my information comes from one incapable of an untruth ; and one who is about the person of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Name the scoundrel ! Dor . Dorival Nay , do not be vexed ; though I must say I like your zeal for your patron 's reputation . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( aside ) He made me tremble ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( apart , laughing ) Zounds ! I had nearly played a shallow part and betrayed myself ! Dor . Dorival After all , why need we concern ourselves about Richelieu ? He is above our sphere . Whatever may be his vices , they 'll never trouble our repose . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( apart ) Break , heart !  --  break ! break ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Nay , but , to be candid , the picture you have had of Richelieu has not been drawn by the most friendly hand . On what ground is he condemned ? What !  --  If women will listen , and blush , and sigh , and be angry , and forgive  --  and husbands will be blind , and credulous , and confiding  --  Dor . Dorival Hold , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Shall poor woman 's weakness be ever the excuse for villany ? Shall her warm , trusting , affectionate nature , be an apology for the cold , selfish , scoundrel craft of the seducer ? Shall the confiding , open hearted hospitality of the husband , justify the dastard who takes advantage of it to ruin him ? Nay , sir , I speak feelingly , but I speak disinterestedly . God be thanked , such a bitter calamity can never be my lot ; but I do say , that every woman seduced is an object to be pitied ,  --  every seducer , a reptile to be hunted from the earth ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( gayly ) Excellent  --  admirable ! This is a lecture on morals which I shall certainly lay to heart . But , in truth , you must be more merciful to poor Richelien . He 's a sad fellow , that there 's no doubt of ; but really the women make a point of being deceived by him . There 's not a woman disposed to go astray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook , to bring poor Riehelieu into the scrape !  --  Indeed , indeed , my good friends , you must not let your own conscious virtue make you severe towards the errors of your neighbours . Dor . Dorival I doubt you are speaking ironically , my friend . Rich . Duke of Richlieu Well , then , to be serious  --  granting Richelieu to be guilty of some excesses , has he not , also , great temptations ? Born to high rank ; elevated to power ; flushed with success in court and camp ; caressed by the nation ; favoured by the fair ; can a man be plied on all hands with such intoxicating cups and keep his judgment cool ? Dor . Dorival Well , it is but natural for you to plead his cause ; and , indeed , I owe you an apology for applying such harsh terms to your patron . I hope you will not feel hurt at-what I have said . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with the freest air possible ) Bless you , I do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spare him on my account , I beg of you ! But , to change the subject . I have a commission from him respecting a little drawing by madam Dorival . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( apart ) What now !  --  Dor . Dorival What drawing was it ? Rich . Duke of Richlieu Oh ! one that hit my fancy prodigiously . She was working at it when I was last here  --  a cupid sleeping among thorns  --  a charming idea , and charmingly executed . The duke wishes it to complete the embellishment of his cabinet . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( apart ) Amazing insolence ! Dor . Dorival Oh , I remember  --  But she never finished it . To tell you the truth , she 's grown miserably nervous of late . I caught her once crying over that picture . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( blushing and interrupting him ) Enough of this  --  Dor . Dorival Nay . my dear ,  --  Lamotte shall know your injustice to yourself .  --  Would you believe !  --  She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have destroyed it , had I not prevented her . I 'll bring it to you in a moment . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( a little flurried ) Do  --  pray do ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( agitated and alarmed ) Do not go  --  do not leave me  --  do not trouble yourself about the miserable painting  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu Oh , I entreat of all things you 'll let me see it . Dor . Dorival I will I 'm sure it will please the duke . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( eagerly ) Well , then , I will bring it . Dor . Dorival No , no , my dear , You are not well , to day . You must not fatigue yourself . Entertain Mr. Lamotte till my return . I 'll be back immediately . ( Exit Dorival in haste . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Oh , hear me ! Let me go with you ! ( offers to follow him . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( seizing her hand ) Stay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment chance has thrown in my way . Behold me at your feet . Spurn me , if you please ,  --  but do not leave me ,  --  at least , till you have heard me. falling on his knees . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Unhand me , Sir !  --  ( with warmth and dignity ) Unhand me ! ( forcing her hand from him ) Fear not I shall leave you . No . However my feelings prompt me to fly , yet I must speak to you , and you must listen . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( rising ) Nay , speak not with such severity . I have been guilty ,  --  I own I have been guilty ,  --  but consider the violence of my love ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( with energy ) No more of this hypocrisy . My soul sickens at it . I have but a moment to speak , and I will be heard . Why do you come here ? Why do you seek to harass the victim you have made ?  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth . ) Listen to me , sir ! You have forced this interview upon me , and I will make use of it . Look around upon this humble dwelling , to which you were welcomed with such warmth .  --  You found it the abode of innocence and peace ,  --  you have made it a scene of anguish and remorse ! My husband received you into his home and into his bosom ; he leaned upon you as the friend of his broken fortunes ; you found him with one cherished solace in the world , and of that solace you robbed him ! Look at me , sir ,  --  yes , look at me ! You found me innocent , tranquil , happy  --  oh , how happy ! Like a serpent , you stole upon my security ,  --  you wound yourself into my confidence ,  --  you fascinated , you dazzled , you bewildered my mind ,  --  you artfully and insidiously beguiled my inexperienced heart :  --  my mind you have filled with horror and repining ;  --  my heart ,  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Rich . Duke of Richlieu For Heaven 's sake , moderate this violence . You cut me to the soul . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( recovering herself ) Nay , sir . I mean not to deal in idle reproaches . What is past , is past . The anguish you have brought upon me will soon be over . Had you sought me a little later , the tomb stone would have told you that once more I slept in peace . You have overtaken me in my career , but let me finish it in quiet . Avoid this house . You have made me wretched ,  --  do not render me infamous . For my poor husband 's sake , let me sink into the dust without disgrace let him remain in ignorance of my fall , that when he weeps over my grave , he may not have to weep over my dishonour ! ( sinks in a chair , exhausted , and covers her face . ) Rich . Duke of Richlieu Will you , at length , let me speak in extenuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so . I know you have heard shocking stories of me , and I know that they are in a great measure true . I have been wild , inconstant , licentious , perfidious , if you please ; but , with you , never ! You are the only woman I ever truly loved . The moment I saw you , my heart became fixed for ever . Abjuring rank , family , friends . occupation , every object of pleasure and ambition , I followed you for months and months in humble garb  --  giving up all the world for you , until my passion became too violent to be restrained . Alas ! In sinning against you . I have sinned against myself . Could I tell you all that I have suffered in mind since we parted  --  ( madam Dorival , recovering rises to depart )  --  Nay  --  you do not mean to leave me thus unheard  --  Mad . D. Madam Dorival I have nothing more to hear from you , sir . I have said what I had to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words will have an effect upon you . ( Enter Janet . Jan . Janet ( with an angry start ) What ! He here yet ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( eagerly ) Janet , attend upon that gentleman until my husband 's return . ( going ) Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( darting between them and drawing back madam Dorival ) No . I can not suffer you to go , till you have heard me out , unless you would drive me to despair . Jan . Janet Despair , quotha ! Pray how many ladies do you despair about in a day ? However , here comes Mr. Dorival , so I fancy you will be able to master your despair at present . ( Enter Dorival . Dor . Dorival My dear Lamotte , I beg a thousand pardons for making you wait so long ; but really , the drawing is in such a condition that I can not venture to let you see it until it is touched up .

Janet ( the same ) Let me alone . I was thinking of it already . Rich . Duke of Richlieu With all my heart  --  that is to say  --  ( with a sidelong glance at madam Dorival , who stands , her eyes cast down , fixed as marble )  --  if my visit will not be disagreeable  --  Dor . Dorival Disagreeable , indeed ! To whom ? If it is my wife you mean , I can answer for her . I hope your good spirits will cheer her up again . I am afraid our lonely way of living affects her .

Is this mere absence of mind ? Sure you 'll welcome our friend Lamotte once more to our fireside . Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( forced to speak , but with her eyes cast down ) You know  --  whatever gives you pleasure  --  ( turns abruptly away , and says aside )  --  My heart revolts from what I say ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with pretended frankness ) Enough . I thank you for your invitation , and will not fail to be at supper . Jan . Janet ( aside ) If he does , may it choke him ! Dor .

But your description piqued my curiosity , so you see I lost no time in gratifying it . Countess . Countess Fleury ( with a significant air ) And your curiosity , I trust , is satisfied . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( carelessly ) Perfectly , perfectly . I will never again take one lady 's opinion of another 's charms . And is this your vaunted beauty ?  --  pale , mawkish , destitute of style !  --  I wonder how you , of all others , can admire her . Countess . Countess Fleury And do you really think I 'm blinded by all this ? ( shaking her head still more significantly ) My lord , my lord ! You 're amazing clever , but it wo n't do . No .

Duke of Richlieu ( with perfect self possession ) As you please . But I hope your protge will prove more grateful than she appears likely to be . It was not the civilest return for your patronage , for her and her husband to bow you out of their house in the way they did just now . Countess .

A very magnificent apartment in the suburb palace of the Duke of Richelieu . On one side , a large and splendid scene . The Duke is discovered , very elegantly dressed sitting at a table strewed with papers . He has just done writing . A lacquey is standing at a short distance from him . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( to the lacquey ) Is not Mr. Dubois arrived yet ? Lac . Lacquey Not yet , your grace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was accustomed to go on foot , and did not like to lose the habit .

You are a little caustic and severe . Rich .

Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( with forced raillery ) Admirable ! admirable ! Why , what a tirade about weeping wives , and distracted mothers , and expiring daughters ! You must have been foraging among the garrulous old beldames of the city , who dread Richelieu as they abhor the devil .  --  With them , if he but smile upon a woman , her virtue is suspected ; but if he kiss her hand , her character is gone forever ! If you credit their tales , his gate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deluded damsels dangle by dozens from every tree in his vicinity . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Out upon it , that the sage Mr. Dubois should be the echo of such gossip . Dub . Dubois Sir , I have said nothing but what is notorious ; and let me observe , that if a public man  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu Pooh . pooh , pooh ! A truce with your solemn saws ! It is the misfortune of public men , that all their sins are public , while obscure men may sin safely and snugly under cover of their obscurity . We notice every strop and pounce of the eagle as he soars aloft in the full blaze of sunshine ; while the owl mouses securely in the dark , and nobody knows of his peccadilloes . He , forsooth , sits all day demurely in his hollow tree .  --  and hoots , and hoots.  --  and passes for the very emblem of wisdom ! Am I not right , Sir Owl ? Dub . Dubois I heed not your railery , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Richelieu My heart was full of what I had seen and heard . It required relief . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( sarcastically ) Truly your 's is a cur-like heart , that relieves itself by barking . Go on , ease your spleen by yelping at the foibles of your benefactor . And yet it is an ungrateful cur that bays at the light which shines upon him . Dor . Dorival This is all idle bickering . For Heaven 's sake , drop the subject . I hear my wife approaching Come . To supper ! to supper !  --  and let us hear no more of Richelieu ! Exit Dorival , who goes to meet his wife . Dub . Dubois ( to Richelieu ) If you have a spark of human feelings left . find some pretext to retire . The sight of you will be the death of her . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( turning fiercely and scornfully on him ) And who are you that dares advise ! Richelieu to retire ?  --  ( advancing indignantly towards him ) Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word with you I 've been compelled by circumstances to tolerate your schooling ,  --  nay , even to descend to grovelling contest with you . How dared you take advantage of my situation to bate me with your vulgar cant ? How dared you measure wits with me before your plebeian comrades ? What ! Is it for you to cross my path ,  --  to scan my conduct  --  to question my pursuits ?  --  You  --  a hireling !  --  The creature of my bounty ! A creeping thing , whom , in a moment , I could spurn into your native nothing ! ( with concentrated scorn ) Are the high-born Richelieu 's pleasures to be meted out by the plebeian notions of a low-born man like you ? Dub . Dubois When duke Richelieu shall forget his lofty station  --  Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( peremptorily ) No more , sir , of your insolence . Give me rather your apology for what is past . What plea have you to such unbridled rudeness to your lord and master ?  --  Dub . Dubois What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duke of Richlieu Great Heaven ! Can this be madam Dorival ! ( Enter madam Dorival and Janet . Madam Dorival is in a morning dress , her hair disshevelled , pale , and her voice almost inaudible . Janet helps to support her . Dorival is on the other side . She is assisted to a chair . ) Dor . Dorival My dearest life , I was not prepared for this . Your illness is much more serious than I imagined . Jan . Janet ( eagerly ) No , no . She is a great deal better . ( She perceives Richelieu , and exclaims , apart ) That devil here ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( apart , with deep emotion ) Is this the lovely madam Dorival  --  once flushed with health , radiant with beauty !  --  What ruin has my accurst passion brought on that angel form ! Dor . Dorival Why did you venture from home in such inclement weather ? I am to blame for this . Why did I suffer you to venture out ! Mad . D. Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ! I do not deserve this .  --  But I knew you would not drive me from you  --  Dor . Dorival Drive you from me ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival Oh , no  --  and you 'll pardon me , will you not ? Dor . Dorival Pardon you , my love !  --  What have I to pardon in you ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival Oh , much  --  much  --  when you shall know all  --  But you 'll not hate me , when I am dead and gone , will you ? Dor . Dorival Hate you  --  what a word !  --  I 'll love you ever ! Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( faintly ) That 's kind  --  that 's kind  --  give me your hand  --  so  --  let me lean my head upon your bosom  --  against your heart  --  so  --  so  --  ( closing her eyes ) Now I can die in peace ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( in the same undertone as before ) Oh , that I could roll back the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly  --  of infatuation  --  of guilt ! Dor . Dorival Nay  --  this is all fancy . You are faint and weary  --  cheer up , my love  --  see  --  here are all your friends around you  --  your faithful Janet  --  your good friend Dubois  --  the worthy Lamotte  --  Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( shrieks and starts up ) Lamotte ! Dor . Dorival ( pointing to Richelieu ) Aye , here he is . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Wretch ! Monster ! Must I be haunted to my grave ! ( sinks on the shoulder of Janet . ) Dor . Dorival What did she say ? Jan . Janet Nothing  --  nothing  --  ( tries to lead off madam Dorival ) Come to your room . ma'am  --  for Heaven 's sake , come ! ( madam Dorival struggles frantically in the arms of Janet ) Dor . Dorival My love , you know not what you say . You know not whom you have spoken to so harshly . ' T is to our favorite friend Lamotte  --  Mad . D. Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cursed me with shame !  --  I can keep this silence no longer .  --  Falsehood kills me  --  I was not made for crime .  --  Dorival , that man has deceived thee  --  I have deceived thee ! Dor . Dorival For Heaven 's sake , what are you saying  --  Jan . Janet Stop , I implore ! Dor . Dorival Do my senses  --  who is this man , then ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival Not Lamotte , but  --  Dor . Dorival ( wildly . ) Who ? Mad . D. Madam Dorival Richelieu !  --  ( Dorival falls back in a chair . His wife throws herself at his feet , bending her face to the earth , her hair disshevelled . ) I see that I have sinned beyond forgiveness  --  My heart has erred , but it is broken  --  Let me die at your feet , but do not spurn me ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( in the same under tone as before . ) Would that the earth might sink beneath my feet and bear me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dorival . ) Nay , do not cover your face , my friend .  --  Look down with pity on your unhappy wife  --  Raise her once more to your bosom  --  I know all that has happened  --  I know that she , for a time , has been fascinated bewildered  --  but never has she lapsed from virtue .  --  Her own too sensitive delicacy has converted an outrage she has suffered into a crime  --  There stands the true culprit , whose unmanly violence has been her ruin  --  Dor . Dorival Is it so indeed ! ( rushing to an open Secretary and seizing a pistol . ) Then , villain , receive thy reward ! Dub . &; Jan . Dubois , Janet Hold ! Hold ! ( Richelieu , motionless , eyes him in gloomy silence  --  but does not evade his movements ) Mad . D. Madam Dorival ( seizing Dorival by the arm ) Spare him ! Spare him ! My husband , stain not your hands with blood  --  Leave him to his conscience ! Dor . Dorival ( after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Go , my lord ! But thank your victim that your worthless life is spared ! Aye , go ! But take with you a poor man 's curse ! You have drunk of my cup , and you have left poison in it ! You have eaten of my bread , and you have turned it to bitterness ! You have been welcomed by me in my poverty and lowliness , and you have stolen the lamb from my bosom !  --  ( Turns to his wife , who , after the exertion of arresting his arm , had sunk exhausted into a chair ; and hangs over her in an agony of grief and fondness . ) Oh , God ! That I should have lived to see this day ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( eyes the group gloomily , rouses himself , strikes his forehead as if indignant at himself , and , going , says ) Dubois , I shall expect you at my palace  --  Dub . Dubois You need not , my lord . I will never enter your doors again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must  --  you shall  --  Dub . Dubois Be not imperative , my lord . You have no longer power over me . I abhor your vices  --  I renounce your favour  --  I defy your vengeance ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu Vengeance !  --  How little do you know what 's passing here !  --  ( striking violently upon his bosom ) Scorpions ! scorpions are preying at my heart !  --  Dubois , follow me ! Any reparation I can make  --  Dub . Dubois Can you then feel , my lord ?  --  Nay , go not yet . Look once more upon the ruin you have made . ( grasping his arm , drawing him forward , and pointing firmly to the groupe . Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( shaking him off ) Think not your puny taunts can point my anguish . My own follies , my own vices , have produced this dreadful desolation ;  --  my own heart ,  --  the agony of my remorse ,  --  inflict my punishment ! ( Madam Dorival who had reclined , insensible , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly about , and sinks at her husband 's feet , who partly raises her in his arms . Mad . D. Madam Dorival Say that you forgive me.  --  Once more , your hand .  --  Nay , do not turn your face from me.  --  One look  --  one kind look !  --  My poor husband !  --  What ? a tear ? a tear ?  --  Do you then weep over your lost wife ?  --  Dubois  --  Janet  --  Joy ! Joy !  --  He weeps over me ! He forgives me ! Heaven will forgive me too ! ( Dies . ) Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( gazing frantic with anguish ) Help ! Aid ! Assistance for her  --  My wealth  --  My life  --  Dor . Dorival ( in a wild agony ) My girl ! my girl !  --  Lost ! Dead ! Rich . Duke of Richlieu ( shuddering ) Dead ?  --  Dead !  --  Dub .
