txt ART . VIII. - Oeuvres inedites de Madame Ia Baronne de Stael , publi6es par son , fils. 3 vols. 8vo . Paris , Strasbourg et Londres. 1821 . THE celebrated Rembrandt , one of the principal ornaments of the Flemish school of painting , did not enjoy , in his lifetime , all the reputation which has since been attached to his name . Fame and fortune are capricious ; and Rembrandt , in the pride of genius , neglected the courtly arts , that are sometimes necessary to obtain the favor of these charming divinities . He found himself , accordingly , with all his merit , in very imminent danger of sttirving : and in order to enhance the value of his pictures , and anticipate some of the advantages of a high posthumous reputation , he retired from public view , and circulated a report of his own death . No sooner was this sad event made known , than the hundred tongues of fame were immediately vocal in loud commendation of the departed painter : and what was more to his purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a sort of fury . After reaping this golden harvest , and disposing *of all the pictures he had on hand , the artist returned to life , find resumed his labors with new alacrity , and increased contempt for the good sense and taste of the public . This anecdote has been wrought up by a French writer into a little comedy ; and in order to give it the additional interest of a seasoning of gallantry , the painter 's wife is represented as a second Penelope , besieged , like the queen of Ithaca , in consequence of the supposed death of her husband , by innumerable suitors . She is described , however , as not possessing quite the constancy of that illustrious personage , ' and as not being wholly disinclined to anticipate also , in her own way , some of the advantages , that might be expected to result from her husband 's actual decease , so that the poor painter has more reasons than one for making haste to return to life . // This little anecdote , true or false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the uncertainty there is , whether the judgments of contemporaries will be annulled or confirmed by posterity . No writer of our own times has enjoyed , upon the whole , so extensive a reputation as Madamede Stael obtained in the latter fart of her literary career . The productions of some others have been read with more pleasure , in smaller circles , or rated higher by a few judges who were able to appreciate them ; but taking into view the extent of the public to which she addressed herself , as well as her success in obtaining its favor , it would be difficult to find a name that can come in competition with hers , since the time of Voltaire and Rousseau . Or if this should be contested , it will readily be granted by all , that she was one of the most popular writers of her time . Notwithstanding this , she had critics and very severe ones ; nor has her death wholly silenced them , as it did those of the Flemish artist . We have seen but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a solemn anathema against bad writers of various kinds , in which , among other denunciations equally severe , all Sapphos , Aspasias , and Corinnas , are sent , without ceremony , to the madhouse . This judgment savors too strongly in its rudeness as well as its severity , of the soil , and we imagine will not be confirmed , even by such critics in other countries as are less partial to the daughter of Necker . In fact , if we are rightly informed , although Madame de Stael was received with great attention in the higher circles of German society , the scholars of that country , who wield the sceptre of criticism , have never looked upon her with an eye of favor . Her learning appeared to them scanty and superficial , and quite insufficient to justify her in giving her opinions so freely as she did on large and difficult questions . Accustomed themselves to push their inquiries with an expense of much time and unwearied labor into the minutest details of fact , they are unwilling to acknowledge that these toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and that it is possible to reason correctly upon general subjects , by means of observations made exclusively on large masses and leading points . By French critics , on the contrary , Madame de Stael has been reproached with affeQting too much the German taste , with indulging in vague and obscure modes of expression , with deviating from the pure and lucid perspicuity that distinguishes the best // French writers , and adopting the manner they call romantic , without precisely knowing themselves what they mean by this terni . These objections refer to the style of her works , but the substance of them has also been freely handled . The moral in some has been regarded was loose , and in all as bordering on extravagance and mysticism . Her political philosophy has dissatisfied the zealots of every party . The republicans dislike her passion for historical names , ' and the royal- ' ists her zeal for liberal institutions . Some quarrel with her hatred for Bonaparte and others with her passion for the British government . Meanwhile , these objections , in most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not prevent her reputation from extending itself regularly and rapidly up to the time of her death . Her name and merit were comparatively little known till the publication of Corinna . This work diffused her fame far and wide* and her subsequent more serious productions established it on solid foundations . Instead of outliving her reputation like some authors , and degenerating from the excellence of her earlier efforts , each book that she published was regularly more valuable than the one preceding , and her great posthumous work on the French revolution far excelled any she had previously written , and gave the last finish to her literary character . it may be supposed by some , that the elevated social position of Madame de Stael , her rank , wealth , and titles , , contributed something to her literary success ; but this idea is not very plausible . Other ministers have bad daughters besides M. Necker , and there have been baronesses of higher standing in the rolls of heraldry , and perhaps of larger fortunes , . though hers was very great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , whatever could be done for Madame de Stael by the advantages of her birth and fortune , waseffected at a very early period of her life , and we have seen that her reputation was principally the fruit of her later labors , . performed at a time when she was persecuted , in exile , and comparatively poor . The remark of Pope , upon the great influence of high social standing in sanctifying dullness , like many others of his satirical sallies , has very little foundation .. The rarity of great merit , whether in the loftiest or the lowest ranks of society , makes us perceive it , when it really exists there , with increased satisfaction : but if the public is dispos*d to be indulgent in either case , it seen*s to be rather to the // efforts of indigent , than of wealthy or dignified mediocrity . The Bloomfields obtained a sort of distinction by poems , which , had they been written by men of education , would have sunk without notice into forgetfulness . Hogg , and even Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theinterest excited by their humble origin and small advantages ; while on the other hand the dunces have been uniformly more severely handled by critics and the public , in proportion to their rank and fortune . Lord Thurlow found no protection for affectation and nonsense in his own title , or the merit of his father ; and the earl of Carlisle 's coronet did not secure him from the most unmerciful castigation by his own nephew , lord Byron ,  --  more severe , perhaps , than mere unoffending dulness really deserved . Byron himself received for his hours of idleness a critical lashing , which did not seem to be inflicted with the less relish because it fell on patrician shoulders . In short , we apprehend that notwithstanding the efforts lately made in Europe to give the greatest possible prevalence to the doctrine of legit*rnacy , it has not yet obtained sway in literature , and if all the other governments in the world should assume a monarchical form , except the United States , we shall still have the republic of letters to keep us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions is the poetical coloring of the language . Without having , perhaps , the best possible taste in style , she succeeds to a considerable extent in what she attempts . She is not satisfied with a merely natural and perspicuous expression of tuought , which is , after all , the perfection of art , but aims assiduously and constantly at effect and brilliancy . She deals willingly in large and majestic forms of expression ; and this manner , however imposing when perfectly successful , borders too nearly on stiffness and affectation to be employed without considerable hazard . But Madame de Stael has avoided on the whole , with great skill and success , the principal faults into which her peculiar taste was likely to lead her ; and her ianguage , though rich and elevated , is in general very flowing and easy ; She has also throughout great spirit and vivacity . Her imagination enlivens every thing it touches ; and in the several departments of literature which she has attempted , such as historical and fictitious narrative , description of art and nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various branches of philosophy , she possesses the art of giving her compositions a high degree of interest . This is the true secret of literary success . An attractive style is not so much the clothing of thought , as the conductor of it . Without the intervention of this medium the c*mmunication is not formed between the minds of the writer and the public . his merit , whatever it is , can not be felt or appreciated , because it is not known . We live by style , was an apophthegrn of Voltaire , who had thoroughly studied his profession . To know how to write is indeed of necessity the first qualification of a good writer ; and a mind , however rich in thought and feeling , can no more impart its treasures to the world , in the form of written composition , without possessing naturally , or acquiring by the necessary labor and study the arts of language , than it can pour them out upon canvass without initiating itself into the mysteries of painting . This remark may appear trite , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory , the world would be spared at least ninety-nine out of a hundred of the books that are published . But I*1adame de Stael , though possessed of a poetical mind , was not a poet . She had neither the perfection of style nor the force of imagination , both of which are required for this art . This is proved by the failure of all her attempts at poetry . Her essays in verse were wholly unsuccessful , and she was herself so conscious of it , that she did not publish them during her life . They now appear in the collection of her posthumous works ; but whether the editor has shown his judgment in the publication of them is perhaps a question . They certainly add nothing to the reputation of Madame de Stael as a writer ; but a her acquired fame does not rest in any degree upon these pieces , their inferiority can , of course , do her no injury ; and it is agreeable , as a mere matter of curiosity , to see the attempts in verse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks of literature . These essays consist principally of two tragedies , which were among the very first of her compositions , and which are wholly destitute of any kind of merit . They have all the coldness and stiffness of the French school , without any of its high finish and elegance . There is no examl ) le in fact of a good poem of this importance , written at the age of seventeen or eighteen , when these were produced ; and it is not impossible that the talent of Madame de Stael might have been brought by the necessary labor New Sgries , No. 9. j4 // and discipline to the degree of perfection required for writing good poetry . But whether for want of this course of training , or from original inaptitude , her subsequent attempts are not much superior to the first ; and the few of them that appear in this collection are wholly spirit4*ess . The best things in this way are two or three little comedies , of the slightest possible pretension , written for representation at her own house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbs . These pieces are gay and pleasant ; and show how far talent can go in trifling things , even without the regular discipline . They are written in prose . Madame de Stael was not only incapable of writing in verse , but she wanted the vigor of imagination which constitutes the essential requisite of poetry ; and her works in prose , as far as they assume the character of poetical inventions , may also be regarded as complete failures . Her smaller novels met with no success at all ; and would now be unknown , as indeed they are very nearly , without the subsequent reputation of the writer . The same is true of Deiphine , which is defective in every respect as a work of art , and having no other accidental merit to sustain it , is almost wholly worthless . The morality of it is far from being unexceptionable , notwithstanding the arguments alleged by the author in its defence in a separate essay . But , as was observed by the best critics at the time of its publication , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . Corinna has higher claims ; but if examined , its merit will not be found to lie in the poetical , but in the descriptive part ; and as far as it is a work of invention , it is still a failure , though not to the same extent as Delphine . The character of the heroine is doubtless drawn with considerable spirit and produces effect , but this success does not seem to be the result of a general inventive talent . The personage is wholly out of nature ; and under the pen of an actual observer and true painter , like Shakspeare or Scott , could only have been exhibited , in sorrow or in sport , as a half maniac , if exhibited at all . It is in substance a picture by Madame de Stael of herself , with the expression of every feature heightened to the very verge of carricature ; not , as may well be supposed , for the purpose of producing a ludicrous effect , but in consequence of the intense interest with which an ardent mind naturally expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect knowledge which every individual has of his // own sentiments , supply , for this particular object , the defect of inventive talent . This seems also to be the extent of lord Byron 's power of poetical creation , although he possesses in perfection the talent of writing in verse , which Madame de Stael wanted , and which it might* , be wished that the noble author would put a little more upon the stretch , than he has done in most of his poems . The failure of his late attempt in tragedy adds a positive confirmation to these negative proofs , that his inventive power has a very limited range . But with regard to Corinna , whatever may he the value of the principal character , it is not commonly considered as the chief merit of the work . The hook is , after all , a description of Italy in a poetical form , drawn up with far more talent than is commonly exhibited in this class of writings . Descriptions of foreign countries , although in general very indifferently written , are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular works which appear . It is easy , therefore , to imagine that a production of this class , recommended by the charm of eloquence , and replete with profound and philosophical views , could not fail to attract great attention . We find , accordingly , that the subsequent work on Germany , which is another Italy without the attempt at poetical invention , is not only more valuable , but at least equally if not more popular . We also find among the posthumous works , a dramatic essay on the story of Sappho , which shows what Corinna would have been without Italy , as the Germany shows what italy would have been without Corinna . A true poetical talent would have treated this subject much more at ease in the form of a tragedy , than with the incumbrance of a great country to describe in the midst of all the sentimental agonies of an unrequited passion . The failure of Sappho proves very clearly that the loves of Oswald and Corinna would have excited but little*interest without the associations of ancient greatness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they are accompanied . A German poet , Grilipar. ' zer , has lately produced a tragedy on the subject of Sappho , which resembles the work of Madame de Stacl so nearly in plot , that there must necessarily have been a communication between the two authors . Whether Grillparzer had seen her Sappho in manuscript , or whether after the publication of his , she undertook to treat the same subject in her own way , we are not informed . // As Madame de Stael , though possessed of sufficient taste and imaujuation to write with correctness and elegance , and even with poetical coloring , had not the essential requisites of real poetry , it is evident her success must have depended at least as much upon the substan. *e of her compositions , as upon their form . Even fine versifi*ation , to produce its effect , must be sustained by a brilliant inventive talent , or a power of deep and original thought . Poetry properly requires the former but the latter sometimes serves as a substitute , as in Pope , Goldsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose , however beautiful , demands still more imperiously , the aid of some substantial merit . This merit , as in poetry , may con sist either in thought or invention . The novels of Richardson , Fielding and Scott , which , are real poems in prose , derive their principal value from invention . As Madame Stael wanted this talent , we find , as might be supposed , that her substantial excellence is thought . Philosophy , and not poetry , was her proper department ; and in making a general estimate of her literary character it is still more important to look at it under this point of view than the other . in the various walks of speculation , her reach of mind was very extensive ; and if she treats some subjects more superficially than others , it seems to be rather from a want of inclination to engage in them , than of ability to sound them to the bottom . In the account she gives of the German philosophy , the analysis of intellect is lightly touched , and the conclusions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of Kant , she was seduced into an approval of it by the slight and wholly superficial colouring of plausibility which may he given to his leading principle . To do her justice , however , it should be observed , that she does not profess to have studied his theories , and after giving a general view of his leading principle in one of her chapters , she says little more than that there is an appearance of plausibilty about it , which is true . Had she pushed her inquiries farther , she would have seen that this was only an appearance . But probably deriving her knowledge of the system from persons who approved it , she regards this plausibility as a presumption in favor of its truth . She was doubtless repelled by the obscurity in which the German metaphysicians have voluntarily shrouded their speculations , from entering into a thorough examination of them ; and few , we fancy , will blame her for it , // very severely . Her favorite branches of philosophy were morals and politics , and upon these she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In morals she embraced and supported , with singular zeal , the system which places the essence of virtue in the benevolent motive of the agent , and not il the useful tendency of the action . She treats with undisguised contempt the idea , that calculation can have any connexion with moral goodness ; and regards feeling as the only elevated and really correct guide of conduct . Considered as a specimen of logical inquiry , there is a want of closeness and precision in her reasoning upon this , as upon most other points of philosophy . It is a part of the sublime and beautiful order of the universe , that good feelings tend to produce good consequences ; and both these theories of virtue , abstractly considered , are therefore equally true . To deny that it is possible ever to do good by calculation , would be either to deny that good feelings tend to useful results , or to deny that we can perceive the connexion between them ; neither of which points is at all tenable . There is , therefore , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Stael supports the doctrine of sympathy , and attacks that of utility . But considering the state of moral philosophy in France at the time when she began to write , she is entitled to great credit for adopting these opinions . The French philosophers of the last century , in their analysis of the mind , almost wholly overlooked the existence of sympathetic feelings , or , as they are called by a writer in the Edinburgh Review , with happy technical precision , felt relations , and resolved all sentiments into self-love . On this system , the promotion of our own advantage is the only natural motive of action ; and as it does not seem to have been intended that we should act upon large views of distant consequences , it would on this supposition he natural , and of course right , that we should sacrifice the happiness of others to our own . Thus , these philosophers neglected the most beautiful feature in the order of Providence , which has provided for the general good , by giving to each individual a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his owi* , and has neutralised by a contrary principle , at least as strong , the malignant operation of pure self-love . This selfish philosophy had become universal in France , and had been brought into view in combination with the grossest and // Jan. most revolting materialism , to which it does not necessarily lead , but with which it may be easily connected . No modern French writer had espoused the contrary doctrine , at least in a dogmatical form , previously to Madame de Stael . Hence , although there was no real novelty in the doctrine of sympathy , she had something of the me*t of philosophical discovery , in reviving it with so much zeal and vigor in a country where it had fallen into discredit . Her manner of explaining the doctrine is somewhat vague and incorrect , as we have observed above . Instead of contenting herself with reinstating the principle of sympathy in its rights , as co-operating with that of utility to produce the moral harmony of the universe , she denies with a sort of passion , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she perfecily exact in her view of the value of sympathetic feelings . She seems very much disposed to give the character of virtue exclusively to acts that involve a sacrifice of our own interest to that of others , which is one step beyond the doctrine of pure disinterestedness , as a man may act without any view to his own interest , when he does not absolutely sacrifice it . This idea can hardly be admitted , although the promotion of the happiness of others , at the expense of our own , may well be considered as the highest act of virtue , since it is the most difficult . But these terms are used with very little precision by most other writers , and it was not the particular object of iMadame de Stael to reform or fix the nomenclature of moral science , but to recommend a particular view of it to the public . By supporting the general doctrine of sympathy as she understood it , *. vith her ardent and enthusiastic eloquence , she has done far more good , than would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even been more exact in the details . Although the speculations of Madame de Stael on this subject are somewhat deficient in precision , they are more profound and scientific than in any other department of philosophy . Mewphysics , as we have already seen , she has treated in a light and superficial way ; and the critical remarks on various ancient and modern writers interspersed in her different works , though often very just and ingenious , and always indicative of a highly cultivated mind , do not seem to be the result of a philosophical investigation of the principles of taste . In politics her observations are almost wholly practi // cal ; and she has made no effort to improve in theory the science of government . It would be difficult , however , to cite any political writings of modern times , which display a more truly liberal and philosophical spirit . Whatever errors there may be in* her judgments re*ecting persons or thing , they are never tinctured with malignity or vitiated by narrow and partial views . Her point of observation is uniformly elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansive . She rises above the bewildering and poisonous atmosphere of vulgar party spirit , and is ready to allow , that the mistakes of he r adversaries and her own juster views are alike the results of the ordinary motives that influence opinion and conduct . A false judgment is not , with her , the necessa* ry consequence of a bitter malignant spirit , but an accidental effect of the frailty of human nature . Though strongly attached to liberal institutions and representative government , she can still , at times , discover merit in a monarch , or even in a minister : and what is still more extraordinary , though warmly French in her sentiments , she is an enthusiastic admirer of England and every thing English . The only two points in which she exhibits strong prejudice are her partiality for her father and her hatred of Bonaparte . The first of these feelings is too natural and amiable to be excepted against , though it gives unquestionably a false coloring to the early part of her work on the revolution . The other has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say where honest indignation ends and personal hostility begins . In her judgments of other characters , she uniformly displays the most amiable feel . ings . She is candid and charitable in her notices of acknowledged errors , generous in her construction of doubtful passages , and unreservedly liberal in her commendation of excellence , intellectual and moral . We rise from the perusal of her works , even such as treat of those topics that are ordinarily employed to excite the worst and most malignant passions , with warmer benevolence and higher ideas of the nature and destiny of man . The writer who can produce these effects has little need to be ambitious of higher excellence . At this last appearance of Madame de Stael before the critical tribunal , we have thought it not unprofitable to take this general survey of her literary character , without entering into a detailed examination of her particular works , the most impor1*ant of which have been noticed , as they appeared , in this // journal . It will be seen by the tone of our remarks , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been moved by a wish to depreciate her reputation . It is due to justice to say , that she was unsuccessful alike in poetical in-. vention and execution , to both which qualities she made pretensions ; that she has no claim to the praise of discovery in her philosophical researches ; and is far from being remarka .. ble for developing the truths made known by others with logi-. cal correctness and precision . But after these exceptions are made , there will remain for Madame de Stael praise enough to satisfy the ambition of more than common minds . She thinks freely and writes with power and elegance upon the most important subjects . This union of merits is itself extremely rare and remarkable . Experience shows , that even in an age of refinement , there are not more than three or four individuals in a generation who can fairly make pretensions to it . When we add to this the exhibition of high moral enthusiasm , and all the most exalted and amiable feelings , that appears in her works , we may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically to a higher class , of which the daughter of Necker had reason to be envious . One of the strongest proofs of her real merit is the fact , that her writings are uniformly criticised and judged without regard to the sex of the author . No attempt is made to palliate their deficiencies or exalt their excellence by suggesting that the praise or the blame must attach to a lady . this consent of the public , which has not been shown in any other case , sufficiently proves that Madame de Stael was not an extraordinary female writer , but an extraordinary writer . With all the merit of the present race of female authors in England , no one of them that we recollect has a right to claim an equality with her in this particular , far less to contest her superiority . Of these writers Miss More has the least femality ( to use a coarse word , manufactured by Richardson , ) in her mode of thinking and writing ; but her style , though pure and manly , has no grace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though remarkable as a female writer , she is quite secondary in the general literary scale . In the works of Miss Edgeworth , however interesting and valuable , we catch not unfrequently , a glimpse of the petticoat . She is much more at home in the boudoir and the ball room than in the cabinet or the court of justice , and manages Mrs Falconer far // more gracefully than the commissioner or his dignified and somewhat dull master . She knits up and unravels the ladylike network of a love intrigue with good success , though fable is , after all , not her strong point ; hut the specimens she has given us in Patronage of her djplomatic and professional address are at best of equivocal merit . To our taste , and we say it without meaning to disparage but rather to exalt her reputation , she is , most of all happy and engaging in the citizen 's workshop and parlor and the Irish cottage . These are her fields of triumph and thrones of glory . Indeed as we feel the tears stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these scenes , and think of the true poetical talent with which she has hit off many of her characters , as for instance the charming Geraldine , we are half tempted to return upon our decision , and award her the preference over Madame de Stael . Let the palm rest between them , as it does in almost every thing , between the two illustrious nations to which they belong . The posthumous works of Madame de Stael , to which our attention is now particularly called , will add nothing to the literary reputation of their author . They are made up of her unsuccessful attempts at poetry , whether in verse or prose , already adverted to , and of a fragment , entitled Ten years in Exile , which , had it been completed , would have given the history of an interesting period in her own life . In its present shape , it is of very little value as a literary composition . It is not only an unfinished fragment , hut a great part of it had already been employed as materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesa circumstances , the expediency of publishing it may perhaps be looked on as doubtful ; but on the whole , we can not regret the determination which has given us , though in an imperfect and mutilated form , the autobiography of so fine a writer . There are also a few passages of great interest , and which will serve as contributions to the polittcal history of the period . Neither this work , nor that of Madame de Necker , nor both together , furnish a satisfactory account of the life of Madame de Stael ; so that a biography of her is still a desideratum . The work of Madame de Necker is indiffer .. ently executed . it is almost wholly made up of speculations upon the value of the writings of her heroine-speculations which are hardly of the first order , and which , if they were better , are not what is expected from the writer of her hiogra .. . N'ew , Series , JV'Q. 9 15 // phy . Every reader may reason , according to the measure of his talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to furnish us with the details of her his .. tory ; and this was , of course , the proper field for Madame de Necker to expatiate in . We proj*se to fill up the remainder of this article with a brief ahtract of the narrative contained in the Ten years in Exile , illustrated by a few of the most interesting passages . The narrative commences about the year 1800 , and the first chapters are occupied in explaining and giving the reason of the aversion shown to Madame de Stael by Bonaparte , even at this period , and his subsequent persecution of her . She affirms that her principal crime in his view was her love of liberty ; and afterwards mentions some particular circumstances , apparently of no great importance , in which her influence was directed against his authority and administration . These motives of dislike may have had their weight ; but we think that either from self-deception or for some other reason , she has not stated the real cause so explicitly as she might have done , although she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observing reader . Whatever may have been the feelings of the first consul towards her , it does not appear that she was in any respect molested for a long period after his elevation to the supreme power . She resided at Paris , and employed and amused herself in any way she thought proper , until about the year 1802 . At that time a sort of conspiracy was formed against the government of Bonaparte , in which Madame de Stael took a part , and of which she would seem , even from her own account of it , which is however very imperfect , to have been one of the principal managers . The following paragraph contains the whole of what she says upon the subject . A number of generals and senators formed a party at that time , and addressed themselves to general Bernadotte , with a view of ascertaining from him , if nothing could he done to check the progress of the usurpation , then so rapidly advancing . Bernadotte proposed several plans , all founded in legislative measures , being opposed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such measures required an act of at least a part of the senate ; and not a member could he found who dared to concur in such a proceeding . While this dangerous negotiation was in progress , I was frequently in company with // general Bernadotte and his friends . This was more than enough to ruin me , if these plans were brought to light . Bonaparte was heard to say , that the persons who frequented my house always left it with sentiments less favorable to him than those with which they entered it . Finally , he found it expedient to consider me as the 6*ily person criminal among many others , who were much more so than I was , but whom he could not so conveniently break with . ' This incident explains , we think , very sufficiently and satisfactorily the persecution of Madame de Stael by Napo .. leon , as well as his known and avowed dislike of Bernadotte . It appears from this account , however brief and imperfect , that a conspiracy against the power of the first consul was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the meetings were probably held at her house . It is evident that Bonaparte obtained information of the plot : and supposing it to have been managed with such prudence as to afford no pretext for proceeding against the principal active conspirators , it was natural and even justifiable that he should provide for his future safety by removing from the capital the person , whose conversation probably fomented the intrigue , and whose house was the rendezvous of those engaged in it . In saying that this step was justifiable , we shall of course not he understood to imply that an attempt to check the usurpations of Bonaparte , even by violent means , was criminal . It was doubtless on the contrary highly creditable to its authors , and if successful , might have been very advantageous to the state . But a person who adventures in so treacherous and doubtful a field as that of conspiracy , ought to he aware of the character of such enterprises , and not bewail his fate too loudly , if discovery ends in nothing worse than exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how*. ever violent and unjust , for proceeding with severity against its real and ascertained enemies ; and there would be no merit in attempting to overthrow such a government , if failure and discovery were not to be attended with personal inconvenience . The part taken by Madame de Stael in this conspiracy was , therefore , as we imagine , her real crime , and not her passion for liberty in the ajzstract , nor even her refusal to fiat* ter the emperor in her writings . In fact , the distinguished literary characters of the time , though of opposite political sentiments , were rather courted than persecuted by Napoleon : // rJaii* and some , whose opinions were still more hostile to him than those of Madame de Stael , but who had the prudence to abstain from overt acts , as for example M. de Ch*teaubriand , resided very quietly at Paris throughout his whole reign . It is also precisely at this period , as she herself admits , that the violent proceedings of Bonaparte against *er commenced . Immediately upon the detection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless with the view of providing for her safety , and did not attempt for some time to return to Paris . The next year , thinking that Bonaparte , who was then busily engaged in making preparations for his descent upon England , had forgotten her , but still not choosing to trust herself at Paris , she ventured to take a country house in the neighborhood of that capital , and occasionally to make her appearance there . I confess ; ' she observes here with a singular simplicity , I confess that I do not see what inconvenience it would have been to the First Consul , had he permitted me to remain at this retreat in voluntary exile . ' The inconveniiice is plain enough . A person , who has already organized one conspiracy , can hardly be trusted with safety in a situation , which affords an opportunity of organizing another . The most decided enemies of Bonaparte can hardly deny that his conduct in this respect , was perfectly reasonable ; and it is evident that in confining his precautions to banishment from Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , which were nevertheless familiar to him , he gave clear proofs of a wish to avoid the public scandal of treating too harshly a woman of distinguished genius . She received , however , an order to remove forty leagues from the capital ; and it was at this time that she determined on travelling in Germany . Upon the view we have here taken of the relations between Madame de Stael and Bonaparte , according to the account she has given of them herself , it appears that her complaints of persecution were entirely groundless . She seems to have had a vague notion that the emperor was bound to treat her , at the very moment when she was aiming a dagger at his heart , with all the gallantry and regard due to her sex and genius . She engages in a secret attempt to overturn by violence a powerful military government , and when detected , complains with bitterness that she is not allowed to enjoy , as before , all her usual comforts . A person who had composed a tragedy upon // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slighter offences than hers had brought much loftier heads to the block , at the order of tyrants less remorseless than Bonaparte . Few particulars are given of her travels in Germany , the matter having been treated in her*separate work on that country . She was accompanied on this journey by Benjamin Constant . She resided three months at Weimar , and there made the acquaintance of G6the , Wieland , and Schiller , of whom she has given her opinion at large in her Germany . At this place she also received intelligence of the illness of her father ; and immediately returned in haste to Copet , but did not reach that place in time to be present at his death . In the year 1804 , she published a collection of M. Necker 's manuscripts , with a notice of his life , and then to console her sorrows , undertook the journey to Italy , the fruits of which appeared in Corinna . At this period she made another attempt to return to Paris . As a preliminary step , she established herself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the indulgence of Fouch* , then minister of police , she was allowed to approach within twelve . But the publication of Corinna awakened anew the attention of Bonaparte , and she received immediately after another sentence of exile . The intervening time between this period , and her final departure from Switzerland in 1812 , was passed principally at Copet , and employed in the composition of the work on Germany . There is an interruption in this part of the memoirs ; and the narrative is continued by the insertion of a brief notice of the principal facts written by the editor . The son , as is not unnatural , takes part with the mother in her complaints of her unjust persecution by Napoleon . After finishing the work on Germany , she made another approach to the capital of France to superintend the printing of it . The book , as is well known , was suppressed , when it was all printed and just on the eve of publication , and the disappointed author returned once more in sadness to Switzerland . Here she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic comfort was disturbed by such various molestations , that the residence became intolerable to her ; and she determined , finally , to make her escape , and to pass by way of Austria , Russia , and the North of Europe , into England . After much preiiminary doubt and hesitation , she finally attempted this // scheme , and effected it with very little difficulty and no obstruction on the part of the French government . The account of this journey occupies the greater part of the narrative in the work we are reviewing ; but is only brought down to her arrival at Stockholm . The passages of most interest contain her observations at St Petersburg . The*following account of her presentation to the emperor Alexander is curious in itself , and still more so , from the light , which subsequent events have thrown upon the character of this sovereign . At length I saw this monarch , absolute by the laws and usages of his country , but so moderate by his own inclination . I was first presented to the empress Elizabeth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I was converQino ' with the empress , a door opened , and the emperor Alexander dja me the honor to come in and speak to me . The first thing , that struck me in him , was an expression of goodness and of dignity , so strong , that the two qualities appeared to be inseparable , and to form but one . 1 was also much impressed by the noble simplicity with which he immediately began to converse upon the great interests of Europe . I have always regarded as a sign of mediocrity , the unwillingness to talk upm matters of importance , which has become habitual with all the European sovereigns . They are afraid to utter a word which has any real meaning . The emperor Alexander talked with me , on the contrary , as the statesmen of England would have done , who trust to their own strength , and not the external pomp and circumstance of their offices . This emperor , whom Napoleon attempted to degrade in the public *opinion , is a man of remarkable talent and information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole empire , a minister more *capable than himself of directing the public affairs . He ( lid not conceal froro me the regret he felt , for the admiration which he had publicly exhibited of Napoleon . His ancestor , Peter III , was seduced into a similar enthusiasm for Frederic II . In these ilIu sions , created by extraordinary characters , there is always something generous , however unfortunate may be the consequences . The emperor described with great ability the effect produced upon him by his conversations with Bonaparte , in which the latter often made the most iaconsistent remarks ; as if thinking that all would be received with admiration , without any feeling of their contradictory character . lie also communicated to me the Machiavelian instructions which Napoleon thought proper to give him . " Observe , how I take care to excite quarrels among my generals and ministers , that they may reveal to me each other 's faults . I keep up about me a continual jealousy by the manner in which I treat them . Sometimes one thinks himself preferred . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ; so that nobody can ever be sure of my favor . " What a vulgar and vicious theory is this Will there never appear a man superior to this man , who can prove its falsity ? The only thing wanting to the sacred cause of morality is to be attend - ed in this world with great and brilliant success . One who duly appreciates the dignity of this cause*ould , without doubt , feel a pleasure in sacrificing to it every other consideration ; but those presumptuous souls who regard vice as a proof of sound and deep thinking , require to be taught by example , that if immorality is sometimes compatible with talent , genius may also be the attendant of virtue . I was satisfied of the good *faith of the emperor Alexander in his relations with Napoleon ; and was convinced at the same time , that he would never imitate the conduct of the unfortunate German sovereigns , by signing a peace with one who is equally the enemy of sovereigns and nations . A noble mind will never be deceived twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence with great reflection . his youth and personal advantages threw upon him , at the beginning of his reign , some suspicions of frivolity ; but he is serious , like all who have suffered . Alexander expressed to inc his regret at not being a great captain . In answer to so noble a proof of modesty , I remarked , that sovereigns were even more rare than generals ; and that to keep up the spirit of the nation , by his example , was the most important of victories , arid the first of the kind that had been gained in these struggles . The emperor spoke to me with enthusiasm of his people and their future destinies . He intimated the desire , which he is generally known to feel , of improving the condition of the peasants who are still in slavery . * said 1 , " your character is a constitution to your empire , and your ' conscience is the security of it . " " if this were true , " he replied , . " 1 should still be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first of the kind , I fancy , that an absolute monarch ever pronounced . What virtue it requires in a despot to pass such a sentence upon despotism ! and what virtue too , it requiresnever to abuse power in a country where public opinion is so far from demanding moderation , that the people are almost astonished at its exercise . ' Late events have shown very clearly , that whatever confidence the conscience of the emperor Alexander may inspiro in the minds of his subjects , it is no sufficient security against the abuse of his influence over foreign powers . The *epresentation here given of his disposition at a preceding period , towards Bonaparte , is tinged with a favorable coloring , which nothing could excuse , but the sympathy naturally inspired by his situation at the time when this passage was written . A // fIJau* mind , which could be seduced by the glare of military suc* cess , encircling the name of Bonaparte , into a passionate admiration of his character , and a public approval of his measures , by cooperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting in firmness ; and a conscience which can lend itself to such illusions is a poor security for the rights of a great nation . That Peter 111. felt a similar enthusiasm for the great Frederic may be true ; but the example is not very flattering to the emperor Alexander , who probably aspires to a higher reputation than that of his besotted and miserable great grandfather ; while , in order to defend him on the authority of this instance , it would be necessary to suppose him as much weaker than Peter , as Bonaparte was more unprincipled , and less accomplished than the hero of Bran denburgh . We can hardly exculpate Madame de Stael , in this point , of intentional flattery , a heinous offence in so warm a champion of liberal principles and generous feelings . We are not , however , disposed to deny that her general idea of the emperor 's moral character is substantially just . We believe his disposition to be naturally good and generous , and are ready to admit that even in supporting the late invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut really believed himself to be doing God service . His honesty in these measures was of the same description with that , which lighted the faggots for Cranmer , and hung the witches at Salem . Minds much stronger than the emperor 's have been subdued by the influence of prevailing opinions ; and a powerful military despot , who is led to trample on the rights of other nations by a fanatical zeal for what he believes to be a good cause , is , in our opinion , a much more dangerous person , than a sovereign merely ambitious of greatness and glory . The proceedings of the former will probably be found to be more violent , more unjust , and perhaps more cruel . The conscience of an individual is , therefore , no sufficient guarantee for any rights whatever , and it is the great advantage of liberal institutions and representative governments , that they protect the people , alike from the wilful oppression of profligate rulers , and th' equally fatal errors of the well meaning . These institutions throw upon the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Public opinion itself may , at times , be erroneous ; but it is the last tribunal to which an appeal can be made on this side the grave ; and where the form of // government allows it a full and free expression , its connsel* may generally be followed with confidence by honest rulers , as they must be obeyed , however reluctantly , by all . While with these reservations we adopt the opinion of Madame de Stael respecting the moral characte* of the emperor of Russia , we find ourselves unable to agree with her , in pronouncing him a man of remarkable talent and information . Every thing has , doubtless , been done for his mind , which could be effected by the most careful and judicious course of training ; and he is much superior to the great majority of persons be-. longing to the same social class ; but we are not aware that he has exhibited any clear proofs of possessing great intellectual energy ; and he certainly has given many of wanting it . There is little novelty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians . She was forcibly struck with the high civilization of the nobles , and the rude barbarity of the general mass . Her representation of the character of both classes is perhaps rather more favorable than strict justice would admit , but is in the main , substantially just . The following passages contain some of her reflections on the Russian character , and may peihaps V'p interestin. * at a time when the public attention is so strorvdx duected towards this vast empire , and when the import*nt p'ut *vhicli it is destined to play in the future history of Eumope is becoming every day more and more perceptible . No civilized nation is so nearly savage as u*sia ; and even the nobles when they possess mental enei* exoibit the faults and the virtues of unreclajined nature . Much pi *ise has been . bestowed on the celebrated remark of I ) id of " The I ussian&amp;* rotted before they ripened ; " but the observaton is wholly false . Their vices , with some exceptions , are those of h ' *rnaiism , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cite , said a man of talent , and when they desire to accom1 lish i my object good or bad , they are alternately furious and cuninn I hcir character is not changed by the rapid civilization introduced by Peter . Hitherto it has only polished their inammnei s and fortunately for them , they remain what we call barbarians ihat is thtv act from feelings , often generous , but always ins*incti* e , and employ reflection only in the choice of means , and 11 x in that of ends1 I say fortunately for them , not because ib ii the state of barbarisin desirable , but because this nativ- enery of character is time only substitute in nations for the rei* no- and deliberate power of freedom . // The people , it may be said , are in slavery ; how then can they be supposed to have a character . Certainly I need not say , that every enlightened man desires to see them raised above this situation , and the emperor Alexander more than any body else . But the slavery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea we form of it in the w*t . This relation is not like that which existed under the feudal system , when a conquering nation had impose ( l severe laws upon a conquere ( 1 one . It is more like the state of family servitude among the ancients . There is no middling class ( tiers stat ) in lThssia . This is a great evil as regards the progress of literature and the arts , which generally flourish but in this portion of society ; but the absence of any intervenin* order between the nobles and the slaves , produces a greater attachment between them than would otherwise exist . The distance appears very great from one of these orders to the other , because they are two extremes , unconnected by any intermediate link ; but this very circumstance brings them in reality much more frequently into contact . This stat&amp;of society is very unfavorable to the improvement of the higher classes , but not to the happiness of the lower . In countries where there is no representative government , and where the monarch makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are often more debased by the sacrifice of independence and opinion , required by such a political constitution , than they are in this empire , where a few *im ple ideas of religion and patriotism serve to maintain the influence of a small number of lords over a vast uncivilized mass . The immense extent of the Russian empire prevents the despotism of the nobles from pressing as heavily as it otherwise would , upon the peasants . A religious and a military spirit are also generally prevalent , and we may readily overlook some deficiencies in a country where two such excellent motives of conduct are in steady operation . A man of great talent remarked , that Russia resembled the plays of Shakspeare , where every thing which is not sublime is faulty ; and every thing which is not faulty is sublime . This observation is perfectly just ; but in the very difficult crisis which existed at the time when I visited this people , it was impossible not to admire their energetic resistance to the invader , and their cheerful resignation to the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly possible to notice the faults which might have been remarked at other times . ' We quote these passages without pretending to adopt or contest the opinions ; but merely with a view of communicating to the reader the sentiments of so enliThten ver on a very important subject . * ed an obserThe determined and bitter hostility of Madame de Stael to // the now departed military tyrant of her country , is a remarkable feature in this work , as in the one on the French revohition . It is expressed in this in a still more unqualified form than in the other , partly , perhaps , because the rude lines of a first sketch had not been correcte*and softened for the public eye , and partly because the work was written at the pen .. od of the emperor 's worst and wildest extravagance , and when the writer was suffering strongly herself under the continual stroke ' of his iron sceptre . When she Published the work on the French revolution , her great enemy had already lost his power ; and even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers in the world not wholly indisposed to play in their turn the game of tyranny . Under these circumstances she was able to treat the character and history of Bonaparte with more coolness and judgment ; and though there are still strong symptoms of personal feeling , we l ) erceive something of the dignity and impartiality of history . In the present work a tone of passion and petulance prevails throughout on the subject ; and it tends very strongly to defeat the unfavorable impression which might otherwise be made by the facts related and the opinions given . This circumstance might have been considered as a reason among others , for suppressing the work out of regard for the author 's reputation . Independently of the unfortunate tone of most of the observations upon that point , the substance of them is far from being always correct or even plausible . There is too obvious an effort to degrade the character of Napoleon for talent , as well as to inculpate his motives and conduct . If we merely look at his political and military successes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age like this , demands intellectual powers of the highest order . An Attila or a Gengisk an may ravage half the globe , without any qualities but brutal courage and a wild barbarian energy of mind and body ; but to establish a dominion , though merely military , over an enlightened continent like Europe , is an achievement of a different sort ; and supposes , in addition to the virtues of a great commander , a natural dignity and elevation of mind . is it possible that a vulgar spirit should raise itself , by its own efforts , from the lowest ranks in the army to the throne of one of the most powerful and civilized nations in Europe ; and should then push the greatness of this nation to a point which it never reached before , and extend it influence over a great // part of the continent ? But , independently of the proofs , drawn from these prodigious results of the naturally elevated character of their author , he has given others in abundance still more direct and ( lecisIve . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noblest code of laws t*t the world has yet seen , as much superior to the undigested mass of the Justinian collection , as the universe is to the chaos out of which it was formed ? Was it a vulgar spirit , that brought together with so perfect a taste the finest specimens of the arts from all other countries , and opened them to the world with such princely magnificence in the unrivalled gallery of the Louvre ? Finally , was it a vulgar spirit that could find time amid the various and numberless occupations of the most active life that man ever led , to take an interest in almost every department of knowledge , and to obtain  --  a sufficient acquaintance with all , to he able to converse upon them with satisfaction and credit ? Bonaparte was certainly little in some points , as in the importance which lie attached towards the close of his reign to the childish foppery of court etiquette . But almost every character is , to a certain extent , a union of inconsistencies ; and the prevailing vices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wildest and most extravagant stamp was the ruling passion of his mind . Had this disposition been controlled , in its practical operation , by the influence of moral feelings or principles , it might have produced the happiest results for its possessor and the world . But morality , whether founded in principle or feeling , seems to have been a thing of which he had no notion whatever . We find no traces in his history of benevolent sentiments in any of their various forms ; and he trampled under foot the en ( learing relations of blood and birth , with the same savage indifference which he showed for the just rights of individuals , with whom he was unconnected . His mother was not allowed to sit in his reception room ; and his brothers were persecuted by him with such relentless severity , that some of them fled from his presence , and the rest were ready to expire under its terrors . Lucien , whose influence contributed so much to give him his power , found it expedient to retire into voluntary exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of an amiable and affectionate wife , who had been his companion and benefactress in his humbler fortunes ; // and he imposed on his brothers , sacrifices of the same kind , to serve not their views , but his own . Jerome must be divorc* ed , and Louis must marry to gratify his ambition or something worse . The light in which he viewed his confidential agents and officers has been seen , in h. * conversation above cited with the em peror Alexander . In this total deficiency of natural affection in all its forms , he differs disadvantageously from the two most distinguished conquerors of antiquity ; and approaches more nearly to the great Frederic , whose heart was also of the consistency of one of his own cannon balls . The only intellectual vice of Bonaparte was extravagance ; and it was this that caused his ruin . With all his contempt for the rights and feelings of others he might have maintained himself to the last , and transmitted his sceptre to a long line of descendants , had he known how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate infusion of good sense and discretion . This defect in his understanding , had been observed by those who were ecquainted with him , before he had betrayed its existence to the public , by the incredible follies that marked the close of his reign . General Moreau , as we are told by Madame de Stael , observed at his residence on the Delaware , upon hearing of the failure of some attempt at conspiracy in France , the French have not the art of managing this sort of business ; but there is one conspirator to whose machinations he must ultimately fall a victim ,  --  1 mean himself . ' If Madame de Stael has shown a want of coot judgment in attempting to underrate the talents of Napoleon , she is also not always correct in estimating the moral character of his particular actions ; but dwells perhaps with an emphasis not wholly just on actions either of doubtful authenticity or disputed morality . This remark , however , must not be made without exception , for in regard to some separate acts of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater or less degrees of probability , she observes with propriety , that as the correctness of these statements is after all doubtful , to insist much upon them , while it shows a strong sentiment of hostility , has a tendency rather favorable than otherwise to the general reputation of Napoleon , because it seems to argue that the acts , which can be laid to his charge with certainty , are not heinous enough for his condemnation . in reality , however , the undisputed crimes of this personage // are sufficiently enormous to relieve the bitterest of his foes , did they know how to unite even a moderate share of discretion with their animosity , from the necessity of inventing new ones or insisting upon such as are doubtful . The first and greatest of the number was the employmei* of the influence he had acquired by his military successes to destroy the liberty of his country . The fortune of France , at least for a length of time , was in his hands . It was in his power to establish her political institutions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness upon the ruins of every other interest . He chose the latter course , and preferred the part of Cromwell to that of Washington . His second crime , scarcely inferior in magnitude to the first , was the abuse of this ill-gotten greatness to the destruction of the independence and welfare of every foreign nation within his reach . These are the acts for which his memory will be execrated by the friends of liberty , as long as liberty shall have a friend ; and while European courtiers are wasting their sorrows upon the untimely grave of a siI ) gle unfortunate prince , the wise and good of all countries and ages , with whom a prince is no more than any other man , will only lament his fate in common with that of millions , more unfortunate and more innocent , whose lives and happiness were sacrificed by an individual to the vain phantom of military glory . One of the great singularities in the every way singular fortunes of this personage , was the lingering constancy with which the affection of the people still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shameless defection from the cause of freedom , and his subsequent intolerable abuse of power . The friends of liberty throughout the world , especially the less enlightened among them , and those whose opinions are rather the result of impulse than reflection , regarded him , even in the days of his worst excesses , with the sort of distressing interest , which a lover feels for a fair and faithless mistress , who has forfeited his esteem , without having wholly lost her hold upon his affections . A sentiment of this kind was observable in the language of some of the most respectable members of the British parliament ; and traces of it might even be perceived in the views of the most decidedly republican portion of our republican community . It was a remarkable thing to see the character and cause of a military despot treated with a sort of indulgence , by so large a part // of a nation , which lives and moves and has its being in the at* rnosphere of liberty and equality . But here , as elsewhere , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present ; they could not forget at once that Bonaparte , in his earliest and best and *appiest days , had been th' asserter of the good cause against the Holy Alliance of his time ; and that he had trampled upon many a diadem before he stooped to pick up one of them , and disgrace his manly brow with its childish finery . Even after he had assumed the disguise of an emperor , they could not help feeling that he was originally one of themselves ; and when they saw him pouring out his fury upon other established governments , from whose abuses they had formerly suffered , they did not realise , in a moment , that his own was infinitely more tyrannical than any that preceded it . The very enormity of his treason against the cause of liberty prevented the people from viewing it , at first , in its true light . It seemed impossible in the nature of things , that the noblest of her champions should have sunk at once , from the loftiest heights of glory to the lowest depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although against the evidence of their senses , that there was some deception in this apparent apostacy , that the general good required that the cause of the people should be entrusted , for a time , to an arbitrary dictator , and that , after beating down all opposition and rooting out every where the last vestiges of ancient abuses , this mighty champion would resign his truncheon of office , return to the ranks from which he had emerged , and pay his vows again at the altar of freedom . Such , or similar to these , were the willing delusions of many true patriots in various countries . They were not wholly dissipated at the time of the fall of Bonaparte ; and the compassion naturally inspired by so strange a reverse of fortune , contributed to sustain and even heighten this singular sort of interest : so that it continued to attend him even in his last lonely retreat . Liberty , remembering the ardent zeal and brilliant exploits of her youthful hero , did not disdain to cheer the dark hours of the wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering gleams of affection . Lord Holland , and some other enthusiastic partisans of popular principles , raised their voices in favor of Bonaparte. in the British parliament , when every body else had deserted him except his own family and the faithful companions of his // exile : and the care and kindness of these generous souls contributed something to the comfort of his latter years If a heart like his were susceptible of remorse and shame , such treatment would have been far more cutting to him than the persecution of his avowed enemies* We have been led into these observations in part by the occasional interest now attached to the name and character of Bonaparte , in consequence of his death ; an event , the very indifference of which , in a political point of view , makes it more remarkable , than it would have been under any other circumstances . We trust that we have not offended the spirit of Madame de Stael in devoting a few pages to the memory of her great antagonist , since she expresses a hope , in the commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall often be able to withdraw the reader 's attention from her own affairs . However unfortunate for her peace may have been her connexion with the history of Bonaparte , we are not sure that it is not one of the circumstances which will contribute most powerfully to maintain her hold upon the attention of posterity . She has indeed expressed this opinion herself , in a letter which she wrote to him upon the occasion of his first order of exile . She observes , You are giving me a sad celebrity-I shall occupy one of the pages in your history . '
