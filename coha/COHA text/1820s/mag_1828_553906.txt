Memoirs of My Own Times , or Contributions to the History of the Last quarter of the Eighteenth and the Be-. ginning of the Nineteenth Century , 1778 to 1806 . By CHRISTIAN WiLLIAM VQN DOHM . THE author of this work died at Pustleben in May , 1820 . The history does not strictly correspond to the promise of the titlepage , as it illustrates only the period from 1778 to 1786 , the time of the death of Frederic The Second . The intention of the author doubtless extended further ; but disease and the jufirmities of age prevented its execution . He himself gives as a title to this part of his work , History of the last Period of the Reign of Frederic the Second , King of Prussia , 1778-1786 . ' Dohm was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the service of the Prussian king in 1779 , was particularly distinguished by the minister Von Herzberg , enjoyed the confidence and esteem of Frederic , and repeatedly took part in the most important transactions . He continued to gain respect under the two succeeding kings of Prussia . He was one of the Prussian ambassadors at the VOL . XXVI. - NO. 59. // Congress of Rastadt , and when that Congress was interrupted by war and the murder of two French envoys , he was selected by the whole diplomatic corps to draw up the account of these atrocities . The province , in which he was employed in 1806 , having fallen into the hands of the French , he was commanded by his sovhreign to remain at his post , that he might assist in alleviating the misfortunes of the vanquished . In the following years he was on diplomatic business at Warsaw , at Paris , and afterwards , as a permanent envoy from the king of Westphalia , at the court of Dresden . He obtained leave to retire in 1810 , and , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devoted himself to letters and his history . We must mention to his honor , that as early as 1781-3 he pub-. lished a work of great merit , and in a tolerant spirit , on the improvement of the civil condition of the Jews . The work , of which we are to give an account , is written with sober judgment and great accuracy . It has a peculiar and permanent value , as it is drawn directly from the best sources , which to most persons were nnknown or inaccessible . Thus several treaties , never before published , have been brought to light from the Prussian archives ; and on subjects of Russian politics the author had all the valuable aid , that could be gained from Count G6rz , the eminent Prussian minister at Petersburg . For instance , the account given by Dohm of the origin of the armed neutrality was derived from him , and sufficiently substantiated by an appeal to written documents . We may add , that the work of Dohm is esteemed , by those of his countrymen most competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed in it , for the trustworthy views it contains of many remarkable men and of important events , and for the clearness of its style . It was also acceptable to the Prussian court , a part of it being dedicated by permission to the present king . From the character of the contents of the work , containing many distinct accounts of perfidy and injustice on the part of the despotic rulers of the north of Europe , we think this circumstance is strong evidence in favor of the historical accuracy of these Memoirs . ' It is an acknowledgement of their truth on the part of the only persons having any interest to disprove it . Dohm is especially careful in his search after authorities , and where he does not succeed in obtaining those that are perfectly satisfactory , omits to treat the topic . // The materials for a more copious notice of Dolirn 's public services are contained in the Preface to the history . We pass them by , as they have nothing of general importance , and we have already , we trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good intentions of our historian , as well as in his means of information . The Memoirs ' are introduced ( vol. . pp. 3-22 ) with . a general sketch of Frederic* s eventful reign . Bred in the school of adversity , the character of Frederic had already been tried and influenced by affliction , before he began to rule . He found his kingdom in good condition , a treasure , which his father 's parsimony had accumulated , and an army , which his father 's love for fine soldiers had nourished , protected , and spared . In a few months , the Austrian emperor Charles the Sixth having died , the youthful Maria Theresa succeeded ; and Frederic at once pounced upon the helpless empress , and profiting by her misfortunes and her weakness ( not of mind , for her heart was pure and her will firm ) , he wrung from her Silesia and the county of Glatz . Having thus far succeeded , Frederic was content ; he would be considered  --  a conqueror from principle ; he took what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but formed no schemes of unlimited conquest . During this period Frederic conducted himself , not as the member of an empire , but as an independent monarch . He took no pains to get friends ; he had confidence in himself . A minister at the German diet he deemed no better " than a mastiff baying the moon . " The seven years ' war , from 1756 to 1763 forms the second period of Frederic 's history . During this war he was forced , almost single-handed to bear up against Austria , France , Russia , and Sweden , which were united for his destruction . The peace of Hubertsberg - made Frederic 's glory , like his kingdom , safe against attacks . The magnanimity and energy , which he displayed during the war , inspired admiration ; and new moral power was imparted to the nation he governed . In the season of peace , which ensued , Frederic was actively and zealously engaged to heal the woqnds of his kingdom . During the whole war he himself had contracted no debts now in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sources of gain , promoted industry , and in fact enabled Prussia to recover from its losses , before other governments had // 288 April , become aware of the extent of the sufferings of their subjects . During the war Peter the Third of Russia , immediately on his accession , had joined Frederic ; and the strange sight had been seen of troops marching from a hostile camp to the quarters of those , who but the day before had been counted enemies . Now in peace , the Prussian king succeeded in establisbing friendly relations with Catharine the Second . A repeated personal interview with the Austrian emperor Joseph the Second , in 1769 and 1770 , promoted an approximation of their several interests ; and the division of Polaid was destined to cement their union by crime . The idea of this division did not , however , originate with Frederic . He entered into it readily and fully ; but it was the Austrian Kaunitz , who first made an encroachment on the limits of the republic . In the Appendix to this volume ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the negotiation , which led to the fatal result of the division of Poland . The materials for writing such an account did not exist in print till 1810 , when they were published by Count von G6rz ( who was the Prussian ambassador at Petersburg shortly after the division ) , but they nre neither well arranged , nor correctly printed . The collection has for its title , M6moires et Actes Autentiques relatifs aux N*gociations , qui out pr*c*d'ies le Partage de la Pologne , tir6s du Portefenille d ' un ancien Ministre du 1 8*me Sii*cle. 1810 . , This volume , printed at Weimar , contains the letters and memoirs exchanged between the sovereigns , and the official reports of the ministers , employed in the ' negotiations . Our limits will not permit us to give a copious analysis of the facts , here collected ; yet some we must adduce , to show our readers something of the nature of European diplomacy . It will be remembered that in 1770 and the following years , Russia was at war with the Porte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of Turkey . Frederic was bound by his alliance to preserve friendship with Russia , but at the same time discerned how adverse to his own interest would be the increase of Russia . The affair of Poland became entangled with this war in the East . On the sixth of July , 1771 , the Austrian ambassador Von Thugut signed at Constantinople a secret convention with Turkey , by which Austria , taking advantage of the necessities of the Porte , made // valuable acquisitions of money , land , and commercial privi .. leges , and in consideration of these advantages , promised jointly with the Porte to compel Russia to return all the Turkish provinces she had conquered , and to secure the independence and freedom of the repuhlic of Poland , which would then he a wall hetween Russia and the Porte . Kaunitz made it a condition , that this convention should be kept a secret , and for excellent reasons . All the while that in his negotiations with the Porte he was assuming such obligations of hostility to Russia , he was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised , with certain conditions , to use his influence to procure for Russia an advantageous peace . Meantime the convention was kept a secret for several months ; and Austria received a very acceptable strip of land as well as a large sum of money , very welcome to an exhausted treasury . in the middle of the year 1770 Austrian troops entered Poland , and under pretence of setting up pillars to mark the bounds of Hungary , assumed a large tract of the republic , and kept advancing further and further , all the time making assurances to the Polish king of a great love of justice . This was the beginning of the division of Poland . Occasion had also been seized by Frederic of causing his troops to enter certain other Polish districts . The government of Poland appealed to Catharine , believing the empress would at least reserve to herself the right of oppressing that country . These complaints were made to her in 1772 , just at the time , when Prince Henry of Prussia was making the empress a visit , to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey . She communicated to him the intelligence she had received of the operations of Kaunitz , adding , that Poland seemed to be a country , where it was only necessary to stoop , to pick up what one would . If Austria chose to take a piece of that country , the neighbors had as good a right to do so too . ' Prince Henry seized on the idea with eagerness , developed at once a plan for the division of Poland , and having gained the approbation of the empress , communicated the scheme to his brother . Frederic and Catharine were soon agreed . And now it became the policy of Kaunitz , who began the business , to play the part of a coquette , and to make his partners in the robbery entreat him to join in the plunder . This he did , partly to avoid the odium of having started* so disgrace- // 290 April , ful a scheme , and partly to quiet Maria Theresa 's scruples of conscience . She afterwards gave an assurance , that Kaunitz had in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act contrary to his true character . The monarch may have been honest in this assertion ; but if so , Kauuitz was an accomplished hypocrite . Kaunitz first declared that the attempt at a division of Poland would lead to interminable perplexities . Frederic saw through him at once , and told the Russian court , that they might certainly count on Austria . Kaunitz next endeavored to get the first proposal to be made by Russia ; and nothing having been communicated , he at last grew impatient , and in October of 1771 he determined to bring the Russian court to an explanation . For this purpose he assured the Russian ambassador , Prince Gallitzin , that the terms of peace with the Porte proposed by Catharine , though more moderated , were yet such as Austria could not support . He next suggested proposals , which he declared himself ready to advocate , but which he well knew the empress would reject . Yet , be added , Austria could offer no assistance , unless Russia would guaranty the integrity of Poland , and promise never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other power . But though the indivisibility of Poland was an essential point , he continued , that ' he was nevertheless determined to reassume a piece of land , which bad formerly belonged to Hungary , but had been mortgaged to Poland . The old constitution , he declared , was to be maintained , but it might still receive such modifications , as the interests of the neighboring countries required . The drift of this declaration was well understood in St Petersburg . Count Panin commanded the Russian ambassador to reply , that it was a contradiction for Austria to maintain the integrity of Poland , and yet take a piece without the consent of the republic ; that Russia and Prussia likewise had ancient claims to part of the territory of Poland ; and that justice and the preservation of the balance of power required of Austria to consent , that the three courts should consult together respecting the nature and extent of their claims . Immediately on receiving this communication in January , 1772 , all the scruples of Kaunitz vanished as to the conditions of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty counsel , that Catharine should first make much more // severe requisitions than she designed to insist upon , to which Austria might earnestly object . Then by degrees the terms being made milder , as if by Austrian influence , both powers were to unite in pressing them upon the Porte . He begged to know , what part of Poland Russia and Prussia claimed , recommended the most intim*itte intercourse on the subject , and the most speedy termination of the negotiations . He also recommended profound secrecy in the transaction . Lastly , he added , that if they could not get precisely equal parts in Poland , there was a neighbor , who had too much land , and might be made to yield some of it . When Gallitzin , surprised by this last hint , said , there was no such neighbor , unless it were the Porte , Kaunitz said plainly , that it was the Porte he meant . This plan for jointly plundering Turkey as well as Poland was made just six months after the convention which was mentioned above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Porte , till all its possessions should be recovered . Of that convention the English , some how or other , had obtained a copy , and made haste to transmit it to Petersburg . It arrived there just at the time , when this new proposition of Kaunitz was received . Thus all confidence in Kaunitz was at an end ; and the Russian ambassador at Vienna was charged to watch his motions with the most jealous mistrust and to repose no faith in his word . It soon became plain that it was the design of Kaunitz to enlarge Austria , if he could , as well by taking from Turkey as from Poland . Meantime the negotiations were continued , and on the fifth of August , 1772 , the final agreement was signed at Petersburg by the ministers of the three powers . The king of Poland declared , he would sooner cut off his right hand , than sign the act of cession ; but he did sign it , and his hand remained whole . The three powers guarantied to each other their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however their interest might otherwise divide them , they would at all times and under all circumstances make a common cause of the defence of their acquisitions . The fourth and last period of Frederic 's reign was distinguished by deeds of public virtue , which had a wide and most salutary influence on the condition of Germany . He labored assiduously and with entire success for the independence of // the several sovereignties of the empire . At the head of the Austrian state there now stood an ambitious prince , emulous of the distinction which Frederic had acquired , and threatening the liberties of the neighboring states . The whole course of the contest respecting the Bavarian succession is related by Dohm with great distinctness and a thorough knowledge of all the men concerned in it , and all the interests that were at issue . To follow him in his narration is not permitted us . We refer the student of history to the work itself , undoubtedly a leading authority for this whole subject , to which we are able to devote but a small space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1777 Maximilian Joseph , Elector of Bavaria , died through the want of skill of a physician . He left no children , and with him his branch of a princely family ended . According to the feudal law the other branch of the family , which still flourished in the Palatinate , was entitled to the inheritance . The next heir was Charles Theodore , a man of vile character , and likewise without legitimate children . The Austrian emperor deemed this a fit occasion to possess himself of Bavaria , and immediately caused his troops to enter the territory . Charles Theodore was abject enough to agree to the Austrian demands ; and Joseph the Second imagined himself secure of gaining quiet possession of what Austria had long coveted . The heir of Charles Theodore was Charles , duke of Deux Ponts ; his assent to the encroachments of Austria seemed now alone necessary , and every thing was done to win him . In this state of things Frederic interposed , by a series of admirably conducted negotiations , in which Count Gorz laid the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deux Ponts to decided opposition , and took upon himself the guaranty of the rights of the duke to the Bavarian succession , against all unjust claims of the court of Vienna . Frederic was now justified in making representations to the Austrian government . That government was at this epoch directed by Wenzel Anton , Prince of Kaunitz-Rittberg . He was a statesman of great understanding and extensive experience in public business , a friend and patron of science and the arts. * it was he , who devised the union between France // and Austria , by which in 1756 a new political system was established on the continent of Europe . Afterwards he also began the division of Poland . He was bold in designing , and crafty in executing . He could veil his plans in impenetrable secrecy ; and was a master in the arts of hypocrisy . Superior to base selfishness , he honored and rewarded talents and merit , where he was not himself in danger of being eclipsed . His good opinion of his own capacity was unlimited . His great object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed the first in Europe , and to be himself the first man in that state . Whatever promoted these views was acceptable to him ; he troubled himself little about justice . His manners were marked by haughty condescension and sometimes by striking irregularities ; all which served to elevate him in the minds of the many . Maria Theresa had unlimited confidence in his sagacity , and her son and associate in the empire never dared to oppose the man , who had gained the name of being the greatest statesman of Europe . The Prussian ministers at this time were Herzberg and Finbrenstein . The latter was a man of experience and great respectability . The former was deeply versed in the relations and rights of the several European states ; and those of Prussia he knew in the most minute detail . His knowledge was always at his command . His mind was lively and active ; his style of writing clear , simple , and convincing ; his activity and industry boundless ; his sentiments noble . Love of country was a passion with him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which he loved to dwell on the proofs afforded by history . On the other hand he was often deficient in prudence and secrecy ; and sometimes incurred the displeasure of Frederic , by pressing views which the king did not approve . Frederic was himself the immediate agent in public affairs . Having resolved on his course and taken the necessary measures without consulting any one , he then committed to his ministers , especially to Herzberg , the task of conducting the negotiations with Vienna . The claims made by Austria were subjected to long and learned investigations , and their injustice copiously exposed . Attempts were made to bribe Frederic not to interfere , by promising to permit him to increase his dominions in some similar way ; but the Prussian king was not to be moved from his purpose . // Of the war which ensued , the renewed negotiations for peace , the continued hostilities , and the final restoration of peace , an account is given in the first volume ( pp. 137-*5O ) . The empress Maria Theresa , anxious for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling averse to war , sent is special message to Frederic , expressing her earnest desire to come to a mutual understanding . She hoped , ' such was her message , that it grieved the king not less than herself , that they should thus pluck out each other 's hair , which age had already whitened . ' Still reconciliation was not easy , for the only terms which Austria proposed were such as Frederic peremptorily rejected . Meantime France and Russia were led to take an interest in the event of the war . France was the ally of Austria , but yet in secret averse to the increase of that power . Russia had been prevented by the war with the Porte , from taking an active part in the Bavarian affairs . Finally the peace of Kainardgi was concluded ; and Catharine the Second was at liberty to interfere . She immediately did so , and with good effect . So wonderfully are the destinies of nations , even in the remotest lands , interwoven ; whether Bohemia and Moravia , Saxony or Silesia should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted between Petersburg and Constantinople . It was necessary , that the recognition of a Tartar Chan by the Porte should precede the preservation of the patrimony of a German princely house . ' Austria , however , retained by the peace a part of the land it had claimed . The whole extent , at first taken possession of , amounted to about five thousand square miles ; Austria retained about eight hundred ; and Maria Theresa could hardly for-. give the king of Prussia , cc m*c1iant komme , as she called him , for wresting from her the remainder . Frederic thus secured to himself the applause of Europe and the gratitude of Germany . He returned Ao the careful administration of his kingdom , * and , as though he had done nothing for fame , began extensive reforms ; and , as the greatest and best of his efforts , caused a code to be prepared , by which equal justice should be administered in all parts of his dominions , and the interests of separate districts reconciled and assimilated . The work was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empress was gratified at seeing Austria somewhat humbled , and checked in its attempts at iiggrandizement . She was also pleased at having acquired a right to interfere in the concerns of Germany ; a right which Peter the Great had designed to gain . For Catharine had become a guarantee of the new peace of Teschen ; and one of the articles of that peace confirmed that of Westphalia . Of this last , therefore , and consequently of the German constitution , Catharine became a guarantee . Catharine the Second had a lively mind , and a strong desire to distinguish herself by extraordinary deeds ; and her mother gave to this ambition a political direction. * When Grand Princess , she found little satisfaction in intercourse with her husband , and was very much restrained by the empress Elizabeth . In the solitude to which she was thus driven she cultivated her mind ; ancient and modern history , and the best works of the English and French on politics , were her favorite subjects of study . She busied herself with vast ideas , and loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Gdrz ; the Prussian envoy at St Petersburg , she is described as one , who united amiable qualities with greatness , and , superior to her sex in other respects , yet preserved its weakness in being fond of praise and flattery . Fortune had heaped updri her its choicest favors ; for eighteen years she had been the sovereign of the vastest empire ; beside the flatterers that surrounded her at home , she had been caressed *nd flattered by all foreign courts ; and circumstances having assigned her so brilliant a part , it was impossible to say anything to her in the way of admiration too extravagant or too pointed . She possessed in the greatest degree the art of dissimulation ; and no one could tell , what impression was actually made upon her mind . She was , moreover , extremely jealous of her son , and quite as much so of the Grand Princess . Count Panin ( we draw the characteristics from the memoir-of G6rz ) was one of the first statesmen of Russia , and peculiarly worthy of attention to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Catharine and Frederic . He was kind , generous , dibonnaire ; fond of pleasures , especially of horses and the theatre ; he was conscious of possessing great knowledge on the different relations of the European // political system , was communicative , and met with cheerfulness all attempts to gain his acquaintance . He hated Prince Potemkin , could not brook those who courted that favorite , and on this point was even suspicious . Prince Potemkin was undoubtedly the most powerful man in Russia . He had genius and talents , but was little suited to conciliate either love or esteem . The Grand Duke , the Count Panin , and other noblemen of the empire detested him . He was proud of his regiment , which he esteemed the finest in the universe ; and prided himself on his skill in regulating cavalry . Another subject to which he gave much attention , was the ceremonies of the Greek church ; which he was fond of rendering peculiarly brilliant. * In the long series of personal favorites of the empress , he alone retained unlimited influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first offered himself to her attention in the time of the revolution in 1762 , and having once made himself observed by the bold .. ness of his deportment and his person , he used every art to excite an interest in her . Being once admitted to the imrne-. diate circle of her society , he employed all the resources of a courtier to overthrow his rivals , especially the Orlows . He was the avowed favorite from 1776 , and confirmed his power over Catharine by withdrawing himself from time to time , and then returning again as it pleased his humor . By persuading Catharine that his services were indispensable to her security , rather than by the influence of attachment , he gained entire sway over the empress and the state . For Catharine knew very well that her authority , which had been founded on crimes , was impatiently borne by a great part of her subjects , and she deemed it therefore necessary to have at her side a man of fearful energy , capable of inspiring terror , and destroying every thought of opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potemkin , and to establish her own safety through him , she conferred on him unlimited command . The use which he made of it may have caused the empress herself at times to tremble . Singular qualities he must certainly have possessed , to maintain this power for sixteen years against all adversaries and rivals till his death , and he must have been favored by singular circumstances ; but un // blushing impudence on his part secured this influence over the feminine weakness of Catharine . Potemkin had no distinguished talents as a commander ; yet the whole army was under his control ; and all the generals of greatest experience and fame were subject to his caprice . He understood but imperfectly the foreign relations of the empire or the wants of the interior ; and yet it was he , who dictated to the vanity of the empress the measures to be adopted within her immense empire or towards foreign powers . He had no elevated ambition of any kind ; it never occurred to him , that he could do good to mankind by wisely guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew of nothing nobler than the honors that dazzle the beholder ; his whole soul was in the gratification of his vanity , and this he would sometimes do by pretending indifference . He would deny himself nothing ; he would gratify all his whims ; and he would have it known that he could do so . This was to him the great purpose of life . He disregarded all distinctions of birth , or rank , or wealth , and was always bent on showing that he was the only powerful man . Frederic the Second once directed his ambassador to offer Poternkin his influence in gain-. ing for him the crown of Poland ; Potemkin replied , that he had never dreamed of such a thing ; and did not respect the Polish nation enough to be willing to be their king . He treated the most distinguished foreigners with contumely , and listened to the proposals of foreign ambassadors with the con-. temptuous air of one who but just condescends to hear the requests of his inferiors and dependents . No rank secured the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went so far as to beat the empress . It is certain , that he often opposed her loudly , and did on purpose the very opposite of what she had desired . Sated with pleasure , he lavished the public treasure with boundless prodigality in the gratification of his caprices . Though Catharine anticipated all his wants , that could be divined , and gave him incredibly large sums of money , he would yet turn to the gratification of his will money entrusted to him for public purposes , and would even forge orders of the empress on the treasury , to get pos-. session of money , and this when he knew it to be peculiarly needed by the state . And Catharine bore all this . Potemkin took bribes from foreign states to promote their objects ; though his views were so contracted , that he could not judge // of the true interests of the empire . Possessed of immense treasures , which he carelessly squandered at the gaming-table or for any fancy , he was accustomed never to pay those , who furnished him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an order came to supply the wants of Potemkin . He had no sentiment of mercy in his nature . He would torment without any object , as if to show that he could do it with impunity . He had long and earnestly desired the Prussian order of the Black Eagle , but as it was sent him rather later than he expected , he received it with a disdainful air , saying , he was much obliged to the king , but really , he already had such a host of that sort of distinctions , he did not know how he should be able to arrange them all . ' When Frederic learnt , that Poternkin was aiming at the dukedom of Courland , he offered to assist him ; but Potemkin very coolly replied , that Courland was not enough to satisfy him ; and , besides , if he wanted it , he could take it himself , without giving the king any trouble about it . And he used on all occasions to set in the most ridiculous light Frederic 's strict economy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the very best authority , that Potemkin formally proposed to Frederic a second division of Poland , saying the first division was mere child 's play ; the whole should have been divided at once ; it would not have caused greater clamor . ' Frederic rejected the scheme , on the ground of its injustice , and adopted in his order in cabinet the opinion drawn up by G6rz , and developing the subject in a moral point of view . To Potemkin the answer of Frederic was wholly unexpected ; he read the king 's letter three several times and then gave it back to the Prussian minister with the words , I never should have believed , that King Frederic had such romantic notions . He cared as little for human life as for money , if the waste of it pleased his capricious humor . Catharine wished to honor him after the manner of antiquity , and in 1787 gave him the appellation of the Taurian . In Russian affairs he did whatever he pleased . If things of moment were sometimes decided without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere , and was willing to let them go . The single affair of the armed neutrality , of which an account follows , was decided contrary to his intentions . But the reason was , the docision // depended on political knowledge , of which Potemkin had little , and which Panin possessed abundantly , and knew how to use with skill . Potemkin has been called a man of colossal greatness . But he was in no wise great . His mind was low and coarse . He began his career of success like the other favorites , chance having made him known to the empress ; and he confirmed his power by an excess of impudence , and an entire insensibility to moral feeling and to honor . He cared neither for exercising a wide influence over the destinies of men , nor for gaining an immortality of fame ; but wished to live in the midst of external splendor , have all men near him at his feet , and prove himself to be the man who needed to fear nothing . The success of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of her own merits and the resources of her empire . The deference and respect , manifested by other courts to her as a woman , were interpreted by her as acknowledgments of her superior power ; and she would perhaps have practised no restraint towards others but for the fear of being checked in the execution of her great design . That design , by which she expected to render her reign eminently illustrious , and establish an immortality of glory for her own name , was the establishing of a Greek or Oriental empire . During her life it was *ber intention herself to govern this new empire , together with liar monstrous possessions in the North , and then to bequeath the latter to her grandson Alexander , and the former to Constantine . The names of the children were tokens of the high destiny that was preparing for them . Constantine , from his birth , was treated as the future emperor of Greece and the East . He was baptized according to the rites of the Oriental Greek Church , which differ somewhat from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archipelago . Accident prevented his being nursed with Grecian milk , but Grecian sounds were the first which he heard . He was called the Star of the East , and while yet a child , Greeks were admitted to his presence to do him homage . The glorious peace of Kudschutz-Kainardgi was negotiated just sixty-three years after the disgraceful one , which Peter the First had made to save himself from ruin . This seemed a good omen . Moreover , the religious , warlike enthusiasm of the Ottomans seemed to be extinct . The rulers were educated within the seraglio to indulgence , not to the labors of governing . // The sultans were dependent on their ministers of state ; and these , again , elevated from the very dregs of the populace , and destitute of all political knowledge , owed their security to the Janizaries . In the provinces the regents were almost independent ; and little of the money , which they collected , flowed into the public treasury . The numerous Greeks hated the Turkish government and were ripe for insurrection . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European powers were continually advancing in the arts of civil polity and of war . These views were represented to Catharine in their strongest light . Yet there were facts , which proved them to be exaggerated . If the internal administration of Turkey was so bad , how could the empire continue to exist and array such formidable armies against its enemies ? If the pachas were almost entirely free , and if little of their revenues found its way to the Grand Seignior , where were the immense sums obtained to defray the cost of the naval battles and the land service ? If despotic caprice controlled property , how came it that agriculture , mechanic arts , and manufactures throve in Turkey , and produced what formed the chief articles of an important commerce , which European nations were emuions of sharing ? And can it be conceived , that these nations would continue trade with a country , in which the disregard of justice took away all security from the capital employed in business ? The condition of the ministers of state is the least comfortable ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a private man can even in Turkey enjoy the fruit of his labors , and suffer less oppression than in many an European state . The natives are strongly attached to their country , which they call the land of freedom ; and if business leads them to pass even years in foreign lands , they are accustomed to return as soon as possible to the land of their birth . It has even been asserted by the head of a large commercial house , which carried on much business with the Levant and with Russia , that debts due in the former were esteemed incompara-* bly more secure than those in the latter , not only from greater confidence reposed in individuals , but also because the Turkish administration was more impartial and more prompt . To this it must be added , that the writers on the subject always advise the Europeans to endeavor to vanquish the Turks by superiority in tactics , and to avoid the contest between man // and man , as one , in which the European soldier is sure to be worsted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will serve to explain the partial success of the Russians in their attempts to banish the Turks from Europe . It was the fleldmarshal Munich , who , more than any other , cherished in the mind of Catharine the design of subverting the Turkish empire . This celebrated general , called by Frederic the Second , the Eugene of the North , was in the Russian service even as early as under Peter the First ; arid during the reign of Anna he was the terror of the Ottomans . He lost his influence under Elizabeth and for twenty years was banished to Siberia . Yet there his mind was brooding over great designs in his exile , and prepared a scheme for the entire ruin of the Turkish power . In 1762 he was recalled by Peter the Third , and now , an old man of seventy-nine years , he reappeared at a court , from which nearly all his contemporaries had passed away , with the fire and ambition of vigorous manhood . Catharine employed him for the very purposes , which he promoted under Peter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The empress was so charmed with his conversation and reposed such confidence in his experienced counsel , that she usually passed an hour every day with him . It was now that he unfolded his plan , which , but for Austria 's ill success and the disastrous peace of Belgrade , would have been executed under Anna , and which was now to lend lustre to the administration of Catharine . The thought took deep root in the mind of the empress , and was confirmed by the success of her generals in the first war with Turkey . Full of hope , she no longer concealed her ideas . She would playfully speak of the ancient Greek tragedies , which were to be enacted anew on the sta* of Athens by Grecian players ; and medals were designed , if not executed , on the taking of Constantinople . All Europe applauded her for her design . No one asked if it was just , or if Russian despotism was less oppressive than the Turkish . Religious sympathy was awakened ; a hostile feeling to a foreign race revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , and it seemed the more splendid and pleasing , that the beautiful design was to be executed by a woman . The tocsin of the kings ' was sounded by Voltaire ; * Dohm . Vol . II . pp. 365-381. voi .. xxvx. - *o. 59. 39 // and be advocated the war of extermination of the Turks , sometimes with fanatical fervor , sometimes with jests and gallantry . Barbarians , ' said he , who despise tle fine arts and shut up the women , deserve to be exterminated ; and it is meet for a heroine to chastise them for their contempt of the fair . ' I really think , ' wrote Catbarine to Voltaire , I must soon go to some university to study Greek . ' But if the many applauded , the cabinets opposed . England , though otherwise friendly to Russia , could not favor the banishment of the Turks from Europe ; and the union of the Russian and Austrian cabinets aroused the attention of France . For France was interested in maintaining the Porte , because it could furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more , for the immense injury , which the French commerce would sustain by the ruin of Turkey . Is there another example in all history of commercial advantages con-. ceded , such as were secured to France by the Porte ? Into all the Turkish possessions the French might import and export every kind of raw or manufactured product , paying a duty nominally of three , actually of two and a half per cent . Not only other nations , the Turks themselves paid a double , and on some things , a threefold greater duty . The coasting trade on the Turkish coasts was carried on in French ships , free from any duty or tax whatever . The French residing in Turkey , stood under the sole jurisdiction of their own state . The com .. merce with France was constantly on the increase . At the beginning of the eighteenth century the exports from Turkey to France amounted to about two millions of livres ; but in the middle of that century to twenty-two millions ; and in the year 1786 they amounted to thirty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France Spain entered into a commercial treaty with the Porte , and promised , it is said , to permit no vessels hostile to the same to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar ; and France was even preparing to break its alliance with Austria , and renew its relations of intimacy with Prussia . The diplomatic relations of the European powers were at this time exceedingly curious . Prussia had an intimate alliance with Russia , and having faithfully fulfilled its obligations in the first war between Russia and Turkey , believed itself now fairly entitled to a reciprocity of favor , and was reluctant to relinquish its claim to this . The disastrous union between // Austria and France still continued . And now the doctrine of elective affinities , with a slight modification , was to prove itself good in politics . A new ingredient is added in the Porte . Forthwith Austria unfolds itself from the embrace of France , and falls into the toils of Russia ; France , left thus alone , endeavors to form a new combination with Prussia , which must first set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stood in the way of this last combination , we shall endeavor concisely to explain . The principal aim of France was , to defeat the schemes of aggrandizement formed by Russia and Austria ; the principal aim of Frederic , to dissolve the union between France and Austria . France wished to retain its union with Austria , but to prevent its aggrandizement ; and for that purpose was willing to act jointly with Prussia in a protest addressed to the court of Vienna . Frederic sincerely desired a union with France , his natural ally , with whom he believed himself really to have common interests ; but he was too cautious to trust himself in an alliance , before France should have had a rupture with Austria . He was unwilling , that an apparent union between his kingdom and France should be made use of in negotiations with the imperial courts ; since he would in that way lose the benefit of his alliance with Russia , and *ain nothing . He had no fear that the empress and the emperor would succeed against Turkey ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make themselves formidable by the resistance of despair ; partly because he knew the incapacity of the Russian military commanders ; and , most of all , because he counted on mutual jealousy , which , in case of partial success , would soon beget a quarrel about the distribution of the spoil , and so take it all out of their hands . Indeed the Prussian king was , on the whole , pleased , that the imperial courts , since they , would have war , should turn their attention to the East . Meantime Frederic used every means to avoid appearing to counteract the schemes of Catharine . But alas for the chances of diplomacy ! He commanded his charge d ' affaires at Constantinople , Baron von Gaifron , to be exceedingly circumspect , but not to lose a good opportunity of stirring up the Porte to resist the ceding of the Crimea to Russia , provided he could do so without danger of being discovered . Accordingly the envoy indited a m6moire for the most private edification of the Turkish minister , // and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drogoman , being bribed , gave the m6moire to the Russian ambassador , who soon announced the affair at St Petersburg . Catharine , without communicating the particular circumstances , remonstrated with her faithful ally Frederic , that his charge d ' affaires had been acting against her interests . Frederic dis- claimed all participation in the business , recalled Von Gaifron , investigated the matter , and found nothing , that he thought could be known to Catharine to justify her complaints . Still she insisted upon them , and Frederic , to show at least his own innocence , turned Von Gaffron out of office , and put him in prison . Such are the rewards of European diplomacy . Its morality resembles the Spartan principle about stealing . To play a double part is honorable and the patriotic discharge of duty ; but to be discovered is a crime and a disgrace . While negotiations were conducted with careful reserve between the Prussian and French governments , the courts of Vienna and Petersburg were not less active , and hardly more successful . To Catharine the expulsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second it was a secondary consideration , to be made subservient to his views on Bavaria and elsewhere in the West . He acceded to the Russian policy to oblige the empress , that so the empress might in turn favor him . He did not believe success against the Turks so sure or easy as was imagined ; and acknowledged also , that the Austrian interest would suffer from the capture of Constantinople by his northern rival . The nearer the two imperial courts came to the execution of their schemes , the greater difficulties rose between them . Potemkin meant Moldavia and Wallachia for himself ; and so mighty were Potemkin 's whims , that Joseph did not dare to utter a wish for their possession . Moreover Catharine deemed it enough to restore to Austria the provinces which it had lost in the peace of Belgrade ; the idea of an Eastern empire was her own ; the affair of getting possession of Turkey was her speculation , and in that business she wanted no partners . Thus kind words and promises of friendship were frequent ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance between Austria and Russia in 1783 produced extraordinary effects . The Porte was alarmed , and Catharine joyfully , and with really wonderful art , turned the fear of he Turks to her advantage in negotiations . For all that she could thus gain was her own ; her treaties with the // Porte were not Austria 's affair ; that power had nothing to do with her private concerns . And thus without striking a blow , and without giving Austria a chance at any advantage whatever , she constantly turned to her own account all the benefit , which could be derived from the menace of a joint invasion . And the chief advantage she thus gained was the possession of the Crimea . The convention of March 10 , 1779 , confirmed in the most solemn manner the . independence of this sovereign state . No foreign power should under any circumstances whatever demand of it an account of its actio*ns ; Russia and the Porte , each promised , by all that they acknowledged as holy , never , under any pretence , to interfere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recognised , but was never to extend to other relations . Should either party by any unforeseen accident become entangled in the concerns of the Tartars , it was agreed , that no step should be taken by it , without consulting the other . Notwithstanding these obligations , Catharine took part in the troubles , which soon broke out in the Crimea . The new Chan , Schahin Gheray , was devoted to the Russian empress , and trusting in her protection , imposed new burdens , violated established usages , and pretended to be greatly enamored of European culture . To diffuse this in all its lustre , ( shall we be believed as we write ? ) he formed the resolution of having the large French Encyclopedia translated into the Tartar language . His authority did not last long enough to execute his purpose ; and when Catharine was mistress of the destiny of the Tartars , in a better spirit of toleration , she had a beautiful edition of the Koran printed for the benefit of her Mahoinedan subjects . The Tartars revolted ; and refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gheray in his stead . The Russians had not yet withdrawn their troops ; the Turks , therefore , felt themselves justified in sending troops to Taman , to relieve those who were suffering for their religious faith . This served Russia as a pretext for hostilities ; and Prince Potemkin undertook the guidance of affairs . Blood and booty were the watchwords . Thousands of families were destroyed , or carried away into bondage in remote Russian provinces ; till finally the Chan and some of the royal tribe declared , that , convinced that happiness could be found only under the mild government of the empress , they submitted // themselves and their nation unconditionally and for ever to her authority . ' On the eighth of April , 1783 , the empress issued her manifesto , that for sundry reasons therein given , she had been induced to receive under her authority the peninsula of the Crimea , Kuban , and the island Taman . Her new subjects were exhorted to fidelity and obedience . ' The oath of alle-. giance to the empress was administered ; every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time ; and thus the opposition was soon done away . The Chan , who had betrayed his nation , received for three or at most for four years the payment of the pension , that had been promised him . When that ceased to be paid , he fled to Turkey , and was executed in the island of Rhodes . As if nothing had happened , Catharine directly proposed a treaty of commerce and amity with Turkey ; the members of the Turkish ministry were terrified or bribed , and a treaty was actually closed in June of the same year , of which treaty the conditions were in an unequal degree favorable to Russia . Hardly had this been effected , when she proceeded still fur-. ther , and demanded of the Porte a recognition of her sovereignty over the Crimea ; threatening war , and Austria joining her in the threat , if she received a refusal . The Porte yielded , and the river Kuban became the acknowledged boundary between the Turkish and Russian empires . Thus Russia tore from the Porte a province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the granary of Constantinople , and as a resource in war , capable of furnishing excellent soldiers . This province was now of vast importance to Russia , for it afforded the means of conducting the most extensive commerce . Catharine and Potemkin both valued it chiefly as the preparation for further conquest . At the mouth of the Dneiper the empress caused a new city , Cherson , to be built , and over one of its gates the inscription was placed in the Greek tongue , This is the way to Constantinople . ' The new conquests received their ancient name , the Tauric Chersonesus , and Potemkin , who had now obtained the appellation of the Taunan , assumed the charge of changing the Tartars into good Russian subjects . In the execution of his office he knew no purpose beyond gratifying his own rapacity and the vanity of the empress . Constitution , manners , and established customs were despised ; justice was made a matter of purchase ; the wealthy were plundered ; many fled ; many were driven into // other Russian provinces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former times the Tartar Chan had joined the Turkish army with fifty thousand well equipped horsemen ; and now , two years after the land had become an integral part of the Russian empire , the census of all the male inhabitants is said to have amounted to but seventeen thousand . Thus far we have followed Dohm . Before leaving this subject , we can not but call to mind the remarkable journey , which four years after , in 1787 , Catharine made to this part of her dominions , and which resembled a continued triumphal procession . Potemkin wished to exhibit proofs of the rapid prosperity of the Chersonesus , and the newly acquired provinces . Palaces were , therefore , erected to be occupied but for a night ; signs of apparent prosperity and contentment were everywhere hung out for show ; towns were built and people assembled to play the part of inhabitants ; then the houses were left vacant , and the same people , having been carried forward by night , showed themselves on the next day , ready to act the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the day ; the plains , over which the Tartars had so recently sped their coursers amidst the loneliness of rude nature and countries occupied by Nomades alone , now resounded with strange notes of revelry , and glittered with all the splendors of imperial magnificence . The deputies of a hundred subject nations stayed the steps of the triumphant conqueror , the new Semiramis , who was come to receive their homage . The king of Poland , too , made his appearance to gaze at the novel spectacle ; and Joseph the Second came all the way from his empire to see the show , and , remaining several days with the empress , the newly built city , Cherson , became gay and brilliant beyond imagination with the splendid flUes , which were given in honor of his arrival . Never had the banks of the Borysthenes been made the scene of such a series of festivals . And here in the solitary city of the desert , intoxicated with triumph , viewing with contempt the withered energies of the Porte , and holding out greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Russian czarina , perfected their scheme for the dissolution of the Turkish empire , and divided in anticipation their future conquests . This was in 1787 . Suppose a prophet had appeared in the midst of their dazzling dreams and magnificent banquets , and // opened to them a glimpse of the coming age . He could have shown them how destiny would laugh their plans to scorn , and mark out a widely different fate for the countries , whose fortunes were the object of their deliberations . He could have shown them the imperial pride of Vienna humbled at the feet of a conqueror , and the crown of Germany cast aside among forgotten diadems ; the lands of Austria diminished , and such as were left to her held , as it were , at the mercy of others ; he could have shown them the palaces of Petersburg filled with terror , the Russian emperor disgraced by frequent defeats and injurious treaties , and finally , after years of anxiety , safety purchased only by sacrificing the ancient metropolis in the very heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cupidity already declared their own , was , excepting for a short period in a remote province , safe from the terrors of war , and preserved its territory undiminished and its honor unimpaired , elevated in fearless security above the wrecks and ruins of the shattered system of Europe . The interest belonging to the history of Russia , during the period when she assumed the rank of the first power of Europe , has induced us to give more attention to this period of Russian history . We return from considering the progress of Russian arms in the South and East , to give some details on a topic , * which is of immediate interest to the United States . England entered upon the war with her colonies without allies . She demanded the assistance of Holland in pursuance of existing treaties . But assistance was refused on the ground that the case to which those treaties were applicable did not yet exist . From no nation could England hope more than from Prussia . It was known that Catharine the Second cherished a predilection for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All insurrections of subjects against their rulers , were by her opposed from principle , and the suppression of them seemed the common cause of rulers . Hence the hope was conceived on the part of the English , that a treaty of al* liance might be closed with her , binding her in the event to render them assistance . This subject was entrusted to Sir James Harris , afterwards Lord Malmesbury , the British minister at St Petersburg , a diplomatist of extensive information and great activity . Panin , the chancellor of the Russian empire , // knew the state of the country too well , its finances exhausted by the war with the Porte , to admit of participating in a dispute carried on in another hemisphere , perhaps to be followed by entangling connexions , and an injury to Russian commerce . Catharine herself was also disinclined to relinquish the free and independent station in which she found herself . Harris , seeing little prospect of gaining his point in a direct way , endeavored to succeed by the influence of Potemkin , whom no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned in the result , once observed to Count Panin , that he feared Poternkin was in the interests of England , as he had received of England fifty thousand rubles . Panin answered , smiling , Potemkin is not a man to be bought for so small a sum . ' And in fact , on inquiry , it proved that he had had not so many rubles , but pounds sterling . By means of Potemkin , Harris proposed to Catharine directly an alliance with England for the reduction of the English colonies , promising in return the assistance of England in any further plans of Russia to subdue the Porte . But it belonged to the chancellor of the empire , from his office , to make an estimate of the tendency of such a proposition , and frame the proper answer to it . Drawing his arguments from the true interests of the Russian state , he demonstrated so clearly , that it was against the welfare of Russia to form such an alliance with England , that the empress was convinced , and the answer given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , the present time , when this power was engaged in war with several powers , was not a proper one for forming an alliance ; Russia desired the restoration of peace ; her threat of taking part in the war would but serve to extend and protract it . ' Harris was in consternation at this answer ; but he received in private from Potemkin , and it is said by some , from the empress herself , assurances of unchanged good will , and an expression of the hope that circumstances would soon admit of her conforming her actions to her wishes . Accident seemed to favor the designs of the English ambassador . Two Russian vessels , laden with corn , and bound to the Mediterranean , were captured by Spanish privateers , under the pretence that they were intended to supply the fortress of Gibraltar . The empress was indignant ; was bent on obtaining singular satisfaction , or , if refused , on avenging herself on Spain by declaring war , and so uniting with England . // These views she communicated to Count Panin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fitted out at Cronstadt , which , in the event of an unsatisfactory answer from Spain , was to join the English . The English envoy was informed of it , and made haste to communicate the good news to his court . Potemkin triumphed in his imagined advantage , gained over the chancellor . The fitting out of the fleet did not long remain concealed from Panin , nor was he in doubt as to its destination . But he determined nevertheless to carry his own views into effect . Far from appearing to oppose the designs of the empress , he declared , that he himself participated in her indignation at Spain , and approved her determination to require satisfaction for the injury done to the free commerce of her subjects and her insulted majesty . Nay , he would go further ; he would even exhort his sovereign to seize this opportunity of solemnly announcing to Europe , that the empress of Russia would in nowise suffer the wars waged between other powers to affect the trade of her subjects . She would promise strict justice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one as an enemy , who should invade the commerce of her subjects while conducted within the limits of justice . Principles so manifestly equitable , added Panin , will meet with universal approbation . The nations had long desired to see them adopted and maintained ; but had desired thus far in vain , as till now no monarch had been possessed at once of sufficient power , and wisdom , and philanthropy to carry them into execution . But these were now united in Catharine , and she had an opportunity of acquiring a new fame , of becoming a lawgiver for the high seas , and so affording property a security , and trade a freedom*such as they never had possessed . Nations would admire her for the mild energy , with which she set bounds to the horrors of war , and future generations acknowledge her as their benefactor . Catharine was completely carried away by these representations . She laid her commands on Panin to prepare a statement of the principles he had developed , to be communicated to the belligerent powers , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time to call on all neutral states to adopt them , and to carry them into effect with their united force . And this was the origin of the famous armed neutrality , which established as a principle , that neutral ships may freely // pavigate from port to port on the coasts of belligerents ; that tree ships make free goods , excepting contraband articles ; that nothing is contraband but arms and military stores ; that no harbor can be considered as under blockade unless that harbor is in fact so effectually blockaded , that no vessel can safely enter it . Thus a system , destined to become so conspicuous in the history of the world , and involving principles of such vast importance in the concerns of commerce , owed its origin to no enlarged conceptions of the maritime rights of nations , and to no wisdom having regard for the general interest and welfare of mankind ; but was the result of the cunning of a statesman , who contrived to give this direction to the vanity of his sovereign , and thus to extricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been placed . Thus , when the mysteries of diplomacy are explained , we find the greatest concerns of public life depending on the irritated pride of an individual . The greatness of the idea which Panin proposed to the empress , consisted in providihg a few distinct and clearly expressed rules for regulating the difficulties , which from time to time had arisen in conducting commerce in seasons of war ; and in uniting all nations for the maintenance of those rules . Even those nations , which were to be benefited the most by the security of the rights of neutrals , had been inconsistent in their demands ; and Holland , for example , had in times of war essentially violated and limited the rights , which in times of its own neutrality it was desirous of asserting in their greatest latitude . Between 1746 and 1750 many Prussian ships , or other property , had been taken by English privateers . Frederic the Second demanded satisfaction , and as this was obstinately refused , he erected at Berlin a tribunal , before which his subjects were commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoined ; and the decisions were regulated by existing contracts , or by public opinion on the acknowledged rights of nations . And then the king satisfied the demands of his subjects out of the debt formerly due to the English by Austria on security in Silesia , and assumed by Frederic in the treaties of Breslau and Dresden , by which Silesia was ceded to Prussia . in 1778 the Danish minister , Count Berustorif , had proposed to the Swedish king , Gustavus the Third , an alliance for the mutual defence of free trade ; // and both had applied to the Russian empress for her coi5peration , which was refused . Thus Panin has the merit , not of originally proclaiming the rights of nations as to free trade , but of having defined those rights in a few distinct propositions , and of , having procured a union of many states for their acknowledgment and support . The manifesto of the empress was delivered at the courts of London , Paris , and Madrid . She had no foreboding of the immense importance of the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . So ignorant was she of commerce , that she flattered herself as having at once vindicated her honor and shown her strong regard for England . Panin took care not to undeceive her ; and through fear of obstacles that might retard or ruin his scheme , he begged the empress would communicate on the subject with no one till the couriers were despatched . The empress promised and kept her word . But she could not refrain from confidentially saying to the English ambassador , that there would soon he delivered in her name to the belligerents a manifesto which would be completely satisfactory to England ; and condescended even to give him leave to communicate thus much to his court . Sir James Harris hastened to communicate the joyous intelligence , and expectation was raised to the utmost . When , but a few days after , he learnt the true nature of the measures that had been taken , so directly opposed to the usurped authority of Great Britain , he could not but be anxious , lest he should he accused at home of inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described ; the disappointment was proportionate to the intense expectation of great advantage . It was with difficulty that the English ministry could be induced to abstain from bitter reproaches , while the king replied to the manifesto by a cold assurance , that he should follow the treaties which existed between himself and Russia , and in following them no cause of complaint could be given to Russian subjects . The courts of France and Spain , on the contrary , were filled with gladness . The satisfaction demanded was promptly given by Spain . The principles of the empress were extolled , and her own merits magnified . The empress began to understand the tendency o* her measures , and , delighted with the glory which she had unconsciously acquired , she acknowledged the wisdom of Panin 's counsel ; gave her earnest attention to // the principles she had established ; and abandoned entirely the thought of an alliance with England . The hope of fixing for ever the doctrine of maritime liberty now divided the thought of Catharine with her scheme for founding an oriental empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her in her design . None adopted her policy with more zeal than Gustavus the Third of Sweden , and in July , 1780 , he announced to the belligerents his intention of strictly following the principles advanced by Catharine . Count Bernstorff , the minister of Denmark , was favorable to England , yet following the true policy which the interest of his country required , he also joined the alliance without delay . It was now the policy of England , at least to prevent , if possible , the accession of Holland to the alliance of the Northern powers . The tardy mode of doing business in the republic delayed its decision till November ; but at last that decision was made , and envoys were already despatched to St Petersburg , when England , feeling that a war with Holland would be the less evil , made a sudden declaration of hostilities . Holland invoked the aid of the allied powers ; and Gustavus proposed a joint and earnest interference in behalf of the republic . England maintained , on the contrary , that Holland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an alliance of neutrals ; offered sundry causes , real or pretended , to justify its declaration of war , and finally succeeded in having the question between itself and the republic referred for consideration to the negotiations for a general peace , to be conducted under the auspices of Russia and Austria . We hardly need call to mind , that the republic suffered in this war a shock , from which it never recovered , and England would concede peace only on the sacrifice of valuable East India possessions . The king of Prussia was invited by Panin to join the neutrality . At first he declined , partly because he did not wish to entangle himself in engagements in his old age , and partly because he was possessed of no maritime power . But afterwards , when Catharine wished to give a more imposing character to the system of neutrality by the addition of Prussia and Austria , Frederic was induced to join it . In the treaties with Austria , the act signed by the empress had no name but her own . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other European powers , to be the first to subscribe to each copy of the treaty ; Catha // rifle s vanity was saved by the exchange of papers , signed each by but one party . Finally the king of the two Sicilies and the queen of Portugal joined the alliance . Thus the Russian empress could glory in the recognition of her princi .. ples by all the larger neutral powers of Europe , that took part in commerce . One thing of importance was indeed wanting ; that the belligerent nations themselves should adopt them in their treaties of peace . The wisdom of Gustavus prompted him to urge a common effort to obtain such an acknowledgment from France and England . But Catharine was at that time no longer guided by Panin , and the proposal was declined . She was content with the empty honor of seeming , in connexion with the German emperor , to have effected the restoration of peace . Every body knows , that the envoys of the two imperial courts exerted , in reality , not the least influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was settled , that they were invited to hear the treaties read and jointly to sign them . It is said , that the Swedes derived the greatest advaniages from the system of neutrality . They made their speculations with the most judgment and greatest activity . Next to theirs the prosperity of the Prussians and Danes was increased . The Austrian Netherlands , also , took advantage of their favorable situation , and much capital that had been idle was put to profitable use . Such are the main points in the history of the armed neutrality . The honor of Russia would have been better established , had its rulers subsequently maintained the same principles with inflexible firmness and undeviating consistency . The volumes of Dohm contain interesting accounts of Maria Theresa , and still more so of the personal character , foreign relations , and domestic policy of Joseph the Second . Our limits permit us to do nothing more than to refer to them . The third volume contains a sketch of Joseph the Second 's designs of aggrandizement by an exchange of the Netherlands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to assure the future tranquillity of the empire , formed an alliance among the German princes for the support and.defence of the German constitution . Never was anything better conceived , or more happily executed . Without any effusion of blood , the designs of Austria were frustrated , and an opposition made , which was sufficient to baffle any future attempts of a // similar nature . The treaties between the German princes were finished and signed little more than a year before Frederic 's death . The last public treaty which Frederic ratified , was one negotiated at the Hague between the Prussian envoy , Von Thulemeyer , and our American plenipotentiaries , Franklin , Adams , and Jefferson . In this treaty , the great principles of the armed neutrality are recognised , and , in case of war , both parties pledge themselves to fit out no privateers* for the purpose of plundering private property . The fourth and fifth volumes of Dohm are occupied particularly with Frederic . The fifth contains an account of the chief works which relate to him , and their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Frederic 's character as a man and as a ruler . But fearing to prolong this article , we do not venture to describe his habits , or draw an estimate of his merits . Yet in leaving the subject , we must say , that the perusal of Dohm 's work has compelled us to think highly of the qualities of Frederic . He was benevolent , and , except where duty demanded severity , mild and forgiving . He was a most laborious man , rising sometimes at two in the morning , and always finishing a good day 's work , before most men had begun . The year was divided into regular parts , to each of which appropriate cares were assigned . So also the day was regularly divided ; the first hours were given to business in his cabinet ; then he attended the military exercises . At twelve he dined ; at nine in the evening retired to rest . His pleasures were few and simple . Study , conversation , music , and the enjoyment of nature were all . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of the theatre . He did not like the chase ; and laughed at the idea that a hunt furnishes an image of war . He rejected the use of cards , as an unworthy waste of time . He always gave some of the day to reading . The society of his wife he never enjoyed ; she spent her time in writing or translating books of devotion . There are two great points , which made Frederic 's reign important to the world . Though he was himself not scrupuIons about seizing what he could get , he still rescued the liberties of Germany from imminent danger , and preserved // Bavaria in the list of independent sovereignties . And though he . had himself no faith in immortality , and hardly knew that there is a God , he yet was an instrument in the hands of Providence for upholding the Protestant religion on the continent of Europe . Had he not succeeded in raising Prussia into the number of the great powers of Europe , the Roman Catholic faith would have been predominant in every important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left without any strong defence in the very land of Luther.
