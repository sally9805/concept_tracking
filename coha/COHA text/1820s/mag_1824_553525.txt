Captain in the 84th Regiment of Foot . London , 1823. pp. 321 . LITTLE was known of New Zealand , till visited by captain Cook in his first voyage round the world , although it had been discovered by Tasman , a Dutch navigator , as early as 1642 . Tasman traversed the eastern coast for several hun-. dred miles , but being attacked by the natives , while at anchor in a bay , he did not go on shore . An old chief told Mr Marsden , that he remembered to have seen three vessels approach the coast before captain Cook 's visit , and said that two of them were cut off , and their crews destroyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit in 1770 , this country was supposed to be part of a great southern continent , but he ascertained that it consisted of two islands , divided by a strait of four or five leagues in breadth . The northern island is six hundred miles long , and on an average about one hundred and fifty broad . The other is nearly as large . Numerous small islands are scattered in the bays , and along he coast , at no great distance from the main land . Cook 's // Strait , which separates the two large islands , is in latitude forty one degrees south , and the western coast of New Zealand is about nine hundred miles southeast of New Holland . Mr Marsden , author of one of the journals now under our notice , has been favorably known to the public during the last ten years , by his zealous and active missionary labors at Port Jackson . He has also superintended a seminary at Parramatta , designed for instructing the natives of the southern isles . In the year 1815 he made his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the chiefs , gained the confidence of the natives , and laid the foundation of a missionary establishment . Four years afterwards he again visited the same country , and took with him three missionaries , and three mechanics , with their families ; and also two native New Zealanders , Tooi and Teeterree , who had been residing in England . He remained three months in the country , travelled over some of the interior districts , and recorded his observations in the journal to which we have alluded . In January , 1820 , his Majesty 's ship Dromedary arrived in New South Wales , with three hundred and sixty nine convicts . When these were debarked , the commander , according to his instructions , proceeded to New Zealand for the purpose of obtaining a return cargo of ship timber . Captain Cook had remarked , that he thought the cowry trees , which he had seen in New Zealand , admirably fitted for masts of the larger classes of ships ; and spars of this description had become so scarce , and commanded so extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the experiment suggested by Cook . The Dromedary was assigned to this employment , and sailed from Port Jackson on the 15th of February . To facilitate the object of the Dromedary 's present service , ' says Captain Cruise , we were accompanied by the Rev. S. Marsden , principal chaplain to the colony of New South Wales , who established some missionaries in New Zealand , and who , from having frequently visited that Island , was considered popular among its inhabitants . He brought on board nine New Zealanders , who were all either chiefs , or the sons of people of that rank . They had been living with him at Parramatta . ' The vessel had a short passage of ten days to New Zealand , and the // natives expressed great joy when they came in sight of their own country , manifesting their delight by antic gestures , running from one part of the vessel to another , and shouting the names of the headlands , and prominent objects on the coast , which successively came into their view . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends from the shore , is thus described by Captain Cruise . Before the ship was brought to , she was surrounded with Canoes , full of the friends and relations of the chiefs we had on board . To salute them , as well as to exhibit the riches they had acquired by their visit to Port Jackson , our New Zealanders began firing their muskets without intermission , and , indeed , so prodigal were they of their powder , that one might presume little of it would remain , after their landing , for the destructive purposes for which they had gone so far to procure it . When their fathers , brothers , &amp;c. were admitted into the ship , the scene exceeded description ; the muskets were all laid aside , and every appearance of joy vanished . It is customary with these extraordinary people to go through the same ceremony upon meeting , as upon taking leave of their friends . They join their noses together , and remain in this position for at least half an hour , during which time they sob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any friends gathered around the person , who has returned , the nearest relation takes possession of his nose , while the others hang upon his arms , shoulders , and legs , and keep perfect time with the chief mourner , if he may be so called , in the various expressions of his lamentations . This ended , they resume their wonted cheerfulness , and enter into a detail of all that had happened during their separation . As there were nine New Zealanders just returned , and more than three times that number to commemorate the event , the howl was quite tremendous , and so novel to almost every one in the ship , that it was with difficulty our people 's attention could be kept to ' matters at that moment much more essential . Little Repero , who had frequently boasted during the passage , that he was too much of an Englishman ever to cry again , made a strong effort when his father , Shunghie , approached him , to keep his word ; but his early habit soon got the better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distress than any of the others . There was something peculiarly respectable in the appearance of Shunghie ; in person , he was a firm looking man , and was dressed in the uniform coat of a British officer . Though one of the most powerful chiefs in the Bay of Islands , and its bravest and most enterprising warrior , he was by far the least assuming of those , who had been permitted to come on board ; and , while many othem // tried to force their way into the cabin , he remained with his son on the deck ; nor did he attempt to go anywhere without invitation . ' p. 19-21 . After the arrival of the vessel in the Bay of Islands , the officers immediately commenced their inquiries for the cowry tree , for which they were in pursuit . They encountered many embarrassments in searching for the quality they desired , although the chiefs were ready to sell any timber that might be selected , for such articles as were offered them in exchange . The large and well formed cowry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom found except in low lands , and at some distance from water communication . They were often deceived , also , by the misrepresentations of the chiefs , who were jealous lest their neighbors should gain the advantage of the trade with the ship . From Various obstacles the Dromedary was detained on the coast ten months , before a full cargo could be procured . During this period Captain Cruise , who commanded a guard of soldiers , and had few duties connected with his station , spent his time chiefly in observing the manners and characteristics of the people , their modes of life , peculiar habitude , and social condition . His journal is made up of the results of these observations . It is written in a plain , unambitious style , recording events as they occur , without any parade of circum-* stance or show of ornament . His general statements are fully corroborated by the cotemporary evidence of Mr Marsden , and the journals of the Missionaries , which have been published during the last year in the London . Missionary Register , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these combined sources we are mainly indebted for the particulars , to which we invite the attention of our readers . We have also received considerable information from the Journal of our countryman John Ledyard , who accompanied Cook in his last voyage of discovery . When he returned to his native country , in 1783 , he arranged the notes , which he had taken , and published them in a small volume at Hartford , in Connecticut . This work was written under many disadvantages ; it is crude in style , and but little adorned with the graces of finished composition ; but nevertheless it bears marks of a strong , original , and observing mind ; it contains // striking thoughts , and deep philosophical reflectionS , proving at once the quick , penetrating powers , and commanding genius of the author . His observations furnish many curious and valuable facts , some of which are not to be found in any other account of Cook 's voyage . He was on shore , and standing near the great navigator , when he was killed at Owyhee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His narrative of the causes and circumstances of this catastrophe is minute and spirited , and contains some particulars not mentioned in any other description of this event . His occasional remarks on the comparative manners , characteristics , and language of the South Sea Islanders , show a mind perpetually awake to surrounding objects , rapid in its conceptionss profound in its views of human nature , and ever active in collecting and embodying the facts , which illustrate the being and social state of man . We understand , that a gentleman in this country is collecting materials for a life of Ledyard , which may be expected at no distant period to come before the public . Of the mans who rambled in his boyhood among the Indians on our fron .. tiers ; who was the first to descend the Connecticut River in a canoe , and in one which was constructed by his own hands and managed in its voyage by himself alone ; who studied law and divinity ; who enlisted as a soldier at Gibraltar ; who went round the world with Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast ; was intimate with Robert Morris in Philadelphia , with Paul Jones in Paris , with Sir Joseph Banks in London , and Professor Pallas in Petersburgh ; who was the friend and correspondent of Jefferson and La Fayette ; who was one season in New York , the next in Spain and France , the next in Siberia , and the next under the pyramids of Egypt ; who was the first to open the field of African discovery , on which , during the last thirty six years , so many have entered with an enthusiasm and love of adventure , which nothing could damp but the sacrifice of life itself ; and who , in his own language , trampled half the globe under his feet , ' - of such a man , no doubt many particulars may be related , which will be interesting to his countrymen , and which , at the same time they illustrate the character , and do justice to the memory of a remarkable // individual , will prove what wonders may be wrought by a union of enterprise , perseverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some points of view , we apprehend , the New Zealanders are among the most extraordinary people of whom we have any knowledge . No authentic record can be found of a people more thoroughly and shockingly savage ; more fierce in their passions , insatiate in their revenge , bloodthirsty in their wars , or inhuman in their treatment of enemies ; and , at the same time , they are not less distinguished for the strength of their affections , unshaken attachment to their relations , grief at the loss of friends , and reverence for the memory of the dead . These extremes we know are common to all savages , but in the New Zealanders we believe they run to a much greater extent , than in any other tribes of the human race , with whom civilized men have been acquainted . In their modes of living , and in the general features of their character , they resemble the other South Sea Islanders ; but they exhibit stronger contrasts , and have customs peculiar to themselves . The climate of New Zealand is temperate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the natives cultivate hardly anything , except sweet potatoes , which they call koomeras . These are produced in great abundance , and deposited for common use in public storehouses . The time of the koomera harvest is a season of dancing and festivity . Fern roots , wild celery , cresses , and a few other indigenous vegetables are used for food . Fish in great variety , and of good quality , is abundant . The only quadru .. peds , which Captain Cook saw , were dogs and rats ; but he left hogs on the island , which have since become numerous . Mr Marsden carried over horned cattle and horses , some of which were shot by the natives , because they trespassed on tabooed ground . The missionaries successfully cultivate wheat , other grain , and many kinds of garden vegetables introduced from England . * The title of the work mentioned above is , A Journal of Captain Cook 's Last Voyage to the Pacific Ocean , and in Quest of a North West Passage between Asia and America ; performed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustrated with a Chart , showing the Tracks of the Ships employed in the Ex* pedition . Faithfully narrated from the original Manuscript of Mr John Ledyard . Hartford , printed and sold by Nathaniel Potter , 1783. ' // The New Zealand men are tall , well formed , and athletic , with a dark brown complexion , *and black hair , which is commonly straight , but sometimes curled . The features of both sexes are regular , and some of the women are accounted beautiful . The dress of men and women is the same , consisting of two mats fashioned into garments , and worn one over the other . The under garment , in form and dimensions , resembles a blanket , and is thrown over the body like a man tIe , in such a manner as to leave the right arm bare ; it is made of the strong silky fibres of a species of grass , intermixed with dog 's hair , and closely woven or matted together . The outer garment , which they call kakaltow , is much coarser and thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely below the middle of the body . The kakahow is chiefly intended as a defence against the inclemency of the weather . The ears of the women , and frequently of the men , are perforated with large holes , having been pierced in infancy , and so distended as to receive bits of wood , feathers , bones , and the teeth of fishes , as ornaments . They also wear *uspended from the fleck pieces of green talk , carved into grotesque shapes somewhat resembling the human figure . The men gather their hair into a bunch at the top of the head , and confine it there with combs of wood , or of bone , and adorn it with feathers ; but the hair of the women either flows loosely over their shoulders , or is cut short . In neither men nor women is any covering ever worn on the head . The houses , or huts , of the natives are small , built with a rough frame work of wood , covered and lined with grass firmly compacted , and sometimes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit a person to stand erect within them ; and they have one opening only , which serves the double purpose of a door and window , and which is just large enough to allow a man to creep through it on his hands and knees . The houses of the chiefs commonly have a veranda , or porch , on the side , which is fantastic . ally ornamented with paintings and carved work . Notwithstanding this rude construction of their dwellings , the want of better ones is hardly felt by the inhabitants , since it is customary with them to eat , sleep , and cook in the open air . They take their rest , ' says Captain Cruise , in a sitting pos. * ture , with their legs gathered under them ; and from the // coarse texture of the outer mat , in which they envelope themselves , they have the appearance , during the night , of a number of beehives scattered in groups about a village . ' Ledyard mentions the same custom , and says , that , in this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a haycock surmounted by a human head . Fires are sometimes kindled in the huts , and Mr Marsden complains bitterly of the smoke and suffocating heat , which he was compelled to endure , when he crawled into them to avoid the cold of the external atmosphere in the night . The government of New Zealand is much like that described by Ledyard , as existing at Otaheite , and resembling , as he remarks , the early state of every government , which , in an unimproved and unrefined state , is ever a kind of feudal system of subordination , securing licentious liberty to a few , and dependant servility to the rest . ' This prevailing characteristic of savage governments , however , is to he received with some modifications in the case of the New Zealanders . The chiefs have a feudal jurisdiction , but their authority is absolute only in times of war . Various gradations of power , and extent of possessions , pertain to different chiefs . Some hold large tracts of lands by hereditary right , and on these lands other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation , and manage their own affairs without any in** terference or control of the head chief . The people at large are bound to no master ; they go and come as they please ; and are idle or industrious as moved by the wants of nature . Over their own household , their families , domestics , and slaves , every man , as well among the lower ranks as among the chiefs themselves , has absolute power ; so far the feudal system is perfect ; but beyond this , neither the theoretical nor practical machinery of government seems to be anything else , than a tacit understanding between the parties , that some shall lead and others follow for mutual security , and the better protection of personal rights and property . In time of war the case is different ; all the subordinate chiefs and warriors throughout the territories of a head chief flock to his standard , and put themselves under his command . Let a chief order the humblest subject in his dominions to go and labor in his fields , to dig his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or catch fish , and his // order would not be regarded , nor could he enforce obedience ; but let the cry of war be raised , and he is immediately surrounded by multitudes of submissive dependants , ready to endure any hardship that he may require , and to rush at his bidding into the heat of battle . They are no doubt in some degree prompted to this submission by their natural love of war , and hope of sharing in its spoils ; it is also observed , that nearly all the secondary chiefs , within the territory of a particular head chief , are connected by family alliances either with each other , or with the head chief himself , so that from this circumstance they naturally unite in a common cause . One of the most powerful chiefs , in those parts of the islands visited by Europeans , is called Shunghie , and in his dominions and near his residence the missionaries have established themselves . The first missionaries went to New Zealand in 1815 , and four years afterwards , on Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract of land at Kiddeekiddee for a permanent settlement . This tract consisted of thirteen thousand acres , and was bought for forty eight axes . A formal deed was executed , signed on one part by Mr Marsden and the missionaries , in behalf of the Missionary Society , and on the other , by Shuughie and some of the principal men of his tribe . What validity this deed will have hereafter in the eyes of the savages , time must prove ; up to the last accounts its obligations had been faithfully regarded . There is another missionary station at Rangheehoo , not far from Kiddeekiddee ; and also a third lately established by the Wesleyan Methodists in the same vicinity . As far as we can ascertain from the latest intelligence , there are at this time from twelve to twenty English missionaries settled among the natives . The deepest trait , perhaps , in the New Zealand character , is a passion for war ; fighting is their element ; to other employments they may be reluctantly brought by necessity ; but to the din of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an eager delight . The natives , who have resided a long time in England , and learnt the language , and become habituated to the customs of civilized life , lose none of this ferocity ; their warlike propensities are revived the moment they again inhale their native atmosphere . Tooi is a. remarkable instance in point . He possessed a good capacity , quicknes*i // of parts , and an apparently amiable temper ; he improved rapid. * ly in England , and when he left that country high expectations were entertained , that he would be an important instrument in reforming his countrymen , and introducing among them some of the blessings of civilized life . He returned under the charge . of the missionaries ; but no sooner was he placed in the midst of his tribe , and surrounded by the scenes of his early years , than he forgot the lessons he had learnt , and the impressions he had received , during his absence , and the spirit of the savage assumed its former empire in his mind . He boasted of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries themselves , and when reminded of his better knowledge , and asked why he did not endeavor to make his people happy by teaching them agriculture , and the arts of civilized life , he replied , that it was impossible , that if you told a New Zealander to work , he fell asleep ; but if you spoke of fighting , he opened his eyes as wide as a teacup ; that the whole bent of his mind was war ; and that he looked upon fighting as fun . ' In his own case Tooi 's conduct verified his language All the tribes have fortified posts , called Paks , or Hippalts , situated at the top of an eminence difficult of ascent , to which they resort in case of immediate danger from the attack of an enemy . These pahs are minutely described in Cook 's Voyages* Where muskets have been introduced , these strong places have nearly become deserted . The imple .. ments of warfare , originally used by the natives , were the spear , mear6e , and pattoo-pattoo . The spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed at both ends ; it is grasped in the middle , and managed by the combatant with great agility and skill . The mear*e is a kind of club made of stone , and worn in the girdle ; and the pattoo-pattoo is a sort of wooden battle axe . With these weapons they always engage hand to hand , and the only advantage which they seek , is to take the enemy by surprise . So far had the New Zea. * lander , by his own untutored powers , devised the means of human slaughter ; but his recent acquaintance with the im- provements of civilization , if it has done nothing else , has taught him more destructive and ingenious modes of warfare . He now goes into battle with bayonets , tomahawks , steels and powder* // Several years ago the whalers from England , and the United States , began to visit the coast of New Zealand , and , was in all the South Sea Islands , to barter muskets and powder with the natives for hogs and potatoes , the only kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the chiefs understand the virtue of muskets and gunpowder in war , than they resorted to every possible means of obtaining them . They would deprive themselves of the last article of comfort and necessity , and take the food from their own mouths to buy a musket . One chief has thus collected an armory of fifty firelocks , and when an invasion is expected among any of the tribes , it is no longer inquired how many men are brought into the field , but how many muskets are numbered in the invader 's ranks . On one occasion a powerful tribe was thrown into great consternation at the approach of a force weak in numbers , but armed with twelve muskets . Tooi boasted with marked delight of what he considered an instance of generalship , in driving a party of the enemy into a narrow place from which they could not escape , and then deliberately shooting them one by one to the number of twenty two . And it is , moreover , worthy of remark , that , since the introduction of firearms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for killing has burnt with the more fury , in proportion as the means of doing it with the greater facility have increased . This evil had become so serious and alarming , that the missionaries were instructed by the Board at home not to trade with the natives on any occasion with muskets and powder ; but to supply them with axes , adzes , spades , hoes , and such implements of agriculture , and the arts of life , as they most needed . The natives took umbrage at this restriction ; they were insolent and troublesome ; and the consequence was , that the missionaries were obliged to compromise , and pay dollars for what they wanted , with which the natives could purchase firearms of the whalers . It was thought for a time by the Missionary Society a desirable object , for the chiefs and principal men to visit England , and inducements were held out to them for this purpose , by offering to pay their passage , and promising them presents of such articles as should be useful on their return . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded to make the // 340 April , *voyage , and accordingly he arrived in London accompanied by Whykato , another chief , on the 8th of August , 1820 . Here he remained four months , during which time he receiv. ed marked attentions ; he was introduced to the king , caress* ed by the great , and every effort was made to impress him favorably with what he saw and experienced . Rich with the presents he had received , he left his benefactors in England elated at the prospect of the benefits , which they doubted not his visit would be the means of bringing to his degraded countrymen . Little did they penetrate the deep and dark purposes of Shunghie . As soon as he landed at Port Jack .. son , he exchanged his whole property , king George 's present with the rest , for firearms and powder . With these trophies of his enterprise , he returned to his own country , and is now the greatest , the bloodiest , and most successful warrior in the northern regions of New Zealand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ivar , are so numerous and varied , that it seems impossible for a state of things ever to occur , in which a settled peace can continue for any length of time . The slaying of a chief in battle , or an insult offered to a tribe at any period within the remotest verge of tradition , are considered just grounds of retaliation ; and as every war multiplies these offences , they are not likely to have an end . The following account , respecting the practices of the natives in war , and the manner in which they dispose of the heads of the chiefs slain in battle , is given in the words of Mr Marsden . In time of war , great honor is paid to the head of a warrior when killed in battle , if he is properly tattooed . His head is taken to the conqueror , and preserved , as the spoils of war , with respect , *-*as a standard , when taken from a regiment is respected by the victor . It is gratifying to the vanquished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enemy ; for when the conqueror wishes to make peace , he takes the heads of the chiefs along with him and exhibits them to their tribe . If the tribe are desirous of putting an end to the contest , they cry aloud at the sight of the heads of their chiefs , and all hostilities terminate ; this is a signal that the conqueror will grant them any terms they may require . But if the tribe are determined to renew the contest , and risk the issue *f another battle , they do not cry . Thus the head of a chief // may be considered as the standard of the tribe to which he belongs* and a signal of peace or war . If the conqueror never intends to make peace , he will dispose of the heads of those chiefs , whom he kills in battle , to ships , or to any persons who will buy them . Sometimes they are purchased by the friends of the vanquished , and returned to their surviving relations , who hold them in the highest veneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping over them . When a chief is killed in regular battle , the victors cry aloud as soon as he falls , " Throw us the man , " if he falls within the line of his own party . If the party , whose chief is dead , are inti .. midated , they immediately comply with the command . As soon as the victim is received , his head is immediately cut off , and a proclamation issued for all the chiefs to attend , who belong to the victorious party , to assist in performing the accustomed religious ceremony , in order to ascertain by augury , whether their god will prosper them in the present battle . If the priest , after performing the ceremony , says that their god is propitious , they are inspired with fresh courage to attack the enemy ; but if the priest returns an answer , that their god will not be propitious , they quit the field of battle in sullen silence . The head , already in possession , is preserved for the chief on whose account the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he , or some one of his tribe , had received from the enemy . When the war is over , and the head properly prepared , it is sent round to all the chief 's friends , as a gratification to them , and to show them that justice had been obtained from the offending party . " Proceedings of the Church Missionary Society , 1820-1821. p. 301 . Many beads are bought back from all Shunghie 's wars , and seen by the missionaries stuck on poles , and exhibited in other situations , so that in this respect Kiddeekiddee might not be disparaged by a comparison with the grand seignior 's good city of Constantinople . The chiefs ' heads only are preserved , or embalmed , and the mode of effecting this operation is peculiar to the New Zealanders . It is done , according to Captain t*ruise , wholly by desiccation ; a hole is dug in the ground , and lined with stones , which are made hot ; into this the head is placed rolled up in leaves , where it remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped ; it is then taken out and set in a current of air tilL it becomes thoroughly dry . When thus prepared , it resists the action of the atmosphere , and the skin and muscular parts // are nearly as imperishable as the bone itself . Several of ' these heads have latterly been purchased by the whalers , and brought to Europe and the United States . One was recently exhibited with the Egyptian Mummy in Boston , the features of which were full and regular , and the hair and teeth *s p*rfect as in life . The mode of preserving , or embalming the human body by desiccation , is said to have been practised in Sicily , but although the flesh was made perfectly dry and hard , yet the features were hideously distorted , and nothing remained to call to mind the image of the living person . This practice seems to be essential to the customs of War in New Zealand , since , on the declaration of peace between two parties , an exchange of the heads of all the chiefs killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have elapsed from the commencement of hostilities . How the modern habit of selling the heads to foreigners will affect these negociations , or what compromise is to be made , remains for the New Zealand statesmen in their wisdom to determine . The war dance is common to all the tribes before they engage in battle . It is performed almost at the moment of going into action , and is represented as a most frightful exhibition ; the performers come together without regularity ; they jump from the ground with violent gestures , rending the air with savage yells , distorting their countenances , and working themselves up to a wild and furious frenzy . In this state of frantic excitement they rush upon the enemy , inspired , as they imagine , with new , courage , and armed with greater strength . They also have orators to quicken their sense of injury , and rouse them to avenge an insult . Mr Marsden heard two of these speak on one occasion , when they wished to stir up the people immediately to seize their arms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring tribe . The first orator rose with a dignified and commanding aspect , and held a weapon of war in his hand , which he brandished as he spoke ; his gestures were strong and expressive , but his language was calm and discreet ; he exhorted the chief , Matanghee , to proceed with courage and firmness in vindicating the rights of his tribe , but still he was willing to come to a reconciliation with the offenders , if they // 1824 . Wars of Yew Zealand . would make suitable reparation . When this harangue was ended , another orator sprang forward , grasped a long spear in his hand , and began to declaim with vehemence against the audacity of the enemy in the outrage committed ; he recounted from the beginning the differences between the two tribes , pointed out the injustice and insolence of the opposite party , and chided the cautious wisdom of the speaker who went before him ; his countenance glowed with the fire of indignation , he stamped with his foot , brandished his spear in a threatening manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other method remained of retrieving the insulted dignity of the tribe , but to take up arms and fight . To both speakers the people listened with profound stillness and attention ; but when the debate was closed , they flew to arms , and Matanghee went out with a party of his men to examine the movements of the enemy . They returned at night highly indignant at what they had witnessed , for it seems the slaves of Moodeewhy , a chief in the vicinity , had been killing Mataughee 's pigs ; and this was a subject to call forth the eloquence of orators , kindle the wrath of chiefs , and stir up the fury of the populace . It was resolved to take exemplary vengeance on the morrow , and preparations were made for the coming conflict . Meantime the fire of resentment was not suffered to cool . The following is Mr Marsden 's account of the venerable Warreemaddon 's speech on the occasion . In the evening , old Warreemaddoo threw of his mat , took his spear , and began to address his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them against the injustice and ingratitude of Moo .. deewhy 's conduct ; recited many injuries , which he and his tribe had suffered from Moodeewby for a long period ; mentioned in* stances of his bad conduct , at the time his father 's bones were removed from the Ahoodu Pah to their family vault ; stated acts of kindness which he had shown to Moodeewby at different times ; and said that he had twice saved his tribe from total ruin . In the present instance , Moodeewby had killed three of his hogs ; one of them was very large and fat , being two years old . Every time he mentioned the large hog , the recollection of his loss seemed to nerve afresh his aged sinews . He shook his hoary head , stariiped withl indignant rage , and poised his quivering spear . He exhorted his tribe to be bold and courageous , and declared that he would head them in the morning against the enemy , and , rather than be would // submit , he would be killed and eaten . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemies whom he had to meet ; their hearts did not lie deep ; and , if they were resolutely opposed , they would yield . His oration continued nearly an hour , and all listened to him with great attention . ' It may be satisfactory to know , that these important state differences , which threatened to involve two tribes in a bloody contest , were amicably settled by the interference of Mr Mars .. den , and his companion Mr Kendall , though not till after much parade of war on the part of Matanghee , and the resolute Warreemaddoo . The most curious specimens of art and ingenuity , which have been seen among the New Zealanders , are their war canoes . These are various in their dimensions and workmanship . The largest seen by Captain Cruise belonged to a chief of Shunghie 's tribe ; it was eighty four feet long , six wide , and five deep , made of a single cowry tree , hollowed out , and the sides raised about two feet with planks firmly fastened and connected by cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem and stern was fixed a post fifteen feet high , which , together with the sides of the canoe , were ornamented with carved work painted red , and strung with a profusion of feathers . This canoe was propelled by ninety naked men , who regulated the movements of their oars by a song , which was led by three men , and in which they all joined ; the owner sat at the stern and steered . This canoe moved with great rapidity , and would cross the Bay of Islands in perfect safety , when the sea was so rough as to render it imprudent to lower the ship 's boats . The New Zealanders are cannibals . It was for a long time doubted whether there existed on the globe a race of men , addicted to the custom of devouring one another . When Cook in his First Voyage mentioned this , as the practice of the New Zealanders , his account was discredited by many respectable persons , because it was founded rather on circumstances , than demonstrative evidence . In his Second Voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occular proof of the fact ; and since his time , the melancholy testimony has been such , not only in New Zealand , but in other South Sea Islands , as to put the question forever at rest . Ledyard speaks of two instances of cannibalism , which came under // his own observation , one at the Sandwich Islands , the day after they were discovered , and the other on the northwest coast of America . The stories related by Herodotus , Strabo , Pliny , and other ancients , about anthropophagi , which have been regarded as fables in modern times , are more than real .. ized at this day in many islands of the southern ocean . During Cook 's first visit to New Zealand , a boat 's crew from his vessel was seized while on shore in some retired place , and , as the natives afterwards confessed , the men were killed and eaten . The French navigator , Marion de Fresne , with seventeen of his men , suffered the same fate . He had been sent out to Otaheite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and on his return he stopped at New Zealand , where he was on friendly and intimate terms with the natives for thirty three days , before they perpetrated the horrible act of treachery and inhumanity , which ended his life . While on shore with a party of his men , as he imagined in perfect security , the natives suddenly rose upon them and massacred every individual except one seamen . Their surviving companions were doomed to witness the horrid spectacle of their being cut in pieces , and devoured by the cannibals . In the year 1810 , the English ship Boyd went to New Zealand for the purpose of procuring a cargo of spars . She had on board seventy two persons , besides four or five New Zealanders returning from Port Jackson . One of these na. tives , whose name was Tarra , became dissatisfied at what he deemed ill treatment during the voyage , but concealed his resentment ; and when the ship approached the coast he induced the captain to go into Wangarooa , which he said was the best place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . Tarra appeared friendly , and expressed a constant readiness to promote the objects of the voyage , till he found the crew of the Boyd separated and off their guard , when the natives rushed upon them at a concerted signal , and massacred every person of the seventy two , except one woman and two children . After this deed was done , a cask of gunpowder was found on board , which was placed between the decks , and Tarra 's father , by way of trying its virtue , snapped his musket over it ; the upper deck was blown off by the explosion , and the lives of many natives lost . The // hull of the vessel floated into shoal water , and grounded* where it was visited by the officers of the Dromedary . They likewise saw Tarra and many of the persons engaged in the massacre , by whom they were told , that all the people belonging to the Boyd were cut in quarters , distributed among the different families of the tribe , and devoured . But we have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the narrative of incidents , which have come under the immediate notice of the missionaries within the last two years and a half , as contained in their journals . We can not do so much violence to the feelings of our readers , as to quote the instances to which we refer , with all the horrible circumstances accompanying them . When Shunghie returned from England with his fresh supply of firearms , he immediately began to meditate new wars , and resolved to take ample vengeance on all his old enemies . Great preparations were made ; the surrounding tribes were summoned to join him , and he departed to seek his foes at the head of a formidable armament of war canoes , filled with fighting men . He was successful to the extent of his wishes , and in a few months the whole expedition returned with numerous prison .. ers of war . And now followed a scene , which words have not power to express , and which humanity shudders to contemplate . Tbe victims , who had been taken alive on the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ; Shunghie and his people butchered and ate them in cold blood ; and for three successive days the missionaries beheld these barbarians feasting on the prisoners of war , whom they had brought home ; even from the doors of their own dwellings , the horrid sight met their eyes , and on one occasion Shunghie invited them to partake of his repast . The excess was no doubt greater at this time , by reason of a son in law of Shunghie 's , and some other relatives of the family , having been killed in battle . Shunghie 's wife , and other women of his household , seemed frantic with rage ; they murdered several captives with their own hands , and the children apparently took delight in imbuing their hands in human blood . We might enlarge on these scenes , but we forbear . What we have said is enough to prove the existence of cannibalism , in its most barbarous and distressing forms , even among a people with whom tM Europeans have had a *ow* // stant intercourse for the last twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for becoming acquainted with the advantages of civilization. * Notwithstanding these ferocious habits , this refinement of savageness , the New Zealanders have strong natural affections ; their family ties are close and indissoluble ; their grief at the death of a friend is extreme , and refuses consolation ; it is often clamorous , but this is no more than the overflowing of a heart untrained to the discipline of concealing its emotions , or suppressing the impulses of nature . They weep and mourn for many days , even months . On Mr Marsden 's second visit , he met with persons whose friends had died during his absence , and the associations , which his presence called up , put them immediately to talking of their departed friends , and brought floods of teats into their eyes . Suicide is common upon the sudden bereavement of a near relation . Shunghie 's daughter was bound and watched , that she might not destroy herself , when she heard the fatal tidings of her husband 's death in battle ; her sister in law , who had suffered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in safe keeping . It is a usual occurrence , in seasons of mourning , for women to cut their faces and bodies in a hideous manner with a shell , that they may testify , by mingling blood with their tears , the depth and sincerity of their grief . If these are nevertheless the virtues of a savage , the rank shoots of nature , rather than the fair growth of a cultivated soil , it may be added , that the natives are allowed not to be deficient in the milder virtues of social life . For the most part they are gentle and tractable , neither tyrannical in their families , harsh to their children , dogmatizing to their equals , nor oppressive and troublesome to their neighbors . They express a pleasure in having the missionaries teach their chilFor numerous particulars respecting this subject , see the London Missionagy Register for November , 1823 , pp. 504-Si 1 . Also , Cruise 's Residence ire New Zealand , pp. 97 , 110 , 112 , 125 , 140 , 184 , 286 . Mr Marsden mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had with three chiefs at Pookanewee . At length , ' says he , the conversation led to the origin of eating human flesh . They first alleged , that it originated from the largest fishes of the sea eating other fishes , and some even eating their own kind ; that large fishes eat small ones ; small fishes eat insects ; dogs will eat men , and men will eat dogs , and dogs devour one another ; the birds of the air also devour one another ; and one god will devour another god* Proreediregs of the Church .

To be sure , the missionaries can use no restraint for this purpose , but it does not appear that they are ever opposed , or that the children are chided for going to be taught . An instance of fidelity in a native girl is mentioned by Captain Cruise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when his house was rudely entered by a party of plunderers , she held Mrs Hall 's infant child in her arms7 and so much was she alarmed at the menacing aspect of the intruders , that she fled with her charge from the house . Crossing the river Wytangy in a canoe , she concealed herself in a wood , where she remained two days , till all danger was over , and then brought hack the child in safety to its parents . Nor are these daughters of cannibals unsusceptible of the tender passion . Ledyard mentions an amusing adven-. ture between a New Zealand girl , and a young sailor on board Cook 's vessel , with whom she fell violently in love . She enticed him on shore just as the vessel was about to sail , and so much did her charms and assiduity operate on the youthful seaman , that he agreed to elope with her into the interior , and had actually commenced the enterprise , when a body of his comrades , who had been despatched by their commander , overtook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as will not be doubted , to the unutterable grief of the enamored damsel . Among the customs , which prevail in New Zealand in common with all the South Sea Islands , are those denominated tattooing , and tabooing . The tattoo consists of artificial punctures in the skin , so applied as to become permanent , and represent certain figures according to the fancy of the individual , or the fashion of a tribe . The operation is described by voyagers as nearly the same , in all the islands scattered throughout the great southern ocean . Black lines are first drawn on the part to be tattooed , delineating the figure intended to be impressed ; in these lines the skin is punctured by a kind of pointed chisel , made of the wing of a bird fixed in a handle . After the point of this instrument has been dipped in a black coloring fluid , it is gently struck on the other end with a small stick , till it pierces through the skin , and causes the blood to flow // out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is performed , that frequent respites of several days are neces* sary for the wounds to heal ; but when the work is done , it leaves a black ridge , which never disappears . The tattooing will become less distinct with age , and those who value themselves for the beauty of their persons , or the dignity of their stations , have it frequently repeated . New Zealand and the Sandwich Islands are said to be the only places in which the face is tattooed ; and it is remark* able , as observed in Cook 's Third Voyage , that among the natives of the former , it is done in beautiful spiral volutes , while among the latter , the tattooed lines are straight , and cross each other at right angles . The figures on the arms and other parts of the body are not uniform . Mr Mariner says , that in the Tonga Islands numerous patterns are kept , and the individual chooses such as pleases his fancy . The women are seldom tattooed , except slightly on the hands and arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few instances on the tip of the tongue , a custom , of which Cook puzzled himself in vain to find out the meaning . In New Zealand a man is regarded with very little respect , who is not tattooed , and , laying the consideration of beauty out of the question , few are willing to endure the taunts and re*. proaches , to which a want of this symbol of manhood and courage exposes them . The custom itself , in its origin , was probably a device ta assist the memory . Marks were made on the body in cornmemoration of some signal event , such as the death of a chief5 of a friend , or the result of a great battle* They are sometimes used for similar purposes at the present day They are also employed as the distinguishing badges of tribes , as well as of chiefs and men of elevated rank . Of the New Zealanders this is particularly true ; the pattern after which the face of a chief is tattooed is a kind of coat of arms5 which descends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Shunghie signed the deed with the missionaries , he impressed on the paper the figure of his amoco . An officer , who had a coat of arms on a watch seal , was asked whether it was the amoco of his tribe . We thus see , that this singular custom has its foundation in purposes of utility , and accomplishos* // ends , which other savages attain in a much ruder and ipors imperfect manner . The ornamental has gradually been engrafted into the useful ; but this union has not diminished the value of the device , while it has added something to the stock of human enjoyment , and perhaps to human advancement , by exercising the imagination , and quickening the principles of taste . The taboo is another custom peculiar to the islands in the Pacific Ocean , and neither less singular , nor less universal , than the one just mentioned . The word is so extensive , in its application and import , as not to admit of a very close definition . In general , anything which is consecrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched , is said to be tahooed . The term is applied indifferently to persons and things , and denotes equally the object prohibited , the prohibition itself , and the persons against whom the prohibition is intended to act . A piece of ground is tabooed by consecrating it ; the consecration itself is a taboo ; and the people who are forbidden to intrude upon it are said to be tabooed . Many tabooes are laid by direct imposition for specific purposes , and when they have the nature of a consecrations they are imposed by a priest . Burial places are tabooed in a formal manner , and are not to be entered except on parti .. cular occasions , and with certain ceremonies . Sick men are sometimes tabooed , from motives of superstition , and left to die , as no one will venture to approach them with food , or to give them any assistance . The , public stores containing the koomeras , which constitute the principal food of the natives of New Zealand , are tabooed immediately after the koomera harvest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is rare that the taboo on these depositories is violated . At a certain season of the year a species of fish is caught , which is reserved for winter food ; when the vessel , in which Mr Marsden went to New Zealand , approached the coast , a great many people were busy in catching this kind of fish and drying it on the shore ; but they would sell none , alleging that it was tahooed and could not be disposed of , nor eaten . The same prohibition is laid on any kind of food , when there is danger of a scarcity ; and newly planted fields are taboocd by marks , or signals , to prevent persons from // trampling on them . Animals known to have trespassed are killed . In these latter instances , and others of a similar character which might be mentioned , we see a very wise and salutary operation of the taboo system , in providing for the exigencies of the future ; and in a state of society , where the government and manners are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of the whole population may be easily estimated . Besides this method of tabooing by consecration , or positive injunction , many tabooes are accidental , or become such by certain acts on the part of the tabooed person . Whoever touches a dead body , whether by accident or intentionally , and women , who attend funerals as mourners , are tabooed from taking any food in their hands for a stated length of time . They are fed by other persons till the time expires , In the Tonga Islands a person becomes tabooed by touching a chief , as also by eating in the presence of a superior without turning his back to him , and in both cases the same penalty of not feeding himself with his own hands follows . This taboo can be taken off , however , by the ceremony of putting the palms of the hands to the sole of a chief 's foot ; and a chief of higher rank can remove a taboo occasioned by touching one of a lower . The great chief Tooitonga , being above all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by coming in contact with him , and to remedy the inconvenience , which would otherwise occur in his absence , he left a consecrated howl , which had the same virtue on being touched as the soles of his feet . Mr Mariner says , that Tooitonga devoted to this purpose a pewter basin , which had been given to his father by Captain Cook . The same custom of restrict* ing the handling of food exists in New Zealand . When Shunghie sailed for England , his aged mother , whom the missionaries believed to be a hundred years old , was tabooed , and some days afterwards she was seen wandering on the beach with her white locks floating in the wind , and accompanied only by a single person , who held a basket and fed her with koomeras as she required . The penalty for breaking a taboo varies according to the degree of sacredness , which is supposed to be attached to the particular kind of taboo violated . It does not appear , that any ' civil penalties are instituted , or corpor*tl punishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgression seems to be considered as wholly an offence against the gods , for which an atonement is necessary , either by a sacrifice , or some ceremony , the particulars of which have been defined and established by custom .. Mr Mariner relates a remarkable incident in illustration of this point . Palavali , a chief in the Tonga Islands , was absent one day at some distance from his village with half a dozen of his men , when he suddenly came upon four of his eneinies belonging to another tribe . They were near a tabooed enclosure , and Palavali sprang forward , that he might overtake them before they should gain a refuge in that hallowed spot . He came up just in time to give one man a mortal blow as he was clambering over the reed work , which sur* rounded the enclosure , and he fell dead on the tabooed ground . Palavali was struck with terror at what he had done , and hastened back to the village to ascertain from a priest in what manner he could avert the anger of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the smallest atonement , which the gods would accept , and accordingly one of the most promising children in the tribe , of about two years old , was immediately selected for the purpose and strangled . A few days afterwards Palavali was mortally wounded in a conflict with an enemy ; he survived for a short time , but would not suffer the broken spear to be drawn from his body , saying that his fate was just , and decreed by the gods , as a punishment of his recent offence . From this incident we learn with what reverence the taboo is regarded , and how powerful its influence must be over the minds of the people . It may hence be inferred , that the universal custom of tabooing , as well as of tattooing , originated in necessity ; it answers the same ends with savages , as laws do in a civilized state ; it is a potent engine of government , and communicates to the rules of civil and political intercourse almost the only strength they could have , among such a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that superstition should mingle deeply with this custow ; its power and its value chief ly depend on this circumstance ; superstition tyrannizes over the mind , and the tyranny it exercises is suited to act on the intellect merged in ignorance and barbarism . It will naturab* ly run to absurd and revolting extremes ; but its office will be *p*ecuted ; it will restrain passions , which nothing else couh* // restrain ; and tame the ferocity and soften the heart , which would bid defiance to the authority of reason , the persuasions of conscience , the force of law , and the power of man . With many tribes the taboo extends to all vices and criminal ac* tions , such as theft , lying , fraud , and whoever is guilty of these is said to have broken the taboo . Here we have an actual code of laws , written in the memory of the people , and descending from age to age ; not so perfect , perhaps , as if they received the benefit of annual legislation , yet they are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds they control have arrived . Little is known of the religion of the New Zealanders , for the reason probably that there is little to be learnt . They believe in the existence of invisible , spiritual agents , who have control over the winds , the waves of the sea , the weather , and , to a certain extent , of their own persons . These spirits are denominated . dtuas , and it is supposed that death is caused by the presence of an Atna . They believe that chiefs and persons of distinction exist after death , or become Atuas , but cookees , or slaves , they suppose to have no being after this life . They have various modes of frightening away the Atuas , when they do not desire their presence . Shunghie fired guns for this purpose , at the time he removed the bones of his son in law , who had been killed in battle . They have numerous priests , whose principal employment is to impose taboos , regulate the weather , still the winds when they are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were surprised that the missionaries should pray every day , and said they saw no motive for praying , except when they wanted the assistance of an Atna . The language of New Zealand resembles , in its outlines , the kindred dialects spoken in all the South Sea Islands . Otaheite is fifteen hundred miles from New Zealand , and yet the language of the former so nearly resembles that of the latter , that the natives of the two islands understand each other without difficulty . Omai , the Otaheitan , who was taken to England by Captain Cook as he returned from his second voyage , and who went back with him on his third voyage by way of New Zealand , could understand the language with ease , and served as interpreter between the natives and the English , although be had never before been in the country , // nor seen any of its inhabitants . Ledyard has Written out * vocabulary of several words , representing the same things in the two languages . In a large portion of these words there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Samuel Lee of Cambridge , England , has lately constructed a Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand language , aided by the manuscript papers of the missionaries , and by the chiefs who resided in England . It is particularly remarkable of this language , as well as of the Tonga and Malayan* of which Grammars have been made , that it has no declension of nouns nor conjugation of verbs . In nouns , the purposes of declension are answered by particles and prepositions ; and in verbs , the distinctions of person , tense , and mode , are determined by adverbs , pronouns , and other parts of speech . From this feature of the language it follows , that the words , arranged in the order of syntax , are not affected in their forms or terminations by the influence of any other words ; they are placed in a natural order , and their meaning is ascertained , not from any alteration in the words them-. selves , either by suffixes , prefixes , or changes of termination . The language is easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ear . The plan , upon which the missionaries have established themselves in New Zealand , promises ultimately to be of essential service to the natives . Their numbers are composed of teachers , and practical artificers and agriculturalists . This *s the true mode of diffusing the knowledge and benefits of a pure religion ; savages must be cjvilized before they can be christians , and civilization is a slow process , which can be carried on only by the force of example , and by repeated efforts to make the untutored savage feel by actual observation and experience , that the means of his enjoyments will be multiplied in proportion as he abandons his old habits , adopts the arts of peace and refinement , and yields to the spirit of moral and religious culture . Great is the praise due to those persons , who are willing , for the attainment of so noble and benevolent an object , to sacrifice what mankind usually consider the choicest blessings of life , the sweets of home , the ties of friendship , the security of a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island on the opposite side of the globe , amidst tribes of wild and restless can // nibals , whose delight is the destruction of their own species , and who kill and devour one another , without even a sense of the iniquity of a deed so horrible and shocking to humanity . The moral courage , the selfdenial , and singleness of purpose , which induce men to resign all the comforts , that the world in its happiest regions can bestow , and deliberately resolve to pass their days in these abodes of darkness , and danger , and privation , are enough to enlist the sympathy of the benevolent heart , to excite a deep interest in their web fare , and inspire an earnest wish , that they may have the consolation of success in the work of piety and goodness to which they are devoted . The recent accounts are not very favorable ; a gloom has been thrown over their prospects by the wars , which raged with more than usual violence after Shunghie 's return . These turbulent times seemed to communicate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were less respectful to the missionaries , breaking into their yards and houses , and stealing , or forcibly seizing , whatsoever came in their way . The missionaries complained to Shunghie , but he offered no redress ; he turned them off with a broad laugh1 saying , that such was the custom of his country . In truth7 he shunned them after his return , and evidently regarded them with no friendly eye . He told them in plain terms , that they had deceived him in affirming that king George would not allow them to sell muskets , for he had seen king George , and ascertained that he had given no such orders . But notwithstanding this coolness on Shunghie 's part , he kept up an outside show of friendship , occasionally breakfasted with them , and permitted them as before to instruct the children and cultivate the lands . At the date of their last letters they had reason to hope , that a few weeks would change the face of things , and that they should be able to live among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging success .
