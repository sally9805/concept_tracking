VI. - Letters written in the Interior of Cuba , between the iWountains of . lrcana , to the East , and of Cusco , to the West , in the Months of February , March , . /lpril , and . lIlay , 1828 . By the late Rev. ABIEL ABBOT , D. D. , Pastor of the First Church in Beverly , in Massachusetts . 8vo . Boston . 1829 . Bowles &amp; Dearborn. pp. 256 . WE hardly know how more annoyances , novelty , and romantic interest can be crowded into three months , than by a voyage to the island of Cuba . One embarking at a northern port in February , leaves a coast covered with snow and bound in frost . The sea , at the commencement of the voyage , is still more inhospitable than the land which he leaves behind . The winds are rough , cold , and , in the strongest sense of the term , // penetrating ; so much so , that it is difficult to envelope one 's self in a sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing severity . The day passes in a variety of discomforts ; in migrating from the cabin to the deck , and from the deck to the cabin ; walking to and fro , with yet an unsteady step ; making occasional advances to an acquaintance with the captain and officers of the ship ; severing the last connecting link with home , by discharging the pilot ; and taking an occasional glimpse at the receding and still receding shore , which grows more dear , as it becomes more distant ; - and , as it gradually sinks below the borizon , a thousand remembrances and anticipations rush upon the mind of the voyager , as he looks to the past and the future , from what seems like an isthmus between two separate existences . He does not , however , become fully sensible of the transition , until the night closes in ; he then begins to feel that he has exchanged the solid , fixed continent , for a floating , wandering shell . But then all sense of insecurity vanishes , when he *comes on deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perceives the steadiness with which the course is kept , and hears an occasional voice giving or acknowledging an order , indicating the presence and guardianship of mind , and sees the ship triumphantly leaping from wave to wave , dashing up a bright spray , which appears the more vivid amidst the general darkness . The first part of the voyage should be stormy , the atmosphere enveloped in a thick mist , with only a glimpse of a sail or two from day to day , until , as the routes of the vessels bound on the same voyage diverge , none is seen for several days . The rain still continues , and the wind occasionally blows a gale . Your clothes , your sheets and bedding , become saturated with a clammy moisture , and the water collects in drops on the side of your birth . Here and there a leak through the deck , or side of the ship , makes a continual dripping , and drenches a part of your garments or bed . In moving , you must hold by the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree , to the motion of the ship , or you will , by some sudden lurch , be flung prostrate acro*s the cabin . You have not the accommodations and good order of a Liverpool packet , upon this voyage . The captain will be swearing at and threatening the ste*ard , for allowing the waste of water , providing the wrong article for dinner , &amp;c . The chicken , which is nearly pecked // to death by its companions , must be killed first . Though you may not suffer that worst of all calamities , sea-sickness , your stomach becomes queasy ; and in this state of fastidious irritability , you will be soothed only by the captain 's exceeding politeness in offering you great junks of salted beef , cut with his own greasy knife , about which he has just been scolding the cook or cabin-boy . The table-cloth will have become so foul and loathsome , that a knife , fork , spoon , or piece of bread , which has come in contact with it , is no longer endurable . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoon , and plate , by use of a spare towel or two with which you may have provided yourself , the captain looks upon this with the most absolute contempt , as totally unseamanlike , and a reproach upon the good management and neatness of his cabin ; and his looks express plainly enough that you are a nice , mincing puppy . The salt , though white at first , by degrees acquires the complexion of pepper and salt ; and finally verges upon that of pepper , and is none the more attractive on account of each one 's helping himself from the salt-cellar with his own knife . The wind is fitful and changeahle , and you have no sooner got yourself seated for dinner , than the ship gives a lurch , and sends you and your messmates with the chairs , beef , gravy , pease-soup , dishes , and plates , in one common chaos , to the lee side of the cabin . No longer trusting to chairs , the party place themselves near the side of the cabin , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck of the dinner . The coffee served up morning and night , begins to have an indescribably sickening , disgusting taste , as if some old bilge .. water had been mixed with it in boiling . In the evening you are troubled with the cold gusts from the cabin-door , which the captain must have kept open , that he may know what is going on upon deck . You try to drive away some of the cold and dampness by a fire , but the wood being infected by the general moisture , will only smoulder in the stove without yielding any heat ; or if you succeed , with the help of your assistant , to kindle up a fire that affords a gleam of comfort , it can not be sustained , for want of a regular supply of fuel ; or the fire itself may join the enemy , and add to your other annoyances , by filling the cabin with smoke . The captain grows cross and querulous , and the men sulky , going about their duty , in their wet garments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you are obliged to lie to . The lurching , tossing , vote . xxlx. - *o. 64. 26 // and jerking motion of the ship ceases ; all the men except the watch are retired to get rest , in preparation for severer service . The ship lies steady and strong . to the wind , which whizzes through the shrouds and rigging , as if it would shiver the whole ship , with all its apparel , into shreds and splinters . All else is silent on board of the ship . The mate , whose watch it is , now and then steals down into the cabin , to record upon his slate an entry for the log-book i. - .. ' Twelve o'clock . A violent gale at southwest , ' &amp;c. ; and as you spy him entering , muffled in his watch-coat , and searching about for something , you involuntarily start , as if an assassin were approaching . You try your birth , and are repelled by a comfortless dampness ; you get up , and attempt the Vicar of Wakefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix your attention ; all the grace and beauty of the style , and all the interest of the story , have vanished* The importunate , angry , terrific whizzing of the gale provokes a continual restlessness and impatience . Something seems to be wrong , and yet nothing is to be done . You go to the gangway , and put your head just above deck , not venturing quite out , lest you should go off in the wind . You see one or two forms skulkino* behind some shelter , as if lying in wait for some one . But being finally worn down , and utterly exhausted , you throw yourself into you birth and fall asleep . When you wake in the morning , you find the ship is under way , going , with close-reefed sails at the rate of ten miles an hour . But the agitation of the sea , and violence of the wind , still give the ship a good deal of motion . You have a small glass in your state-room , so placed that you may brace yourself against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partition , in which position you may shave yourself with perfect security , however irregular the motion of the ship . Having drawn out some dry and clean linen , and other articles of dress , from your closely packed trunk , where they have been protected from the general saturation , you make your tuilet in very neat style , except the outer garments , bootees , and cap , which are always such as not to shun the contamination of contact with a tarred rope or a spray of sea-water . The clear , dry air , with the change of dress , give a pleasurable sensation through your whole frame . On going upon deck , the faces of the captain and the men greet you with good humor ; every one is busy , and goes about his duty with alacrity . You are now fr*r away in the Gulf Stream , and perceive , for the // first time since embarking , that you have changed your latitude . The . air has a bland softness , notwithstanding the vkdence of the wind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the eastern atmosphere is a transparent sea of effulgence . In other directions , you just perceive , near the horizon , and at immense distances , small specks of dim , gauzy whiteness , which are recognised for sails , and remind you that you are still In the im in a peopled world . mense prospect , ' in all directions , the white-crested waves are tumbling with restless and ever-varying turmoil ; and as they successively rise and subside , the eye seeks to catch the white streaks of foam at a greater and still greater distance , and you expect to extend the varying , indefinite boundaries of vision still farther , and descry the shore of some island or continent ; and though you may be persuaded , from your known latitude and longitude , that no such object will appear , yet still you persist in imagining that there is some grand object or other , Just beyond the verge of your prospect , which you in vain attempt to discover . Such are some of the incidents which we are sure may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost infinitely varied in different passages , each one of which would afford materials to fill a book . Were we to pursue this one as we have begun , itwould occupy all the space of the present article , and we should forget the work of Dr Abbot . We will , therefore , not dwell particularly upon the remaining objects and incidents ,  --  . the approach to the Hole in the Wall ; the throng of sails sure to be met , converging to this point ' ; the exhilaration at the sight of the low land of Abaco ; the new and peculiar appearance of the scattered palm-trees seen ranged along the horizon ; the small green islands on the left , mostly uninhabited , what few habitations there are , being the rudely built dwellings of fishermen ; the passage over the Bahama Bank , with the continual music of the man at the lead , singing out every five minutes , in a peculiarly monotonous and drawling tone , Three quarters and twain , ' C A half and twain , ' &amp;c. during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soundings ; the clearness of the water , through which is distinctly seen the sandy bottom , studded , here and there , with patches of sponge ; the numerous vessels passing the same course ; the exhilarating proclamation , that the Orange Key that is , rock is discovered to the right ; then , successively , the Dog Key , &amp;c. , to the Double-headed-shot Key on the left ,  --  . // being a row of monuments , stretched along sixty or eighty miles , of what was once an island , and is now the Sal Key Bank . In passing the Bahama Bank you are reminded that some twenty-five leagues to the eastward is St Salvador , the first land discovered by Columbus ; and though the chart shows it to be at so great a distance , you have a desire to turn from the course of the voyage , to visit the place where the first European footsteps , in our hemisphere , were imprinted . If you have left all the clouds and gales in the Gulf Stream and latitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bright , clear atmosphere , of a genial warmth , the more sensibly felt and enjoyed from a contrast with the rough winds and biting frosts which you left at home but a few days before , it will be one continued scene of delight and luxury . When you are satiated with sleep , or tired of reading , you may amuse yourself for hours in the day , by climbing up and stationing youself in the rigging , to contemplate , with an idle curiosity , the various objects in the prospect , and most of all , the sublime , terrific , and treacherous sea itself , the inexhaustible subject of musing and contemplation , which never tires except in a dead calm . Finally , a dim , bluish haze just above the horizon , not distinguishable from a cloud except by its more marked and definite lines , announces Cuba , and kindles , in a new voyager , a train of tumultuous sensations . All eyes are now peering to descry the Pan of Matanzas , which being described to you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for it as well as the rest , and perhaps have the satisfaction of first discovering it . Dr Abbot arrived at the port of Matanzas ; when the voyager , who would receive the most favorable first impression , should arrive ,  --  at sunrise , on a clear , bright morning . On the right , as he enters the bay , he sees a line of low rock , with abrupt hills in the rear , and a few small huts of fishermen or negroes , standing just on the brink of the water , with a small garden enclosed near by . On the left , the bay is bordered partly by an abrupt shore , and in part by low grounds , and receding ravines , with a few white , neat-looking buildings ; and at the bottom of this bay , which is not deep , appears the town of Matanzas , with buildings huddled together in apparent confusion , mostly of an indifferent appearance , the only two that present themselves // 205 with any striking effect , being a white wooden house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right or west of the town , and the custom-house , fronting on the public square , a stone building , with a white front , and ornamented with a broad piazza , supported by high square pillars . In the clear , lucid atmosphere of this region , where objects appear with unusual splendor and brilliancy , the landscape bounded by hills in the distance , the new species of trees and shrubbery , the sprinkling of buildings along the shore , the vessels arriving and departing ; the song of the sailors , who , especially if from Virginia , take in their cargoes to the music of a brisk and animating air and chorus ; and the throng of boats gliding to and froacross the harbor , navigated by blacks , or dark-looking Spaniards , with huge whiskers and mustachios , in straw hats , some in rags , some in fantastic dresses , and some with scarcely any dress ; with all the hum and echoes of this little , busy port ,  --  present to one newly arrived in these regions , a most animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this prospect , is one of our beautiful national frigates , if there happens to be one in the harbor at the time , the sight of which , here , will awaken all your patriotic pride , and give you the most lively sense of the protection extended by the government to its sUbjects , even in the remote regions of the world . And if a midshipman , dressed in a blue coat , white underdress , and straw hat , shoots out in his boat round the bows of the frigate , to board you , and inquire the news , and borrow the newspapers from home , and on coming abOard , announces to you that his ship is commanded by your acquaintance or friend , you seem , at once , to have met all the delights of home , amidst all the enchantments of romance . After relating the ceremonies preliminary to landing , Dr Abbot describes , with great truth and vivacity , the first impression made on a new visiter , on entering the town . There had been a small shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The buildings were a motley group of all sizes , and of various forms and roofs . The Spaflish visage and costume , however , strike you with irresistible humor . It seems a scene of masquerade , and as if all are striving to amuse by the extravagance and oddity of their appearance . Here , is ambling by you a Don , with a spur on his shoe , his horses head low , and his tail tied up in a club ; there , comes a volante with huge wheels , highly adorned with silver plate , with a boot of broadcloth hitched // to the top of the vehicle , as if there were nuns or donnas within , not to be seen by vulgar eyes . This heavy carriage is sometimes drawn by one horse , and sometimes by two , with a postillion in livery , and jack-boots reaching almost to his hips , with a monstrous spur at his heel , and a short whip in his hand , both very freely applied . Sometimes , if the sun be hid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three gaily dressed and laughing girls , or one or two grave men , lounging in the ample chaise body , for this is the form of the carriage . You withdra*v your eyes from the volante , to gaze on a vehicle of an humbler character , on the clumsy cart , with large wheels and a rude body , formed of skins , and perhaps filled with corn , each ear covered with a thin coat of husks , the state in which they preserve this grain . It is drawn by oxen most strangely harnessed . A yoke is placed behind their horns at the root , and so fixed to them with fillets and ropes , that they draw or push by their horns without chafing . A rope or thong leads from that gear to the nostril , which is perforated to receive it . A rope thus fastened to the nose of each ox , is sometimes seen in the hand of a man leading the team , as we lead a horse by the bridle ; and sometimes the teamster holds the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle , goading the animals with a ten-foot pole . There is an infinite variety of caparison to their riding horses , from a saddle of leather and plaited stirrup , to a bed of straw tied on by a rope . Their bridles are as various , with and without bit , of leather , rope , and braided grass . But what strikes the stranger with surprise , almost rising into a nervous feeling , is the constant sight of men in armor . It seems as if it was a time of war , and every horseman a vidette . The broad sword dangles by the side of the gentleman , and holsters are inseparable from his saddle . The simplest countryman on his straw saddle , belts on his rude cutlass ; and every man with a skin less dark than an African , appears ready for encounter . ' pp. 3 , 4 . After a few days spent in town , Dr Abbot made an excursion into the country , going a part of the way up a river that discharges itself into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a volante through coffee and sugar estates , bordered here and there with lime hedges , and palm , orange , and other ornamental trees . About five in the morning , the church-bell tolled for prayers . In about twenty minutes we rose , took a cup of coffee , the very quintessence of the island staple , without any accompaniment . At dawning , the servants took up my baggage , and we repaired to the mole , where the watermen were waiting , and we started down the // bay , to the side of the Stranger , and thence entered the most romantic river , I should say , that ever was seen-only that I can not speak confidently as to that point , there being many romantic rivers which I never have seen . The mouth of it is guarded by a Spanish fort , and the solitary sentinel was pacing his round with a gun on his shoulder , and a high cap on his head . Whether it was that we were rowed by bargemen belonging to the CustomHouse , or that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we unexpectedly were suffered to pass without a hail . A jest , in Spanish , however , was sent into the fort by one of the rowers , and we shot up this enchanting stream . The tide in the river is but two feet , and in the bay , little more . Our course was instantly walled in by a lofty bank of nature 's masonry , sometimes almost perpendicular , and sometimes with a precipitous slope , I conjecture , fifty , seventy-five , and a hundred feet high . But imagine not that these beetling cliffs appeared in dreary , naked majesty , blackening in a tropical sun . From a few feet in the water , to the top of the height , is a matted growth of cane , and brush , and trees , glossy and brilliant with foliage and flowers , not a plant of which but was a stranger to my eyes . Many of the trees were exceedingly beautiful . The red mango tree runs high with a branchy top , and is as gay and thick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mahawa has something of a catalpa top , trunk , and limb , with a gay red flower on some of the trees , and a yellow flower on others ; and what struck me as a curious anomaly , on some trees were seen flowers , some perfectly red , and some perfectly yellow , so growing naturally , and not by inoculation . In crevices of the rocks , you occasionally discover natural beehives , which are found filled with honey , in situations difficult for the human robber to disturb their busy and well ordered commonwealth . The turns in this river are frequent , presenting the most diversified prospects ; the bank , now curving into an amphitheatre , and now fluted in the most beautiful swells , and hollows , as if the hand of art had been employed . Now you see a little hut of wattled walls and thatched roof , and a narrow bank of a rod or two , flourishing with great beds of sallads and cabbages , luxuriant in spite of shade . Here runs into the water a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they enjoy the water ; and there a still closer fence , to inclose the fishes , probably at the recess of the scanty tide . A duck came swimming along our passage so fearlessly , that the bargeman might almost have saluted him with his oar , and , when so near , dipping only , not flying . His form was different from all the ducks I have seen . Various birds appeared on wing , and perch , and on the water , whose forms , and feathers , and names , were all new to me. ' pp. *l-7. // The useless cotton-tree is a conspicuous object in many of the landscapes on this island , and the attention of the traveller is sure to be attracted by bibiaguas , a sort of little black ants , an unconquerable tribe of aborigines , great marauders upon every plantatation , Who carry on a perpetual war against the proprietors . As you approach this plantation , La Carolina , in the neighborhood of Matanzas , you discover one of the most beautiful and grand objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cotton-tree . It is not rare , almost every estate reserves one or more of these trees , in some favorable situation to gratify the eye ; for it answers no other human purpose ,  --  it is neither timber nor fuel . The cotton , however , I should not forget , which it yields in a very scanty crop , is sometimes used to stuff a pillow . One on the Santa Ana Estate , towers a hundred feet towards heaven , sixty-five of which , ascertained by admeasurement , are a smooth cylinder , without a limb or knot , twenty-seven and a half feet in circumference , six feet from the ground ; and near the base , where it spreads itself in the direction of its principal roots , like a giant bracing himself against the tempest , the fluted trunk has been measured , forty-six feet and a half . Were there nothing to be seen but this noble shaft , with its white smooth surface , it would excite admiration . But at the height already mentioned , it stretches forth its arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forms a top , for width and grandeur worthy of the trunk below . It has been measured and found to cover a diameter of one hundred and sixty-five feet . This immense tree is a world by itself , and is peopled by its millions . The wild pine-apple colonizes its top . Bajuca , or vines , vegetate on its extended limbs , and run downward to the earth coiling like ropes on the ground , which the thirsty traveller , when water fails him in this land of rare springs , cuts , and the sweet milky juice proves to him a delightful beverage . These vines , very possibly , answer another purpose of nature , who regards with tenderness her humblest offspring . The mice and rats , and opossum , who might find it difficult to ascend the plain surface of the trunk , may easily ascend these natural shrouds , and drink out of the cups of the pines , which stretch their leaves to catch and concentrate the rains and dews in those natural reservoirs. -I said this tree was peopled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may see among its branches the commonwealths of the comajen , or wood-louse . They are not peculiar to this tree . Their large , black cities are attached to the body of some limb , or safely repose in some fork of the tree , where they are a Chinese population , innumerable . This insect , about the size of a flea , forms a // covered way of ' a mortar of its own , down the trunk to the ground ; and as they have different public roads , it is probable that some are for ascending , and others for descending , so that the travellers may not incommode each other . This insect is harmless , and their populous nests are carried whole to the poultry yard , where I have seen hundreds , young and old , enjoying the repast , with all the glee of turkeys in grasshopper time . On the subject of insects , I will take this opportunity of mentioning the greatest **nnoyance to the planter , the.bibiagua , an ant of half the size of our black ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are powerful and formidable in their congregated , or social strength . On the Santa Ana estate , I witnessed the attempt to disinter and exterminate a tribe of these enemies . Near the house was planted a hedge of campeachy ; it is young and flourishing . One morning , Mr S. discovered signs of a nocturnal incursion . Leaves were dropped across the path , and the busy laborers had stripped the campeachy hedge of every leaf , for an extent of ten or twelve feet . The retreating enemies were traced by their path some rods on the surface to their entrance into a covered way . Here commenced the digging , and their passage , or arched way , was followed to the depth of sometimes two feet , and sometimes one , until it terminated in a spacious city . This was a collection of cells , in which were deposited masses of eggs , and astonishing numbers of the common bibiaguas , with a sprinkling of probably queen or mother ants , as we judged them to be , from their royal size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here in no small confusion , as a stout negro had plunged into the very heart of their citadel , and disregarding their bite , was transferring them , with hand and shovel , , to the blazing fire near by , and sometimes kindling with husks a quick flame to destroy them in their cells . We should , by stopping here , have but a limited view of this ingenious and populous nation . Its metes and bounds , its geographical limits , it is difficult to ascertain with accuracy , as they are subterranean in their highways , and in a great measure in their dwellings . Several cities and villages have been discovered , and the subterranean passages , connecting them in one commonwealth . I should think that from the entrance into the ground to which the marauders of the campeachy were traced , to the last town as yet discovered , may be twenty or thirty rods ; and who can tell where we are to look for their metropolis or frontiers ? pp. 10-12 . The following account is given of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Matanzas . The grinding is done on this e*tate by oxen but on many estates , as Dr Abbot somewhere else mentions , and we believe on // most of the extensive ones , it is done by steam-engines , which are peculiarly adapted to this use , since the heat necessary to boil down the cane juice , will work the engine , which can , accordingly , he applied in this manufacture with little or no expense for fuel . The engines , apparatus , and machinery used for this purpose , have been hitherto mostly , if not wholly , supplied from England . An agent of the manufacturers resides on the island , and contracts with the planters for the supply of the engines , and putting thorn in operation . After a superb breakfast , highly enjoyed with an appetite eager from a ride of ten or eleven miles , we sallied out to survey an extensive sugar plantation . Two volantes accomiiiodated the ladies ; the gentlemen first repaired to the mill , to witness a busy scene . A huge boiler , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot . A negro close by , with a mill turned by a crank , was providing the raw material . Two mills , with ten or twelve oxen harnessed in each , with a driver to each pair on the outside , and a general whipper on the inside , and a yell from the whole , which defies description , were keeping the mill in quick motion . When the cane had passed through the first pair of nuts , it was turned hack again through the second pair , ( the middle nut being one of each pair , ) by six wooden rollers called dumb turners , revolving parallel with the nuts . The juice fell copiously into an inclined trough , and passed off rapidly in an underground conductor , to join the cohfluent stream of the other mill . Together in a rapid and respectable tide , it disgorges itself into a reservoir , in the boiling section of this vast building , one story lower than the level of the mills . The mills in this manner deliver five hundred gallons in twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by a duct , to a large copper kettle , containing five hundred gallons , under which is kept a hot fire of wood ; - into this mass three tumblers of lime are thrown , as a refining process . Here it boils with violence , and rises crowned with froth and bubbles ; and as it is prone to overleap the limits of the kettle , there is a second rim rising higher , which controls the stray fluid and leads it into a reservoir close by , which may be called the save-all , for safe keeping . The next step is to transfer the refined juice into a duct , which conveys it into a tank , where the impurities sink to the bottom . Thence it passes by an easy conveyance to take its course through a row of three kettles , over a fire , . a gentler fire of dried ground cane . From the first kettle it is dipped out into the second by a negro with a copper bucket attached to a long pole , which operation he performs by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the third kettle it is transferred to a tank , // or large trough , against the wall , with a guard of boards on each side , that nothing may be lost . It is here brought to a state of granulation by two negroes , one at each end of the trough , dashing with the bucket on the pole , back and forth , and up and down , till it is felt or seen to be graining . It is at this trough that strangers and negroes have free access to cake off the sugar for their entertainment ; and invalids find it salutary to inhale the fumes of the neighboring kettles . In this state of granulated liquid , the precious mass is taken in an iron bucket to the pans , arranged in rows over an inclined plane . The pans are first wetted , that the sugar may not stick to them ; and are in the form of an inverted cone , with a hole at the bottom , which is stopped by a plug and husks , but not so tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling on an inclined plane , placed like a roof beneath , and running into casks below . Negroes returning from the field are required to call as they pass , and take each a pan of sugar to the purging-house , so called , till they are all removed . Here we will leave the pans for the present , to complete our view of the mill and boiling-house . Passing to the end of the building we look into the furnaces under the respective kettles , and find all are fed with dry cane , which has been through the mill , except the central fire under the clarifying kettle , which is heated hotter than the rest with wood . Great quantities of cane fuel are housed at hand , lest rain should unfit it for use . I may just remark that the negroes wear sandals in this business ; and that the pots , about to receive the granulated juice are wet to prevent its sticking , and that from the central clarifying boiler , the same process goes on to the granulating tank , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purging-house , we discovered a negro goading a pair of superannuated oxen , who were incapable of harder labor , round a post in the centre of a little pit , six or eight feet in diameter , for the purpose of treading liquid clay . Everythiub , of course , looked filthy enough . In this dirty hole is produced the mighty agent , through whose pollution purity is produced , and snowy whiteness is imparted to the dark muscovado . In the neighboring building , we saw it standing in rows , with the lower part of the cone in a hole , to drop the molasses again upon an inclined plane , which conveys it to a vat holding thirty thousand gallons . We saw seven thousand pans , each holding from thirty-five to fifty pounds of sugar . On the top of the sugar in the pan , a portion of the clay from the pit is placed , and by its magical power , it drives the molasses downward till the greatest part of the cone becomes white , and the bottom becomes tinged with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top entirely in a cake. , perhaps an inch thick The pots are once // more removed to a drying-house ; the white sugar is then severed from the darker , and cut and broken into small pieces , and exposed to the sun in driers on truckles , that in a moment they may be run under a roof in case of rain . The same is done by the darker sugar ; and both are next removed to the store , and boxed for the market , and sent eighteen miles , by land , on mules or in carts , to the Embarcadera , and thence by the Canimar to Matanzas , twelve miles . Five hundred gallons of juice yield about three hundred pounds of clayed sugar ; and as that quantity of the liquid flows from the nuts in twenty-five minutes ; and the operations of the mills and furnaces being simultaneous , and so managed that one part shall not wait day or night for the other , this mill and furnace establishment must send to the purging-house , the driers , and the boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ; sixteen thousand eight hundred pounds must be boxed each day , and something like one million pounds , to speak loosely , in a season . The molasses of this establishment is a heavy article , and would be an important item in the profits of the plantation , if the cartage did not nearly consume its price . The planter designs to set up a distillery on the premises , to raise the price , and diminish the carting of this branch of the economy of the plantation . The buildings on this estate ( and very small is the sum , which the palace has cost the owners ) have been reared at an expense of more than fifty thousand dollars . Though there are estates vastly larger than this , for its income , this may almost be esteemed a principality . When every expense has been deducted from the product of the two thousand acres , it leaves a net income of fifty thousand dollars per annum. ' pp. 22-25 . In a subsequent letter we are told , that one hundred and ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars ) are kept for performing the grinding and other work on this estate . An equal investment in steam-enginery would afford an equivalent , or greater power , and save to the owner a great part of the expense of keeping the oxen . Every one who has travelled in the interior of this island will hear testimony to the truth of Dr Abbot 's acknowledginents and praises of the hospitality of the planters . I am , ' says he , like the sailor crossing the line almost made to swear that I will not walk when I can iide , nor eat brown bread when I can get white , nor touch any secondary thing while there is a first which is better An ascent of one of the peaks of the Hacana mountains , // lying to the southward of Matanzas , near midway of the island from north to south , gives the author an opportunity of describing the general features of the territory . The approach to the mountain is through a sterile savanna , covered only with a blighted growth of grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which runs from thirty t ? forty feet high , having a stem only three or four inches in diameter , with a palmy top , curiously wrapped round at the insertion and below the leaves with a natural web , in which the leaves cross each other in diamonds . Much of the height we ascended on our horses , and securing them to palmettos we soon attained the first peak of the highest row , and passed from peak to peak , in what we supposed the trail of wild negroes , through grass and bushes , quite luxuriant , to the summit of the most elevated , which is estimated variously , from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet , above the level of the sea . Delightful views opened upon us , standing on this natural observatory . A savanna east , and another west , stretched a few miles at our feet , walled in by a necklace of hills , less high than that on which we stood . Beyond these , the eye rested on about thirty sugar *estates , easily discerned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coffee estates were still more numerous ; but the avenues , with which they are adorned , set with palm , and orange , mango , and other trees , both fruitful and beautiful , and shrubs and bushes of gorgeous flowers , were too distant to exhibit their charms to advantage . The Sumidero , in most parts of the circle , appears in high cultivation . We were not altogether fortunate in the morning , a thin fog lingering in the horizon . But the ocean was perfectly visible at the bay of Cardenas , and the sheet of water between the shore and the island in the bay , and the form of the island , lying northeast at the distance of about twenty miles . We expected to see the Caribbean sea , lying southwest . In a clear day it is distinctly seen at the distance , by estimation , of twenty-five miles ; but it remained a little doubtful to the last , whether we saw the water , the fog not wholly clearing away . It is certain , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the observer can entertain no doubt that a line of forty-five or fifty miles would reach from the Caribbean to the Atlantic . From this peak the heights of Camiraoca are seen in the range of the La Carolina , Mr B. 's estate . The mountains extend in an irregular way , west one hundred and twenty miles , north twenty , south five , and east about six miles . Beyond this limit , to the east* the island is a level country about three hundred miles , and from sea to sea . // As natural canals and rivers are rare , and the expense of transporting the bulky articles to market is often more than half their value , canals and rail-ways , at no distant day , may be expected to intersect the most fruitful and practicable parts of the island . The mountains of ilacana , except the tops of some of them , present a naked appearance . The sweet pea ; a beautiful rose on a myrtle-leafed vine , deep red , with a border on the under sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten or fifteen feet high , called by the Spaniards , pinca de sacra , or hedge aloes ; the nightblooming cereus , shooting its roots into the rocks , and winding about on their crags ; were the most considerable vegetables we saw upon them . ' pp. 33 , 34 . It is well known that the value of a newly imported African negro depends in part upon the tribe to which he belongs ; for it is a universal rule , both among freemen and slaves , with animals as well as human laborers , that the usefulness and productive capacity of the agent are very materially affected by the character and disposition , independently of muscular power . According to the accounts given to Dr Abbot , the Carrobalees are proud ; the Mandingos able-bodied , contented , and good laborers ; the Gangars thieves , and ready to run away ; and the Fantees revengeful . He relates an instance of this trait in a Fantee , on an estate which he visited . ( By boltea , our readers will understand , is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of correction bestowed on his wife by a negro-driver of his own nation , and he plotted revenge . He secured the door of his enemy , as he esteemed him , by a rope , and set fire to the bohea in two places . The first negro that burst from the building he stabbed , mistaking him for his enemy ; perceiving his error , he struck at the driver , as he next rushed out , who attempted to parry the vigorous blow with his whip , but it severed his jugular . The desperado next cut his own throat , and to be certain of death , plunged his knife into his own breast . ' Dr Abbot describes a tree which is called , by way of eminence , the beautiful ' tree . Its form , seen at a little distance , is globular ; the ramification so regular and full , and the foliage so thick , that it seems solid . It appeared as if dressed for exhibition , and as we drew near , a scarlet-breasted , or scarlet-crested bird ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ) was perched on its bosom , as a diamond pin in a lady 's kerchief . Mr. C. and myself dismounted , to examine this // far-famed tree . The diamater of the stem is three feet ; the diameter of the globular top is sixty ; and this , also , is its height . The limbs radiate with wonderful regularity , and though almost innumerable , scarcely any two of them are seen to chafe or cross each other . ' This tree is in the vicinity of Matanzas . We must not omit the description of the process of preparing coffee for the market . The extent of a coffee estate varies from one hundred , to three or four hundred acres ; but , most usually , we believe , is about two hundred , that is , six or seven cabalerias , a cabaleria being about thirty acres . In forming a new estate from the forest ,  --  of which the original growth is very heavy and luxuriant in the more fertile soil ,  --  the trees are felled and left lying upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among logs , and limbs , and leaves , which are considered to supply a good manure for coffee plants ; and the coffee is so much better in quality , and the product so much greater , on a new estate , that a strong inducement is held out for bringing new estates into cultivation , even though the market price is so reduced , as to afford little or no profit on the cultivation of an old one . To this circumstance we are inclined to attribute , in part , the long continuance of the surplus production and depression of price of this commodity . It is well known that the price has been falling for a number of years , and is so reduced that a poor estate will not now pay the expenses of cultivation , and a middling one will just reimburse the proprietor his incidental expense for supplies , without yielding him any rent , or any profit on the cost of his negroes . It is true that every commodity goes through a series of fluctuations , the periods and extremes of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time requisite to increase or diminish the quantity produced , the liability to be affected by the varieties of seasons , or the change of fashion and habit , or the spirit of speculation . The period of production , in the case of the coffee plant , is three years , this being the time from the planting of the seed to the gathering a crop from the plant . The quantity produced in the world is , therefore , likely to go on increasing annually for two or three years after the price is so reduced , as to offer no adequate motive to extend the cultivation ; for the plants already set out will not all come to maturity in a shorter time . Add to this , that planters go on increasing the quantity of the product , long after the reduction of the // price , hoping for a rise . These two causes would operate to prolong the gradual depression of the price for a long period , and to reduce it to a very low point . When we consider , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into cultivation , the very long continued , and at present very great depression of the price is not surprising , notwithstanding the actual increase , in the mean time , of the amount of the demand and the actual consumption . The plants are perennial , and in their wild state grow to the height of . eight , ten , or fifteen feet , according to the strength of the soil , and have a little resemblance , in this state , to our wild black cherry trees when young , though the top is less bushy . The cultivated plants are set at a distance of about five feet , in rows and squares , and are kept down to the height of from three to six feet by pruning , so that the berries may be within reach of the negroes to pick . The estate is laid out in squares from twenty to fifly rods in breadth , separated by alleys , some thirty , and others not more than ten feet wide , many of the wider ones being bordered with a row of palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament , though some of them are useful ; the palm branches , for instance , supplying a material for covering the roofs of the ho/teas , or negro huts . Many of these avenues are truly magnificent , and one may gallop through them , on one of the brisk little spanish horses , about sunrise on bright mornings , a thousand times , without becoming weary with their monotony . Scattered about among the coffee trees , are the plaintains , which grow to the height of twelve or fifteen feet , sending out a few broad leaves at their top , which hang over in the manner of branches , four or five feet ; and from the top of the stalk of the plant , is suspended a cluster of fruit , resembling in shape and size moderate-sized cucumbers , hanging to the number of twenty , thirty* fifty , or more , on a pendent stem of between two and three feet in length . This is gathered by cutting down the plant , the stalk of which is left on the ground for manure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addition only of a small quantity of jerked beef , brought from Buenos Aires , or herring , pork , or codfish , from the United States . This plantain is a simple , nourishing , and delicious food , and the production of it is one of the greatest ingredients in the wealth of Cuba . An estate of the dimensions we haxe mentioned will contain from one hundred and twenty , to one hundred and forty thousand trees , besides a // 217 pasture or portrero for the cattle , garden plats for the negroes , a small square in cane for fodder , and a small piece of forest at one corner of the estate , to shade the nursery of young coffeetrees . This patch of forest , intersected with avenues , and consisting of a stately luxuriant growth , is not the least beautiful part of the estate . A coffee estate , with its lime hedges on the borders , its avenues of palms , oranges , and various other trees , the names of which we forget , with its whole surface white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , with the scattered broad-leaved plantain , laden with its treasures of delicious fruit , in all the various stages from the blossom to ripeness , is an Elysian landscape ; but the occasional chiding , threatening voice of the driver , and the sound of the lash , remind the spectator that it is not in all respects a paradise . The coffee-tree will bear , on an average , for about twenty years , and as the plants are renewed here and there as they decay , and do not produce until the third year , one tenth part of them is unproductive . The prodoct is from a half to three quarters of a pound per year . The fruit is contained in globular shells or husks , each of which contains two of the berries , such as we see them in the market . They are picked from the husk when they have turned red ; the picking season commences in November , and continues until March . The fruit of the same tree does not ripen all at once , but the different berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same trees are picked repeatedly , at different times , until all the fruit is gathered . The negroes pick the fruit in baskets , which , when filled , they carry on their heads to the mill , or rather to the dryers , near to the house of the planter , and the huts or bo/icas of the negroes ,  --  alL the buildings being usually situated in a central part of the estate . The berries are placed upon the siccaderos , or plats for drying , until they are sufficiently dried , when they are deposited in large bins or compartments , in a store-house near to the mill , to be subsequently ground and cleaned . The dryers are formed with great care and neatness , and cover from a quarter to half an acre . They elevate the ground with a bed of lime-stone , beaten , to pieces , and raised in the middle of the bed , so as to have a gentle declivity , and surround the edges with a wall of a foot in height . This bed and wall are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a heavy VOL . XXIX. - NO. 64. 28 // beetle , to render it capable of sustaining all changes of weather . An incidefltal but important use of the siccaderos , is to fill an extensive tank with water , to serve the plantation through the dry season ; as brooks , I may say , they have none , and wells are rare , and sunk through stone for hundreds of feet , in this part of the island . On the dryers : the berries are kept stirring , lest they should heat . They are spread thin or thick , according to the extent of the vorks , which , as they have time , they extend from year to year . When the coffee in the cherry is dry , they rake it together in a conical heap , which they cover from the dews and rains with sail-cloth and moveable roofs of palm-leaves . From the dryers , the coffee in cherry is removed to the peelingmill . This is an octagonal roof ( 1 speak of the one now before me ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminating in a cupola . This roof , which runs high , is often the pleasant resort and building-place of large flocks of doves . ' pp. 51 , 52 . The next process is to grind or crush the berries under a stone wheel of about five feet diameter , revolving in a circle , precisely like that of a bark-mill in our tanneries , being moved by a yoke of qxen , or , most frequently , a couple of mules or horses , driven by a boy . His business is somewhat monotonous ; and we recollect a little negro at the Reserva , an estate of Mr N. Fellowes , whose employment was driving the mules , and who took advantage of the liberty his office gave him , to make some noise , and enlivened his labor and encouraged his mules by a sort of chant or recitative , which he kept up for half the time , setting to music and celebrating every incident which came within sight or hearing . If , for instance , he saw any persons approaching the house down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , sonorous voice , in musical recitative , stating the number of visiters , describing their appearance , the horses , equipage , dress , &amp;c . It was an ingenious device of the little slave , to make himself happy . After the shells or berries are sufficiently crushed in this mill , the coffee passes through a fanning-mill , which , if we recollect rightly , is precisely one ot our winnowing-rnills , such as are used for wheat ; and those used in Cuba , are , we believe , mostly supplied from the United States . Dr Abbot mentions two species of mills for fanning , or separating the grains of coffee from the husk or shells . The coffee-grains come from the fanning mill , mixed with more or less dirt , from which it is to be separated , and the coffee divided into two or // 219 three different sorts . For this purpose it is put upon a large table , of some twenty or thirty feet in length , and of the breadth of an ordinary dining-table , on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each grain of coffee , separating the fair and sound , from the broken and defective ; the latter is called triage , and sells for half the price of sound coffee , more or less , according to its quality , and the closeness of the picking . Dr Abbot , having passed some time with Mr Bartlett , Mr Sage , and other American friends , near Matanzas , travelled by land to Havana ; where , after passing a short time , he went southwesterly , sixty or seventy miles , to the southern coast of the island , visiting a great number of planters , among others Mr Fellowes , at the Reserva ; Mr G. D'Wolf , at the Buena Esperanza ; Dr Morel , a skilful physician , of a highly cultivated mind , and very pleasing manners , formerly of Philadelphia , and now at St Mark 's , a sinaI ! town near the southern coast ; Mrs Jouve , an intelligent and accomplished lady whose estate is romantically situated upon the mountains to the westward of St Mark 's ; Mr William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager of the Maryanna ; and describes an extensive estate , which we take to be that of Mr Souchay . Dr Abbot gives only the initials of the names of those whom he visited or met with . He informs us that he travelled eight hundred or a thousand miles in the interior of the island , and his journal ( for such these letters may be considered ) is full of interesting and useful information . In some letters , addressed , as we presume , to Mr Dane , Dr Abbot estimates the white population at two hupdred and fifty-nine thousand , two hundred and sixty ; free black population , one hundred and fifty-four thousand and fifty-seven ; slaves , two hundred and twenty-five thousand , one hundred and thirty-one ; making a total of six hundred and thirty-eight thousand , four hundred and forty-eight . Humboldt , he says , estimates it a little higher , namely , at seven hundred and fifteen thousand .. No enumeration has been made . Dr Abbot mentions one circumstance of verymaterial importance , in relation to the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability of the laws , in the island ; we mean the great number of small cultivators , denominated Montaneros , a sort of yeomanry , scattered about the island , and always able to suppress the insurrections of the slaves . The author says , He has been sparing of remarks as to the political state and // 220 . /lmerican Poems . prospects of the island . He believes that high destinies are before these islanders , rich in six thousand eight hundred square leagues of fertile soil , and , comparatively , with other slave-holding islands , strong in its free population , and a numerous yeomanry , armed and mounted . But they are not ripe for change . Remaining unoppressed , the mixed population will become morehomogeneous and patriotic ; and delay may prepare them ultimately , with union , with wisdom , and safety , to assume an attitude as dignified as their numbers , resources , and relative position entitle them to take .
