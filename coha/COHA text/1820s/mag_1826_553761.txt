THE constitution of Colombia resembles , in many of its great features , the constitution of the United States . Some of its most valuable provisions are copied almost literally from it . The executive power is confided to an officer bearing the name of President , elected for a limited time ; a vice president is chosen to discharge the executive functions , on the death or resignation of the first officer . The legislative power is vested in two branches , each possessing , on all subjects purely legislative , a negative on the proceedings of the other ; and both are elected for limited periods . The judicial authority is confided to a se // parate body of magistracy appointed during good behavior by the Executive , with the advice and consent of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and character to the two governments , they are alike , as they are also in many of the minor provisions , designed to give effect to these fundamental articles . But there is one respect , in which the forms of government established by the two republics is so essentially different , that they can not be considered as entirely bearing a common character , or a common name . The government of the United States is a confederacy of States , each reserving to itself unlimited powers of legislation on most local subjects , and on all subjects , of which the control has not been clearly surrendered , and maintaining distinct local legislatures for the exercise of these powers ; they also have their Executive and Judiciary in full exercise of the ordinary functions of those departments . The federal government has the powers , which are granted by enumeration ; these are generally such as apply to foreign relations , and general commerce . The government of Colombia is central , or consolidated . All the powers of legislation are confided to a single central legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local governments of the northern confederacy . The republic is divided into departments , and has also smaller subdivisions for the purpose of more convenient internal administration , but every officer is indebted for his authority , and owes responsibility , to the great central power , residing in the national metropolis . While the Congress of the one possesses all legislative power not expressly excepted , that of the other has none , which is not granted in a manner equally clear and formal . While the subjects , on which the one can operate , are as numerotis and diversified as the wants of civilized society , those of the other are limited and specified . In the constitution of the United States , enumeration grants power ; while , in that of Colombia , enumeration fixes the boundaries of a grant otherwise unlimited . The patriots , who were assembled to frame a government for the Colombian Republic , met at a moment of anxious trial . The enemy was within the country ; the patriot troops were unsubdued , but they were undisciplined and unpaid ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may readily be believed , that no men ever assembled under circumstances less favorable to mature deliberation , and where there seemed to be less prosrect of a judicious and bappy result . Frum witbiu , they had no // experience but what seemed to guide , and even to drive them to consolidation ; from without , they had the light , which the constitution of the United States gave them . They made use of both , in the way in which the sense of pressing danger at home , and the high reputation of the federal constitution , induced them to believe was best for their country . They adopted the plan of a central government , borrowing from the constitution of the United States most of the important provisions , which could be engrafted on a government of that form . In some of these provisions , the southern statesmen have made improvements , which might be wisely adopted by the elder republic , while in others , they have manifestly fallen below their great original . These points of difference will form the subjects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ultimately adopted , was not the object of first preference , with those who guided the revolution in its early stages . Two controlling reasons led them first to the confederate form ; the one was the brilliant example of the United States , and the other was the fact , that the confederate form would preserve to the provinces the separate independence , which many of them had declared . The present government was adopted under the firm belief , that the disasters , which had attended the revolutionary efforts , resulted in a great degree from the plan of association among the provinces before in existence , and that similar dangers could be averted only by the formation of a strong single government . Whether this opinion was well founded , or not , can now be no more than the subject of speculation ; but to one , who has acquired a tolerably accurate knowledge of the state of things then existing , and particularly of the moral and political condition of the country , it is difficult to resist the conviction , that any other plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous . The course , which the revolutionists have pursued from their first revolt , to the adoption of their present constitution , has been a gradual but constant march from the circumference to the centre of a circle . From the idea of independent governments , almost as numerous as the provinces in the country , they have gone successively , under the sense of the necessity of concert , through all the intermediate stages , to the adoption of a central government , and have suppressed all kind of authority not flowing from it . Not only in the countries now formnig the Republic of Colombia , but in most other parts of Spanish America , the // first efforts towards independence were made by local , or provincial assemblies , seldom representing more than one or two small provinces , and sometimes not more than a single city . This was the necessary effect of existing circumstances . There was no such interchange of views , or of intelligence , between different parts of the country , as permitted the necessary agreement for assembling a congress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be acting under one common anpulse , yet it was an impulse not produced by concert , but by the simultaneous operation of a great common cause . The next succeeding effort , after a declaration of independence , was to procure a general meeting of delegates , from the several revolting districts , to maintain the independence , which each had declared separately . But in some cases , in Colombia , each province designed to maintain its independent sovereignty , and to coalesce with others only for the purpose of expelling the common enemy . Entirely in this spirit , and with these views , Cnndinamarca , Popayan , Carthagena , and Venezuela , declared themselves independent states . This disposition towards a federal union was universal ; but the idea of a federal government , with some of them , extended only to a temporary one , which should expel , or subdue the enemy in the war , and leave to each its independence on the return of peace . An alliance offensive and defensive resembled much more nearly their conceptions of the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government did . The idea of a permanent federal connexion soon succeeded , but with very vague and indefinite views of the nature of that connexion , or of the nature or amount of the power to be surrendered to the general government . The first formal union of the revolted provinces , took place on the seventeenth day of December , 1819 , at Angostura , on the Onnoco , eight years after the royal allegiance was disavowed , during which time the war had been raging throughout the country . This was a union between the viceroyalty of New Grenada , and the captaingeneralship of Caracas , or Venezuela . The provinces , composing these two extensive districts , had previously abandoned their views of separate independence , and had become parts of the viceroyalty , or captaingeneraiship , of which they were provinces under the ancient government . But this change of views and surrender of sovereignty , on the part of the provinces , were not in every case evidenced by any formal act ; it seemed to come from the necessity of things , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Bogoth , the seats of the new , as well as of the old government , without referring to , or seeming to remember , their solemn declarations of indel ) e1*dence and separate government . Indeed , in some cases , no attempt was made towards maintaining that distinct independence , after it was declared by the provincial meetings ; the powers of the deputies seemed to cease after that act , and the meetings were dissolved , as if everything was done ; in other cases , where there was better concert among the chiefs , or greater confidence in their ability to resist the enemy , the aplearai*ce of independent action was longer maintained . This fundamental act of union , between these two great de ) artments , did not however yet designate the nature of the government to be established by them ; it provided only for a temporary government , and the convocation of a general concress to form * constitution for the new republic created by the union . Very few of the chiefs , at that time ; entertained views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the necessity of union first became apparent , the minds of all led them to a confederation of states , or provinces . The example of the United States , and the glorious success of their efforts , had been heard of by all , and was too brilliant not to be admired . The example was recent , successful , and well known . It could not fail to produce a very general confidence , that it would succeed wherever applied . If there were any then , who saw in the different situations of the two countries , and in the different character of the population , any reasons to doubt the success of the same experiment in Colombia , they had but little success in communicating their opinions to the mass of those , who were the principal actors . The great facts only of the North American revolution were known or attended to . The provinces , in the original renunciation of the royal authority , were influenced not only by a wish to throw off a distant and oppressive allegiance , but some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self government . The idea of assuming merely a provincial attitude , under any new form , was certainly not the first or favorite one . And although it can not be affirmed , that a different course would in any case have been pursued , it may be safely asserted , that the zeal , which quickened many of the South American patriots to proclaim independence , tinder circumstances extremely dangerous to their lives and fortunes , would have been much abated , if the opinion // had prevailed , that they , with their provinces , were to become only parts of an empire , whose metropolis was distant , and in which they could only have a remote and partial share of the power and the honors of govern meat . The time had not then arrived , in which it was possible to believe , that half a dozen provinces could not , without some controlling common authority , act sufficiently in union to sustain themselves against their enemy . All the predictions of defeat and disaster , under a connexion so frail , where the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were answered by a reference to the success of the United States , and to that confidence in self exertion , which is inspired l ) y valour and patriotism . Everything connected with the physical aspect of the country seemed to suggest the idea , or indeed impose the necessity , of independent action . Rivers long and broad , mountains lofty , and passable only at few and distant points , with wide spaces of uncultivated and savage territory , had made the inhabitants of the different parts of the country strangers to each other . There never had been , under the former dominion , any of that intimate association between the different provinces , which internal commerce and good roads would have produced , and which would now have contributed to unite the people , and cause them to look upon themselves as memhers of the same family . The Spanish policy had ever forbidden intercourse between different parts of the colonial dominions . No instance can be adduced , in which the inhabitants of one portion of a country had so little knowledge of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subject to the same common government , as those of the late dominions of the King of Spain in South America . There was very little communication , either for purposes of internal commerce or social intercourse . It was not believed that a loyal subject had any business away from his home ; and no one , unless he was a civil or military officer , was permitted to travel beyond his canton , without the strictest interrogation as to his motives and business . It is , however , probable , that some of those very causes , which at first fostered the idea of separate and independent efforts , arising from the difficulty of communication between remote parts of the country , and the consequent tardiness in the arrival of intelligence , were those which at last demonstrated the necessity of a closer political union , and strengthened the conviction , that unless the disastrous effects of these physical circumstances could be obviated , by the estab // lishment of a common central power , the patriot forces would be destroyed in detail . At what time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of government must be changed , is not known . it is obvious , from the speech delivered by Bolivar to the Congress of 1819 , that he then contemplated a government somewhat like the one since adopted . Very few , however , if any , of the political or military leaders , came to that conviction by any previous course of reasonino* the misfortunes of defeat , where there was no concert in action , and where hatred towards the enemy bad not yet calmed in* the chiefs all jealousy of each other , produced at last a general acquiescehee in the necessity of forming a common government , which should control and direct the efforts of all . That general acquiescence resulted in the establishment of the present constitution . This happy event did not take place , until ten years after the commencement of the war , marked by alternate victory and defeat . The Congress of Cucuth , generally denominated the Constituent Congress , assembled in the month of May , 1821 , and concluded and j ) ublished the constitution on the 30th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members , on their first assembling , as to the nature of the I ) olitical fabric to be erected , there is no written or certain account . It is understood , however , that the members were divided into three parties ; first , those who preferred the form afterwards adopted ; secondly , those who wished for a federal form resembling that of the United States ; and thirdly , those who desired to establish a government somewhat like that , which existed in the United States under the articles of confederation . The advocates for this last scheme were few in number , and composed of such only , as still maintained the opinions common at the commencement of the revolution . It soon appeared , that a large majority favored a central , or single government ; and it can hardly be doubted , that in the moral and political state of the country , great wisdom was shown in this opinion . The present constitution was adopted with almost entire unanimity . It was agreed to by many , who preferred the federal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary , during the continuance of the war , and that the return of peace would enable them to establish a different and more perfect form . To give this opportunity of judging by experience , and under circumstances more favorable for deciding wisely , what form // of government would be best suited to the people , a clausts was introduced , which directs that after ten years , when all the advantages and inconveniences of the present constitution shall have been discovered , a grand convention of Colombia shall be convoked by the Congress to examine it , or reform it entirely . ' * The example of the United States had a most extensive and happy effect , in diffusing among the people of South America a love of political independence , and a confidence in their ability to maintain it ; but it is certain , that the successful issue of the North American revolution , attained under the feeble government of the Confederation , had for a time an injurious effect , in the countries now composing the Colombian Republic , as it produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be attained under a similar government . This cause unquestionably conduced , with others , to delay the period at which an effective one was adopted . This part of the great North American example would lead to disaster in every case , in which it should be relied on by Spanis/i Colonists . A serious difficulty would present itself at once , in the ignorance of the practical details of government . In South America , so far from there being any regular legislative body in each province , there was certainly not one individual , who had ever been a legislator , and probably not a dozen , who had ever seen a representative assembly in session . It would have been necessary , not only to institute the general government , but also to create the state governments , and , indeed , to create the materials necessary to constitute them . In North America , it was only necessary to unite the previously existing states by one general tie ; in the South , they must have been first made , and then united . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been instituted at all , and put in the proper exercise of their functions , during the war ; but it is most certain , that with the materials , out of which they must have been formed , the whole machinery would have been of the rudest kind . These newly created legislatures would neither have had the skill , nor the necessary weight with the people , to give effect to their decrees . There were in the * Despues que una pr*ctica de diez 6 mas aiios , haya d*scubierto todos los inconvenientes 6 ventajas de la presente Constitucion , se convocar*r por ci Congreso una gran convencion de Colombia , auto* rizada para examinarla 6 reformarla en *n totalidad. . ikt. 191. , // provinces but few persons , who had any familiarity with the principles or forms of legislation ; and most of those , who were at all familiar with the forms of any kind of government , had gone off , or were in arms against the patriots . In the few cases , in which such persons remained , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heen difficult to create any local authorities , corresponding with the States of the North , and entirely impossible to make them correspond in anything but in name . While this consideration of the subject was conclusive , with the Constituent Congress of Colombia , against the adoption of a government similar to the confederation of 1778 , it was as justly conclusive , as things then stood , against a federal government under any form . In North America the only question was , Shall we unite the existing states under one common and federal head , or shall we consolidate them in one central government ? But in Colombia there could be no such question ; the only one which could be asked was , Shall we first make the states , and then unite them by a confederation ? If these local sovereignties had not existed in the Nortb , before the Revolution , nothing could have been more difficult , nor indeed more perilous , than an attempt to create them during the continuance of the war ; and it is not likely , that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . It is not then to he wondered at , nor to be regretted , that the statesmen of Colombia did not attempt , during the raging of a civil war , to create a federal government ; an attempt which would have involved the necessity of creating , at the same moment , all those subordinate powers , which , in the United States , had been the growth of two centuries . It must here be noticed , that although several of the provinces , in the territories now composing the Republic of Colombia , had , by meetings of the principal persons , declared themselves independent , still no legislative body , or regular government , was ever formed ; in some cases , those who proclaimed independence never assembled again , and in others , they were the representatives only of the capital , while the country , jealous of the little authority assumed by the provincial metropolis , refused to send delegates . The operation of the government , under its present constitution , has been thus far happy and successful . The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . From the recent temporary movements in Venezuela // we apprehend no serious consequences . Considering the imbecility of Spain , and the strength of some of the departments of the republic , partial successes might have been expected , and no doubt would have been obtained against the enemy by provincial enterprises , without any form of general government , but final success would unquestionably have been retarded , perhaps endangered ; and even yet some of the provinces would probably have been in possession of the Spaniards , if the present government had not been established . XVith the advantage of this concentrated power , simultaneous and successful efforts have been made against tile enemy , at Pdrto Cabello on the Atlantic , and at Guayaquil on the Pacific , positions more than four hundred leagues distant from each other . The party in Colombia , denominated the Federalists , is numerous , and composed of some of her most intelligent and worthy statesmen ; and they look with some anxiety for the arrival of the period , when a convention is to be organized to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent to the propriety of letting the subject rest for the constitutional period . A little impatience has been manifested in Venezuela . The citizens of Caracas , who once saw their city the residence of a captaingeneral , and possessed of all the power and privileges of a metropolis , are not wholly reconciled to the condition of being deprived of e*erything resembling their former political consequence , and are almost universally the advocates of a system of confederated states , or departments . This opinion prevails also in Quito ; nor can it excite surprise , that the inhabitants of those departments having cities , once the seats of political power , should not willingly see themselves so completely reduced to provincial insignificance . But if their views have been correctly represented , the system of government preferred by them would be the most unhappy , which could be devised . It is understood to be their favorite opinion , that the state should be divided into three great departments , corresponding with the ancient divisions under the Spanish government , that is , the viceroyalty of New Grenada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency of Quito ; and that the chief cities of each should be the seats of the local government . Whatever danger there may be of a separation between the different parts of the republic , this would certainly be fostered and increased by such an arrangement ; as thereby three great states , not very unequal in population and territory , would be created . // A more extended subdivision , one which would correspond in some degree with the states of North America , could alone be adopted with safety . In any division , making no more than three distinct departments , each would bear in strength and population too great a proportion to the general government . The difference between the whole and the parts should be much greater . The most judicious statesmen of Colombia think , that there can be no danger of separation , but from Quito or Venezuela , and that such danger would be greatly increased by constituting them single states ; they consider it desirable to render them weaker and more obedient members of the confederacy , by subdividing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federalists , who prefer the more minute division , also prefer to have the government remain in its present form , rather than be changed into one , which should provide for three state governments only . There are other points of difference between the constitutions of the United States and Colombia , which , although on important subjects , are not such as affect the general character of the governments , like the one just mentioned , but such as may afford interesting matter for examination and contrast . In the constitutions of both , the power of declaring war is vested in the Congress . This act of sovereign power , involving greater expense of money and of human life , and every way involving greater responsibility than any other , which can be performed by a political assembly , is submitted most wisely to the whole body of the legislature . It was justly thought , that it would be in vain to withhold from the Executive , many of those branches of authority , which all free constitutions concur in denying to it , if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently producing consequences endangering the perinaneat happiness of the people , were surrendered to it . But , nevertheless , most of the reasons , which go to show the propriety of confiding to the Congress alone this high act of declaring war , show , as conclusively , that the power of making peace should be lodged in the same hands . Indeed , the one seems almost a necessary consequence of the other . An authority to place the nation in a state of war , and the authority to judge of the propriety of continuing it in that state , seem to be inseparable branches of the same power . The framers of the constitution of the United States have thought otherwise . While they have given the power of declaring war to the Congress , representing // the whole body of those who have to pay and fight , the policy of continuing the war , the treaty making power , as it is called is submitted to another tribunal , to the President and Senate . These , without consulting the House of Representatives , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , which their judgment , or caprice may dictate . And this may be done at any time after the declaration of war , before any of the ends are attained for which it was declared . The merit of superior wisdom and prudence is due to the constitution of Colombia , which submits the ratification of every treaty to the Congress , thereby avoiding the inconsistency of giving to one department the declaration of war , and to another the power of determining the propriety of continuing it ; and avoiding also the collisions to which it may be justly feared , this distribution will ultimately give rise . In the whole range of legislation , there can scarcely ever occur any subjects more important , than those usually embraced in treaties . The*comnmerce , the navigation , the entire interests of the nation may be regulated by them ; a new direction may be given to the policy of the government , and the dearest interests of the people may be put in jeopardy by the terms of a treaty . A bill for erecting a lighthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except by the authority of the three branches of the legislature , exercised under its most tardy forms ; and yet a treaty , involving more than the legislation of a whole session , is negotiated , concluded , and becomes positively and irrevocably binding on every member of the state , without the assent of his immediate representatives . When the power of concluding a treaty , and judging of the terms of that treaty , which , when ratified , is the supreme law of the land , is exercised by the Executive , the legislative authority is deprived of one of its most essential attributes . Treaties frequently stipulate for the payment of large sums of money , or express conditions , the fulfilment of which requires new and extraordinary burdens on the people . If the legislature is under a legal or moral obligation , to raise the sums necessary for fulfilling such conditions , then it is deprived of the very power , which all free constitutions have designed to entrust to the legislature only , the power of raising public money , and judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit this inconsistency . By giving to the Congress the treaty making power , it has rendered the whole system simple , safe , and consistent . The same authority , which gives the final ratification to a treaty , // passes the necessary laws for complying with its conditions . There is no resort necessary to one tribunal , to redeem the pledges of the public faith made by another ; the case can not occur , in Wl ) iell the popular branch of the legislature may be called on to comply with the stipulations of a treaty , the time and conditions of which , it may deem utterly hostile to the public interests . It has been urged by some , that although true wisdom suggests , that we should oppose as many obstacles as possible to a declaration , which changes the attitude of a nation from peace to ivar , yet in returning to the state of peace , every facility should be given to the ratification of the treaty , by causing the consideration of it to pass under the ordeal of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to treaties simply of peace , whereas it is well known , that many others are negotiated and concluded , which impose burdens , and create taxes , but little less oppressive than those produced by war . The history of all ages declares to us , that the terms of a peace are frequently regarded as worse than war , and of course lead again to it , by the necessity of getting rid of the terms . But it may also be readily seen , that a war may be prolonged , and a peace , instead of being more easily obtained , may be postponed , by depriving the popular branch of the Congress of all agency in negotiating and ratifying the treaty ; for in that way much of its just influence in procuring the treaty , and determining when the true ends of the war have been obtained , is lost . It may be said , that the war can not be continued against the sense of the House of Representatives , in as much as that body may deny to the Executive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own proper influence in the government ; but this would only go to show the superior simplicity and excellence of that constitution , which effects its objects directly , and not by compelling one branch of the legislature to come in collision with another . No impediment is created in the negotiation of a treaty by multiplying the tests , to which it is to he subjected for its final ratification . The negotiation will be in every case conducted by the executive department , through its diplomatic agents , without any embarrassment from the authorities , which are ultimately to decide upon it . The treaty will be presented to the Congress for their decision , only after it has passed through all the ordinary forms . The language of all treaties declares on the face of them , that they are subject , for their final validity , to the ratifi // cation of the sovereign power at home ; there can be no delusion on the part of either contracting party . All treaties concluded by the authorities of Colombia declare , that they can receive their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . In practice no inconvenience has yet arisen ; the Congress has exercised its power of rejection in one case only . The framers of the constitution of the United States seem not to have given to this high power , that prominent importance , which its true character demands ; they seem rather to have considered it as incidental to the executive power , and to have supposed that all the necessary guards were placed , when it was enjoined that the , Executive should act only with the advice and consent of the Senate . In the old governments , the ratification of treaties had always been deemed a power peculiarly belonging to the person of the chief magistrate ; and the constitution of the United States , while , in requiring the acquiescence of the Senate , it shows an improvement on the ancient usages , does not yet seem to have attached to that power its true character . It was viewed under a different aspect by the statesmen of Colombia ; instead of regarding it as a necessary and harmless appendage of the executive authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , considering truly , that there was no burden which it might not impose , no surrender which it might not make , nothing which it might not embrace ; and measuring its importance in this way , they have guarded it accordingly , by granting its exercise to that authority only , to which is confided the power of legislation , the President and Congress . There is another provision in the constitution of Colombia , which is deemed valuable as being auxiliary to the principal one . The authority is expressly given to the Congress to require the Executive to negotiate treaties of peace . ' This clause can not have any conclusive effect on the formation of the treaty , as the terms of it must at last be submitted to the ratifying power , but it presents an easy and constitutional mode of expressing the sense of the nation , at whose expense the war must be maintained , and for the assertion of whose rights only it ought to be continued . This provision seems to be a very proper and consistent part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , whose ultimate acquiescence is indispensably necessary for the adoption of the measure , to manifest its readiness to give the necessary concurrence to the negotiation of the other department . // The provision of the constitution of Colombia , declaring the President ineligible beyond a second election , until there has been an interval of one term , merits unqualified praise . An opinion has been entertained , that the political knowledge , and familiar acquaintance with the interests of the state , acquired by long service in office , render the continuance of such individuals as have these opportunities safe and desirable . It has been urged , too , that a proper regard for the stability of public measures , in the system of the administration , should forbid a frequent change in the person of the individual , who is placed at the head of the government , and of course has the control of the administration . But in governments organized as are those of the United States and Colombia , no dangers are to be apprehended to the state , from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive , after the expiration of two terms or eight years . So far as skill in the high duties of his office , and practical familiarity with the interests of his country , are alleged as reasons for continuing the services of the same person , it may be truly said , that no individual can be elevated to the presidency in either country , without a long course of tuition and service , as a statesman , in the subordinate offices of the government . No splendor of talents , or local character , can avail him in seeking such an elevation , unless he is known to the nation , and known too by such a series of probationary services , as ensure a perfect knowledge of all the interests of his country . No new man can be raised to that dignity . It is not a station , to which he can be elevated to learn his duties , or to acquire the high knowledge necessary for fulfilling them . A deep conviction , that this knowledge has been already acquired , must have previously penetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom his election depends . The presidency will not be given for anticipated merits , nor as an incentive to future acquisitions ; it is not barely a capacity to improve , but only a mind already improved and matured , that can be trusted with this station . It is not doubted then , that in every case of the expiration of a constitutional term , there will be many citizens of the republic as well qualified to discharge the duties of the office , as the one who has left it , citizens qualified by a long tuition in the same school of public services . All arguments used to show , that an individual must be continued in the presidency , because he has there acquired qualifications , or a fitness superior to others , are wholly unsound . The practice of the United States de // monstrates , that no citizen can attain that station without age and long service . In regard to the stability of public measures , which some think might be endangered by a frequent change of the chief magistrate , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures do not receive their distinctive character from the Executive , nor are they principally dependent for their permanency on that department . The great scheme of political measures , which characterizes the administration , are such , as are suggested by the genius of the government itself , and not by the particular policy of the individual at its head . The views of different men on minor subjects of policy differ , as their degrees of wisdom differ , but the great system is suggested and controlled by the government itself . So far as the policy of the administration of the government can be varied , it is subject to be varied much more by the legislative than by the executive department . It is the legislature , of which the President is a constituent , but not a controlling member , that gives character to the public measures of the government . A President , who does his duty and no more , can only execute the system , of which he may have been an adviser , but which must have been principally instituted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the boundaries of his prescribed duties , he can not institute any policy in the administration , which may not be pursued and completed by other wise and disciplined statesmen , as well as by himself . While , then , there are no positive reasons for continuing the same individual in office for a great number of years , there are dangers resulting from it , which render a positive interdiction on the face of the constitution a very high recommendation , and of course the absence of such a provision , a just cause of regret . That the possession of power gives an increased inclination for its enjoyment , and a disinclination to abandon the situation , which ensures that enjoyment , the history of man too unfortunately proves . It is equally true , that the apparent probability of succeeding in attempts to retain it , beyond the legitimate period , excites , if it does not create , the inclination to attempt it . The few cases , which the course of time presents , of rare individuals , who have voluntarily resigned supreme power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument against the truth of the general position . These exceptions can be regarded only as ornaments to beautify the page of history . // The long enjoyment of supreme power weans the possessor from popular attachments , breaks that sympathy arising from common feeling and common interest , which he once had from equal association with his countrymen , gives to his mind the habits only of command , and causes it to revolt at the idea of obedience and a private station . When he sees no constitutional barrier to the retention of this power , his good dispositions may induce him to believe , that he can continue to exercise it beneficially for his country , and his bad ones , if he should unfortunately have any , will too certainly come in to delude and excite him . Government itself is rendered necessary , only by the frailty or viciousness of men ; and when the constitution of the government , by the omission of a guard , invites or enables an ambitious incumbent to indulge his passion for power beyond its lawful ends , a material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract this very natural inclination to acquire , and the too common inclination to abuse and continue power ; and none seems so salutary and simple , as one which shall refuse to the possessor such a protracted enjoyment of it , as would enable him afterwards to hold it ar'ainst the public opinion . Althou * , h , in the American republics , the executive authority is so limited as to embrace only a part of the powers , enjoyed by the supreme magistrate in the monarchies of Europe , still the powers confided to it are necessarily very great ; the patronage of the Executive extends to the appointment of all officers in the government ; it embraces , either directly or through channels of subordination to be traced to it , the whole annual expenditure of the government . These annual disbursements are already considerable , and if these nations increase in wealth and population , in the proportion which their present prosperity seems to indicate , in a few years the amount of public money to be expended at the will of the President , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There will be then in the hands of the chief officer of the Executive , a patronage so great , that if used with that design , an influence may be acquired by long enjoyment , dangerous to the liberties of the people , and menacing the true balance of the constitution . It must be remembered , that all the officers appointed by the President , and their numherless dependants , are interested in his continuance in office ; many of them certainly would be , and all of them might be , displaced by successful competitors . It may then fairly be assumed , // that in a competition of this kind , the great body of the officeholders , and their dependants , would ally themselves in favor of the reelection of the actual occupant . It is in ) possible to believe , that this state of things would leave the competition equal , or ensure to the disinterested part of the community a fair opportunity of securing the object of their choice . No mode seems so simple , and so certain to avert these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , declaring that the same person shall not be eligible after a given number of years . if these apprehensions can be justly entertained in a federal government , like that of the United States , where many of the ordinary branches of executive authority are in the hands of the state functionaries , there certainly would have been danger in permitting the reelection of the President for an indefinite succession of terms in Colombia , where to all the patronage possessed by the President of the United States , he unites that possessed by the governors of the states . But while the Colombian constitution can boast its superiority over that of the United States , in having this valuable provision for limiting the number of terms in the executive office , another principle of a very different kind has found admission ; one not only omitted in the constitution of the United States , but which may be regarded as entirily hostile to the opinions generally received , of the duties and powers of a legislative body in a limited government . It is declared that , Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of any of the articles of this constitution . ' * This is a power which must be considered as particularly objectionable ; it would be dangerous with the best , and ruinous with a corrupt Congress . It is but fair to say , that some of the politicians of the United States hold the opinion , that the Judiciary does not possess the power of declaring a law void for its repugnance to the constitution ; and the inference seems to be , that the legislature would in that case be the uncontrollable judges , not only of the expediency of the law , but also of its conformity to the constitution . To prevent that utter and general confusion , which would follow , if there was no tribunal to declare whether a law was justified by the constitution or not , it is indisputable that if this power is denied to the Judiciary , then the Legislature must be considered as giving the true construction in passing the law , and all other departments , // and all the citzens of the state must obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some statesmen , indeed , this is the only remedy existing in the case of an unconstitutional law . They say that the people must change the law by changing their rulers , but that until this be done , no tribunal can pronounce it void . Of this consequence there can be no doubt , if to the Judiciary is denied that power . But happily these opinions are confined to few . Not only the courts of the United States , but the people have long cherished the safe opinion , that the judicial department does rightfully possess the authority of determining , whether a law passed in its usual forms is permitted by the constitution . This in fact is the only doctrine , which can be tolerated in a limited government ; the government would otherwise cease to be limited , as the legislative authority would draw within its vortex all other powers . The boundaries prescribed would cease to he a safeguard , when the authority to be limited is itself the judge of the meaning and extent of the limitation . All restraints upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body to be restrained ; but the whole design is frustrated , whenever that body is permitted to judge without control , of the extent or construction of these bulwarks . Even with just men there is a disposition to believe , that public ' injury will not result from the exercise of power by them , and hence comes the inclination of all bodies to enlarge the sphere of their action , by giving a liberal construction to their own powers in all doubtful cases . The observations of Mr Jefferson , made to illustrate the defects of the constitution of Virginia , may be well used to show the character of a government , in which the authority of the Legislature is limited only by the opinions or forbearance of those , who exercise it . He says All the powers of government , legislative , executive , and judiciary , result to the legislative body . The concentrating these in the same hands , is precisely the definition of despotic government . It will be no alleviation , that these powers will be exercised by plurality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and seventythree despots would surely be as oppressive as one . Let those who doubt it , turn their eyes on the republic of Venice . As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves . An elective despotism was not the government we fought for ; but one which should not only be founded on free principles , but in which // the powers of government should he so divided and halanced among several bodies of magistracy , as that no one could traiiscend their legal limits , without being effectually checked and restrained by the others . For this reason that convention , which passed the ordinance of government , laid its foundation on this basis , that the legislative , executive , and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct , so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time . But no barrier was provided between these several powers . ' If therefore the Legislature assumes the executive and judiciary powers , no opposition is likely to be made ; nor if made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may put their proceedings in the form of an act of Assembly , which will render them obligatory on the other branches . They have accordingly in many instances decided rights , which should have been left to judiciary controversy ; and the direction of the Executive , during the whole time of their session , is becoming habitual and familiar . And this is done with no ill intention . The views of the present members are perfectly upright . When they are led out of their province , it is by art in others and inadvertency in themselves ; and this will probably be the case for some time to come . But it will not be a very long time . Mankind soon learn to make interested uses of every right and power , which they possess or may assume . The public money and public liberty intended to have been deposited with three branches of magistracy , but found inadvertently to be in the hands of one only , will soon be discovered to be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold them . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , and will be alike influenced by the same causes . The time to guard against corruption and tyranny , is before they shall have gotten hold on us . It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold , than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he shall have entered . ' * It has been said , that the oath of the legislator , and the right of the people to channe their rulers by election , form the legitimate securities against the passage of laws not authorized by the constitution . But the oath of the legislator is never introduced , or relied on , as an effectual , independent guard ; it is only considered an auxiliary defence against transgression , operating on the mind of a conscientious , or timid man . From the very nature of an oath , while it gives security , with honorable men , against the wilful perversion of power , it can give none against * Jefferson 's Notes , Chap . xiii . Constitution . 1*OL . XX1II. - NO. 53. 43 // their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , it gives none in the very cases hi which it is most required , in cases of bold and hardened vice . But it frequently may happen , that laws will be passed in violation of the constitution , without any imputation on the honesty or moral purity of the members ; political excitement , the violence of party , or sheer inadvertence may produce this result . In those cases , the intervention of another tribunal , where the feelings of the members have not been enlisted in party controversy , whom the angry collisions of popular debate have never reached , whose official situation is permanent and independent , who can have no unworthy motive to abridge or enlarge the powers of the Congress , and whose previous education fits them for judicial investigation , is necessary to declare to the country , whether the true boundaries of granted power have been observed by those , who were entrusted with its exercise . Without the interposition of a firm judicial tribunal , there can be no permanence , or uniformity , in the construction given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the persons of its members , and constructions given by one Congress may be frequently changed by the next . The constitution will cease to be stable and certain in its meaning , under the multitudinous and ever varying cxpounders . What is constitutional now , may no longer be so after the next election . This will be the unavoidable result , without ascribing to the Congress any character but that , which belongs to all numerous representative bodies . It can not be admitted , that the power reserved to the people , at their periodical elections , of ejecting their old and electing new rulers , by whom the objectionable law may be repealed , is sufficient to avert the mischievous consequences , flowing from a denial to the Judiciary of the right of declaring it at once unconstitutional and void . The security furnished to the people by the elections in Colombia is distant , and inadequate when applied ; it may produce the repeal of the law , but it can not prevent its present operation and mischiefs . And , moreover , the repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which they were before its passage ; by the passage of a law , many rights are created or affected in a great number of ways , which must still continue to have an existence , after the law has been stricken from the statute book . Indeed , this consideration alone is sufficient to show the manifold mischiefs springing from the doctrine , that the Judiciary can not declare void a statute violating the consti // tution . If this can not be done , then valid rights can be created by such statutes , which must be enjoyed inviolate , and may continue to be so enjoyed for years after the public sentiment has been pronounced against the violent act , which gave them existence . And it appears from this view of the subject , that the effect of a law upon the interests of society would be prccisely the same , whether it were permitted or forbidden by the constitution . For if it be once conceded , that the judges can not pronounce a statute void in any case , then they must execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it is repealed by the same authority which enacted it ; and this is true even if it should be a bill of attainder , a law manifestly ex post facto , or one declaring that there might be a conviction in a trial for treason on the testimony of one witness . To each house of the Colombian Congress is granted the usual power of punishiug* or expelling a member for improper conduct . But to this salutary and necessary power , is added one which must be considered pernicious , and suhversive of the rights of election . To each branch of the legislature is given , not only the power of expelling a member , but , also , on a vote of two thirds , of declaring him unfit for holding any other office of trust or honor in the republic . ' * This is a power , which neither the constitution of the United States , nor of an ' of the states in the Union , has given ; in almost every ease the power to expel a second time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle , that when the offence or criminal charge is known to the people , and they still think proper to reelect the person expelled , he has then l ) assed the final ordeal ; and that no legislative body can disqualify a man for the public service , upon whom the people have passed their sentence of approbation or of pardon . Large representative assemblies have never beon distinguished for freedom from caprice or passion ; and to give to an assembly , constituted as they ever must be , an authority to disqualify a citizen for * Cada c*mara tiene el derecho de establecer los reglamentos que deba observar en sus sesiones , debates , y deliberaciones .

The worthiest citizen , in times of public excitement and party heat , might , by this parliamentary ostracism , be cut off from public usefulness for ever . And this power seems to be still more objectionable , when it is remembered , that expulsion may be , and frequently is , applied in punishment for offences , in no way infamous ; and that expulsion generally takes place upon a single vote , without those delays of form and time , which are prescribed for the passage of ordinary laws . In this way some of the severest penalties of an attainder might be visited on a citizen , not by the legislative authority of his country , but by one branch of the legislature ; a high punishment might he imposed without the sanction of a court of judicature , or any manner ofjudicial proceeding . In the organization of the two houses , constituting the Congress of Colombia , other principles are admitted , which are liable to strong objections . The senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department or province which he represents ; he is eligible not only from the department in which he resides , but also from the one in which he was born , although he may not have been in it since the days of his earliest infancy . That the representative should be an inhabitant of the state , or department for which be is chosen , seems essential to ensure most of the purposes of his election . Otherxvise lie may be a nominal and legal , hut he can not he a real representative of his constituents ; he may bind them by his votes and his acts , but he can not represent their feelings or interests . In a government embracing a great extent of territory , it is in vain to expect that the representative principle can be brought to its per .. feet practice , unless this principle of subdivision is also applied . If under the omission of this principle , it should happen that most of the members should come from the same part of the country , leaving some other parts without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wants and situation of many of the citizens of the republic . And when this should occur even in one instance , a portion of the people would be left without that direct and immediate representation , which is essential to present , explain , and enforce their rights , because under such circumstances they could not be adequately felt or known . But it may be said , that the people themselves will create the best defence against such an evil , by not electing any one , who is not a resident of the district to be represented . The experience of // Colombia already contradicts this ; cases have occurred in which this rule , so obvious and salutary , has been disregarded . An argument , which would go to show that local residence in the member might he safely dispensed with , under the idea that a sufficient security would always be found in the good sense of the people , would go too far ; such an argument would prove , that all constitutional qualifications might be dispensed with , and that the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him against an improper selection . Unfortunately all experience contradicts this ; even when his good sense in the selection is aided by multiplied guards and qualifications , he is not always able to protect himself against an injudicious choice . This has been the opinion of the wisest statesmen . We see that the framers of all modern constitutions have thought it useful to declare , that the high officers of government , whether belonging to the executive or legislative department , should have prescribed qualifications either of age , residence , or citizenship . Although in a government , in which the principles of civil liberty are well understood , and education is generally diffused , it is known that great and just reliance can be placed on the judicious exercise of the elective franchise by the people , still he would be deemed a most adventurous politician , who should advise , that all constitutional qualifications should be dispensed with iu the elected . The example too of Great Britain proves to us , the necessity of chartered protection in this case . A very large portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the districts for which they are chosen ; this may not be regarded as a great inconvenience , where the whole territory embraced by the government is small , and the inhabitants of each part of it may be supposed to have a competent knowledge of the interests of the others ; but it is cited to show the facility , with which elections may be secured by persons having no connexion , by residence , with the electors ; and to show that the good sense of the people should never be considered above protection , by judicious constitutional guards . There is another provision connected with this subject , which places the representative still farther from his constituents . It is declared that the senators and representatives hold their character for the nation , and not for the department , or province , which elects them ; and that they are not to receive orders or instructions from the electoral assemblies , which can only pre // sent petitions . ' * It is not at all necessary to go into an exarnination of the propriety of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into the question whether such a principle exists without any special provision , as here the representative must be a resident of the state , and , in practice , is almost invariably a resident of the district , which elects him . Imperative instructions to a member , so intimately connected with his constituents by interest , feelings , and residence , could rarely be necessary . But in those cases , in which the representative resides beyond the limits of his department , or province , there seems to be no adequate mode of making him fully acquainted with the interests of his constituents , or indeed of securing anything like a just representation of them , but by subjecting him to mandatory instructions , on those occasions , which they may deem sufficiently important to require them . Where the residence is distant , and there can he no intimate knowledge of the concerns of the people , no very strong inducement to undertake or pursue them , and no constitutional mode of coercing obedience , there is left very little of the substance or theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this constitution . In violation of that fundamental distribution of the supreme power , into the three great departments , legislative , executive , and judicial , which is declared in the usual language , officers belonging to one of those departments , may , also , with a few exceptions , be officers of either or both of the others . It is but just to state , that these exceptions embrace the President , Vice President , the different Secretaries , Intendants , and those other officers who may be excepted by law . The duties and the emoluments of the first station are suspended , on the acceptance of the second , hut the office is not resigned , nor vacated , and may be resumed at pleasure . In this way an officer of the army , or of the customs , may be a foreign minister , or a member of Congress . Tb is principle is fundamentally wrong , and particularly dangerous in its application to members of Coiigress . They should hold but one office ; all other officers are subject to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , annual salary , or contingent emoluments of an office * Los senadores y representantes tienen este caracter por la nacion , y no por el departamento 6 provincia que los nombra ; ellos no pueden recibir 6rdenes ni instrucciones particulares de las asembleas electorales , que solo podrt*n presentarles peticiones . Art . 64. // of which they hold the ultimate ownership , and the duties of which they may immediately resume , they are acting for themselves . And , without supposing actual corruption , there is certainly an entire absence of that freedom from all improper temptation , which should exist . In the Congress of Colombia , under the sanction of this clause , are many officers of the army , and several of the navy . The Vice President himself , who has almost ever since the organization of the government discharged the duties of the supreme Executive , is a general of division in the army ; Commodore Padilla is a member of the Senate ; and Sucr* , the victor at Ayacucho , is a senator , general of division , and minister plenipotentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they are discharging those civil functions , yet , wheneve.r the interests , or supposed rights of the army or navy , become subjects of legislation , the people may well fear , that human infirmities will display themselves to their cost and injury . Under the most favorable circumstances , a victOrious and unpaid army presents many dangers to its country , at the close of a revolution ; but when the supreme legislation is in any degree in the hands of that army , there is ground for apprehension , that its permanent footing will be fixed on foundations , nowise favorable to that complete subordination to the civil authority , which is essential to the liberties of the people . It is gratifying to know , however , that the civil duties , assumed by military men , have been so far discharged with great propriety , and apparent disinterestedness . A very wholesome jealousy of military influence has been diffused among the people , and the elections will go far towards correcting the palpable defect of the constitution . The admission of the iidlitary into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the alleged necessity of opposing them , and their liberal opinions , to the influence and illiberality of the clergy , if the admission of the cler0y was unavoidable , as it is said to have been , then , indeed , the objection against permitting officers of the army to have seats in the legislature , is much weakened . All the most liberal and judicious schemes , for the melioration of the country , have been supported by the military . They have been generally the advocates of abrogating the old monopolies and repealing the burdensome export duties , and have made some most salutary inroads upon the ancicut system of tithes and // other ecclesiastical dues . Few xviii doubt , however , that the constitution should have interdicted the admission of the clergy , the military , and all others holding office , to seats within the walls of the Congress . In the constitution of the United States there is no such prohibition , as it regards the ministers of religion ; nor was it at all necessary ; we had no national religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain such a predominance , as to create a system of legislation favorable to itself , and burdensome to the body of the people . But in Colombia , although there is happily in the constitution an entire silence on the subject , yet there is in truth a national religion , supported in practice and by the ordinary laws as such . A numerous and powerful body of clergy is sustained , under the laws of the country , by taxes imposed upon the people , in the very burdensome shape of tithes . In regard to this subject of eligibility to office , there is an extraordinary omission in the Colombiaxi constitution . No pro*-vision is made for preventing a member of Congress from accepting an office , created during his term of service . ? In republican constitutions , it may justly be deemed an object of solicitude to free the mind of the representative from the hopes and fears , which may divert him from an independent devotedness to the interests of his constituents . One of the most obvious means of promoting this intellectual independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any public post created while he is in office . In the constitutions of several of the North American states , this salutary caution is carried so far , as to render the member ineligible for one year after the expiration of his term . This is considered as the perfection of the principle . In that case no inducement is held out to the representative , either immediate or remote , to desert the interests of those , whose interests should ever be regarded by him as superior to his own . The honor of a representative may be a sufficient safeguard against the desertion of his trust , but when you bind both his honor and his interest , you then have all the guaranties , that human prudence can give ; and when the liberties of a people are involved , less than all should never be considered as enough . The qualifications , which give the right of suffrage in Colombia , are the following . The individual must be a Colombian , native or naturalized ; of the age of twentyone years , or be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although this // qualification is not to be demanded until the year 1840 ; he must have a real estate of the value of one hundred dollars , or have some office , profession , or trade , not being dependent on another as journeyman , or servant . And the right of sujfrage is lost , by taking any employment under ai*other government without the leave of Congress ; by any judicial sentence imposing an infamous punishment , until the individual is restored by law ; by a person selling his vote , or buying that of another , either for himself or a third person . And the exercise of this right is suspended , in lunatics ; in vagabonds and insolvents , declared such by law ; in all those against whom a criminal prosecution is depending , until they are acquitted , or condemned to a punishment not infamous ; in ( lebtors to the public treasury . To be eligible to the House of Representatives , the candidate is required to have all the qualifications of a voter ; to be at least twentyfive years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province for which he is elected ; to have been a resident of the republic for the two years next preceding his election ; to possess a real estate of the value of two thousand dollars , or have an annual income of five hundred dollars , or be a professor of some science . Those , who are not natives of Colombia , must have been resident eight years in the country , and have a real estate of the value of ten thousand dollars . A senator is required to be thirtyr years of age ; to be a resident , or native of the department for which he is elected ; to have been a resident of the republic for the three years next preceding his election ; to be owner of a real estate of the value of four thousand dollars , or to have an annual income of five hundred dollars , or to be a professor of some science . Those who are not natives of Colombia must have been resident twelve years in the country , and have a real estate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , in addition to all the ( jualifications of a senator , be citizens of the republic by birth . The elections of members of the two houses of Congress , and of the President and Vice President , are in no case made immediately uy the people , but by electors chosen by them every four years . These electors assemble at a designated place in each province , and proceed to vote for a President , Vice President , four senators ( the number to which each department is entitled ) , and as many representatives as the province , by its population , is // authorized to elect . In the case of the representatives , the balloting continues among the electors , until the requisite number shall have received a majority of all the votes given . But with reward to the other officers to be elected there is to be but a single ballot among the electors ; the register of the vote is then sent to the Congress , and opened in the presence of both houses , and those persons , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional majority , are declared duly elected . When the full number , to be elected as senators , have not the required majority of the votes tioin the provinces composing one department , the members of both houses of Congress , voting per capita , elect thc deficient number , one by one , from the three highest on the list . In the election of the President , no one is considered as chosen , unless he have a majority of two thirds of all the votes given in the electoral colleges . XVhen no person has received that majority , the President is elected by the Congress from the three candidates highest on the list . this mode differs in one essential point from that prescribed in the constitution of the United States , and in that difference it is unsusceptible of vindication . In requiring a vote of two thirds of the electors to secure the election , the influence of the people is greatly diminished , as the choice is almost certainly removed from them . In almost every case a resort must be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be justified , when there is a great diversity of opinion among the people , and which should never be thought of , when any one candidate has an absolute majority . The mode of election also differs , in allowing to each member of both houses one vote ; this difference , however , results from the original difference in the frame of the government . Although the senators represent distinct departments , these departments are nothing more than convenient divisions of territory , created by the Congress , with none of the attributes of the states of the North . The regulations with respect to the election of the Vice President are , in every particular , similar to those in the election of the President . Except when the Vice President is called on to administer the government , on account of the absence , or death of the first officer , he is a member of the Executive Council . tie does not preside in the Senate . The members of the House of Representatives continue in service for four , and the senators for eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body is renewed every four // years . It is perhaps impossible to fix with precision the exact time of service , which is most favorable to the liberties of the people , and the proper independence of the representative ; but it may be doubted whether the duration of the term , as designated in the constitution of the United States , could be increased , without removing the representative farther from the control of the people , than would be consistent with that responsibility , which he owes to them . So far , therefore , as there is a deviation from that term , it is believed that the Colombian constitution has failed in attaining the excellence of the other . In the election , too , of the members of the house of Representatives , the removal of the immediate choice from the people can not be vindicated . The election of the popular branch of the legislature , directly by the people , has ever been deemed the simplest and the purest mode of selecting the members of that body . A just sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only when they see , as the principal actors in it , those who derive their authority immediately from themselves , and with whom they have some personal acquaintance . Any system , which denies to the citizens of the commonwealth generally , all agency in the immediate election of their representatives , would go far towards estranging all feelings of favor from the governn ic nt , would produce a dangerous indifference towards its administration , and ultimately cause them to regard it as a distant and alien one , which merited little care for its support and continuance . The apportionment of representation is regulated by the following rule ; every thirty thousand souls in each province entitles it to a member , until the number in the House of Representatives shall equal one hundred , but when there is an excess , or fraction , of fifteen thousand , an addhional member is allowed to the province ; when that given number in the representation of the house is reached , then forty thousand inhabitants is assumed as the ratio , until the number is increased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls are necessary for a member . This regulation is considered as a very happy one . It has the effect of preventing entirely that angry dissatisfaction which occurs whenever an apportionment of the representation takes place , produced by the apparently harsh operation , which the assumed standard must have in particular cases . XVhen the rule is fixed in the constitution , there is nothing left for the legislature , but to apply it . This regulation has the effect , too , of postponing // for a great number of years , the time at which the House of Reprcsentatives can arrive at an inconvenient number . The provision would have been greatly improved , however , by fixing a maximum , beyond which the number could not in any event go . The republic is divided into twelve departments , each of which is entitled to four senators . I ' he power of impeaching is in the House of Representatives , and that of trial in the Senate , who convict upon a vote of two thirds . When the Senate is sitting as a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high court of justice to assist it on judicial points . The rules , which govern the houses in the discharge of their legislative duties , are such as are usually observed in assemblies of that kind . The Congress meets on the second day of January each year . The session can only continue for ninety days , unless it is prolonged for thirty days more by a vote of both houses ; beyond that period the session can not be continued . The President can convoke both houses , whenever he may think the public service requires it . The attributes and duties of the Executive do not materially differ , from those assigned by the constitution of the United States to the President . The power of putting the negative on the passage of a law is the same , except that in Colombia , when a bill has passed both houses as urgent , it must be signed , or returned by the Executive within two , instead of ten days . The President of Colombia can , in cases of capital conviction , pardon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who presided at the trial . He may suspend from their employment any unfit or delinquent officer , but must forthwith give advice thereof , and the reasons of his proceeding , to the proper tribunal for prosecuting or impeaching . He can not command the army in person , unless with the assent of the Congress , and in that case , the civil duties of the Executive are to be immediately assumed by the Vice President . He can not go beyond the territory of the republic , during his presidency , nor for one year thereafter , without the leave of the Congress . An Executive Council is provided by the constitution , coinposed of the Vice President , one of the judges of the high court of *ustice , and the four Secretaries . The President is authorized to take their advice on all subjects , on which he may require it ; but he is imperatively required to take their written opinions in the following cases , namely ; in the consideration of // a bill , which has passed the Congress , and is presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures for conducting a war ; in nominating to the Senate foreign ministers and military officers ; in making all appointments in the recess of the Senate ; in suspending an officer for unfitness or improper conduct ; in granting pardons ; and in declaring martial law , which he is authorized to do in case of insurrection , or sudden invasion , in which case the Congress is to be immediately convened . The President is , however , not obliged to follow their advice in any case ; hut a register of all their opinions is to be preserved , and prcsented annually to the Senate for their examination . The creation of this Council was no doubt designed to aid the Executive in the discharge of his high duties , and also to operate as a check on any wilful or capricious exercise of his powers . The necessity of keeping a record of those opinions , and particularly the obligation to present a copy of them every year to one branch of the legislature , will go far towards preventing any violent or corrupt conduct in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . member of the Council holds his office by a tenure entirely beyond the control of the President . All of them , except the Vice President , owe their original appointment to his nomination , but none of them are removeable by him . Notwithstanding these apparent advantages in the organization and power of the Council , in preventing the adoption of hasty and unconstitutional measures , it may well be doubted , whether the tendency of it , under its present organization , be not more injurious than beneficial to the public affairs . Any system , which compels the Executive to receive , and submit to the Congress , the opinions of those who are not responsible to him , must have an unhappy effect upon the exercise of his public functions . He is at last the responsible person to the nation , and to the Congress , for the measures which he shall adopt , and , under the virtual control of an irresponsible Council , his mind can not be so independent and free to pursue its own dictates , as it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is done or omitted . When an officer is not permitted to protect himself under the advice which he receives , more injury than good will result from compelling him to hear it , especially when he is farther compelled to promulgate it . The Secretaries are required to give to the Congress , upon the order of either house , written or oral expositions on all subjects connected with their departments . This power is frequently // used by the Congress ; the Secretary of Foreign Affairs is called on , to give explanations of the views of the Executive upon subjects of foreign negotiation , and to vindicate the policy of treaties and other conventions , offered for the ratificafion of Congress , whenever it is thought necessary . The other secretaries are also frequently introduced under the order of the house , to explain anything within their duties , that may not be understood or approved . With regard to the foundation , on which the Judiciary is placed , no particular observation is necessary . The Judges hold their office during good behavior , and receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , a mode is pursued somewhat unusual , and designed to ensure the most tinexceptionable selections . Three persons are nominated by the President to the House of Representatives , the house reduces the number to two , and presents them to the Senate , from whom that body designates the judge . For purposes of internal administration , the republic is divided into Departments , the number of which is to he regulated by Congress . Over each of these an officer presides , denominated an Intendant . Each department is divided into i*rovinccs* over which a Governor presides . These provinces are again divided into Cantons , and these into Parishes . In these are officers denominated Alcaldes , answering very much to justices of the peace in countries where the common law prevails . The A* OYYs have jurisdiction , not only in judicial matters of small amoirit , but also in matters of police . As the powers of the government of Colombia do not depend , for their existence or extent , upon any specific grant in the constitution , hut all are embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied to it , the list of interdicted powers becomes much more important , than the corresponding interdictions in the constitution of the United States , where they have been introduced , not as essentially necessary , but only through abundant caution . The constitution opens with a declaration indicative of the sense , which its framers had , of the magnitude of their duties , and of the high situation in which they stood ; We the representatives of the people of Colombia in General Congress assembled , fulfilling the wishes of our constituents , to fix the fundamental rules of their union , and to establish a form of government , which may secure to them the blessings of liberty , // security , property , and equality , so far as it is given to a nation so to do , which is commencing its political career , and is as yet struggling for its existence , do ordain and declare the following CONSTITUTION . The Colombian nation is forever and irrevocably free and indepeiident of the monarchy of Spain , and of every other foreign potentate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , the patrimony of any person or family . The sovereignty resides essentially in the nation . The magistrates and officers of government invested with any kind of authority , are its agents or deputies , responsible to it for their public conduct . It is the duty of every Colombian to live obedient to the constitution and the laws ; to respect and obey the authorities , which are its organs ; to contribute to the public expenses ; to be ready at all times to serve and defend his country , and to make to it the sacrifice of his property , and of his life , if it be necessary . ' XVe here present the substance of some of the provisions , intended to secure the rights of person and property to the citizen , against all attacks from the constituted authorities , as they are found under the eighth title of the constitution . Every Colombian has a right freely to write , print , and publish his thoughts and opinions , without any previous examination or revision , he being responsible to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which every citizen has of claiming his rights before the proper tribunals , shall never be obstructed or limited ; on the contrary , he shall find a prompt and secure remedy in the laws for any losses , or injuries , he may sustain in his person , his property , his honor , or his reputation . Every person shall be presumed innocent , until declared guilty according to law ; and if it shall be previously necessary to arrest him , no more rigor shall be used , than is indispensable for securing his person . No person shall be seized , or imprisoned , unless by virtue of a warrant signed by the magistrate , to whom the law gives this authority ; the warrant shall express the grounds of the arrest ; and a copy of it shall be delivered to the prisoner , No jailer or other officer shall receive or detain in prison any one whatever , unless under a warrant issued and signed as above . All persons shall be deemed guilty of the crime of arbitrary detention , and shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause any one to be arrested , without legal authority . // No one shall be tried by special commissions , except by the ordinary tribunals established by law . No one shall be judged , much less punished , except by virtue of a law passed anterior to the crime , or offence , and after having been heard in his defence , or legally cited ; nor shall any one be obliged or admitted , in a criminal case , to give evidence against himself . No house shall be subject to search , except in cases determined by law , and under the responsibility of the judge who issues the order . The private papers of individuals , and their correspondence , shall be inviolable , and shall not be liable to examination , or to be intercepted , except in cases expressly prescribed by law . The infamy of punishment shall not be visited by law upon the family or relations of the offender . No one , but those who are in the army or navy , or in the militia when in actual service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishments provided by it . Entails are prohibited . All titles of honor granted by the Spanish government are abolished ; Congress shall not grant any title of nobility , or hereditary distinction ; nor create any office or employment , where the salary or emolument shall continue longer than the good conduct of those who serve in them . No one , who enjoys any post of trust or honor under the republic , shall accept any title , gift , or emolument from any king1 prince , or foreign state , without the consent of the Congress . No money shall be drawn from the public treasury , except for objects fixed by law ; and there shall be published every year , a regular statement of the receipts and expenditures , for the information of the people . All foreigners shall be admitted into Colombia , of whatever nation they may he ; and they shall enjoy in their property and persons the same security as citizens , so long as they respect the laws . Oae of the first duties of the Congress shall be to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the advantages of the institution are well understood , it shall be applied to all cases civil anti criminal , in which it is commonly used in other nations . ' The language of this last clause is somewhat vague , it seems , however , to have been intended to require of the Congress imperatively to introduce the system in some particular ease , and that when the practice and proceedings under it should become familiar and well understood , it should be generally introduced . // In this way the clause has been interpreted by the Congress , and law was passed at the first session , providing for the trial by jury in all cases of prosecution for libel . The system has not yet been applied to any other case ; but many will be of opinion , that the advantages of the institution are well understood ' already , when it is stated , that in every prosecution for a libel , which has yet occurred in the republic , the prisoner has been acqustted.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
