Svo , XVE have placed at the head of this article the last volume of the transactions of two very respectable societies , instituted for the object of promoting the useful arts . The English society , for this purpose , is one of the most ancient associations of Great Britain ; and besides the numerous premiums which it distributes for discoveries* it publishes yearly a volume of transactions . The volume published by the New-York society is certainly not inferior to the foreign work , in the amount of useful matter which it contains , and is calculated for wider circulation by the absence of costly engravings . The publica .. tion of the collections of such societies is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their institution . As books , however , of this kind are uninteresting to general read .. ers , instead of giving an analysis of their contents , we shall devote this article to the purpose of laying before our readers some account of the rapid improvements of the useful arts , and of the great number of mechanical inventions which have been made within the last fifty or sixty years . So numerous have these improvements been , that a total reform has been produced in the practice of most of these arts , and the common comforts and conveniences peculiar to civilized life are now for the most part supplied to us , by the action of the elements , rather than by the toil of man . It is true that some of our most useful machines are of early origin . But these are generally of simple construction , and such as would naturally result from a very few easy experiments . Some contrivance having a nether and upper stone , and which answered the purpose of a corn-mill , was known in the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied as a moving force until the time of C*esar . It was not until the twelfth , and , according to other writers , the sheteenth century , that water or wind-mills were known in Europe , north of the Alps . Even the common spinning-wheel is quite a modern invention ; and the art of knitting was un* // known in England before the reign of Henry VIII . But most of those wonderful pieces of mechanism , which surpass even the experienced hand , in the delicacy of their operations and excellence of their products , are of very recent invention* No longer ago than the middle of the eighteenth century , there was hardly a species of maiThfacture which did not depend principally on manual labor for the performance of most of its operations . Cloths of every description were made almost wholly by human force . The fibre was taken from the animal or plant by hand , and the tedious operations of carding , spinning , weaving , and shearing were all performed by hand . The finer kinds of chain or mesh-work were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . Rolling and slitting mills , although known , were hardly used , from the imperfection of the machinery by which they were driven . Nails were drawn out under the handhammer . The art of pottery , in Europe at least , furnished no wares , which , in their texture or ornaments , exhibited either strength or beauty , hut at prices which would now be considered enormous . The quadrant , it is true , was invented before the period above alluded to , but practical mechanics had furn'ished no machine for dividing its arc , so that great skill and much time were required to arrive at any tolerable approximation to accuracy in this part of the instrument . The necessary consequence was , that the cost of a good instrument placed it beyond the reach of the common mariner , whose life was constantly depending on observations made with it . It has been the fate of practical mechanics , until within a few years , to be considered beneath the attention of those men who were best qualified to improve them . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or given a useful formula to guide the engineer , yet the advantages , which the arts have received from th*s source , have not been so considerable as is generally supposed . Rather than abstract mathematical learning , the useful arts have requir*d actual experiments directed by acute and well ordered minds . They have wanted the presence of the philosopher , in the manufactory itself , to supply them with machinery , and direct the labors of the workmen . It is even not unlikely that general knowledge may have deterred its possessors fcom attempting mechanical inventions , inasmuch as it made them not only acquainted with the diffi // culti es and perplexities to be encountered , but with the small chance of reward awaiting such pursuits . To undertake the production of a considerable machine requires a degree of ardor and enthusiasm rarely found united with much science , or indeed experience ; for the history of invention presents us at every page with instances of years of drudgery , ending in the ruin of the adventurer . Unacquainted with what has been done by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making experiments , which have before been found to give no advantageous results ; or new methods are tried , and new devices wrought upon , until , with his patience exhausted and his substance consumed , he abandons his designs forever . In those instances , which have been attended with success , it has not been until after years have been passed in anxious labor , and great sums of money been expended . So true is it , that a machine is never the result of a chance hit or a lucky thought . There were expended on Arkwright 's cotton machinery twenty thousand pounds , before any return was made by it . The nail machinery in the United States was not perfected under ten years , nor at a less expense than one hundred thousand dollars . One individual in England has expended three thousand pounds merely for letters patent to secure the property of his inventions in the manufacture of lace . But this is not all ; the completion of a machine is often far from terminating the labors and difficulties of its inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention is not pirated . This opens to him fourteen years of disaster in the law , when his monopoly expires , and he is left with his reputation as the only reward of his labors . Yet here and there a great fortune has been acquired , which has drawn on crowds to these pursuits , who have possessed none of the gifts necessary to command success , except enthusiasm and confidence . But discouraging as the circumstances may seem ; if the instances have been rare of men of extensive learning laboring in practical mechanics , yet of late years such numbers of judicious as well as in- genious men have been allured , either by a true admiration of the subject , or , as has often no doubt been the case , the hope of reward , that the lights of improvement have been carried into the darkest recesses of the arts , and machines have been contrived no less useful in their products than astonishing in their operations . The last half of the eighteenth century has been marked by // the great improvements of Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had only enabled the English to keep possession of their mines , would have been of incalculable advantage . But when we see it driving every species of machinery in the vast establishments of E*gland , and its power propelling vessels through the course of every river and bay in our own country , we can not but exult at the superiority of this age over those which have preceded it . Mr Watt 's improvements are so generally known , as hardly to need a recapitulation . They consis4 in condensing the steam in a vessel apart from the cylinder , or steam-vessel , as he calls it , the temperature of which could therefore always be kept above the boiling point ; in driving the piston both ways through the cylinder with steam , by which the engine could be carried to a force beyond the weight of the atmosphere , to which it was before limited ; in surrounding the cylinder with wood or some slow conductor of heat ; and in the invention of the sun and planet wheels , by which the reciprocating motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more convenient application of it to various machinery ; Since these early inventions of Mr Watt , several curious miprovements have been made , as the laws of the expansive force of steam have become better understood . As these may not be generally known to our readers , the high pressure engine being very much used in this country , we shall be excused for giving an account of one or two of them . The first began with Mr Watt himself . This gentleman had discovered , in the course of his experiments , that steam , which possesses an expansive force but very little superior to the pressure of the atmosphere , when suffered to enlarge itself to several times its former volume still possesses an expansive force equal to that pressure ; or , in more general terms , that the force of steam does not diminish in the same ratio that its volume increases . From this fact , Mr Watt drew the conclusion , that there will be a great economy in using steam of a high temperature at a low pressure ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the communication between the boiler and steam-vessel or cylinder should be cut off , after the piston had passed but part way through the cylinder , and the stroke of the piston be completed simply by the expansion of the steam . Mr Hornblower sopn after constructed an engine with two cylinders of different sizes , which he suppos // ed better adapted to take advantage of the above law . But this being at the time that Mr Watt possessed the monopoly of the condenser and some other parts of the steam-engine , which were indispensable to carry Mr Hornblower 's invention into effect , he was never able to put it . to the test of fair experiment . Subsequently Mr Arthur Woolf , who has pursued his inquiries into this subject with considerable success , has constructed an engine with two cylinders , which seems to embrace all the laws of the expansive force of steam , in the most complete manner . The large cylinder has no direct com munication with the boiler , while the small cylinder communicates both with the large cylinder and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were measured off by the small cylinder into the large . The piston of the small cylinder is driven with a force which effectively is constantly increasing . While the large piston being driven by a quantity of steam , which enlarges itself during the stroke from the volume of the small to equal the volume of the large cylinder , is constantly diminishing in force . Thus the two piston-rods , being fixed to the same end of the lever-beam , regulate each other , and drive the beam with a force nearly constant through the whole stroke . llornblower 's engine effected this equalization of the force very well , while in Mr Watt 's no provision is made for it . His engine having but one steam cylinder , the stroke is given with a constantly diminishing force . The high pressure engine , asit is called , is a greatfavorite with our adventurous countrymen . Mr Oliver Evans , well known for his numerous improvements in flour-mills , constructed a great many engines of this kind , and it was principally through his influence that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the discovery of a curious fact in regard to steam , of which we have not yet spoken , and from which these engines derive their great power , was made by himself more than forty years ago . This fact , as he states it , is , that an increase in the heat of the water , by arithmetical progression , will increase the elasticity and power of the steam by a geometrical progression . This statement , however , is not exactly true , if we consider the degrees of Fahrenheit 's thermometer , as marking equal increments of temperature . For although the addition of equal portions of heat , as measured by this thermometer , augments the expansive force of steam in quantities constantly increasing as the mercury ascends the scale , yet this augmentation // does not hold that exact relation , to the increase of temperature , which the expression of Mr Evans would seem to imply . Thus , the addition of l5* ' of heat to steam of the temperature of 2120 , increases its expansive force five pounds per square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam , already at the temperature of 2590 , increases i*ts expansive force upwards of twelve pounds on the same area . Mr Dalton , however , is of opinion , that Fahrenheit 's thermometer does not measure equal increments of heat ; but , on the contrary , that the expansion of mercury is as the square of the temperature , and that the force of all elastic fluids increases in geometrical progression , if the temperature be increased by equal increments . On the assumption of this fact , he constructed his thermometer . This agrees perfectly with Mr Evans ' opinion , and is clearly supported by general analogy , though it does not seem to admit of more absolute proof . The fact , however , that steam of a high temperature increases in force much faster than that a low temperature , on the addition of an equal quantity of heat , as measured by any thermometer , or even by the consumption of fuel , is sufficient to render the use of high steam much more economical than that of low , could it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily performed . On account of this , the condensation is wholly omitted . in the high pressure engine ; which , therefore , is unprovided with the condensing apparatus . This is the only material respect in which it differs from the low pressure engines . The steam , therefore , is freely let off to the atmosphere after the stroke of the piston is completed , and however great the pressure may have been , it will be immediately perceived , that after this communication is open , it can not resist the return of the piston in a degree above the weight of the ntmosphere and when steam of the force of fifty or sixty pounds per inch is used , more than an equivalent for the amount of loss from the piston acting against a resistance equal to the pressure of the atmosphere , is obtained from the small quantity of heat required to render steam , which already exerts a force of twenty or thirty pounds per inch , capable of exercising a force of the above magnitude . The high pressure engine is cheaper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render it peculiarly advantageous for the purposes of navigation , were it equally safe . But in this important particular it is very questionable , whether it will bear a comparison with other enginos. // Not that its boiler can not be rendered so strong , that its bursting shall be as rare as that of any other , but because its very strength renders the consequences more terrible , when unfortunately it does burst . And as it will sometimes happen , that steam-engines will be intrusted to the management of careless or ignorant people , we can not hope entirely to prevent the recurrence of that accident ; and we believe that the only way to lessen the amount of destruction is to use engines , the boilers of which may burst without doing great injury . This circumstance , important in every case , is particularly so in steam passage-boats , where a great number of persons are constantly exposed ; persons , too , who have a right to expect that every precaution will be taken to insure their safety . There is in the steam engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action from rectilinear to rotatory , by the methods in common practice , not very satisfactorily *iccounted for , considering the magnitude of the loss , which on an aver*. age amounts to about three fourths of the whole power , as appears from the reports on the performance of the engines used at the mines in Cornwall . This , together with the hope of producing a more simple machine , has given rise to very frequent attempts to apply the action of the steam directly to a wheel , and by that means obtain a circular motion primarily . Mr Watt , whose comprehensive mind seems early to have embraced the whole subject of the mechanical application of steam , made several contrivances for this purpose . One of them is described in his specification of 1769 . But none of his plans to effect this object succeeding , he abandoned them all . And no engine has been adopted to any extent , in which the force of steam is not applied in the first instance to produce motion in the direction of the axis of a cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine had some influence in exciting engineers to the inventing and improving of the machinery necessary to its application to the arts . We do not know , however , of a single machine , the invention of which can be traced directly to this cause ; and it is worthy of remark , considering the widely extended and diversified use of the steam engine at this day , that all who were early concerned in improving it , from the Marquis of Worcester down even to Mr Watt , seem to have had principally in view the raising of the water from the mines ; although some of them foresaw that advantage might be taken of a power so admirable in some part of the wide range of practical mechanics . // While the steam engine was yet in its infancy , indeed , before the separate condenser was used , the machinery for manufacturing cotton was getting into notice , which , perhaps , as far as mere ingenuity is concerned , exceeds the steam engine itself . Richard Hargreaves. , a weaver of Lancashire , invented the spinnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is also said to have been the inventor of stock cards , which reduced the labor of carding fifty per cent . Later improvements having superseded these inventions of Hargreaves , his name has fallen into unmerited oblivion . He died in poverty in Nottingham , whither he was obliged to remove to avoid the popular fury of Lancashire ; for it has not been until very lately that the laboring manufacturers have willingly permitted any ' innovation in the ancient modes of practice in the arts . Their mistaken views and narrow ' prejudices have constantly proscribed attempts at saving labor ; and even at the present time , this spirit is not wholly extinct . Sir Richard Arkwright , who followed Hargreaves in improving the cotton machinery , was destined to a better fortune . From a poor barber , he raised himself to opulence and the rank of knighthood . Abandoning his occupation in 1767 , he left Preston , his native town , and went to Warrington , where he made a mechanical contrivance for perpetual m ' 6fion . We mention this merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mechanics . Mr John Kay , however , of that town , suggested to him the more hopeful project of making a machine for spinning cotton . Mr Kay , it seems , had himself invented a machine for that purpose , which he described to Arkwright . With the assistance of Kay , Arkwright completed his machine so as to take out a patent in 1769 . The merit of Arkwright 's invention , and that which distinguishes it from all others , is the drawing the sliver of cotton by rollers , which are found a complete substitute for the human fingers . Arkwright did not stop here , but devoted the rest of his life to improving the machinery and reducing the various processes of the manufacture to order and system . He not only made improvements in the carding , but the vigor of his genius manifested itself in every stage of preparing the cotton for the loom . His first machinery driven by water was erected at Cromford in Derbyshire in 1771 . In 1779 , Mr Crompton completed the machine called the mule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkwright 's machines , from which circumstance it is said to have derived its name . The mule is superior to any other machine for spinning certain kinds of yarn . Cotton may be drawn out by it to an almost incredible fineness . It is said that one pound has been made into a thread one hundred and sixty seven miles in length ; which , to place the fact in a stronger light , is one hundred and thirty feet to each grain weight . Such is a brief outline of the commencement and early progress of this extensive and useful branch of industry . Many and great improvements have been made in it , in almost all the stages of the manufacture , since the death of *ir Richard Arkwright . Indeed , it is but a few years since the very important machine , known by the name of the double speeder , was perfected . Power looms are also quite recent . But to the praise of Arkwright , we may remark , that all the ingenuity that has succeeded him , has been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The machinery for manufacturing cotton is at this time unquestionably more perfect , than that used in any other manufacture . Cotton stuffs are now sold at such prices , and this is the best test of the facility with which they are manufactured , that with a numerous class in all countries , they have supplanted the use of linens and silks . The quantity of linen , cloth made in Ireland has remained about stationary for several years past , although the countries which supply themselves with linens of Irish manufacture , have greatly increased in population . And every body knows the misery which the depression of the silk trade , a few years since , brought upon thousands in England . We can not leave this subject without noticing the invention of the saw gin , by a native of Massachusetts , a machine for clearing the fibres of cotton from the seeds . We do this , not merely because it is an American invention , but because the world has not produced a machine , which increases in so great a degree the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventor , that each person employed with the machine is equal to one thousand persons working with the hands merely ; niid we do not know that this comparison is to be considered materially erroneous . To show the great influence which it has had on the agriculture of a large district of our country , we shall make an extract or two from a charge to a // jury of Georgia , by judge Johnson . The cotton plant furnished clothing to mankind before the age of Herodotus . The green seed is a species much more productive than the black , and by nature adapted to a much greater variety of climate ; but by reason of the strong adhereit*e of the fibre to the seed , without the aid of some more powerful machine for separating it than any formerly known among us , the cultivation of it could never have been made an object . The machine , of which Mr Whitney claims the invention , so facilitates the preparation of this species for use , that the cultivation of it has suddenly become an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever can be . With regard to the utility of this discovery , the court would deem it a waste of time to dwell long upon this topic . Is thc*re a man who hears us , who has not experienced its utility ? The whole interior of the southern states was languishing , and its inhabitants emigrating for want of some object to engage their attention and employ their industry , when the invention of this machine at once opened views to them , which set the whole country in active motion . From chilck. hood to age , it has presented us a lucrative employment . Individuals , who were depressed in poverty and sunk in idleness , have suddenly risen to wealth and respectability . Our debts have been paid off ; our capitals increased ; and our lands are trebled in value . We can not express the weight of obligation , which the country owes to this invention . The extent of it can not now be seen . Some faint presentiment may be formed from the reflection , that cotton is rapidly supplanting wool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may one day profitably supply the use of specie in our East India trade . Our sister states also participate in the benefits of this invenlion ; for , besides affording the raw materials for their manufactories , the bulkiness and quality of the article afford a valuable employment for their shipping . ' The success , which attended the establishment of the cotton machinery , directed the attention of ingenious men to attempt the somewhatsimilar manufacture of woollen fabrics by machinery driven by power , and although the triumph has not been so complete as that which attended the cotton manufacture , yet the saving of labor has been of a greater extent than the most visionary projector could have dreamed of fifty years ago . The jen. ny and carding machine were transferred with little alteration // from the cotton to the woollen fabrics . By the first of these machines , one person is enabled to spin about as much as fifty persons could by the old method , and it should be remember. * ed , that this process cost more labor , than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery soon followed that of the jenny , and was attended with great , though not equal advantages . The manufacture of hemp and flax , by machinery moved without human aid , to such a degree as is req*iired in the or. - dinary methods , attracted a great share of the public attention as early as the cotton machinery was established . Ingenuity has been on the rack ever since to accomplish an object of such magnitude . So much has this been thought of by rulers , as well as private individuals , that the emperor Napoleon , by a decree in 1810 , offered the munificent reward of one million of-franks to the inventor , of whatever nation he might be , who should produce the best macbine for spinning fla*. , Competitors for the prize arose in almost every civilized nation , and many most ingenious machines were coiistructed . But we believe no one possessed advantages decidedlbr superior to all others* and unless we have been misinformed on the subject , no machine was rewarded . The length of the fibres of flax , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presents difficulties in the way of spinning it by machinery , which are unknown in the use of cotton and wool . It can-not be prepared by carding , as these other substances are , and the rollers are capable of drawing it but very imperfectly , although , as we have before remarked , they even surpass the human fingers in drawing out cotton . Yet , notwithstanding these difficulties in the production of an even thread , there are machines in operation in this country , as well as Great Britain and France , which spin some coarse kinds of thread tolerably well , and with great rapidity . The machines are , however , too imperfect to spin the fine threads , and in Ireland , where the labor of women is very cheap , they have not much disturbed the ancient course of manufacture . The improvements in manufacturing the metals , particularly iron , have been very great , since the date of the steam engine . England , possessed of abundance of the necessary materials for this manufacture , has brought the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pleasure to - notice , that this branch of art has been much improved in the United // States within a few years . Twenty years ago , our iron furnaces produced no castings , which united the properties of strength and solidity , with such softness as to enable the workmen to give them any kind of finish . The many serious accidents which happened during tlY* last war by the bursting of our cannon , must be fresh in the minds of most of our readers . These imperfections were not to be attributed to the quality of our ore , but wholly to the want of skill in working it . The importance of this art to every other , where any kind of machinery is used , is seldom sufficiently appreciated . We believe that the reason why the machinery of this country does not operate in general so well as that of England , though of the same construction , is to be found principally in the imperfection of our castings , which obliges us often to substitute wood for iron , and that too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving their figure unchanged , are highly essential . In the history of the improvements of the arts , as in every thing else , the chain of cause and effect is often too fine to be distinctly visible , but we think that every one , after a moment 's consideration of the subject , will agree with us , that improvement in the workmanship of machinery tends directly and powerfully to the successful exercise of mechanical invention . It has been principally in the heavier and rougher kinds of iron work , that improvements have lately been made . The arts of making fine cutlery and watches , although considerably improved of late years , have advanced by no means so rapidly as they did for some time before . Improvements in these arts were the result of the division of labor , which was carried to great minuteness an hundred years ago , and the advantages which resulted from it in the manufacture of many fine steel instruments and watches , were astonishing . According to Adam Smith , a better watch could be purchased in his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the seventeenth century for twenty pounds . But the introduction of the steam engine into the manufacture of heavy iron wares , has been of great advantage . And we ought to notice also the invention of the machine for making nails . We have before alluded to the cost and labor of this invention . Few machines are now , however , more perfect in their operations , or have been more successful in their way . This machine originated from a practice , which // began about thirty years ago , of cutting off slivers from iron hoops , with a pair of common shears , and beading them in a smith 's vice , to be used in building instead of nails . From such rude beginnings has grown up the present nail machine , which is capable of producing twcdiundred and sixty *complete nails in one minute . But as any enumeration of modern improvements in the arts , which we can make , must necessarily be imperfect , if not tedious to our readers , we shall pursue the subject in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principal cause of the great saving of labor , from the use of machines generally , is , that their moving force is derived from some physical action of inorganic matter , or from the strength of some brute animal . In fact , many of the most useful machines are no more than the means by which a single motion , as that of water or steam , acting in one direction and with one velocity , is divided and modified into many motions acting in different directions , and with various velocities , but having such relations to each other that the instruments which they put in motion shall perform those operations necessary to produce a nail , a thread , a card , a piece of lace , or whatever else may be the subject of manufacture . These facts make it very desirable to know , which of the several powers or forces offers to the manufacturer the greatest advantage But on this subject no estimate of universal application has been or can be made . The character of the force must be such as shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied . Otherwise , although it be in cost cheaper , it may be less economical . Thus the force of wind may be obtained in great quantities at a small expense ; but as it sometimes wholly remits its action , it would be far from prudent to employ it , where a number of workmen could labor only when a supply of such a force could be obtained . The numerous waterfalls in New-England have long furnished almost the only force employed for driving our machinery . In many cases this force is sufficiently constant , and being cheaper than steam , it is to be preferred to it . But waterfalls are rarely to be found in large towns , and often not in their immediate vicinity , places where many kinds of manufacture are most advantageously carried on ; whilst one of the great excellencies of the steam-engine is , that its force may be obtained at all times , in all places , and in any quantity . It is an important fact , however , in the economy of steam , that a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large than from a small engine ; so that for a power merely equal to one or two horses , it is probably as cheap to use the animal as the steam engine . The high price of fuel in our large towns renders this power much more expensive to us than it is in places where coals are plenty . But , notwithstanding this , in engines of an ordinary size , from pretty good in- formation on the subject we can state , that the cost of a given quantity of power will be to that of the same quantity obtained from horses , about as one to four , if the engine be kept in con*tant operation , and about as two to five if worked only twelve hours per day : an advantage sufficiently marked to determine a preference , even where all the other circumstances are equal ; and they can hardly be unfavorable to the use of steam , from any thing in the character of that power . The actual value of modern improvements in the useful arts can only be estimated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agriculture and other useful employments , by abundantly supplying all our wants of useful manufactures with fewer artisans than would otherwise have been required . The record of facts necessary to make an estimate on this subject is extremely scanty , particularly in. . &amp;ur - own country . The reports of the marshals , in the year 1810 , fu.r*. nished materials for two or three works , which contain some account of our manufactures . Of these , Mr Coxe 's staternent of the arts and manufactures of the United States of America ' is the most valuable . But the materials from which this work was composed were manifestly imperfect , for the period when they were collected ; and such has been the rapid growth of our manufactures since that time , that we are not to depend now upon a valuation made twelve years since . The reports of the marshals , for the year 1820 , have not yet found their way to the public , no digest having been made from them . We have been unable to obtain a copy of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament of England , into the trade and manufactures of that kingdom , have been the means of furnishing to the public considerable information of the value of the machinery of Great Britain , which we shall proceed to notice . By an examination made by the house of commons in 1800 , it appeared that woollen goods were annually manufactured to the amount of ? 19,800,000 . The number of persons directly // employed was stated by Mr Law , afterwards lord Ellenborough , to be 1,500,000 ; an equal number receiving employment indirectly in consequence of being engaged in some collateral branch of trade . These numbers , however , have been proved much too high . At the same time , it was admitted by the manufacturers , that by the improvements in their machinery thirty-five persons could produce a quantity of cloth , which would have employed sixteen hundred and thirty-four persons an equal period of time , with the machinery used in 1785 , which is increasing the product of labor about forty-six fold . But that this estimate of the value of the machinery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that in the West Riding of Yorkshire , where the manufacture has advanced as rapidly as it has in any part of the kingdom , the quantity of cloth manufactured in 1770 was to the quantity immufactured in 1817 , about as one to three by measure , the quantity having advanced through the intermediate years pretty steadily . It may be estimated also , that the quality has been improved in an equal ratio . Now , if we suppose the number of workmen to have continued the same , and we do not think the variation on this head to have been large , we shall have the product of their labor increased about nine fold . Taking then the whole number of individuals employed in the trade to be 800,000 , the product of their labor is equal to that of 7,200,000 , with the machinery of 1770 ; or the present woollen machinery of England is equal in value to the industry of 6,400,000 people ; an industry , too , it must be remembered , which furnishes to the country its product , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of wealth may seem to those , who have not been in the habit of making themselves acquainted with the subject , it is yet of small consequence when compared with the product of the cotton trade . As might be expected , there is great want of uniformity of opinion among the few who have undertaken to state the saving of labor by the use of cotton machinery . The manufacturers themselves have not a very accurate knowledge of the comparative effect of equal quantities of labor , aided in the one case with machinery , and in the other applying itself without that advantage , because the cotton manufacture itself has grown up altogether with the machinery , having been almost unknown in Europe before the invention of the jenny . We // believe that generally the value of improvements are overrated in public accounts ; and it does not appear that the cotton machinery forms an exception to this rule . Some writers have stated it to increase the product of labor two hundred fold . But there is hardly a process of the manufacture which warrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some operations require now the same labor that they did in the infancy of the manufacture . On the whole , we think that one person may be considered now as equal in effect to fifty , employing the implements common sixty years ago ; and if we take the whole number of people employed in Great Britain in this branch of industry at 650,000 , we must consider the cotton machinery of that country as equalling in value the labor of 31,850,000 people . All the other machinery of Great Britain , invented xvhhin the last sixty years , except the steam-engine , which supplying a moving force to other machines , of itself produces nothing , does not probably approach the value of the cotton machinery alone . We are not able to satisfy ourselves of the value of the machinery of the United States , in any great branch of industry , from the defects to which we have before alluded , in the only authentic source of information . The wool of the United States is estimated by Mr Coxe , for the year 1812 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is generally stated that about one hundred millions of pounds of the same article are annually manufactured in England . This would give the woollen machinery of the United States equal to the labor of one million two hundred and eighty thousand people , if the manufacture were practised by the same method here that it is in England . But as the domestic mode prevails in this country to a greater comparative degree , no valuation formed in this way is worthy of much confidence . But , however imposing this array of the manufacturing power of England may appear to us , we must remember that it is by no means to be taken into the account , in comparing the political importance of the two nations . The labor saved by mechanical improvements is for the common benefit of the world at large . It is impossible for any nation to derive great and exclusive advantage , even from their own inventions , for any considerable period . An almost immediate effect of improvements , in any branch of manufacture , is to reduce the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always will follow , from the competition of different mdi-. viduals in the same trade . Thus the competition of the English manufacturers reduced the price of fine cotton yarn , in the course of twenty years , from thirty-five shillings and sixpence to four and fourpence halfpenny a pound ; a reduction of froni bout eight to one on the whole co*it ; which , it will be perceived , must be much more on the labor of spinning alone . And such are the facilities which modern commerce gives to exchanges , that countries foreign to that where the improvements may first have been introduced , soon participate almost equally in the advantages of any great mechanical invention . So true is this , that we can now hardly find a people so remote , or a race so barbarous , that they have not obtained the blankets , and knives , the fire-arms and trinkets of civilized nations , in exchange for the skins and teeth of their animals , or the gold and precious stones of their rivers and mines . There will be a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before any extensive competition grows up , during which the nation , where the improvement is produced , will derive something like an exclusive advantage from it . The very c* nimercial facilities , which we have above alluded to , will enable her to destroy the manufacture of the article which is the subject of improvement in other countries , by supplying them cheaper than they can manufacture for themselves , and still give a most advantageous employment to her own people engaged in the trade . But , indeed , if a nation so circumstanced could , by any laws or regulations , keep up the price of the article at home , it could avail them nothing . Foreign nations would the sooner obtain possession of the invention , and manufacture for themselves ; and this they always will do , sooner or later , unless the inventing nation have some peculiarity in their circumstances , which enables them to carry on the manufacture to greater advantage than any other people . The rival claims of England and France to superiority in me*hanical invention , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No new manufacture is established in France , but French patriotism is called upon to pay the easy tax of a belief that the invention originated in French genius , and was perfected by French skill and enterprize ; while the English sweepingly declare , our inventions and discoveries are more numerous and solid than those of any other people . What may not have been original to us , we have seldom failed // to improve as soon as it has passed into our hands ; and we have applied to useful practical purposes more than all the rest of the world are vain of having had a glimpse of . ' If this was expressed , as it was probably directed , against the French alone , it might be considered , although somewhat overcharged , as true in the main . The French have not in their character those qualities , which are necessary to superiority in the merely useful arts , which embrace the manufacture of those articles that contribute to simple comfort and convenience . In comparing them with the English , any one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have been struck with the fact , that while the English aim to produce good and plain articles in large quantity , the French constantly strive to bring forward something curious and showy . So deeply is the love of display engrained in the French constitution , that the factory itself is sometimes arranged with a view to produce a fine spectacle . Thus the steam-engine is put up in a shop window with its flies and its levers polished comme un mtroir , to attract the admiration of the crowd . But we Americans think , that we can maintain the claim to equality , at least , with the English . We know that an opinion is generally prevalent among us , that we are decidedly superior to them in mechanical invention . We are sorry to remark , that this is sometimes asserted with a vaporing air , which is ill calculated to produce conviction abroad , and which it would not at all injure us to correct . As this subject is now before us , we may briefly examine some of the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . The English are the undoubted inventors of the steam engine . The Americans first successfully applied it to propelling vessels . The English invented the cotton spinning machinery . The Americans the cotton gin . The carding machine , the lace machine , the coining machinery , the threshing machine , the hydrostatic press , are all English inventions . While the Americans have produced the card machine , the nail machine , the machine for splitting leather , the improvements in flourmills , and the machinery which immortalizes the work of the engraver . These are all the decidedly important machines , which now occur to our minds , which can be specifically stated , and which clearly belong exclusively to either nation , although a great deal more of excellent machinery has been invented , in each country , since the period of American independence . // Improvements on almost all the old inventions for whatever purpose , have been made since that time , and many original machines of minor importance have been contrived . But we believe that we have enumerated the most important body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other . We have not mentioned the block machinery , which the English claim , because , although it was invented in England , its inventor , Mr Brunel , was born in France , and lived some time in America . It shbuld be noticed also , that the steam engine , although improved since our independence , was very near its present state of perfection before that time . Among American inventions worthy of notice , we can not , however , forbear to specify a beautiful machine lately constructed by Mr Blanchard , for fashioning irregular figures of wood . It is capable of producing an exact fac simile of almost any figure of common size , and is already in use for making shoemakers ' lasts and gun stocks . An extensive application of it to other purposes may be expected . The circumstances of the English have , on the whole , been most favorable to produce machinery . They had forty years ago the most mechanical knowledge , and they still have the most capital , and a greater number of people occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the higher price of labor in this country , which is perhaps the most considerable incentive to invention with us . Still we believe that our improvements have been as ingenious as theirs , and have required as much persevering industry to carry them into effect ; and that we are , at least , not inferior to any natioa in those qualities necessary to advance the useful arts . It does not appear that Germany and Holland have maintained the rank , to which their former inventions , particularly the art of printing , and the application of the pendulum to timekeepers , had raised them . It nas been perhaps rather from a want of enterprise than of mechanical skill , that the great inventions of the age have not been brought into more general use in Germany . The government of Russia has extended a liberal patronage to the introduction of arts and machines from foreign countries ; and as civilization advances , they must ne. * *essarily be adopted throughout that vast empire .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
