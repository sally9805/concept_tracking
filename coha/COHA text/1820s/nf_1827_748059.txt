txt /z/ When the Trustees of the Gardiner Lyceum had determined , a year or two since , to add to the regular classes , admitted annually , several winter classes to continue for a few months , for the benefit of those young men , whose circumstances would not permit them to devote any considerable time to study ; it devolved upon the Author of the following pages to mark out , for each of these Classes , a course of study , which would be appropriate and not too extensive for the time allotted to them . It was while fixing upon a course for the winter doss in Carpentry and Civil Architecture , that , the design of publishing this book suggested itself to him . He could find " books of lines " sufficient ; was at no loss for exemplars of the orders ; could easily provide for instruction in practical geometry and drawing ; but knew of no book which appeared to him suited to instruct young men , who had made no advances in mathematics , beyond arithmetic and the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch of mechanical science . " " The many volumes , " as Dr. Robison justly observes , " called Complete Instructers , Manuals , Jewells , &c.; take a humbler flight , and content themselves with instructing the mere workman , and sometimes give the master builder a few approved forms* ? roofs and other framings , with the rules for drawing them on paper , and from thence forming working draughts , which must guide the Saw and the chisel of the workman . Hardly any of them offer any thing that can be called a principle , applicable to many particular cases , with rules for their adaptation . " / Dr. Robison 's own excellent articles , Carpentry , Strength of Materials , , Roofs , &c.; first published in the supplement to the Encyclopaedia Brittannica , and afterwards in the first volume of his System of Mechanical Philosophy , have done much to supply the deficiency , of which he speaks in the passage just quoted , and which , in other places , he censures more explicitly and severely . Since the publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , his " Elementary Principles of Carpentry , " which has justly been characterized as a work of great practical utility . It may be thought , that Mr. Tredgold 's work mifirht supersede the necessity of the ene now offered to the public . To the Author it appeared otherwise . Mr. Tredgold 's work is replete with the sound and judicious observations of a man , in whom practical knowledge is united with science ; but it is not well constructed for elementary instruction . It frequently supposes the reader to be acquainted with the higher mathematics and mechanics , and a considerable part of it is taken up with the subject of Bridges , which adds to the expense of the work , and is not , to most carpenters , a matter of immediate interest . Mr * T d S old ' 8 wo rk , however , the Author is greatly indebted , as will be manifest , from the perpetual reference to it , as well as from several chapters , which are taken from it , with little alteration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Robison , and of the Essay on the Strength of timber , " by Prof. Barlow , of the Royal Military /z/ Academy , at Woolwich . These books have been his principal resources . The article " Carpentry , " in the E din burg Encyclopedia , and a Memoir of M. Dupin , in the 10th vol. of the Journal of the French Polytechnic School , have furnished some contributions , and other works are occasionally referred to . The plan of this Introduction is , to give , in the first place , some knowledge of the Strength and Stiffness of Timber , as the foundation , both of the science and art of Carpentry . In this part of the work , the principles are deduced directly from a comparison of well conducted experiments ; a method , - which , while it is the most satisfactory to practical men , and the only intelligible one to those , who are not skilled in mathematics , is also the most safe . This part is followed by an elementary view of those doctrines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which snew the strength of timber , as it depends upon position , and in this part of the book the Author has taken occasion to in* troduce most of the simple mechanical powers . The principles of equilibrium are next applied to the constructions of Roofs , JJomes , and Partitions , and the book ends with an excellent chapter from Tredgold , on scarfing , joints , and straps . It was contemplated originally , to add a chapter on the nature and properties of timber , but this is rendered in a great measure unnecessary by the reprinting of Mr. Tred gold 's chapter on this subject in a valuable publication , * which we presume to be extensively circulated among mechanics . Numerous practical questions are introduced to be solved by the student . Those in the second part are to be solved by the scale and compasses . More accurate solutions may indeed be obtained by calculation ; but the scale and compasses , skilfully used , will give results sufficiently accurate , for practical purposes , and solutions by construction have the advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the student into the habit of drawing with accuracy . This work is not offered to the public as a complete system of carpentry . It is designed only to furnish a familiar introduction to a most important part of it , which has been hitherto very much neglected ; and if it should be in any measure the means of convincing carpenters of the true dignity of their art , and giving them a taste for acquiring a scientific knowledge of it ; the Author will think he has done no unacceptable service to the public . With regard to the execution of the work , the Author hopes to be judged with some indulgence : for it was undertaken from a conviction that something of the kind was wanting ; and has been pursued from its commencement , without leisure , and with frequent interruptions . If however he deserves censure , he is too well persuaded of the importance of just criticism , to refuse to submit to it . /z/ 1 . " To know the resistance , which a piece of timber offers to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important species of knowledge that a carpenter has to acquire ; and to be able to judge of the degree of resistance from observation only , even in common cases , requires nothing less than the practice of a life devoted wholly to carpentry. " * The knowledge , usually acquired by carpenters from their experience , although extremely valuable , is little more than " a feeling of fitness 9 ' or unfitness , and can not be communicated . The young carpenter , therefore , if he would not be ignorant of the strength and stiffness of timber , the very qualities upon which the excellence of his constructions must continually depend , must study the laws which govern them , as they are deduced from actual experiments . 2 . The principal strains , to which timber is exposed , are the following : viz. i . When the force , producing the strain , tends to pull the piece asunder in the direction of its length . The strength of timber to resist this strain is called its direct cohesion . /z/ ii . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called a cross or transverse strain , iii . When the force tends to compress the body in the direction of its length , as in the case of a column . iv . A piece may be crushed across , as when a pin or tenon fails . Resistance to this kind of strain is called by some writers lateral resistance ; by others , resistance to detrusion. v. The strain upon a piece of timber may tend to twist it , as in the case of mill shafts. /z/ Of the direct cohesion of timber . 3 . By the direct cohesion of timber , we mean its strength to resist fracture , when drawn in the direction of its length . The direct cohesion is ascertained by suspending vertically a stick of known dimensions , by the upper end , and hanging weights to the lower , until it breaks . It is a strain of this kind , to which king-posts , and all tie-beams are exposed . 4 . The experiments , which have been made upon the direct cohesion of timber are not numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary in performing them , the great weights which are required to break even small pieces , and the consequent necessity of well constructed apparatus . The experiments , which have been principally relied upon , are those of Musschenbroeck , Emerson , and Anderson , and to these may be added Professor Barlow , of Woolwich . Musschenbroeck and Barlow have given us minute descriptions of their apparatus , and of the manner of conducting their experiments. * Emerson has given us only the results of his experiments , and those perhaps not without being modified by his calculations . Of Dr. Anderson 's experiments the Edinburgh Encyclopedia observes , they are probably faithfully related . * Musschenbroeck ' s lntroductio ad Philosophiam Naturalum , Leyden y 1762 ; and Barlow 's Essay on the Strength mnd Stress of Timber , London , 1817. iao /z/ 5 . In constructing the following table , the authorities of Barlow and Musschenbroeck are preferred ; and where they differ Barlow is followed . This preference is given to Barlow , because of the care he took to ascertain very exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than those of Musschenbroeck . These circumstances are of great importance . A slight error in the measure of small pieces ( those of Musschenbroeck were only one fifth of an inch square ) may produce a very considerable error in the result , because the error may bear a very considerable proportion to the whole dimensions of the piece . Table of the direct cohesion of different kinds of wood . /z/ 6 . The above table exhibits , in the fourth column , the cohesion of timber , measured by the weight in pounds , which is necessary to tear asunder pieces of an inch square . It is generally assumed , that the direct cohesion of timber , since it depends upon the cohe* of its particles , must be in proportion to the number of them . But the number of the particles is as the area of the section , and therefore , the direct cohesion of a stick of timber must be as the area of the section . We have then an easy rule for ascertaining , by the help of the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this direct cohesion . Multiply the number placed against the name of the timber in the fourth column of the table , by the number of square inches contained in the area of the section of the piece , and the product will be the answer in pounds* Note . The number of square inches in the area of the section of any piece of timber is found by multiplying together the breadth and depth of the piece . Examples . i . Required the direct cohesion of an oak joist , whose dimensions are 3 inches by four . /z/ 12 equal to 3 multiplied by 4 , or area of section . 124668 equal to answer . ii . The same of a joist of ash , 6 inches by 7 . Ans. 717234 lbs . iii . T*he same of a joist of fir , 4 inches by 6 . Ans. 292872 lbs . iv . The same of a joist of pine , 7 inches by 10. v. The same of a joist of beech , 6 inches square . 7 . In practice it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight , which , according to the above rule , is sufficient to break it . The reason is obvious . The very action of the weight , in some measure , weakens the timber . There are , also , imperceptible defects in large sticks , which are always avoided in those small pieces , upon which experiments are performed ; and a very considerable allowance should be made in comparing the most perfect specimens with pieces which may be unsound . A slight change in the position of a stick may ( as we shall hereafter shew ) greatly increase the strain . These reasons well considered , /z/ M will be perceived to be unsafe to trust a beam to support more than half the weight necessary to break %U vi . What would be the greatest load proper for a joist of ash , whose dimensions are 6 inches by 7 ? Ans. 358617. vii . What for a stick of walnut two inches square ? , viii .

To obtain the size of a stick , which would carry such a load with safety , we must double this area , and shall obtain 96. 96 being the area of the section , any two numbers , which are factors of 96 , as 8 and 12 , may be the dimensions , and will be an answer to the question . Ans. 8 and 12 . Note . This process is only the reverse of that required in the former examples . ix . What should be the dimensions of a stick of fir , to support 42600 lbs . ? x . What the dimensions of a stick of ash to support the same ? xi . Answer the same questions , upon the supposition , that each stick is to be square . 8 . When the breaking weights of the table are compared with each other , they manifestly express the relative cohesion of the different kinds of wood . It will be easy therefore to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct cohesion of a stick of beech is equal to 600,000 lbs . what will be the direct cohesion of a stick of larch of the same size ? xiii .

What must be the size in square of a stick of box to sustain ibe same load as a stick of oak 2 inches square ? /z/ xv . What the size of a stick of pear to replace a stick of fir 3 inches by 5 ? 9 . Some experiments have been made by Mr. Tredgold , * on oak , poplar and larch , to ascertain their lateral cohesion , u e. their strength , when drawn in a direction perpendicular to the direction mi their fibres . The results are shewn in the following table . Table of lateral cohesion of square inch in pounds* Oak , 2316 Poplar , . 1782 Larch , from 870 to 1700 , - mean 1325 It is here seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that wood is much weaker across the grain , than in the direction of it . Hence a stick , the grain of which is twisted and irregular , will support less , by its direct cohesion , than another , whose grain is straight . For in the former case , a weight , acting in the direction of the length of the stick , will tend to separate some of the fibres laterally . In the experiments of Mr. Barlow , it was observed , that some of the pieces twisted by the action of the weight , probably in consequence of a spiral direction of the fibres . In all such cases the pieces broke with less weight , than was required by those of straighter grain . 10 . The opinion of Mr. Nimmo , t is apparently in contradiction to the above statement . He says , " It is highly probable , that the cohesion of timber , especially that of which the fibres are much intertwisted , such as oak , increases in the thicker pieces , in a ratio , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibrous bodies , by being drawn in length , are strongly compressed together , and those weaker fibres are more firmly retained , which , by breaking at their finest part , might otherwise tear out . This is indeed the way , in which such bodies fail , viz. by the fibres sliding out from among each other , ' and not by an absolute snap . In this respect , therefore , timber may be compared to cordage ; and then we have several examples of the truth of this principle , Duhamel mentions that a 6 thread rope bore 631 lbs. , but that thicker cords bore more in proportion . We have arranged the result below . " /z/ t Edinburgh Encyclopedia , Art , Carpentry. /z/ 11 , Wood , whose fibres are very much , intertwisted , may have greater direct cohesion ; but when they are simply twisted , or irregular in their direction , they can not be compared with the fibres of a rope , and will be found , as in the experiments of Mr. Barlow , to impair the cohesion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cohesion increacing faster than the area of the section , the reference to ropes does not seem sufficient to confirm the opinion . The fibres of ropes are doubtless " strongly compressed together , 79 when the rope6 are in a state of tension ; but this will not be the case with wood , the fibres of which have the common degree of straightness . And if timber with twisted fibres , derives any additional strength from this circumstance , it is safest , as Mr. Nimmo himself observes , to disregard it . /z/ Of the transverse strength of rectangular beams . 12 . By the transverse strength of beams , is meant their strength to resist fracture , when they are placed horizontally upon sup ports at their extremities , and loaded with weights suspended from some point between . The simplest case is when the weight is suspended from the middle of the beam . The case , also , in which the ends of the beams are merely laid upon their supports , must be distinguished from that in which the ends are firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams are supposed to be merely supported , and the weight to be suspended from the middle , between the points of support . /z/ Barlow 's experiments were performed on fir andxtak battens , care fully selected , and well seasoned . The battens were placed horizontally on firm supports , at proper distances asunder , and the scale , in which the weights were placed , was suspended from the centre of the batten between the supports* In order to observe the deflection of the battens , a fine silk line was stretched across from one support to the other , and kept extended by weights hung at the ends . Graduated scales being attached to the battens , the degrees on the scales , cut by the silk line , shewed the deflection . In some of the following experiments , the lengthening is introduced , viz. the lengthening of the under side of the batten , when it is bent by the weight . This was measured by a silk line fixed to one end of the batten , and extended along its lower surface to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was loaded with a small weight . An index attached to the weight , pointed out the lengthening on a graduated scale fixed to the side of the support . For a more particular description of the apparatus used by Mr* Barlow , the reader is referred to his Essay . 14* The results of Prof. Barlow 's experiments are arranged in the first and second of the following tables , which were taken from his Essay* The jirst column contains the number of the experiments* The three following , the dimensions of the battens . The fifth , their deflections* The sixth , their specific gravity . The seventh , the weight in pounds necessary to break them . The eighth , the weight , which would be necessary to break the battens , if they were of the specific gravity 600 ; calculated upon the supposition , that the strength of timber is as its specific gravity . The relation between the strength and the specific gravity of timber , will be examined in its place . The ninth column contains the mean weight required to break battens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ; deduced from the preceding column , by dividing the sum of the weights by the number of them . In the latter division of Table I. a different arrangement oA the columns is introduced , which in general is sufficiently explained by the table itself . In the column of successive deflections , are given the deflections shewn by a succession of graduated scales , placed at equal distances , from one end to the middle . Where only one deflection is given , it is always that which is indicated by the scale at the middle of the batten . /z/ 19 . The strength of beams , subjected to transverse strains , will depend not only upon the absolute strength of the timber , but also upon their length , breadth , and depth* By a comparison of the above experiments , we are enabled to discover the ratio , which exists between the strength of beams , and these several circum-stances* The- strength of beams , as depending upon theit length . 20 . By referring to the first of the above tables , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one broad , and one , deep , to be 276* , and that of a beam a , 1 5 inches long , and of the same breadth and depth , to be 439 . If we make an inverse proportion* employing the strengths of these pieces and one of their lengths , for the three first terms ; the fourth term , which we find by calculation , will enable us to find the relation for which we seek . Strength of a : strength of c : : length of c : /z/ The fourth term thus obtained by calculation , is very nearly the length of a . The conclusion , to which this comparison would lead us , is , that the strength of beams is in the inverse ratio of their lengths* By making similar comparisons with other battens , it may be found whether this principle is generally correct . Compare the battens f , and o . " Strength of f : strength of : : length of o : /z/ The fourth term varies but very little from the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student compare the battens h and i ; h and k ; n and m ; a and d , &c,; and he will find results agree- ' ing still more exactly with the experiments . It may then be considered as sufficiently proved , that the strength of a beam supported at both ends , and loaded in the middle , is in versely as its length* 21 . It is easy to apply this principle to the solution of practical examples* By taking the mean o/265 and 288 , the remit* of the Table . // i . If a stick of oak 2 feet long , 1 inch deep , and 1 inch broad , breaks with 482 lbs . ; what weight will be required to break a stick of the same breadth and depth , and 3 feet long ? 3:2 : : 482 : 321 , Answer . ii . If the strength of a stick of beech 2.5 feet long , and 1 inch square , be estimated at 271 lbs . ; what will be the strength of a stick of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet 9 inches long ? iii . A stick of teak 7 feet long and 2 inches square.breaks with 820 lbs . : required the weight necessary to break a stick of the same scantling , * and 9 feet long . iv . The strength of a stick of willow 2.5 feet long and 1 inch square is estimated at 146 lbs . : required the Strength of a similar stick 4 feet 7 inches long . Of the strength of beams as depending upon their breadth* 22 . The relation , which obtains between the strength of beams and their breadth may be ascertained by comparisons similar to those , which were employed in the preceding section . The strength of No , 1 , Table HI , is 406 . That of No7 3 , which has the same length and depth , and twice the breadth , is 805 . That is , the strengths are very nearly as the breadths . Again , Table I. Strength of h ; 24 in. long , 2 deep , and 1 wide , equal 1119. do . of m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , equal 1 1 16 . In order to compare these battens , in reference to their breadth or width , we must make the other dimensions equal , by first reducing the lertgth of the latter to that of the former , which is easily done by the principle established in the preceding section .. J Then calling the stick m , so reduced , m ' , we shall have Strength of m ' 24 inches long , 2 deep and 2 wide , equal to 2232 . If we then compare their strength with their breadths , we have Strength of h : strength of m ' : : breadth of h : /z/ which is equal to the breadth of m ' within .006 of an inch . From * Scantling ; lateral dimensions , viz , length and breadth . /q/ this result it would seem that the strength of a beam is directly pro* poriional to its breadth* Let us take another example . The strength of i , 30 inches long , 2 deep , and 1 broad , being 900 ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the length 72 inches , and call it i ' , we shall have Strength of i ' , 72 in. long , 2 deep , fend 1 broad , equal to 375* Now compare with Strength of n , 72 in. long , 2 deep , and 2 broad , equal to 744. 375 : 744 : : 1 : 2.98 , which is very nearly as I : 2 , the ratio of the breadth . 23 . These examples may serve to convince us , that the strength of timber is in direct proportion to its breadth . This is what we should have expected , without experiment , and is admitted by alt writers upon this subject Examples . i . The strength of a stick of American pine 2.5 feet long , and 1 inch square , being 329 lbs . ; what will be the strength of a stick , whose breadth is 2 inches , the other dimensions being the same ? 329 multiplied by 2 , equal to 658 , answer . ii . The medium strength of a stick of larch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lbs . : what would it be were its breadth increased to 3 inches ? iii . What , if its breadth were 4.5 ? iv . A stick of common English elm , length 2.5 feet , breadth 1 inch , and depth 1 inch , is 216 lbs . ; required its strength , when its breadth is increased to 2.68 ? The strength of beams , in relation to their depth* 24 . We must now inquire into the effect , which an increase of depth has upon the strength of beams . The breaking weight of the fir batten c , is 276.5 lbs* , and of the batten h , of the same length and breadth as c , but of double the depth , is 1119 lbs . Strength of c : strength of h : : depth of c : /z/ From this it appears that while the depths are as 1 : 2 , the strengths are as 1 : 4 . But 4 is the square of 2 , and we should therefore infer , that the strength is as the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battens d and i are equal in length and breadth , but the depth of d is 1 , and of i , 2 . Their strengths are 237 and 900. 237 : 900 : : 1 : 3.887 , or nearly 4 . In the same manner compare e and k ; - c and g - and d and h of Table II , and 1 and 4 , of Table III . The ratio of the depths being in each of the above cases as 1 : 2 , we shall compare f , whose length is 24 , depth 1.5 , and breadth .75 , with h , whose length is 24 , depth 2 , and breadth 1 . The mean strength of f is 416 , and of h , 1119 . To prepare f for the comparison , we may suppose its breadth to be increased to one , and then the breaking weight would be 555. ( 23 ) Then 1119 : 555 : : 4 ( square of 2 ) : 1.98 , which differs from 2.25 , the square of 1*5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal breadth and depth , as in the last case , we need not reduce them to a mean breadth before comparing them . We have found the strength of beams to be in proportion to their breadth , and we are led by the above examples to believe that their strength is directly as the squares of their depths . If now we were to compare two beams , one of which is twice as broad and twice as deep as the other , we might double the strength of the smaller on account of breadth , and then quadruple it on account of depth , to obtain the strength of the larger ; - or it would be the same to multiply the strength of the former by 8 , which is the product of the breadth into the square of the depth of the larger . We shall have , then , this rule ; the strength of one beam is to the strength of another of equal lengthy as the product of the breadth into the square of the depth of the former 9 is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter . Compare o and i in this manner . 1.5* x .75 = 1.6875. 2* x 1 =4. 900 : 336 : : 4 : 1.4933 , which differs from 1.6875 bv .1942. /z/ /z/ Compare Nos. 5 and 15 ; 9 and 21 , &c.; of Table IV . Note . The beams in Table IV . are square . The square of the depth multiplied by their breadth will therefore be the same thing as the cube of their depths . 26 . Although there is not a perfect agreement between the experiments and the results obtained in the above comparisons , yet it is sufficient to convince us that the strength of timber is as the square of the depth . Examples* Repeat the examples under the last section , taking in each case the breadth for the depth and the reverse . 27 . It is very obvious from what has now been said , and particularly from the solutions of the last examples , that much more strength is gained by increasing the depth of a piece of timber , than by increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only doubles its strength ; but if the depth be doubled , the strength is increased fourfold . If the breadth be tripled , the strength is increased in the same ratio , but if the depth be tripled , the beam is nine times stronger . 28 . The strength of beams being ( 25 ) as the products of their breadths into the square of their depths , the following examples will be easily solved . i . Suppose a beam whose lateral dimensions are 2 and 1 ; how much more will it bear when placed edgewise than when it is laid flatwise ? ii . Suppose the two dimensions to be 6 and 4 ? 29 . The strength of square beams is as the cube of the side of the square . ( 25 , note . ) Examples . i . One beam is 6.2 square and another 7.3 : they are of the same length ; in what proportion will be their strength I As 238.328 : 389.017 , or 1 : 1.63. ii . Two beams are respectively 6.5 and 6.85 in square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? /z/ Strength of beams as depending upon lengthy breadth , and depth . 30 . We found a method ( 25 ) for bringing the breadth and depth of pieces into one expression , which renders a separate comparison for breadth and depth unnecessary . We may proceed , much in the same manner , with regard to the length . We supposed ( 25 ) two pieces of timber , one of which was twice as deep and twice as broad as the other , and we now add , twice as long . In order to find the strength of the laiger , we were to double the strength of the smaller , on account of the difference in breadth : then quadruple it , on account of the difference in depth : which would be the same thing as multiplying the strength of the former l ? y twice 4 , or 8 . But the larger stick is twice as long . We must , therefore , ( 20 ) take half the product for the strength of the larger stick , instead of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had divided 8 by 2 , and multiplied the strength of the smaller stick by the quotient 4 . It appears , therefore , that the strengths of beams are as the products of their breadths into the square of their depths , divided by their lengths . Thus : If a stick of oak one foot long , one inch broad and one inch deep breaks with 964 lbs* ; what will be the breaking weight of a stick 3 feet long , 2 inches broad , and 3 deep ? - - - = 1 , and - g - 6. then , 1:6 : : 964 /z/ 5784 lbs . answer . 31 . It is evident from the example just given , that if we had a Table , containing the weights necessary to break a piece of each kind of timber , one foot long , one ijtoh broad , and one inch deep , we might easily find die strength of any given stick , by multiplying the proper tabular weight , by the product of the breadth and square of the depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Such a Table is the following . /z/ Table V. Of the transverse strength of sticks of different kinds of wood , each stick being one foot long , one inch broad , and one inch deep . Specific gravity .

Required the strength of a stick of common elm , 12 feet long , 3.75 inches deep , and 3.875 broad . 32 . It is proper to observe , that the foregoing Table does not record the results of experiments , made upon pieces of the size therein supposed . They were made upon pieces , which were longer , but otherwise of like dimensions , except in a few cases . The strength , as stated in the Table , was obtained by reducing the pieces to the dimensions supposed , by the rules which have been given . The above Table is only part of one , which is contained in Tredgold 's Principles of Carpentry . The remainder of his Table is here given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ /z/ i 33 . To shew bow the breaking weights in the table , Art . 29 , were obtained , we will take the first specimen , oak . For the length 2 feet , breadth and depth each one inch , we have in the last table the breaking weight 432 . But the strength is inversely as the length . If therefore the length be reduced to one foot , the strength will be doubled , and the breaking weight will be 964 . Transverse strength of timber , as depending upon specific gravity . 34 . In the Tables I and II , in the first part of this chapter , there are columns , giving the weights which would be necessary to break the battens , after they were reduced to a common specific gravity . It might have been supposed , previous to experiment , that the great diversity in specific gravity , which is observed in wood of the same species , would be accompanied with a corresponding difference in strength . Experiment proves this to be the case , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific gravity and the strength of timber , and what that proportion may be . 35 . Take the experiments Nos. 1 and 2 , Table I. Art . 1 3 . The specific gravities of the pieces are 504 and 533 , and their corresponding strengths 360 and 388. 504 : 533 : : 360 : 380.4 , which does not differ greatly from 388 . This example would lead us to conclude that the strength of timber of the same species , is directly as the specific gravity . This is the law which Mr. Barlow has adopted as the result of his experiments , and according to which , he made the reduction of his experiments to pieces of a common specific gravity ; and although a slight examination of Mr. Barlow 's experiments will convince us , that this law is far from being as accurate as those , which wp have * before deduced , it will also satisfy us , that no general statement of the ratio between the specific gravity of timber and its strength , can be more accurate . 36 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe that the weights of the pieces are given - , and by comparing the weights of /z/ PWWh /z/ pieces of the same dimensions , with the weights necessary to break them , he will he able to prove the correctness of the above rule . 37 . If , as in Table IV , bodies of the same size have different weights , the heaviest are said to be specifically heavier , than the others , or to have a greater specific gravity ; the specific gravity of a body , therefore , is its weight , compared with the weight of another body of the same size . The weight of water is adopted as a standard , and its specific gravity is 1 ; and when we say the specific gravity of a body is .600 , we mean that a quantity of it would weigh six tenths as much as the same bulk of water . One cubic foot of Water ( rain ) weighs 1000 ounces , or 62.5 pounds . In order therefore to ascertain the specific gravity of a piece of timber ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cubic feet* This will give the weight of a cubic foot of the timber . Then say 62.5 : J : : the weight of a cubic foot : specific gravity . 38 . To illustrate the above rule , take the first specimen in Table IV . . a j 9*. / ( inches ( length ) X 4.28 X 4.28 =r 1A40.0 . It contains therefore only ffift a cubic foot . Divide the weight 64.5 by this fraction ; i. e. multiply by the denominator and divide by the numerator , and we obtain 72.05 for the weight of a cubic foot . Then /z/ 39 . We have not introduced the specific gravity as an element for calculating the strength of timber , into the Rule in Art . 31 , because it might not always be convenient for the carpenter to ascertain it . And if he should ascertain it , there is no difficulty in making allowance for it , after the strength of the stick has been computed by the rule . 40 . The specific gravity of timber varies with the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce of a good dry soil is much denser than the growth of soils of opposite qualities . Duhamel states that the density or specific gravity of the same species of timber , and in the same climate , but the growth of different soils , will vary as much as 7 : 5 , and that the strength will be as 6 : 4 . The greater specific gravity before seasoning increases the strength of timber . Dry timber will therefore support less than greeta. /z/ Of the stiffness of Rectangular Beams* 41 . Timber is rarely subjected to strains sufficient to occasion fracture . It is more frequently exposed to bending , which is always a source of inconvenience , and often of very serious injury . The stiffness of timber is therefore a more interesting problem to the carpenter , than the strength . Indeed if a carpenter provides for the stiffness of his timber , he secures the strength of his work , and however accurately he may calculate the strength of his materials , if he neglects the stiffness , it is very possible , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of position in his constructions , as will be followed by a total failure . 42 . The stiffness of beams depends upon the different circumstances of length , breadth , and depth , and the influence , which each of these exerts , must be examined . The stiffness of beams is ascertained by their deflections , the manner of observing which was described in the last chapter ( 13 ) . * Instead of speaking of the stiffness of beams , we shall speak of these deflections , for in fact , the great point in regard to the stiffness of beams , is to be able to ascertain the amount of deflection , which a beam would suffer , under any given circumstances . - These deflections will vary , also , with the weight , with which the beam is loaded , and this , therefore , will be another circumstance to be regarded in the inquiry contained in this chapter . 43 . The following Table is from Mr. Barlow 's Essay , page 1 20 . Experiments on the deflection of fir battens* ' No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon three pieces of fir , of very " uniform texture . " Deflection as depending upon the length* 44 . From the experiments a and c , of the foregoing Table , it appears that the lengths of the battens , being 3 and 6 , other circumstances the same , the deflections are 9 and 68 . Now , 9 : 68 : : 1 : 7.55 . That is , the lengths being as 1 : 2 , the deflections are as 1 : 7.55 . Again , compare the deflections in the experiments b and d , in which the length of the pieces are in the same ratio of 1 : 2. /z/ The ratio which seems to be indicated by these experiments is 1 : 8 , when the lengths are as 1 : 2 . But 8 is the cube of 2 . The result seems then to be that the deflection of beams is as the cube of their lengths* Let the student compare e and g if and A , &c,; and he will find , with as little deviation as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prof. Barlow was led to consider the subject of this section with much attention , in consequence of finding himself at variance with M. Girard , who makes the deflections of beams to be as the squares of their lengths . In order to satisfy himself , he instituted the following experiments , and neglected no circumstance which could insure their accuracy . No* 1 , props 9 feet apart , the deflection was 27 parts . No. 2 , props 9 feet apart , the deflection was 40.5 . These experiments agree very exactly with the supposition , that the deflections are as the cubes of their lengths , and leave no doubt of its correctness . 46 . This result is confirmed by the experiments of M. Dupin . The following Table is from the Journal de 1'ecole polytechnique , Tom . X , p. 202 . Experiments upon Oak battens of 2 centimetres by 3 , charged with the weight of 10 kilogrames . Weight of the battens 0.94 kit . 47 . The experiments of Dupin are recorded in the upper half of the last table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third line contains the cubes of the distances of the props , or lengths of the batten . In order to shew that these cubes are proportional to the deflections , the deflections are given in the fourth line , divided by .006 . The ratio of the deflections is not change /z/ ed by the . division , and the agreement of the last two lines therefore , confirms the ratio of the deflection to the cubes of the lengths . M. Dupin has a similar table of experiments on a batten of Fir . Examples . i . If the deflection of a beam 4 feet long be .7 inch , what will be the deflection of a similar beam , of 10 feet long , acted upon by a similar weight ? 4 3 : 10 3 : : .7 : 10.93 inches , Ans. ii . What would be the deflection of a similar beam 23.5 feet long ? iii . A beam 6 feet long being deflected 1 inch by a certain weight , how much will a similar beam 3.75 feet long be deflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as depending upon length and /z/ 49 . Not being acquainted with any experiments , which exhibit separately the influence of breadth and depth upon the stiffness of timber , I procured several pieces of pine of different dimensions , from v ? hich I selected two , which were each , three feet and a few inches in length , one being an inch square , and the other an inch by an inch and a half . The larger* dimension of the latter piece was successively made the breadth and the depth . The props were 3 feet asunder , the same weights were used in each case , and the deflections were carefully measured by a scale of 55 parts to an inch . The results are recorded in the following Table . 50 . Compare the first deflection of the battens ( a ) and ( b ) with their breadths. /z/ In the same manner compare the other deflections , and it will appear that the deflections are inversely as the breadth , or , which is the same thing , the stiffness is directly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battens ( a ) and ( c ) with their depths . /z/ which differs but .33 from 3.37 the cube of 1.5 . Compare the second deflections ; which differs from 3.37 by only , 03 in excess . In the same way compare the third deflections . These results would indicate , that the deflections are inversely as the cubes of the depths ; - or that the stiffness is directly as the cube of the depth . 52 . At different times I have made other experiments , but doubting their exactness , I have thrown them aside , although some , of them agreed remarkably well with the above conclusion . 53 . If the above propositions ( 50 and 51 ) are correct , it will follow , that the deflections of rectangular beams will be inversely as their breadths multiplied by the cubes of their depths . To satisfy ourselves then of their correctness , we may apply this rule to ' some of the experiments in the Table , Art . 43 . Take the experiments ( i ) and ( n ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5* X2 a 6.75. /z/ which differs from 6.75 by .09 . Let the student in the same manner compare k and o , d and h , u and z , &c.; 54 . The following Table is from the memoir . of M. Dupin , before quoted . Deflections of a rod of Fir , - lateral dimensions 0.03 and 0.04 metres . These experiments compared in the same manner as the last , will give you the same result . m /z/ STirfNI &fl; OP BBAMS. 3 55 ; More experiments might be adduced , but the above sufficiently proves the proposition* in articles 50 ; 51 , and 53* Examples* , i . Two beams have the same breadth ; bat the depth of one is twice as great as the depth of the other : how much greater will be its stiffness ? 8 times . ii . If the lateral dimensions of a beam are 6 inches and 10 ; how much stifler will it be laid edgewise , than flatwise ? 2.77 times* iii . Suppose the lateral dimensions are 4 and 9 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflecting weight . /z/ 56 . In the last Table , ( 54 ) we have a weight of 2 kilograms causing a deflection equal to 16 : 4 kil. a deflection equal to 32 , and so on ; the deflections increasing exactly in the ratio of the weights . In the Table Art . 40 , the same thing is shewn by comparing a with 6 , &c.; and it may be concluded with safety , that the deflection of beams supported at both ends is as the deflecting weight* Examples . i . If a weight of 2500 lbs . produses a deflection of one inch in a beam ; what deflection will 727 lbs . produce ? ii . What will 1895 produce ? 57 . This ratio of the deflection of beams to the deflecting weight is not true without some limitation . It will be seen by referring to Mr. Barlow 's experiments , marked l , M , and k , in Art . 13 , that although the above ratio holds to a certain extent , yet , when the weight increases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deflection increases in a much higher ratio . The elasticity of the timber is then impaired ; there is a new arrangement of the particles , and if the load should be removed from a beam under such circumstances , it would not resume its original position . It is therefore said to have taken a set . For all practical purposes , however , the law is sufficiently exact , for a judicious carpenter will never expose his timber to a. strain sufficient to impair its elasticity . /z/ Deflection of beams as depending upon lur oth , breadthdepth , and weight , with rules for scantlings* 58 . We have found in the preceding sections , that the deflections of beams are directly as the weights and cubes of their lengths , and inversely as the breadths and cubes of the depths* Following the same method of reasoning as in Art . 30 , we should sura these particulars in one general rule , as follows . The deflections of beams are in proportion to the product of deflecting weights by the cube of their lengths , divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths . 59 . If a beam of New-England Fir , 7 feet long , 2 inches broad , and 2 inches deep is bent .97 of an inch by a weight of 150 lbs . what will be the deflection of a beam one foot long and one inch square , loaded with one pound ? To solve this question we have the proposition - Zz cr ' .97 : : t : .0003. 2 3 xl l 3 X 1 which gives .0003 of an inch for the result . By obtaining similar results for different kinds ' of timber , we might construct a Table similar to that in Art . 31 . Such a Table would enable the carpenter to ascertain easily , what would be the deflection of a stick under any circumstances ; but it would not be found so useful as the one given below Indeed , without such a table , be may obtain from table Art . 61 the deflection for any stick , as we have above for a stick one foot long . 60 . Timber subjected to a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore is not required to be absolutely inflexible , in order to be stiff* " A deflection of one fourth of an inch in a joist 20 feet long would not be attended with any bad effect , " and such a joist might therefore be considered stiff . " In order that two pieces of different lengths may be equally stiff , the deflection should be in proportion to their length ? . Hence , the rules given by mathematical writers , for determining the stiffness of beams , are not adapted to the carpenter 's purpose : yet they are perfectly correct on the principle of making the deflection always the same , whatever the length may be . " * 62 . " The constant number a is calculated upon the supposition that the deflection is equal to one fortieth of an inch , for each fobt in length i. when the length is one foot , the weight will produce a deflection of one fortieth of an inch ; when the length is 20 feet , the deflection will be twenty fortieths , or half an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he intends to calculate the scantling of a beam , what degree of deflection the beam may take without injury to the work . When the deflection must be less than one fortieth of an inch to a foot , multiply the constant number a " by some number that will reduce the deflection to the degree required . If e. g. the deflection should be only half of a fortieth , multiply a by 2 ; if a third of one fortieth multiply a by 3 and so on . If , again , the deflection may be greater than one fortieth per foot , divide a by 2 , 3 , or any number of times , that the proposed deflection may exceed one fortieth of an inch per foot .

Bearing of a beam of pitch pine being 14 feet , depth 10 in. and weight 2000 lbs . required the breadth . 64 . But generally neither the breadth nor depth is given . In this case , fix on some proportion , which the breadth shall have to the depth , as e. g. .6 , then the rule will be as follows : Rule 3 . Multiply the weight in pounds by the value of a ; divide the product by .6 , and extract the square root , Multiply this , root by the length in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the depth in inches . - To obtain the breadth , multiply # depth by .6 . Note . If the breadth is to be .4 of the depth , substitute .4 for in the rule , and so with any other quantity , which may be taken to express the relation of breadth to depth . Examples . i . A be$m of Riga fir is intended to sustain a ton in the middle of its length ; bearing 22 fet ; what must be the dimensions ? 66 . The quantity of timber in a beam being given , the stiffness will be increased by increasing the depth ( 51 ; 53 ) . If , however , a beam is made very thin , it will be liable to overturn and /z/ break sideways . Unless , therefore , a beam can be held in its position by other means , there must be a limit , a certain proportion between the depth and breadth , which ought not to be exceeded . To find this proportion the following Rule is given by Mr. Tredgold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root of the depth in inches , and multiply the quotient by the decimal .6 , for the breadth in inches . ' Example . The length of a beam being 24 feet , and the depth 12 inches , what should be its breadth by the above Rule . /z/ 6.9 x .6 = 4.14 , the breadth required . 67 . To find the strongest form for a beam , so as to use only a given quantity of timber , the following Rule is given by the same Author . Rule . Multiply the length in feet by the decimal .6 , and divide the given area in inches by the product : the square of the quotient will give the depth in inches . Example* If the bearing be 20 feet , and the given area of section be 48 inches , then 68 . The stiffest beam that can be cut out of a round tree , is that , of which the breadth is to the depth as and this is a good proportion for beams that have to sustain a considerable load , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tree to obtain them as deep as the foregoing rules would require . /z/ Of the stiffness of beams when the weight is unipobmly distributed over the length , 69 . We hare hitherto supposed the weight which causes deflection in a beam to be suspended from the middle of it If , instead of this , the weight should be divided into smalt and equal parts , and these distributed uniformly over the whole length of the beam , we should find , that the beam in bending would assume a different curve , and that the descent of the middle part , which we have called the deflection , would be less . 70 . To determine the ratio between the deflection produced by the weights uniformly distributed , and that produced by the same weights accumulated in the centre , we have the following table , containing the results of the experiments of M. Dupiiu* 71 . It has been shown above , that the deflections are as the deflecting weights . In the first experiment above , the deflection for 6 kilograms is .003 metres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The third and fourth experiments give this ratio exactly . The deflection of a beam , therefore , when the weights art uniformly distributed over its length , is to the deflection , when a weight , equal to their sum is applied to the centre , as 19 : 30. 72 . If we wish to calculate the deflection of a beam , the weight being distributed through its length ; we have only to calculate the /z/ deflection , upon the supposition of an equal weight acting in the centre , ( 59 ) and take nineteen thirtieths of it , or , which is the same thing , multiply it by .63* 73 . In calculating scantlings by the rules Art . 63 and 64 , if in* stead of using the wtole weight we employ nineteen thirtieths of it or .63 of it , we shalwmve the proper scantling beam , when the weight is uniformly distributMhflfrer it . For ofineteen thirtieths of the weight acting at the centre will cause the same deflection as the whole weight uniformly distributed . Examples . i . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches broad , and is required to support 1000 lbs . uniformly diffused oyer its length ; what should be its depth ? /z/ and 482.33 = 7*84 , the depth required* ii . The examples in Art* 60 may be repeated , upon the supposition that the weights are uniformly distributed . 74 . Rafters , purlines , ceiling posts and binding joists , that support ceilings only , have their weight uniformly distributed . Flooring joists have to resist strains at one point . A floor might seem stiff enough to support a unifofmjoad , and yet shake very much by the weight of a single person moving over it . 75 . M. Dupin gives a curious problem , for ascertaining the weight of a large stick of timber of uniform depth . Place its ends upon two supports of the same height , and observe the deflection by its own weight ; - then add a known weight to the middle , and observe the additional deflection . Then as .63 of the second deflection is to the first deflection , so is the weight added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be easy from the above principles to find the deflection , which any given beam would suffer from its own weight . Let the weight of the beam be supposed to be accumulated at the centre , and having calculated the deflection , as in Art . 56 , multiply the deflection so found by .63. /z/ Examples* i . How much will a stick of Weymouth pine be deflected by its own weight ; the stick being 15 feet long and 6 inches square , weighing 100 lbs . ii . How much will a stick of yellow Riga fir be deflected by its own weight , supposing it to be 30 feet long , 6 inches deep , and 7 inches broad ? Note . The weight of . the stick may be calculated from its dimensions and specific gravity . iii If a stick of pine , resting on supports at its extremities , bends by its own weight .025 of an inch , and if by the action of a weight of 200 lbs . placed upon its centre , the deflection increases .13 of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Note* Solve this example by Art . 7 &; ' /z/ Of ike strength and stiffness of beams fixed at both ends and loaded at the centre . 77 . The difference between the strength and stiffness of beams metelv supported at each end , and of those , whose ends are fixed so as not to be capable of rising by the action of the weight suspended from the middle , has been alluded to : the inquiry now H , what is the difference . These experiments then give us the ratio of 2 : 3 , as the ratio of the strength of two similar sticks , one of which is supported , and the ofhev fixed at each end . In other words , a beam merely supported at each end , has only two thirds the strength of a similar beam , whose ends are fixed . /z/ This ratio is confirmed by the first and second of Belidor 's experiments , Art . 17. 80 . The strength of a stick of chesnut 11*5 feet long , 8 in. deep , and 6 broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Example 2 , Art . 31 . ) What will be its strength it fixed at both ends . It is obvious that we obtain the strength required , if we add half of 6012 to itself , thus : /z/ 8 lbs , answer , for 6012 is two thirds of 9018 . We have then this very simple Rule , find the strength of a beam , whose ends are supported ; add one half this strength to itself and the sum is the strength of the beam when its ends are fixed . Examples . i . A beam , whose ends are supported can bear 10956 lbs . How much will it sustain if its ends are fixed ? ii . What weight will be necessary to break a stick of sycamore , fixed at both ends , whose length is 9 feet , breadth and depth 5 inches ? iii . What is the strength of a beam of oak , medium quality , fixed at both ends ; length 10 feet , breadth and depth 6 inches ? i v. Of American pine ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both ends . 81 . The same ratio of 2 : 3 , appears to take place between the stiffness of a beam supported , and that of one fixed at each end . In the 56th experiment of the table , Art . 15 , we have .75 of an inch for the deflection of a stick 72 in long , and 2 in. square , under a weight of 221 lbs . ; while the deflection of a similar stickfixed at both ends , is .45 inch , and .75 : .45 nearly as 3 : 2 ; but the deflections are inversely as the stiffness , which therefore is , in the two cases , as 2 : 3. 82 . If we take the average deflection of tire experiments n , Art . /z/ 15 , and of those in the last table , we shall have for that of the supported beam .70 , and for the fixed .4275 ; the weight in each case being 221 lbs . And .70 : .4275 : : 3 : 2 , within a very small fraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 42 lbs . be taken and compared , a very considerable variation from the above ratio will be observed . The deflection of the fixed beam would be .69 ; of the supported 1.32. 1.32 : .69 : : 2 : 1 , nearly . The reason of this deviation will be found in 4rt. 57 . The deflection increases in a higher ratio than that of the weight , when the weight is sufficient to impair the elasticity of the timber , and the nearer it approaches to that which causes fracture : - and 421 is a much greater part of the breaking weight of the supported stick 744 , than of the fixed one 1116 . To this may be added , that , from a comparison . of the tables referred to in this section , , it would appear that when the ends of a stick arexecF , the increase of deflection before the fracture is not so rapid . 83* " We can not , " Mr. Tredgold observes , " in practice fix the ends of a beam into a wall without endangering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beams to suit such a case , is not an object of much importance . When , however , a lotig beam is laid on several points of support , a case of very common occurrence in building , the strength of the intermediate part is nearly twice as much " ( or greater in the ratio of 3 : 2 , according to the above observation ) " as when the beams are cut into short lengths . Hence the carpenter will see the importance of using bridging and ceiling joists , purlities and rafters , in considerable lengths ; so that a joist may extend over several binding joists ; purlines over several trusses , and rafters over several purlines* Also by contriving so that , the joinings shall not be opposite one another , a floor or rodf may be made tolerably equal in strength . Hence also the necessity of notching joists , purlines and rafters over the supports , instead of framing them between . " 84 . Instead of the ratio 3 : 2 , some writers , Emerson and Robinson , and Tredgold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fixed beam double that of a supported one . Experiment is , how- v /z/ ever , against them ; and we have preferred to follow its guidance* We are , also , not unsupported by theory ; as the ratio of 3 : 2 is obtained by Prof. Barlow from his analytical investigations . chapter v. Strength and deflection of solid and hollow cylinders supported at each end . 35 . To ascertain these points by experiments , our materials are nmited . The following table of experiments is tlte only one , I have yet seen . Experiments by Duhamel are referred to by Tredgold , but he makes no use of them . Experiments on hollow and solid cylinders , supported at each end qwq /z/ Mr. Barlow remarks that the ash cylinders , although of a weak quality , " gave very uniform results , and furnish a good com- /z/ parison between the strength of solid and hollow cylinders among themselves .

Examples* i .

It will be seen that nearly one third of the wood may be taken away from the centre , without greatly impairing the strength .

This proportion being derived from the comparison of very few experiments , it may be satisfactory to the reader to observe , that it is the same , which has been deduced from those theoretical investigations , whose results have been found in other cases to agree most exactly with experiment . The following Rule then may serve for calculating the strength of timber fixed at one end . Find the strength of a stick of the same dimensions supported at both ends and loaded in the middle , and take one quarter of it . Examples . i .

As beams , fixed at one end and loaded at the other , are very rarely used in building , we shall add no more to this Chapter , than the following quotations from Prof. Barlow . " We conclude that the deflection of a beam fixed at one end in a wall , and loaded at the other , is double that of a beam of twice the length , supported at both ends , and loaded in the middle with a double weight : that is , the strain being the same in both cases : consequently , when the weights are the same , the deflection in the first case is to that in the second as 4 : 1 " And when the length and weight are both the same , the deflections will be as 1 : 32 . " Essay , p. 115. 44 When a beam or rod is fixed only at one end , the deflection , when the weight is uniformly distributed , is to the same when collected at the extremity , as 3 : 8 whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deflections in the like cases are to each other as 5 : /q/ " Whence , if a rod or plank is , in the first instance , supported in the middle , and the ends be deflected ; and in the second , the ends supported and the middle left to descend , the deflection in the latter case is to that in the former as 5 : 3 . " Essay p. 117. /z/ Of the mechanism of the Transverse Strain* 95 . When a beam is supported at its ends , and is deflected by the action of a load , the fibres in the upper part of the beam are compressed , and those of the under part are extended . Between the compressed and extended fibres there is a stratum of fibres , which suffer neither compression nor extension , and are therefore situated in what is called the neutral axis of the beam . 96 . The position of the neutral axis in rectangular beams was determined by Mr. Barlow , by observing , after the fracture of the batten , the part which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably distinguished from the extended , by the former breaking short , while the latter was drawn out in long fibres . Before the fracture took place , the external appearance of the pressure exhibited itself in a wedge-like form , the lower point of which , when the beam was broken on two props , was commonly found to divide the depth of the beam in the ratio , which was derived from observations on the fracture . This ratio was 5 of compressed parts to 3 extended ; i. e. the position of the neutral axis was five eighths of the depth from the upper surface . 97 . The following curious experiments of Duhamel afford a method of ascertaining , with tolerable exactness , the position of the neutral axis ; and they shew strikingly how small a part of a beam contributes to the strength , by its tenacity . He took 16 bars of willow 2 feet long and half an inch square , and supporting them on props at the ends , suspended weights from /z/ the middle . Four of them were broken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lbs . - the mean being 45 . He then cut four of them one third through , across the upper side , and filled up the cuts with a thin piece of hard wood , and they were broken by 48 , 54 , 50 , and 52 lbs . - the mean being 51 . Four others were cut one half through , and the cuts filled . They were broken by 47 , 49 , 50 and 46 , - the mean being 48 . The four remaining bars were cut two thirds through , and their mean strength was 42 lbs . In another set of experiments upon bars of willow 3 feet long and 1.5 inch square , the mean strength of 6 uncut bars was 525 lbs . - of 6 cut one third through and filled as above , 551 - of ' 6 cut one half through , 542 - and of 6 cut three fourths through , 530 lbs . In another experiment a bar of the same dimensions was cut three fourths through , and after being loaded sometime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin slip taken out , and a " wedge put in to straighten the bar again , and it then bore 577 lbs . Probably by increasing the thickness of the wedge it would have borne still more . Prof. Barlow repeated experiments similar to the above , with nearly the same results . 98 . When beams are fixed at one end , and loaded at the other the fibres of the upper surface are extended , while those of the lower are compressed . 99 . In many of the theories , which have been proposed in relation to the strength of timber , the compression of any part of the beam , subjected to a transverse strain , is entirely overlooked . They suppose , that when a beam is supported at both ends , and loaded in the middle , the fibres throughout the depth are extended , and in proportion to their distance from the upper surface . The fibres of the upper surface have to sustain the extension of those below , as a fulcrum , and of course such speculations do not merely neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it might be supposed , theories so deficient , have led te inferences altogether at variance with fact . /z/ It is inferred , e. g. from such speculations , that a triangular beam supported at both ends , will support a greater load with the edge uppermost , than with the base uppermost , because the fibres of the lower surface being farther from the fulcrum , exert a greater influence than the others , and the more there are of them , or the wider the under surface , the stronger the beam . This inference , if we consider the compressibility of timber , and suppose ( as has been shown to be the case with willow and fir ) that the compressibility is greater than the extensibility , is manifestly false ; , for in such a case the breadth of the base is wanted to resist the compressibility , rather than the extension . In order , therefore , to ascertain , whether a triangular beam would be stronger with its edge or its base uppermost , it is necessary to have reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it consists . Thus , Mr. Barlow found triangular beams of fir , supported at both ends , to be strongest with the base uppermost ; whereas Mr. Couch found triangular oak beams acted upon in the same manner , to be strongest with the angle uppermost. * 101 . We have said that hollow tubes are stiffer and stronger than solid cylinders of the same quantity of matter . Ft is added by some theorists , that the tubes will be stronger , the nearer the opening is to one side ; the upper side , if they are supported at both ends - the under side , if fixed by one end . This supposition proceeds from the same false principle , as the inference in relation to the triangular beams , and still worse than that , it is invariably false . 102 . What is said above of triangular beams , applies to trapezoidal , or those which have their breadths at the upper and under surfaces different . 103 . Although timber is not capable of very great compression , and has no limits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought to be generally more easily compressed than extended by the strains , to which we expose it . If so , the position of beams should be just the reverse of that recommended by such theorists as we have just alluded to . /z/ 104 . From the view we have now given of the nature of the transverse strain , we may see the propriety of several maxims , which have been long familiar to experienced workmen . A mortice should not be cut out of that side of a beam , which will become convex by a strain* It may be cut out of the part which becomes concave , because the place may be filled with the tenon , which , if well fitted , will answer the same purpose as the thin slips of wood in the experiments of Duhamel. - A mortice would be still better near the neutral axis . A fish or strap should be applied to the convex side . /z/ Of the lateral strength of timber . . 105 . The strain , which has been considered in treating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weight , being placed at the middle of a stick , resting upon supports at the extremities , or at one end , when the other is fixed in a wall , acts with the aid of a lever . The pin at the joint of a pair of pincers or scissors , broken by the strain , would present a case of simple transverse fracture . 106 . The experiments we have upon this kind of strain , are those of Dr. Robinson . In performing them he made use of " two iron bars disposed horizontally at an inch distance , and a third , which was hung perpendicularly between them , being supported by a pin made of the substance to be examined . This pin was made of a prismatic form , so as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars , which were made very exact , and of the same size and shape . A scale was suspended at the lower end of the perpendicular bar , and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin , which filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lateral cohesion of two sections . The side bars were made to grasp the middle /z/ bars pretty strongly between them , that there might be no distance imposed between the opposite pressures . This would have combined the energy of the lever with the purely transverse pressure* For the same reason the internal parts of the holes should be no smaller than the edges . " * 107 . Great irregularities occurred in the first experiments , because the pins were somewhat tighter within than at the edges ; but when this was corrected , they were extremely regular . 1 hree sets of holes were employed , a circle , a square and an equilateral triangle . In all the experiments , the strength was exactly proportional to the area of the section and quite independent of its figure or position* It was also found that the strength was considerably above the direct cohesion , 108 . The difference between the lateral strength , found m this way , and the direct cohesion , was very constant in any one substance , but varied from four thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bodies , being smallest in fibrous bodies . - On account of the insufficiency of the apparatus , no experiments were made upon bodies whose cohesion is very great . Brick and freestone were among the strongest . 107 . Although it appears that the lateral strength is proportional to the area of the section , it is advisable that bearing surfaces should be wide and fiat , for all matter is compressible , and wood especially is most so , across the fibre . Should the part r therefore , which first receives the strain , be narrow or thin , it may be crippled before the strength of the other fibres be brought into action . This principle should always be kept in view in forming tenons and mortises , or joints of a similar kind , and appears well known to the intelligent carpenter . The same thing is frequently aimed at by making the tenon long , and giving it a deep hold in the mortise . Such a practice gives no additional strength , and is even injurious . For if the tenon bear upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strain comes to act upon it with the energy of a lever , and may thus be increased in any degree . The bearing side of a. tenon being no longer than sufficient to give a firm hold , the end may be beveled above till flush with /z/ the upper side of the beam . We may trust to every square inch of such a tenon the weight which is given ( Art . 5 ) as the measure of the direct cohesion of the kind of timber employed 110 . Mr. Barlow has made some experiments upon that resistance , which hinders a piece of strait grained timber from sliding out in the direction of the fibre . This resistance he calls lateral adhesion . He found that of fir to be equal to 592 pounds to a square inch . The only experiments besides his , in relation to this point , which we have seen , are those of Mr. Tredgold , already given in Art . 9 ; and these do not seem to have been made in the same manner . Experiments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of calculating the resistance , for example , which an abutment at the end of a lie-beam offers to being crushed ' off by the horizontal thrust of a rafter ; or the distance at which the abutting surface ought to be made from the end of the tie , in order that the resistance might be sufficient to sustain a given pressure . Examples* i . Suppose the tie to be of fir , 6 inches broad , and the distance of the abutting surface from the end of it to be 6 inches . The lateral adhesion of the abutment to the beam is therefore by a surface of 36 square inches . t This multiplied by 592 , ( the lateral adhesion of 1 square inch ) is equal to 21312 lbs . the whole . lateral adhesion of the abutment , or the resistance it offers to being crushed off . In practice , the strain should not be more than one fourth of this , which is 5328. ii . Suppose the horizontal thrust of a rafter to be 5600 lbs . and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abutting surface be from the end of the tie ? The abutment should be able to support 4 times the thrust , or 52400 , which divided by 592 gives the adhering surface , 37.8 , and this again divided by 6 ( the breadth of the tie-beam ) gives 6.3 for the length of the abutment . Note . The method of calculating the horizontal thrust of a rafter , will be given in the 2d part of this work . - &#9632; &#9632; ' &#9632; &#9632; &#9632; .. . , t * Edin Enc . Art , Carp . + It is here , for simplicity , supposed that there is no tenon in the joint u /z/ Of the stiffness of timber to resist compression in the direction of its length* 111 . Much has been written upon the resistance of materials to this kind of strain , from which the practical man will derive little satisfaction . Most if not all the theories , which have been published , have not been derived from experiments , or even constructed with any reference to the actual constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingenuity of their authors " , they fail in their practical applications . If we turn to experiments , we are disappointed in our expectations ; for their results are too irregular to furnish us with . any genera conclusions . Experiments on this strain can not be made with accuracy , without an expensive apparatus , and unless they are so made , they are useless . The principal experiments are those of Lamande and those of Girard. * 112 . The very grgat resistance of timber to compression in the direction of its length , renders it a less matter of regret , that our acquaintance with its laws is so deficient . ' Timber is not often broken or bent by a direct pressure of this kind , especially when the load is so placed as to bring the whole resistance into action . It is therefore even more important to attend-to the circumstances which favor the resistance , anil to the neglect of which many of the irregularities in experiments are owing ; than to know the actual amount of resistance , especially in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheu # a stick of timber is fairly pressed in the direction of its length , we can hardly conceive it possible for it to be bent , except it be by one side being less capable of resisting the compresssion than the other . This is the common cause of bending , and it at once suggests the necessity of avoiding all defects in the sides of /z/ Carpentry , p. 51 , copied from Gautheys ' construction des ponts . Hs may also find this of Girard ' $ in Bees ' Cyclopedia , Art . * ' Strength of materials " /z/ sticks , which are to bear a great strain of this kind , or weakening the sides in any other way . 114 . The bending may be caused by the load not being over the centre or axis of the stick ; for if the load be nearer one side than the other , that side will be most compressed , and will soonest yield . This suggests the necessity of making the ends of posts perfectly square , so that they may bear evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . 115 . When a stick is strongly compressed in a longitudinal direction , a slight lateral strain may cause it to bend , and if it continues , will , as experience has often shown , produce a sudden fracture . Lateral strains should therefore be carefully avoided . 1 1 6 . When a post is square , or its lateral dimensions are nearly equal , it will bend under a load , in two directions . It is often in our power to brace a post in. one direction , in a building , so that it shall only fee able to bend in the other . If then we increase the dimension , in the direction of which only it can be bent , we may greatly increase its stiffness , without increasing the scantling . For instance , a square upright of 6 inches , in a partition , will not be , at farthest , more than one third as stiff , as one of 4 inches by 9. 117 . When a stick of timber is exposed to compression , it yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion between its length , and the area of its cross section Suppose the piece to be a cylinder , then if its length be greater than 8 Or 10 times its diameter , a sufficient force will cause it to bend , and break about the middle of its length . But when the length is less in proportion to its diameter , the piece will bulge out in the middle , and split in several places. * When the height of the column or post is more than ten diameters . 118 . That we may not leave this subject , without sorwe rules for calculating the strength - of columns , posts , and other beams , pressed in the direction of their length , we quote the following from Mr , Tredgold . Tredgold , p. 47. iMJlffi'tti tiff /z/ * ' The strain , " he observes , " will be directly as the weight or pressure , and inversely as the strength , which is as the cube of the diameter* The strain will also be directly as the deflection , which will be as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square of the length , and inversely as the diameter .

Since a column or post tends to break in the middle , when overloaded , it is generally supposed that an enlargement of that part will add to its strength , and further , that a column or pillar , to be equally strong throughout , must have the form generated by the revolution of two parabolas .

Mr* Ronnie 's Experiments were published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1816 . They may be found tn Nicholson s Operative Mechanic . t BarloWyp.fa. /z/ On the resistance to compression at the joints of framing* 125 . " There is yet another kind of resistance to compression to be considered ; which is , when the end of one piece is pressed against the side of another piece . The strength of the joints of framing depends in some degree on this kind of resistance ; for unless the resistance at the joint be equal to the pressure , a degree of compression may take place that would produce considerable derangement in the framing , if not a total failure . u In order to obtain some information on this important point , I made the following experiments : I prepared two pieces of good Memel fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the other , 1 loaded it successively wiljh 800 , 900 , 1000 , 1 100 , 1200 and 1300 pounds upon a square inch , examining the effect of each trial ; the impression was faint with 900 pounds , but became very distinct with 1000 pounds ; therefore 1 consider the pressure on the joints of timbers of yellow fir , should never be greater than 1000 pounds per square inch . The position of the annual rings makes a considerable difference , for in some trials the impression was very distinct with 950 pounds . English oak was next tried ; with a load of 1400 lbs the impression appeared to be about the same as 1000 pounds produced in Memel fir ; and there was less difference from varying the position of the rings . " * chapter x . On the construction iqf Floors . " f 126 . The timbers which support the flooring boards and ceiling of a room are called , irf carpentry , the naked flooring . There are different kinds of naked flooring , but they may all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted from TredgoUTs Pr . of Carp , with no other alteration than to adapt the references to the present work . /z/ ed within the three following ones ; viz. single joisted floors , double floors , and framed floors . i . Single joisted floors . A single joisted floor consists of only one series of joists . The following figure shows a section across the joists of a single joisted floor . n Sometimes every third or fourth joist is made deeper , and the ceiling joists fixed to the deep joists , and crossing them at right angles . This is an improvement in a situation where there is not space for a double floor . The annexed figure shows a section of a floor of this kind . It increases the depth of a floor very little , and will not allow sounds to pass so freely as a single joisted floor , and the ceilings will stand better . The ceiling joists A , are notched to the deep joists B , B , and nailed . 127. ii . Double floors . 4 double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , binding joists , bridging joists , and ceiling joists ; the binding joists are the chief support of the floor , and the bridging joists are notched upon the upper side of them ; the ceiling joists are either notched to the under side , or framed between them with chased mortises ; the best method is to notch them . The figure below shows a section of a double floor , across the binding joists B , B. The bridging joists D are notched over , and the ceiling joists A are notched under the binding joists . 128. iii . Framed floors differ from double floors only in having the binding joists framed into large pieces of timber called girders. /z/ The next figure shows a section across the girders of a framed floor ; where B , B , are the binding joists . Single joisting makes a much stronger floor , with the same quantity of timber , than a double or framed floor , and may be constructed with equal ease to the same extent of bearing ; but the ceilings are more subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings can be used only in inferior buildings . When it is desirable to have a perfect ceiling , a double floor is used ; and when the bearing is long , a framed floor becomes the most convenient . The following experiment was made on the comparative strength of framed and single joisted floors by Professor Robison. 129 . Two models were made 18 inches square , one consisted of single joists , the other framed with girders , binding joists , bridging and ceiling joists ; the single joists of the one contained the same quantity of timber with the girders alone of the other . They - were placed in a wooden trunk 18 inches square within , with a projection on the inside for the floors to rest on ; and small shot was gradually poured over . The single joisted floor broke down with 487 pounds , the framed floor with 327 pounds. * The difference would not be . quite so much on a large scale , because the girders would not be so much weakened by mortises . This is not the Only case where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows how necessary it is to distinguish those parts which really support a load , from those which only appear to do so . 130 . In order to make a strong floor with a small quantity of timber , the joists should be thin and deep ; but a certain degree of /q/ thickness is necessary , for the purpose of nailing the hoards , and two inches is perhaps as thin as the joists ought to be made ; though sometimes they are made thinner . To find the depth of a joist , the length of bearing and breadth being given , for a single joisted floor . Rule . Divide the square of the length in feet , by the breadth in inches ; and the , cube root of the quotient multiplied by 2.2 for fir , or 2.3 for oak , will give the depth in inches . Note . The constant number in this , and in all the rules for flooring and roofing , are derived from the scantlings of timbers that were found to be sufficiently strong ; this I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is difficult to calculate the weight that a floor has to support ; yet it is easy to ascertain whether a floor be sufficiently stiff or not , after it is executed . These comparisons have not been made from single observations , but from various ones on bearings of very different lengths . The constant numbers are taken higher for oak , because the oak is seldom straight grained , and very subject to warp . Example . Required the proper depth for a fir joist , the bearing being 12 feet and the breadth 2 inches ? 12 x 12 - = 72 , and the cube root of 72 is 4.16 ; therefore 4.16 x 2.2 = 9.152 inches , the depth required ; or 9 inches is near enough in practice . On account of flues , fire places , and other causes , it often happens that the joists can not have a bearing on the wall . In such cases a piece of timber , called a trimmer is framed between two of the nearest joists that have a bearing on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supported are mortised . This operation is called trimming* The scantlings of trimmers may be found by the same rule as those for binding joists , Case 2 , Art . 143 ; the length of the joists framed into the trimmer being equivalent to the distance apart in binding joists . The two joists , which support the trimmer are called trimming joists , and they should be stronger than the common joists . In general it will be sufficient to add one eighth of'aninchto the thickness of a trimming joist for each joist supported by the trim- /z/ mer . Thus , if the thickness of the common joists be 2 inches , and a trimmer supports 4 joists , then add four eighths , or half an inch ; that is. make the trimming joists each 2.5 inches in thickness . When the bearing exceeds 8 feet , single joisting should be strutted between the joists to prevent them turning and twisting sideways , and also to stiffen the floor ; when the bearing exceeds 12 feet two rows of struts will be necessary ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4 feet in bearing . These struts should be in a continued line across the floor , and short ends of boards put in moderately tight , and nearly of the depth of the joists , are quite sufficient ; indeed such pieces simply nailed are better than keys mortised into the joists , because they require less labour , and do not weaken the joists with mortises . The well fitting of the struts is an essential part in making a good ceiling . For common purposes single joisting may be used to any extent that timber can be got deep enough for ; but where it is desirable to have a perfect ceiling , the bearing should* not exceed 15 feet . Also , where it is desirable to prevent the passage of sound , a framed floor is necessary . /z/ Of Girders. 131 . The girders are the chief support of a framed floor , and their depth is often limited by the size of the timber ; therefore the method of finding the scantling may be divided into two cases* Case 1 . To find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breadth of the girder are given . Rule . Divide the square of the length in feet , by the breadth in inches ; and the cube root of the quotient multiplied by 4.2 for fir or by 4.34 for oak , will give the depth required in inches . 132 . Case 2 . To find the breadth when the length of bearing and depth are given . Rule . Divide the square of the length in feet by the cube of the depth in inches ; and the quotient multiplied by 74 for fir , or by 82 for oak , will give the breadth in inches . /q/ Example to Case 1 . hfit the bearing be 20 feet , and the depth 13 inches ; to find the breadth , so that the girder shall be sufficiently stiff . The cube of the breadth is 2197 , and the square of the length is 400 ; therefore /z/ ttz X 74 = 13.47 in. the breadth required . 2197 n In these rules the girders are supposed to be 10 feet apart , and this distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less or more than 10 feet , the breadth of the girder should be made in proportion to the distance apart . Girders should always , for long bearings , be made as deep as they can be got ; an inch pr two taken from the height of a room is of little consequence compared with a ceiling disfigured with cracks , besides the inconvenience of not being able to move in the rooms above , without shaking every thing in them . 133 . When the breadth of a girder is considerable , it is often sawn down the middle and bolted together with the sawn side outwards ; the girders in the section , fig . Art . 128 , are supposed to be done in this manner . This is an excellent method , as it not only gives an opportunity of examining the centre of the tree , which in large trees is often in a state of decay , but also reduces the timber to a smaller scantling , by which means it dries sooner , and is less liable to rot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thick enough to allow the air to circulate freely between them . It is generally imagined that it strengthens a girder to cut it down , reverse it . and bolt it together again ; it is in fact weakened by the operation , but the method is recommended here for the reasons above stated . Others suppose that girders are cut down merely for the purpose of equalizing their stiffness ; but admitting a girder to be bent considerably , the difference between the deflections at any two points equally distant from the middle would not be sensible in girders of the usual form . The person who first practised cutting girders down the middle , undoubtedly did it with the view of preserving , not of stiffening them . We find that Vitruvius , the oldest author /z/ on architecture extant , directs a space of two finger 's breadth t# be left between the beams for forming the architrave over columns , in order that the air may circulate between and prevent decay. * Every one must have observed that decay begins in the first place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither perfectly close nor yet sufficiently open to allow any dampness to evaporate* 134 . When the bearing exceeds about 22 feet it is very difficult to obtain timber large enough for girders ; and it is usual in I such cases to truss them . The methods in general adopted for that purpose have the appearance of much ingenuity ; but , in reality , they are of very little use . If a girder be trussed with oak , all the strength that can possibly be gained by such a truss consists merely in the difference between the compressibility of oak and fir , which is very small indeed ; and unless the truss be extremely well fitted at the abutments , it would be much stronger without trussing , I All the apparent stiffness obtained by trussing a beam is procured l by forcing the abutments , or , in other words , by cambering the . beam . This forcing cripples and injures the natural elasticity of the timber ; and the continual spring , from the motion of the floor , upon parts already crippled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy them , as to render the truss a useless burden upon the beam . This is a fact that has long been known to many of our best carpenters , and which has caused them to see* for a remedy in iron trusses ; but this method is quite as bad as the former , unless there be an iron tie as an abutment to the truss , for the failure of a truss is occasioned by the enormous compression applied upon a small surface of timber at the abutments. 135 . The above remarks are further confirmed by some experiments that have been made by Mr. Barlow , of the Royal Military Academy , at Woolwich , the results of which are shown in the following Table . /z/ Table of experiments by Mr. Barlow . Description* m Length of bearing . /z/ lbs . /z/ Deflection produced by the weight . Two trusses meeting against a king bolt ) in the centre , with plate bolts at the #@# ' abutments . ' Piece of the same size , without trusses . Three trusses , with two queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same size , without trusses. ft. in. /z/ The pieces were trussed in the manner described by Mr. Nicholson , in his Carpenter 's Guide , Plate xxxix ; the depth of the pieces 2 inches , and the breadth 1.875 inches . In the experiment with the girder having a king bolt and two truss pieces , there appears to be a slight advantage in trussing ; but in the one in three lengths , trussing appears to hare had no effect , it being much weaker than the untrussed piece. * The methods of trussing proposed by Smith , t Price , J and Lang* are still worse ; some in principle , others in the materials* The attempt to make a solid beam stronger in the same bulk , without using a stronger material than the beam itself is made of , is ridiculous ; yet such has been the aim of most of these writers . Though the usual mode of trussing girders can not be relied upon , nor , indeed , any other timber truss that is made within the depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are several methods that may be applied with success in extending the bearing of timber girders . But where the depth is limited , and the bearing considerable , iron must be employed , and the best mode of doing this would be to make the girders of cast iron , each in one piece , if the bearing should not be too long for a casting , and in two pieces if it should be too long . These cast iron girders are simple , and cheaper than any kind of iron framing of the same * See Hr . Barlow 's Essay on the strength and - stress of timber , p. 196 . Smith 's Carpenter 's Companion . X British Carpenter , Plate B. S Langley 's Builders ' Complete Assistant , Piatt lii , 4th edit . /z/ strength ; that is , when thej are properly contrived , so as to make the most of the material . But it often happens that large founderies are not near , and consequently iron girders would he very expensive ; and at any rate it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there is the means of increasing the depth of the floor , which may generally be done without inconvenience* 136* The principle of constructing girders of any depth is the same as that of building beams , and when properly conducted is ai strong as any truss can be made of the same depth . The most simple method consists in bolting two pieces together , with keys between to prevent the parts sliding upon each other . The joints should be at or near the middle of the depth . The annexed figure shows a beam put together in this manner . The /z/ -o a C D Q o - I thickness of all the keys added together should be somewhat greater than one third more than the whole depth of the girder ; and , if they be made of hard wood , the breadth should be about twice the thickness . 1 37 . The following figure is another girder of the same construction , except that it is held together with hoops instead of bolts . The girder being cut so as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being driven on till they would be perfectly tight , and would make a very firm and simple connection . 138 . In the next figure the parts are tabled or indented togeth- er instead of being keyed , and a king bolt is added to tighten the joints , the upper part of the girder being in two pieces . The depth /z/ of all the indents added together should not be less than two thirds of the whole depth of the girder. * 1 39 . Another method of constructing a girder consists in bending a piece into a curve , and securing it from springing back by bolts or straps . A girder constructed in this manner is shown by the annexed figure . Mr. Smeaton has adopted a similar method of strengthening the beam of a steam engine , t and the additional stiffness gained by bending beams in this manner is very considerable . The pieces should be well bolted , or strapped to prevent - any sliding of the parts . In this manner a beam might be built of any depth that is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints , of any length that is likely to be needed in the construction of floors . The thickness of the bent pieces may be about one fiftieth part of the bearing , and as many of them should be added as will increase the depth to that proposed , unless the whole depth of the curved pieces exceeds half the depth of the girder ; and in that case straight pieces should be added to the under side , so as to make the whole depth of the straight parts exceed the depth of the curved parts . When pieces can not be got sufficiently long for the girder , care should be taken to have no joints near the middle of the length in the lower half of the girder . This last figure shows a girder for a 40 feet bearing , with the lower half scarfed at A , and a plain but joint in the curved part at B. 140 . In the construction of floors it would be a great advantage to make each girder only half the breadth given by the rule , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper or floor joists over the girders , and notch the ceiling joists to the underside of them ; and to omit the binding joists . There would be a great * A girder similar to this is described by Mathurin Jousse , in his Art de la Chat " p enteric ReeJ Cyclopedia , Art . steam engine* plate i . Girders constructed in this manner have also been proposed by Rondelety VArt de Batii , tome 4 , p. 145. ao /z/ increase of strength and stiffness by adopting this method ; and in point of economy , it is decidedly preferable ; only it requires a much greater depth of flooring . 141 . Arthe strain is always the greatest at the middle of the length of a girder , it would be well to avoid making mortises there if possible , either for binding joists or any other purpose ; and the most straight grained part of the beam should be put to the under side . Also , timber girders should not be built into the wall , but an open space should be left round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or by turning an arch to carry . the wall above . Girders should be laid from 9 to 12 inches into the wall , according to the bearing . Binding joists . 142 . The depth of a binding joist is generally determined by the depth of the floor , but this is not always the case . Therefore the rules must be given for two cases . Case 1 To find the depth of a binding joist , the length and breadth being given . Rule . Divide the square of the length in feet , by the breadth in inches ; and the cube root of the quotient multiplied by 3.42 for fir , or by 3.53 for oak , will give the depth in inches . 143 . Case 2 . To find the breadth when the depth and length are given . Rule . Divide the square of the length in feet , by the cube of the depth in inches ; and multiply the quotient by 40 for fir , or by 44 for oak , which will give the breadth in inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ; if the distance be greater or less than 6 feet , the breadth given by the rule must be increased or diminished in proportion . The breadth of the binding joists next the wall may be two thirds of the breadth of the others ; but in general they are made the same breadth , or such as are defective are selected for that purpose . /z/ 144 . The binding joists may be from 4 to 6 feet apart , but should not exceed 6 feet ; and about 6 inches bearing on the wall is sufficient . The manner of framing binding joists into girders is shown by the annexed figure ; and in fitting them great care should be taken that both the bearing parts , A and B , should fit to the corresponding parts of the mortise . This is the most important part of fitting in a binding joist , yet is often the least attended to . The tenon should be about one sixth of the depth , and at one third of the depth from the lower side . 145 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their scantlings found by the same rule as for ceiling joists ( see Art . 147 ) except that the quotient must be multiplied by 1.2 instead of 0.64 for fir , and by 1.25 instead of 0*67 for oak joists . Bridging joists* 146 . The rule for bridging joists is the same as that for single joisting ( see Art . 130 ) . They seldom need be more than 2 inches in thickness , except for ground floors , where they are laid upon sleepers ; in which case the depth may be found to a breadth of 2 inches , and an inch may be added to the breadth , on account of the situation ; as when proper care is not taken to drain and ventilate the under side of a ground floor , the joists are subject to very rapid decay . It is a good practice to strew smiths 9 ashes , or even common ashes , under such floors , to prevent the growth of fungi . The ashes and scoriae from a foundery , or any ashes that contain much iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ i // remedy for the dry rot . He filled a space below the floor of two feet in depth , with anchor smith 's ashes , and also charred the sleepers. * Ceiling joists . 1 47 . Ceiling joists require to be no thicker than is necessary to nail the laths to ; two inches is quite sufficient for that purpose . To find the depth of a ceiling joist , when the length of bearing and breadth are given . Rule . Divide the length in feet by the cube root of the breadth in inches ; and multiply the quotient by 0.64 for fir , or by 0.67 for oak , which will give the depth in inches required . Example* Let the bearing be 6 feet and the breadth 2 inches ; to find the depth of a ceiling joist of fir . The cube root of 2 is nearly 1.26 ; and the length , 6 feet , divid- ed by this number , that is , - p-  = 4.76 ; which being multiplied by the decimal 0.64 , gives 3 inches , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed upon for the breadth , the rule for eeiling joists of fir becomes very easy ; for then half the length in feet is the depth in inches : that is , if the length of bearing be 10 feet , the depth of the joist should be 5 inches . The distance apart in the clear is generally from 10 to 12 inches , according to the length of the laths . It is better to notch ceiling joists to the underside of the binding joists , and nail them , than to mortise and chase them in ; because it requires less labour , it does not weaken the binding joists , and the ceiling stands better . Oak is not so good a material for ceiling joists as fir , because it is more subject to warp ; particularly if it be not well seasoned . /z/ General observations respecting floors . 149 . Girders should never be laid over openings , such as doors or windows , if - it be possible to avoid it ; and when it is absolutely /z/ necessary to lay them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laid low enough to throw the weight upon the piers . It is , however , a bad practice to lay girders very obliquely across the rooms ; and it is better to put a strong piece as a wall plate . In the bearings of floors the caution of Vitruvius must be attended to ; that is , when the ends of the joists are supported by external walls of considerable height , the middle part of the joist should never rest upon a partition wall that does not go higher than the floor ; * otherwise the unequal settlement of the walls will cause the floor to be unlevel , and most likely fracture the cornices* 150 . Wall-plates and templets should be made stronger as the span beeomes longer ; the following proportions may serve for general purposes : ' For a 20 feet bearing , wall plates 4.5 in. by 3 in. 30 " " 6 by 4 40 " " 7.5 by 5. 151 . Floors should always be kept about three fourths of an inch higher in the middle than at the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joists should be fixed about three fourths of an inch in 20 feet higher in the middle than at the sides of the room ; as all floors , however well constructed , will settle in some degree . In laying the flooring , the boards should always be made to rise a little under the doorways , in order that the doors may shut close without dragging ; and at the same time it assists in making them clear the carpet The following observations , from Evelyn 's Sylva , are worthy of notice . " To prevent all possible accidents , when you lay floors , let the joints be shot , fitted , and tacked down only the first year , nailing them for good and all the next ; and by this means they will lie staunch , close , and without shrinking in the least , as if they were Vitruvius , lib , 7 , cap . I. /z/ all of one piece : and upon this occasion I am to add an observation that may prove of no small use to builders , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the floor an hundred years , and shoot them again , they will certainly shrink ( toties quoties ) without the former method . " * /z/ Statics is a part of the Science of Mechanics . It treats of the equilibrium of forces at rest . The student will perceive its relation to Carpentry , by reflecting upon the different forces , which act upon timbers in a roof or any other construction . They are acted upon by their own weight ; they are pressed in one direction by their supports , and in others by timbers , which rest upon them or lean against them . The strength and the stiffness of timber , which have been investigated in the former part , are also forces , which are constantly brought into action . These different forces must be so opposed as to produce an equilibrium , or constructions can not be permanent . /z/ Of the composition and resolution of forces . 152 . Expertment . Take 2 pullies I and H , and having fixed them against the face of a vertical board or wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string , as A and B ; attach to this Fig , 1 string , at some point D between the two pullies , another string from which is suspended a third weight C. This weight C must not be equal to the sum of A and B. The point D will assume a certain position , and the weights being the same , the point will be found to assume the same position , as often as the experiment is attempted , but will change its position if either of the weights be changed* Farther , let us suppose the weight C to be 8 ounces , the weight A 4 , and B 6 ; then , if we measure on the line DC , 8 inches from D to F , and then draw F E parallel to D H , until it meets D E , ( which is I D continued ) F E will be 6 inches , and D E 4 ; that is , the three sides of the triangle will be respectively proportional to thetyree weights ; and to determine , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider which weight draws in the direction of that side Thus , B we supposed 6 oz. and F E , parallel to H D , the direction in which B acts upon the point D , is found to he 6 inches . The student should perform this experiment repeatedly , and with different weights , until it i$ perfectly familiar to his mind , and he is completely satisfied , that If three forces act upon one point and keep it at rest , then those three forces are proportional to the three sides of a triangle , to which sides also the directions , in which they act , are parallel . liT. - /z/ 153 . In the foregoing experiment , C balances A and 6 , and it therefore appears , that , if two forces proportional to , and in the direction of two sides of a triangle , act upon any point ; they will be balanced by a third force , which is proportional to , and in the direction of the third side of the same triangle . Again ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended over a pulley , K , in such a manner as to act upon the point D in a vertical direction , D will be at rest , as when acted upon by A and B. It might therefore supply the place of A and B. 154 . We may suppose , that the point D , instead of being supported by weights acting in the directions D h and D g , is sustained by the rods A D and B D , pressing against it . The same weight g * Fig. 2. , h C being suspended from the point D , the rod B D will have to sustain a force equal to that , which was exerted in the former case in the direction D g ; and A D a force equal to that , which wa* exerted in the direction D h . If the rods A D and B D are able ' to sustain the forces thus assigned them , the weight C will be sustained , otherwise not . Let D c represent the weight D ; then draw c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force sustained by A D , and D f that sustained by B D. 155 . We may farther suppose the weight C to act upon the point D by pressure , as in fig. 3 , instead of being suspended , as in the former cases . But it is evident , that if C D is perpendicular to the horizon , tbe weight C acting upon the point D in the same direction , and with the same force , as if suspended as in the last case , must require the same force to be exerted by A D and B I /z/ to sustain it . If therefore we wish to know what force each of the supports , A D and B D , will have to sustain , in consequence Fig. 3. the pressure of the weight C , we have only to draw the vertical line D e , of a convenient length to represent the weight C , and then from the point e to draw e f parallel to A D ; and as in the former case , e f will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ; and D f that which must be exerted by D B. 156 . From these two last examples , we may infer , that if any force act upon a poinU it may be balanced by any two other force* acting upon the same point , provided the three forces are proportional to the three sides of any triangle , and act in directions parallel to those sides* 157 . It appears then , that vie can find one force , which will balance any two given forces . ( 153 ) Or , we can find two forces , which will balance any one given force . ( 156 ) The former is called the composition of forces , and the latter tk* resolution . This one force , which , by the composition , is found equal to the two others , is called their resultant . We are not limited to two forces . We can , as will be shown farther on , find a resultant to any number of forces : or we can resolve one force into any number of forces . Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beam A D ( fig. 3 ) 6 feet , A 8 8 feet , and resting upon supports at A and B , which are upon a level with each other , and 9 feet apart ; what pressure does each beam sustain ? /z/ i. /q/ To solve this question , let the student take any scale of equal parts , and make a line A B equal to 9 parts . Then let him open his compasses 6 parts , and with one foot in A , describe a curve with the other foot near where he supposes D will come . Then with the compasses open 8 parts , and one foot in B describe a curve cutting the former pne . The point , in which these curves cut each other , will be D. He may then proceed as in Art . 155 to draw a vertical line D e , &c.; Answer , upon A D 772 lbs . upon B D 499. ii . Other circumstances being the same , let the weight be 6500 lbs . ; required the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 13 and 15 feet in length , and distance asunder at A and B 20 ; weight 1000. iv . Let the circumstances in Ex. iii be the same , except that the support A be supposed 3 feet above the level of B. v. Let the two beams A D and B D be of equal length , each 20 feet , the weight 1000 , the two supports A and B on a level , and distant from each other 15 feet . Required the pressure upon each . vi . Circumstances the same , save the distance A to B 30 feet . 156 . By comparing the results of the last two examples , it will be apparent how much the strain upon the beams is increased by increasing the angle of their opening . This is a point of importance , and should be well impressed upon the mind of the student . Of the horizontal thrust of rafters , loaded with a heavy weight at the ridge* 159 . In the last section we have shewn the method of ascertaining the pressure produced upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge . These rafters , acting obliquely upon the walls of a building , must have a tendency to push them outward . This tendency is easily estimated by the principles we have established . /z/ dO CONSTRUCTIONS OF TIMBER . Let C be a weight suspended from the ridge of a roof ; we obtain as in section first the force D e , which it exerts upon D A , and /z/ Fig. 4. the force d e , which it exerts upon D B. We may draw d f parallel to D e , and then D f will be equal to d e , and may be taken instead of it If we resolve D e into two forces , D y vertical , and therefore producing no horizontal pressure , and y e , horizontal ; D y will represent the vertical pressure occasioned by the weight upon A , and y e the horizontal thrust occasioned by the same weight . In the same manner , D x will represent the vertical pressure , and f x the horizontal thrust , upon the point B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced upon the tie beam which connects A and B , then the solution is the same , if the tie beam is horizontal . If not , the lines f x and y e must be drawn parallel to it ; for the sides of the triangle , by which we seek to estimate a strain , must be in the same direction as ( he strain . The lines f x and y e are equal , and either will represent the whole strain upon the tie . Examples* i . The points A and B being on a level , their distance apart 20 feet , length of each beam D and B D 15 feet , and the weight C 1000 lbs . ; required the horizontal thrust and vertical pressure on each wall . 447 horizontal . 500 vertical . ii . Other things the same , distance A B 25 feet ? iii . A B 30 , A D 20 , B D 18 , and weight 500 lbs . ; required the samie. iv . Required the strain upon a tie beam 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees with the horizon ; the rafters being feet each , and weight 1 000 lbs . /z/ To give the tie beam the inclination required , draw any line for a horizontal line . Open the compasses to 60 degrees on the line of chords ( marked C. or Cho. ) and with one foot in the horizontal line , describe a curve crossing the horizontal line . On this curve , set off 5 degrees from tfye horizontal line , upwards , and through the point thus obtained and the point used as a centre , draw a line , which will represent the tie beam inclined as required . v. Inclination of the beam 8 degrees , other things the same ; required the same . 160 . If we suppose the beams A D and B D , in the last figure , to be two bars united by a. joint at D , above which they could move , they would constitute a mechanical power , which has been used in many machines with great effect . The power , or moving force is applied at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some firm support , and the thrust of B , when the two bars come nearly in a straight line , is very great . Example . Let the two bars be 10 feet in length , each ; the angle at D 175 degrees ; the power at D 100 lbs . ; A being stationary , what is the thrust of B ? Printing presses , brick presses , &c.; have been constructed upon this principle Of the transverse strain upon inclined beams , and the inclined /z/ 161 . If a beam , as A B , rest against a wall , and a weight W be suspended from the centre or any other part of it , it will be easy Fig. 5. // to ascertain , by means of the principles investigated in the preceding sections , how much force it exerts in producing a directly transverse strain . If we set off d c to represent the weight W , and from c draw c e perpendicular to A B , we form a triangle dee . And two forces acting upon the point d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proportional to these two sides , will ( 156 ) exactly balance , or be equivalent to the weight W. But of these two forces , d e acts in the direction of the beam , and therefore can have no effect in producing a transverse strain . The force c e , acting perpendicularly , exerts its whole power in producing this strain , and therefore is the measure of the transverse strain produced by W. Examples . " i . Let the angle A B C be 35 degrees , and the weight 1000 lbs . ; required the transverse strain . 820. ii . Let the angle A BC be 25 degrees , and the weight 1000 lbs . iii . Let the angle A B C be 65 degrees , and the weight 1000 lbs . A comparison of these examples will show how much the load may be increased upon a beam , if we increase its inclination to the horizon . iv . Suppose the angle of elevation , A B C , 40 degrees , the length of the beam 20 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the weight 600 lbs . applied at the centre ; what will be the deflection ? Note . First calculate the force , which acts transversely , as in the preceding examples , and then the deflection as in Part 1 , p. 40. v. What weight would be required to break the above beam ? Note . First calculate the weight , which would be required to break it when horizontal ; then draw e c perpendicular to A B to represent this weight , then from c draw c d vertically till it meets the beam ; c d will be the answer . vi . Repeat the two preceding questions , supposing the beam to be oak . vii . Repeat them , supposing the beam to be pine , and 5 inches square . An inclined rafter is strained not only transversely , but is compressed in the direction of its length . The necessity of consider- mm i ti i #@# . a wizsr &a; gsasE ; : 5Sfe /z/ tog this , in finding its scantling , will be apparent from what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transverse strain is solved in the same manner , if we suppose the weight W to rest upon the beam , as in the annexed cut , instead of being suspended as in the last . Fig. 6 . The line f e still measures the transverse strain . But another question here occurs . The weight W has a tendency to roll down the inclined beam A C ; how shall we measure this tendency , or in other words , how shall we ascertain the force , with which it would move down the plane , and consequently the force necessary to keep it at rest . We observed ( 161 ) that if df , representing the weight of W , be resolved into the two forces f e perpendicular to the beam and d e in the direction of it , d e will represent the force exerted by W in the direction of the beam , d e therefore will represent the force with which a spherical weight W will move down the plane . Examples . i . Let the angle of elevation be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spherical weight of 100 lbs. ? 34.2. ii . Angle 25 and ball 250 ? iii . A plank 20 feet long is elevated at one end 2 feet ; what force will sustain a barrel of flour upon it , supposing the barrel and flour to weigh 220 lbs . ? iv . What , if the plank be 10 feet long , and elevated 2 feet at one end ? 163 . A plank or beam , &c.; employed as supposed in the last examples is called , in mechanics , an inclined plane . /z/ It appears then that on an inclined plane , the power and weight will balance each other , when the former is to the latter as d e : d f . Bat d e : d f as A B : A C. Therefore the power and weight balance each other , or are in equilibrium when the power : the weight : : the height of the plane : its length . The most obvious use of the inclined plane is for raising heavy weights , as is suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force with which the weight would tend to roll down the plane , to be the exact measure of the power necessary to preserve it at rest . But this can only be when the power acts in the direction of the plane , or parallel to it . There is no difficulty , however , in ascertaining the power necessary to preserve the equilibrium , in whatever direction it may act . Let this direction be supposed to be i W ; we have only to draw f h parallel to i W till it meets d g ( which is perpendicular to the plane ) in h ; f h will represent the power required . It is evident that we might have represented the force with which the body W tends to move down the plane by f c , drawn parallel to the plane , till it meets d g , which is perpendicular to it . Suppose the power acts in a direction parallel to the base of the plane C B. - We have only to draw f g parallel to the base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is resolved into two forces , d g perpendicular to the plane , and f g parallel to the base , which ( f g ) therefore represents the force necessary to preserve the equilibrium , when it is parallel to the base of the plane , or horizontal . In this case the power : weight as g f : d f , or , which is the same thing , as A B : C B , or as the height of the plane : the base . Examples . u Solve each of the four preceding questions , supposing the power to act in such a direction , that i W makes an angle of 10 degrees with the plane . ii . Solve them upon the supposition , that the force is in each case horizontal . / /z/ Of the strain upon ties and struts* 164 . Instead of substituting for both the ropes I D and H D of Fig. 1 , the beams 8 D and A D of Fig. 2 , we may substitute a beam in place of one , and permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this figure the point D is supported precisely as if a rope in the Fig.7. direction D C were substituted for the beam A D ; or as if the rope B D were replaced by a second beam p D. The method of obtaining the amount of strain exerted by the weight W upon the rope B D and the beam A D , is therefore precisely the same as that employed in Art . 164 . . Set off D y , of a suitable length to express the quantity of the weight , and draw from y the line x y , parallel to B D. Dx will represent the strain upon the beam , A D and x y the strain upon the rope B D. 165 . We might place a beam or joist in the situation of the rope B D , and it would be subjected to the same sort of strain , i. e. it would be drawn by W in the direction of its length , and the amount of this strain must be calculated as above . Examples . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5000 lbs . upon A D and BD ; A D being 12 feet long , and B D 15 , and distance A /z/ ii . A D being 5 feet , B D 4 , and A B 3 ? Hi . A D and B D being each 10 feet , and A B 12 ? iv . A D and B D being each 10 feet , and A B 6 ? v. A D and B D being each 10 feet , and A B 1 8 ? ri . A B and B D being each 5 feet , and making a right angle ? /z/ 166 . Although B D might be replaced by a beam , A D could not by a rope , because it acts by its stiffness* A beam in the situation of B D , in which it acts by its direct cohesion , and in which a rope might be used , is called in general a tie ; while a beam situated like A D , and acting by its stiffness to resist pressure in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie may be distinguished from a stmt , by a little reflection upon the manner in which it acts . It may not , however , be useless to give a simple method of distinguishing between them , which we take from Mr. Tredgold 's Elementary Principles . Fig. 8 , Form the triangle D x y as before . Draw D z parallel to x y , and zy parallel to Dx . Draw z x , and then draw cd through the point D parallel to it . Whatever part of a framing acts upon the point D and is below c d , is a stfut ; if above it , it is a tie . The reason is evident . If we wish to substitute a strut in place of B D , we should make it act in the direction z D : and again if we would substitute a tie for A D , we should arrange it in the direction of m D. ( 164 ) Of the strain upon the jibs of cranes . 167 . In the jibs of cranes there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weight W is not simply sus- /z/ peoded from the point D , but is drawn over it by the rope D C. The rope D C acts therefore as a tie , and the jib A D may be so Fig. 9. placed as to need no brace B D , except to keep it stiff . In this case its position must be that of the resultant of the two forces , viz. the weight K , and that which acts at C to raise the weight . These two forces are equal . Let them be represented by D d , and x d which is equal to D d , and parallel to D C. If C D is perpendicular to B A or D K , then the angle d is a right angle , and the resultant D x makes an angle of 45 degrees with the vertical part B A. The forces acting in the supposed directions , it is manifest that the above is the proper position for the jib of a crane . For these forces tend to produce upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its length . There is no strain upon the piece B D. ' The quantity of pressure upon A D is measured by D x. 168 . If the directions , in which the forces act , make any other anHe with each other , as C D W in the next figure , the position of A D and the strain upon it may be found in the same way , and the comparative advantage of different positions may be easily es- Fig. 10. /z/ to /z/ ti mated . C D being the direction , in which a power applied it C , acts , and D W that in which the Weight acts ; let D d represent the weight , and d x , equal to it and parallel to L ) C , the pow* er . D x is the resultant , and gives the proper direction for A D. In this position , the compression of the jib , measured by D x , is greater than in the preceding case . In the two last figures , suppose e x to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d will be a square or rhombus , and D x will divide the angles D and x into equal parts . The angle B A D is equal to one of these parts . Hence in all cases the angle which the jib makes with the vertical , A B , should be half that , which is made by the direction of the forces , ; . order to avoid unnecessary strains . 169 . We will now suppose the power and weight to act at right angles as in Art . 167 , but the jib not placed in the resultant Fig. 11 . We take as before D e and D h , equal and representing the forces . Their resultant is D G. The strain therefore , which is produced by these two forces , is the same as would be produced by the single force D G. If now we wish to find this strain , we draw G x parallel to D C till it meets D A ( as in Art . 164 ) D x represents the strain upon D A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there results not only a very great strain upon A D , but there is also a strain upon tj D , so great , that if the weight W be large , B D , which acts as a tie , could not be made secure without the use of iron . In the same manner let the student draw a figure in which B A D shall be less than uaif a right angle . Iv . /z/ /q/ 6 . Of the resolution and composition of more than two forces , 170 . In Art . 169 , in order to find the strain upon A D and B D , we first resolved the two forces D e and D h into a single force D G. and then inquired , as in the precediug section , into the action of this force . On this same principle we may always proceed to find the resultant of any number of forces . We may first find the resultant of any two of them ; then the resultant of that resultant and another of the forces , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus obtained will be the resultant of the whole system . 171 . Let us take an example to illustrate this remark . /z/ Fig. 12. t /z/ The forces B A , C A , D A , and E A , are supposed to act upon the point A , Fig. 12 . What will be the direction and quantity of the single force equivalent to them ? Draw B R parallel to A C and equal to it , and join A R. A R is the resultant of these two forces , and we may suppose that the /z/ forces A B and A C vanish* and A R takes their place . Then from R draw R R ' parallel and equal to A D , and join A R ' ; A R ' is the resultant of A R and A D , i. e. of A B , A C , and AD , ( R being equivalent to A B and A C ) therefore all three of the forces , A B , A C , and A D , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by A R which will produce precisely the same effect . We proceed now to find the resultant of A R ' and the remaining force A E , by drawing R ' R " parallel and equal to /z/ A E , and drawing A R ' A R , ? is the resultant , and since A B* is equivalent to the three forces B , A C , and A D , and A R " is the resultant of A R ' and E ; A R " is the resultant of all the forces A B , A C , A D , and A E. 172 . It will be seen by examination of figure 12 , that if we had simply drawn B R parallel and equal to A C , and from its extremity R , had drawn R R ' parallel and equal to A D , and from R , R ' R " equal and parallel to A E ; the line A R " , from this last point to the point on which the forces act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general result , and is applicable to all cases ; Let the student apply it to examples till it is famfiiar. 173 . It may sometimes be convenient to be able to separate one force into two or more , which shall act in given directions . A weight e. g. is to be supported in a certain position , and a perpendicular support is impracticable . Let C , Fig*. 3 , be such a weight . A D and B D may be the supports required . The student will easily ascertain the quantity of the two forces , or the amount of pressure each will have to sustain , by the method in Art . 155. 174 . Neither will it be difficult to resolve one force into three or four others , and to estimate the magnitude of each . Let A R represent the force to be resolved into three others , which shall be in the direction of A b , A c , and A d . From R draw R m parallel Fig. 13. /z/ to Ad , ; from n or m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , meeting A b , extended if necessary . If the forces A b , A c , and A i ai " e proportional to A b , b n , n R , or to A b ' , b ' m , m R , A R will be /z/ /q/ their resultant , according to what has been said , Art . 172 , and therefore this resultant has been properly resolved into three forces , having the directions of 4 b , A c , and A d , and in either of the proportions above named* 1 75 . It will appear from this , that if the directions of any number of forces into which a single force is to be resolved , be given , the quantities of these forces admit of unlimited variety . Hence , as the directions too may vary , and the number also ; there is no limit to the number , the directions , or the quantity , of the forces into which any single force may be resolved . t Centre of gravity . 176 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 ) to be acted upon by two forces , at the points A and B , and the directions of Fig. 14. these forces be represented by the lines A C and B C , and their quantities by C D and C E. We wish to find the resultant of these two forces , its magnitude , direction , and point of application . From D draw D F equal and parallel to C E , and draw C C F is the resultant , and gives at once the magnitude , direction , and point of application , K , where it crosses the beam ; so that if a single force , equal to and in the direction of F C , should act upon the beam at'the point K , it would have precisely the same effect as the simultaneous action of the two forces C D and C E ; and if it should act on the other side of the beam , at the point K , it would precisely balance the two forces C D and C E. /z/ 177 . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of determining the point of application , K , without constructing the figure in each case Draw F h and F i perpendicular to C B and C A , the directions of the forces C E and C D ; it can be demonstrated , that these lines are to each other inversely as the forces , to the directions of which they are perpendicular ; u e . F i : F h : : C E : C D ; * and if C E is 9 and C D 8 , then F i : F h : : 9 : 8 . This property does not belong to the point F only , but to any point in the resultant . If then perpendiculars be drawn from K to the lines A C and C B , these perpendiculars will be in the same proportion of 9 : 8 . The student , who is unacquainted with geometry , will satisfy himself of the truth of this by constructing figures , with the magnitude and direction of the forces varying in each case , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces . In some of these constructions let the forces be made nearly parallel , and they will prepare the student for the next article . 178 . Let us suppose that the two forces C E and C D are parallel to each other ( Fig. 15 ) . It is required , as before , to find Fig. 15. /z/ their resultant . The lines C E and C D , being parallel , can not meet , and the resultant can not be obtained by the construction of a * The following demonstration is added for the satisfaction of the student , who has made some attainments in Mathematics . The angles i D F and F h are equal , being supplements of the equal angles CDF and C E F ; the angles at i and h are equal , because they are both right angles : therefore , the triangles D i F and EhF are similar , and D F : F E : : i F : F h . But D F and F E are equal to C E and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : : C E : C D. /z/ triangle , as in the preceding case . We may however suppose the triangle of the preceding case to have its vertex C removed from the beam till the sides C and C D become almost parallel ; the principle of finding the resultant is the same . And it is the same too if the lines become exactly parallel and no triangle can be formed , for the existence and place of the resultant does not depend upon the possibility of constructing the triangle , although by /z/ the help of the triangle , when it may be constructed , the resultant is found . Tiiis premised , we may infer , that the resultant , as it is between the sides of the triangle , in all its forms , so it will be between these sides when they become parallel , and the triangle vanishes . It must therefore be parallel to the two sides C E and C D ; otherwise it would somewhere cross one of them . To find its point of application , K , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz. the perpendicular distances of the point of application to the direction of the forces are inversely as the magnitudes of tht forces ; - t. c. supposing in this case , that C E and C D are perpendicular to E D. K E : K D : : force C D : force CE ; and to find K , say E D : K D : : sum of the forces C E and C D : force C E. Suppose the force acting at E to be 3 , and that at D to be 5 , we shall have ( 5 +3 ) or8:3 : : ED:KD . We have now to ascertain the magnitude of the resultant . do this , let u examine Fig , 16. qwq /z/ The nearer the directions of the forces C D and C E approach to parallelism , the longer is the resultant C G , and it is easy to see that if these directions exactly coincided , C E and E G would be in a straight line , and C G would be exactly their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and the resultant is equal in magnitude to the sum of the forces . Thus it appears , that the resultant of two parallel forces , divides the perpendicular distance between their directions into parts inversely proportional to those forces ; is parallel to their direction ; and equal to their sum , 179 . This result is easily proved to be correct by the following experiment . Take a rod A B , and support it at the ends by strings passing over pullies , and let small weights , as 1 and 2 Fig. 17. be hooked to the strings to balance the weight of the rod , then add weights at pleasure to represent the forces acting at A and B. If D of 9 pounds be added to one side , and E of 3 at the other , then by the above reasoning , C of 12 pounds ought to be hung upon the rod , and its place K to be thus found . /z/ Now if the weight be appended at the place K , found in this manner , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct . 180 . We might indeed have commenced this chapter with this experiment , but we have preferred to give it in this manner , as a confirmation of the principle of the composition and resolution of forces , and that we might shew the extent of its application . 181 . In the same manner as we have found the resultant of two parallel forces , we may find the resultant of more : first finding the resultant of two , and then of that resultant and another . 182 . All bodies are attracted by gravitation towards the earth , in a direction perpendicular to the surface . /z/ f**m*nv /z/ The gravitation of bodies is made up of the gravitation of all their particles . And gravity acts upon the particles in the manner of parallel forces , drawing them to the earth . 183 . Let us represent the force of gravity acting upon the several points in the line A B , by the lines a i , b k , c 1 , d m , e nf o , Fig. 18 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find the resultant by Art . 181 ; or thus - the forces at i and q being equal , their resultant will divide A B into equal parts at C : k and p being equally distant from i and q , and of course from C , will likewise have their resultant at C ; and so of the rest . This resultant R C , applied at C , will support the beam A B This point C is called the centre of gravity , because the forces a , i , &c.; representing the weights of the different particles , their sum must represent the whole weight of the beam , and C being the point about which these forces balance each other , is therefore the centre of these forces , u e. of gravity* 184 . The centre of gravity then is that point , about which all the parts of a body balance each other It is of course the same , whatever may be the position of the body , because it depends upon the relative situation of the parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of the whole mass . If then an axis pass directly through the centre of gravity of a beam , or any other body , it will be at rest , whatever its position . This can not be said of any other point , for there can be but one point about which the parts of a body will all balance . 185 . If an axis pass through a beam , directly above or directly under the centre of gravity , the beam will be at rest in a horizontal position , but in no other . For if a vertical line be drawn through the axis , and the centre of gravity be in this line , the quantity of natter on each side will be equal ; but if the centre of gravity be /z/ on one side of this vertical line , the quantity of matter on that side must be greater , and it will preponderate. 186 . In the same manner , if a vertical line drawn through the centre of gravity , called the line of direction , fall without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fall . In the annexed figure C is the centre of gravity , and C C the line of direction . If z y be drawn , it will be seen that the greater part is unsupported . Fig. 19. ! 187 . If the height of the body were reduced so as to bring its centre of gravity to x , its line of direction would fall within the base , and the greater part of the weight being within the vertical z y , the body will stand . The same effect will be produced , if the centre of gravity be brought lower by increasing the weight of the lower end of the body , without diminishing its height . 1 88 . On this principle a carriage is not so liable to upset , if the load be low , as when it is high . And where it is necessarily high , the centre of gravity may be kept low by loading the axle . If a carriage is tipping , the passengers should not rise , for by that * means the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it would have kept its position , had they remained on their seats . 1 89 . From these remarks on the centre of gravity , it will appear not to be difficult to ascertain practically the centre of gravity in many bodies . For example ; To find the centre of gravity of a piece of board , place it across the edge of a triangular prism , and make it balance . The centre of gravity will be somewhere over the line which rests upon the prism . Place it in another direction across the prism , and another line is obtained . The intersection of these two lines will give the centre of gravity . /z/ Instead of the triangular prism , the hoard may he ' laid over the edge of a bench , so that the part on the bench shall just balance the part which projects over . Draw a line along the edge of the bench . Place it in another direction and do the same . The intersection of the two lines will give the centre as before . 190 . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into any part of its surface ; from this hang a plumb line , and it will cross the centre ( 185 ) . Suspend the board in the same manner from a peg in another part , and by a plumb line another line crossing the centre will be obtained , and the intersection will give the centre of gravity . In each of the above cases the intersecting lines should cross each other nearly at right angles . 191 . It will be useful to the student to be informed of the position of the centres of gravity in bodies of different forms , although we can not here give the proofs , singe they require more mathematical knowledge than all our readers are supposed to possess . i . The centre of gravity of a uniform cylinder or prism is in the middle of its length . ii . The centre of gravity of a triangle is in a line drawn from the vertex or top of the triangle to the middle of the base or opposite side , and it is situated at the distance of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In cones or pyramids it is at the distance of one fourth of the height from the base . $8 . Of the Lever ) and the Wheel and Axle . 192 . We have seen , that if two forces act upon the ends of an inflexible rod , ( Figs. 14 and 17 ) a third may be found , which , acting upon the other side , will exactly balance them . Here there are three forces in equilibrium . We may suppose , that , instead of the weight hung on at K , ( Fig. 17 ) a pin passes through at that point . The weights or forces D and E will balance each other about that point , and the strain which they produce upon the pin , will be just equal to C. /z/ The weights D and E , instead of passing over pullies might hang directly from the ends of the rod A and B , without disturbing the equilibrium . The resultant would then act upward . A. rod or bar in this situation is called a lever . K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity is termed the weight , and the force at the other the power . Let the load at A be the weight , and E , applied at B , the power . We have seen , ( 180 ) that /z/ i. e . When the weight and power are in equilibrium , they are to each other inversely as their distances from the fulcrum . Note . When the power and weight do not act perpendicularly upon the lever , we must suppose lines to be drawn from the fulcrum , perpendicularly to the directions , in which they act , and these lines will give their true distances ( 177 ) . Examples . i . With a lever 20 feet long , and the prop 4 feet from the weight , how much can a man lift , who can press upon the other end with a force of 1 50 lbs . ? 4 : 16 : : 150 : 600 , the answer . ii . If a lever be 1 feet long , and the prop 3 feet from the weight , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1250 lbs . ? iii . A joist 14 feet long rests upon supports at its extremities : if a weight of 1000 lbs . be laid upon it at 4 feet from one end , what part of this weight will press upon each support ? 193 . There is no difficulty in conceiving the prop A to be the fulcrum , W the weight , and E the power ( 1 80 ) . In this case /z/ and therefore the ratio between the power and weight is the same as when the fulcrum is between them . This is called a lever of the second kind . A crow thrust under a stone for the purpose of raising it is of this kind . Example . A bar 1 1.5 feet long rests at one end upon a support . A man at the other end lifts with a force equal to 160 lbs . How large a weight can he raise , placed 2 feet 4 inches from the support ? /z/ If 4 . With the two kinds of lever , which have been mentioned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the motiou of the weight is lees than that of the power in the same ratio . If however the power be applied between the prop and weight , a quick motion will be produced by a slow one , but the power will be larger than the weight . The ratio between the power and weight will be the same as in the last case ; indeed the cases will pass into each other with the simple exchange of names , power and weight . The raising of a ladder , one foot being fixed against a support , is an instance of this kind . 195 . In theory the lever is considered as an inflexible rod , without weight . In fact it can be neither . But the weight of the lever is usually so small in relation to the weight and power applied to it , that in an essay like this , which does not profess to treat of mechanics , but in the most simple manner , and subservient to carpentry , it would not be proper to enter farther into the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful applications of the lever . It may be well to say a word upon the false balance . The false balance has its arms slightly unequal , and the scales which are attached to it , are also slightly unequal in weight , so that when they are empty they balance . Let one arm be supposed 10 inches long , the other 9 . A weight of 10 lbs . in the scale affixed to the latter , would balance but 9 lbs . in the other . In this manner the false balance may be used for purposes of dishonesty . Nothing is more easy however than the detection . Place the 9 lbs . in the latter , and tbe 10 lbs . in the former of the above mentioned scales , and they will not balance if the scale beam be false . 197 . When a beam is supported at both ends , the strain arising from the action of a weight laid upon it , is greatest when the weight is at the middle of the length . For the strain caused by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same weight at D , as A C X C B is to A D x D B , u e. as the product of the two parts into which Fig. 20. /z/ CONSTRUCTIONS Of TIMBER . C divides the beam , is to the product of the two parts into which D divides it . And the product of the two parts is the greater the nearer they are to equality , and greatest of all when they are exactly equal* Since then the strain arising from a load is directly proportional to the product of the two parts into which it divides the beam ; the ability of a beam to bear a given load at different points is inversely as this product . Examples* i . The beam A B being 20 feet long , and the load which it is able to snpport in the middle being 500 lbs ; how much will it support at 3 feet from one end ? /z/ ii . How much will it support at 5 feet from one end ? iii . How much at 7 feet ? 198 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction in which the power is applied is a matter of importance . Fig. 21 . Let the weight W be suspended from one arm B of a lever , and let it be represented by B d . Resolve B d into B e , perpendicular to B C , and d e parallel to it ; d e can do nothing toward bringing down that arm of the lever ; in fact its tendency is to slide the lever along the support in the direction from B to A. B e is the whole effective part of the weight . From this it appears , that in order to prevent loss of power in the lever , the power should be made to act at right angles with the lever . 199 . With the common lever this would be difficult , for every change of place of the lever would require the place of the power to be moved , as in the last figure ; for if B were brought down and e remained fixed , the line e B would cease to be perpendicular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the circumference of a large wheel , ( Fig. 22 ) and the weight at the circumference of the axle , we should obviate this difficulty . Fig. 22 . The wheel and axle act on the same principle as the lever , for the power G being applied at B has the same effect , as if it were attached to the arm C B of a lever A B , and the weight K applied at A may be considered as applied at the shorter arm A C of the same lever . If the power is applied at B ' it still acts perpendicularly to the longer arm of the lever , which then becomes C B 200 . The ratio between the power and weight , which balance in the wheel and axle , is ( as in the lever ) inversely as the perpendicular distances of the direction in which they act , from the centre ; - or , the power is to the weight , as the radius of the axle to the radius of the wheel . Examples . i . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the axle 5 inches : what power on the wheel will balance 1250 lbs . on the axle ? 60 : 5 : : 1250 : 104.16 , the answer . ii . The radius of the wheel being 6 feet 2 inches , and of the axle 6.5 inches : what weight on the axle will be balanced by 130 lbs . on the wheel ? 201 . Since it is plain , that the power acts with equal force at B and B ' , this may satisfy us , that the bent lever acts upon the same principles as a straight one . /z/ i /z/ Of the Screw . 202 . The screw consists of a cylinder , with a spiral thready passing round it . This thread may be considered as an inclined plane* Indeed , if a triangle , whose hypothenuse represents an inclined plane , be wrapped round a small cylinder , this hypothenuse will form a spiral line . Let A B be a screw , - C a nut , or hollow screw , which turns on the screw by a handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will slide upon the spiral line , which surrounds the screw , and Fig. 23. which is called the thread , and rise through a space equal to the thread distance of the screw , t. e. the distance between two contiguous threads , measured on a line parallel to the axis of the screw , as a b . Each part of the nut will have risen through this space , , and each part , contiguous to the thread of the screw , will have slid upon this thread or spiral inclined plane , through a space equal to the length of one circuit of the spiral about the body of the screw . 203 . This inclined plane may be represented by a plane right angled triangle , whose perpendicular is equal to the thread distance of the screw , and whose hypothenuse is equal to one circuit of the spiral , and whose base is equal to the circumference of the screw . If the power be applied at the circumference of the screw , the mechanical advantage of the screw may be calculated in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained by the inclined plane . One thing however is to be observed . In turning the nut ( or the screw ) ' the power acts at right angles with the axis of the screw , and obliquely to the thread ; precisely as if the power to raise the weight W , Art . 162 , up the plaue C A should be applied in the di- states . 113 lection parallel to the base ; in which case , the power : the weight t. : the height or thread distance : to the base or circumference of the screw ( 163 ) . Tbe power is never applied , however , at the circumference of the screw , but at the end of a lever* The advantage gained by the lever , in this case , is in proportion to its length , compared with the semidiameter of the screw ; or to the circumference of the circle , which the end of the lever describes , compared with the circumference of the screw . The power gained by a screw , therefore , is in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread distance of the screw ; or Power : weight : : thread distance : circumference described by power Examples* i . The thread distance of a paper mill screw being 1.5 inches , the lever 15 feet long , and the power applied at the end of it 150 lbs . ; to what is the pressure equal ? The lever being 15 feet , the diameter of the circle , which the end of it describes is 30 , and the circumference is 30 X 3.1416 = 94.248 feet , or 1 130.9 inches . Then 1.5 : 1130.9 : : 150 : 113090 lbs . the answer , ii . Suppose the thread distance had been 1.75 inches , and the length of the lever 1 9 feet ? 204 . It may be observed , that the motion of the screw is attended with great friction . 1st. because it is one inclined plane rubbing upon another . 2d. because from the direction in which the power acts ( Fig. 6 ) the pressure of the weight upon the inclined plane , is W g , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one half the pressure gained by the screws in the above examples must be deducted for friction . The material of the screw , and its being dry or well oiled , however , occasions great variety in the amount of friction. * Notwithstanding , great mechanical ad vantage may be gained by this instrument . And even this friction has its uses , and those not unimportant : for the screw will remain at /z/ /z/ rest , the friction preserving an equilibrium with the weight , after the power is removed . Of the pressure of inclined beams , arising from their ozon weight . 205 . If a beam A 6 be suspended by a. rope ADB , fixed at each end to the ends of the beam , and passing over a support at D , /z/ Fig. 24. the beam will assume such a position , that a plumb line from D will cut the centre of gravity C. This readily follows from what has already been said in Art . 185 and 190. 206 . If instead of the ropes A D B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B ( f A being in a line with D A , and e B in a ine with D B ) the beam would be sustained without any tendency to move to either side , and would produce no strain upon either joist , but one of direct compression . If the position of the beam A B were given , and that of ene of the joists , as f A , and it were required to find the position of the other ; we should draw a vertical or plumb line D C through the centre of gravity , - continue f A till it meets the vertical in D , and then from D draw D e through the point B , and B e will be the position of the other support . To ascertain by what force each support is compressed , let D g on the vertical represent the weight of the beam ; draw g h parallel to D A , and g b will represent the strain upon A f , and D h that upon B e. /z/ 207 . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of the joists , and if these planes are perpendicular to the direction of the ropes or joists , the beam will have no tendency to slide either way . 308 . If a beam A B leans against a wall , we may easily find the Fig. 25. direction of the abutment at A , which will sustain it without any tendency to slide . Draw the vertical e C through the centre of gravity , C : draw e B perpendicular to the wall at the upper erid of the beam , and then from e , where this line cuts the vertical , draw e A to the foot of the beam . This line e A represents the direction in which the beam presses upon the abutment , and the abutment A must therefore be perpendicular to this line . If we represent the weight of the beam by e f , and draw d f perpendicular to it , d f will represent the horizontal pressure both against the wall at B and the abutment at A , and e d will represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may in the same manner find the direction , in which rafters press by their own weight upon the ends of a tie beam . Fig- /z/ The directions , in which the rafters press upon the ends of the tie are e B and h A. The horizontal thrust d f and i k , &c.; 210 . If the rafters are unlike in their dimensions , the horizontal pressures derived in this way will be unlike . If , for example , D A were longer than D B , and its weight the same , i k would be greater than d f , and the horizontal pressures at D would be unequal . If they were not put together , therefore , at D , so as to prevent sliding , the larger beam would prevail , and the framing fall* Being secured at D , they will stand , but d f will not represent the horizontal thrust at B. B will be pressed not only with the force d f , but with the excess of i k , above d f. i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tie . The abutment at B must likewise , in order to prevent sliding , have an inclination equal to that at B , for by drawing a horizontal line x y , equal to i k , and a perpendicular y z equal to e f , the third side x z will have the same inclination as h k , and the pressure of the beam will be in the direction z x 211 . If a roof be inclined only one way , as the covering of sheds , &c.; the horizontal thrust may be entirely removed by beveling one end of the beam and notching the other , so that the bearing part shall fit the horizontal tops of the walls : as is represented in the present figure* /z/ mm &m*^; /z/ Gtntral remarks . 212 . The great object of the roof is to form a covering for the house . Its form must depend on various circumstances . The same roof , which serves well in a warm climate , would be improper in a cold one . 213 . Trusses* for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , it is hot an uncommon fault . Timber is sometimes added , which not only gives no additional strength , but by increasing the load upon the walls , diminishes the stability of the structure . Not a stick should be used without some definite purpose . Although timber must not be spared where great strength is necessary , and the weight of timber is of small consideration , yet where the strain is light , it should be recollected that the work is stronger , when it is light . 214 . In the pitch of roofs , very great diversity of practice has obtained . The Gothic architects gave them great elevation , which was in harmony with the aspiring character of their style . In Greek and Roman architecture the pitch was less . Roofs of high pitch are less apt to leak than those which are lower . The rain which falls upon them , runs off more rapidly . They are not so liable to be stripped of their covering by winds . The snows , too , do not lie so long upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are also chosen in small houses , in which economy of room is an object . There are however some advantages in low roofs . They require less timber , and press therefore with less weight upon the walls . /z/ 215 . In favour of high pitched roofs it may also be mentioned , that the weight of their covering , or the mass of snow , which rests , in this part of the world , upon them , for several months in the year , presses with less force than upon flatter roofs . But on the other hand , if the rafters are not supported by braces , their increased length will so increase the strain , as to compensate for this advantage . 216 . We have seen , , in the first part of this work , that beams support much greater weights , when pressed or drawn in the direction of their length , than when subjected to transverse strains- It should therefore be an object continually in view , to avoid asrmuch as possible all transverse strains , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are best able to support them . This remark will be illustrated by almost every thing we shall have to say on the subject of roofs , and indeed , to make the load as light as it can be securely done , - and to dispose of the necessary strains in such manner as the timber is best able to bear them , - and to provide for the permanency of the parts in the situation in which they are placed , - constitute the great business of the carpenter . His work is subject , however , to necessary imperfections , and he must therefore provide against possible derangement , and foresee the changes of position to which it is liable , that new and destructive strains may not arise from such changes . Of the tie beam 217 . If a roof should be made with rafters only , as A B and B C , it would have a tendency to press the walls of the building at A Fig. 27. *nd C , outward . To prevent such a strain upon the walls , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , connecting /q/ the feet of the rafters* This is called a tie beam , and by its means the roof becomes a perfect frame of itself , and acts upon the walls of the building only by its weight , in vertical pressure . 218 . By the principles before laid down , we can readily ascertain the horizontal thrust of the roof , and then ascertain the size of the tie beam necessary to sustain this thrust . It will be found that the strength of a very slender beam is altogether sufficient to serve the purpose of a tie , even in a large roof ; and had it no other office to perform , a slender beam would be preferable to a large one . A tie beam has generally , however , a ceiling to support , and sometimes rooms are constructed in the roof upon it , and therefore in calculating the size of the beam , reference must be had to these offices . 219 . In calculating the horizontal thrust of a roof , when it consists only of rafters abutting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet with a tie , the principles developed in Art . 209 must be followed . When trusses are adopted , like those which follow , a different method must be adopted* 220 . The direction in which the ceiling and other weights act upon the tie is vertical , and so far , a thin and deep beam is preferable to a square one . It must however have thickness enough to admit the framing of rafters into it , without being too much weakened . 221 . " It is a common practice in framing roofs to force the tie beam to a certain degree of camber , * which appears to have been introduced under the idea that a cambered beam partakes of the nature of an arch : this , as has been justly observed by a late writer , ( Robison ) is one of the fallacies , which it is the business of the mathematical theory of carpentry to dispel . It is obvious that when a cambered beam settles it has a tendency to thrust out the walls , instead of being a bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally crooked timbers with the round side upward , for tie beams ; but then their walls were capable of supporting a considerable pressure . In some of the tie beams of the Durham Cathedral this curvature is very considerable . Modern walls are constructed on different principles , and require all /z/ CONSTRUCTIONS Of TIMBER . the conuexion a roof can be made to give them , instead of being sufficient to withstand the thrust of a cambered beam . When there are ceiling joists , it is easy to keep them a little higher in the middle of a ceiling , at the rate of about an inch in twenty feet , which prevents the settling from offending " the eye of the beholder , " and consequently accomplishes all that Mr. Price and others propose to do by cambering the tie beam . " * Of the king post . 222 . When the tie beam is long , or the weight it has to sustain ; is so great as to expose it to bending , it is necessary to support it In dwelling houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the partitions , which separate the rooms ; but in many situations , no support can be given to the tie beam from beneath , and we must find some means of sustaining it from above* Fig. 28 , /z/ The tie beam A C may be sustained by a vertical beam B D , whose foot is secured to the tie beam by a strap , or otherwise , and whose head is sustained by the abutting of the rafters , A B and C B , against it . B D is called a king post . The term post is hardly consistent with its office , for it will readily be perceived that it acts only as a tie* It is drawn in the direction of its length , and is therefore capable of sustaining a great weight , and it is supported in such a manner by the rafters , as to press them in the direction of their length . Tredgold 9 p. 82. i U06T9 WITH f IE ! BEAMS . /z/ We see therefore that the strain upon the tie , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes longitudinal ; and great strength is thereby added to the roof . Of Braces . 223 . In a wide roof the rafters will also need support . To furnish this support , we sometimes see a perpendicular brace as E. mortised into the beam . But this is only transferring a transverse strain from the rafter to the tie j it does not remove it . ' Fig. 29 . The braces G F and D F , which abut against the foot of the king post , furnish the necessary support to the rafters A B and C B , while they produce no strain but a longitudinal one on the king post , and are themselves compressed in the directions of their length . In order that the student may be fully convinced of the impropriety of the perpendicular brace D E , let him calculate first the effect of the transverse strain upon the oblique rafter A B , and then upon the horizontal tie F A. 224 . We have introduced into the above design other new timbers besides the braces . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal rafters ; those above them small rafters . The sole office of the latter is to receive the boarding . At G and D are seen sections of timbers called purlines , which stretch across from truss to truss , and support the small rafters . As we have before remarked ( 83 ) purlines should be used /z/ in considerable lengths , and notched over the principal rafters , and the small rafters over the purlines . The purlines should rest upon those parts of the principal rafters , which are supported by braces , by which means nearly all the strain upon the principal rafters is avoided . Prof , Robison calls in question the propriety of using purlines and small rafters , in cases where they can be avoided , and fortifies his opinion by the experiment before quoted ( 1 29 ) in relation to the comparative strength of single and double floors . Doubtless in the above truss the purlines and small rafters might be dispensed with , and the boarding placed directly upon the principal rafters . In the following trusses , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above truss , that the weight of the rafters is , by the interposition of the braces , sustained by the king post , and the king post with all the load which rests upon it , is sustained by the rafters , abutting against the head of it . In trusses of this form , therefore , the whole weight of the roof acts upon the rafters , much like a heavy weight upon the ridge . 226 . A truss of the above construction will serve for a span of 20 to 30 feet . The following Table of Scantlings is given by Tredgold . Span . Tie beam . King post . Prin. rafters . Braces . Purlines .

The value of /z/ a for New-England fir , in the same table , derived from Prof. Barlow 's experiment , agrees very nearly with that obtained from the experiments , page 37 , for the common white pine of New-England . Queen Posts , Straining Beams , and Sills* 227 . If the roof be very wide , the tie beam requires more supports tha/i the single king post . But how shall these be secured ? The king post being supported by the ends of the rafters abutting against them , must necessarily be in the middle . We may imagine a very wide king post composed of a frame , equal in width to about one third the span of the roof , and we shall be led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 30. 228 . The frame HIED may represent the wide king post which we have imagined . The short rafters A H and C 1 abut against the heads of the supports D H and I E , and would crowd them together were they not kept asunder , and in their places by H I , which is therefore called the straining beam . But with the help of this straining beam , the short rafters support the two parts H D and 1 E , in the same manner as the king post receives its support . These two posts , H D and I E , therefore , perform the offices of - ties to support the tie beam , and are called queen posts . The braces F D and G E abut against the feet of the queen posts , and to prevent them from being pressed towards each other , the beam D E is introduced , and is called the straining sill . Instead of the straining sill the queen posts might be strongly mortised into the tie beam , /z/ CONSTRUCTIONS OF TIMBtt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortises would diminish the strength of the tie . 229 . This truss will serve for a span from 30 to 46 feet in extent . Span , ft. /z/ Table of Scantlings ; from Tredgold. v Tie bam . Queen posts . Principal rafters . Straining beam . qwq /z/ 230 . For a span of from 46 to 60 feet , the tie beam and rafters will require more supports . These supports may be introduced between the queen posts and the wall plate , as is seen in the following figure . This truss Fig* 31 , is constructed upon the same principles as the last , and is in fact the same , with the addition of the supports F and G P , against the beads of which the braces G E and F D abut on one side , while on the other they are sustained by the principal rafters . The foot of each supports a brace , and instead of a straining sill between O D and E P , the feet of these supports are mortised into the tie beam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at D , because the beam is more able to support a strain ( 197 ) in that part . /z/ This roof needs no particular explanation* It differs from the preceding by having the supports e b and c g sustained on one side by short rafters , a b and c d ; too , braces springing from the foot of each queen post ip support the rafters ; and in the greater extent of the straining beam , and the support of the straining beam by a king post above it , with braces abutting against its foot . If the straining beam in this roof be shortened , and the king pest omitted , it will then serve for a span of 60 to 75 feet . 234 . To give a clear view of the offices performed by the different parts of a roof , we may briefly recapitulate what has been said thus far . To prevent a horizontal thrust upon the walls , the tie beam is introduced . This however is not merely a tie , but sometimes carries a load , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a king post is added , which is sustained by the abutting of rafters against its head . If the rafters are long , they too need support , and they obtain it from braces which abut against the foot of the king post . If more than one support for the tie beam is necessary , two posts , called queen posts , are introduced , which exactly resemble a king post cut lengthwise , its parts being kept asunder by the straining beam and straining sill ; other supports are added if necessary , and braces , but the same principle governs their use throughout . 235 . The following truss is from Price 's British Carpenter , and it may be . used where it is desired to avoid a large expanse of roof . But instead of this , the trusses , Figs. 30 , 31 , or 32 , might be used , the part above the straining beam being omitted . The top of the roof Fig. 33. would then be flat , and there would be again of room in the roof t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roofs like the above from Price are called M roofs , on account of their resemblance to that letter . /z/ 236 , Table of Scantlings to Fig. 33 ; from Tredgold . Span . Tie beam Queen potts .

Braces* ft. in. in. in. 55 12by8 8 byS 8 by8 /z/ 237* For a span that exceeds 65 feet , a truss of the following farm is considered one of the best of its kind , that can be devised . qwq /z/ It is the same in principle with the roof of Drury Lane Theatre , executed by Mr. Saunders , over a span of 80 feet 3 inches in the clear . Robison says of this roof , that it probably " has not its equal in the world for lightness , stiffness and strength . " 238 . The following figure exhibits " the celebrated roof of the theatre of the University of Oxford , by Sir Christopher Wren . The span between the walls is 75 feet . This is accounted very " ingenious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost unchangeable in its form ; but from this circumstance , it does not distribute the horizontal thrust with the same regularity as the usual constructions . The horizontal thrust on the tie beam is about twice the weight of the roof , and is withstood by an iron strap below'the beam , which stretches the whole width of the building in ' the form of a rope , making part of the ornament of the ceiling . " * Fig. 35. 239 . There is considerable difficulty in erecting roofs , in which the joints are numerous , and the timbers of large dimensions , and they are liable to derangement by the shrinking of king and queen posts ; for it is manifest , that if the king and queen posts , against the heads of which the rafters abut , shrink or are compressed , they will settle , and instead of supporting the tie beam , they will strain it transversely . To obviate these inconveniences , it has been proposed to make the principal rafters " in a continued series of m pieces abutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner as to form a curved rib , as in the next figure . * Robison , Vol. 1 , p. 605. /z/ Fig. 36 , Fig. 37. /z/ These pieces are double , and placed side by side , and bolted or keyed together , and so disposed that the joints on one side come against the middle of the lengths on the other side . Crooked timber would be preferable to straight , because fewer joints would be necessary . The supports , S , for the tie beam , consist each of two pieces , one oh each side of the rib , and notched and bolted both to the rib and the tie beam , as shewn in Fig. 37 . This mode of construction admits of a firmer connexion with the tie beam than the common method of king and queen posts , and the number of suspending pieces can be increased at pleasure . The best situation for the suspending pieces is at , the joints of the ribs . Diagonal braces , as shewn by the dotted lines , may be added if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed for any span from 35 to 1 00 feet . The following is a Table of Scantlings , from Tredgold .

Smaller roofs may be constructed in a similar manner ; but the curved rib , instead of being made of short pieces , may be formed by bending a long stick upon Mr. Hookey 's plan for bending ship timber . " If the depth of a piece of timber does not exceed about a hundred and twentieth of its length , it may be bent into a curve that will rise about one eighth of the span , without impairing its elastic force . And if two such pieces be laid one upon the other /z/ and then bent by means of a rope fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of the required curve , by twisting the rope , as a stone sawyer tightens his saw , or as a common bow saw is tightened . The pieces may then be bolted together ; and if this operation is performed in a workmanlike manner , the pieces will spring very little when the rope is gently slacked ; and it is advisable to do it gradually , that the parts may take their proper bearing without crippling . " If the piece is of about one sixtieth part of the span in thickness , it may be sawn along the middle of its depth with a thin saw from each end toward the middle of its length , leaving a part of about eight feet of the middle uncut . The piece may then be bent to the proper curve and bolted . " In either case the rise of the ribs should be half the height of the roof , and they should be bent one fourth more , to allow for the springing back , when the rope is taken off . " * , 242 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span is shewn in the annexed , diagram . The suspending pieces are notched on each side in pairs , and bolted or strapped together . Fig. 38 .

It is sometimes required , that roofs be executed so as to admit arched ceilings to ascend into them . In such cases the tie beam can not be employed to prevent the lateral pressure against the walls 5 and to construct a truss , which shall exert no horizontal thrust , and that without the assistance of tie beams , is a problem of no small difficulty . Indeed , considering the necessary imperfections of the best executed roofs , arising from the shrinkage of timber it is altogether impossible . Attention to the principles of equilibrium , and the resolution of forces , will however enable a skilful carpenter to make the horizontal thrust comparatively light , and such as well built walls may sustain . 244 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain may easily be calculated . Fig. 39 , b n /z/ The lateral pressure of ' the roof upon a wall would produce the same effect as a weight equal to the pressure , supposing it to be /z/ suspended as F , ( Fig. 39 ) over a pulley , in such a manner as to exert its whole force in drawing the wall outward . If the wall is tipped outward by the weight F , it must turn over the corner A. The whole weight of the wall may be considered as concentrated at the centre of gravity C , and it would act in resisting the outward pressure , precisely as an equal weight W would act , if suspended from the centre of gravity . A being the fulcrum , F aGts at the end of an arm of a lever equal to A E , the height of the wall . W acts in the direction of C W , and the perpendicular distance of the fulcrum A from this direction is A 6 , half the thickness of the wall . When an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal thrust is exactly equal to what the wall can sustain /z/ P WxAB r ' Fa= ! - XE - in other words , the greatest horizontal thrust , which a wall can sup* port , %s equal to the weight of the wall multiplied by half the thickness of the base , and divided by the height . This rule supposes the two faces of the wall perpendicular and parallel . When this is not the case , A B ( the multiplier ) is always equal to the perpendicular distance of A from the line of direction of W , and A E ( the divisor ) equal to the perpendicular distance of A from the direction of F , where it acts upon the wall . 245 . This mode of calculation supposes that the wall is secured upon its base by its weight only , and that the wall is so well built , as to act like one mass , and to tip from the bottom rather than to have its parts separated . 246 . In order to calculate the weight of walls ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply them by the first number set against the material in the following Table . i /z/ Table of the weights of a cubic foot of materials for walls* Materials , Bricks , Marble , Granite , Sandstone , Brickwork may be estimated Stonework " " Mortar " " Wt. of a cubic foot in lbs . /z/ mean 107.00 ( s. /z/ 8p. gr. /z/ ' Examples , i . Let a wall be supposed 4 feet thick , 25 high , and 40 long , and built of stone ; what is the greatest lateral pressure it can sustain from a roof ? ii . Let the same wall be of brick ? iii . The wall 1.5 feet thick , 30 feet high , and 40 long , of brick ? 247 . A method of supplying the place of a tie beam , not unfrequently employed , is that of the collar beam , as E F. Fig. 40 . But if the roof be not very light , and if the whole lateral strain come upon the collar beam , it will not be sufficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight inspection will point out its defects . i . Each of the rafters A B and A C may be considered as levers whose fulcrums are at A* The load acts at B and C , and the /z/ power to sustain it at E and F. The collar beam acts sit &; mechanical disadvantage , therefore , and although there would be no difficulty in making the beam itself strong enough to support this augmented strain , it is difficult to make a joint , which will be suf-ficient* ii . Again , the collar beam acting upon the points C and F , brings a very heavy transverse strain upon the rafters . iii . In forming the joints F and E the rafters must be very much weakened , just where they require to be strong . Considering the imperfections of the best roofs , it will not appear strange , that this , by the failing of the joints/or the bending of the rafters , should be found entirely ineffectual in removing the transverse strain from the walls . 248 . The next specimen is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred to the last , although it can not possess the stability of roofs with ties . Fig. 41 . The beams A C and B C act as ties , confining the Veet of the rafters . The joints at E and'F are not so much strained , and the transverse strains upon the rafters are diminished . A C and B C being ties , tend to produce a downward flexure of the cdllarbeam , which is prevented by the king post D C. The position of the beams A C and B C renders the strain upon them very considerable . This strain can be very well sustained by the beams themselves , but the joints at C will be likely to fail unless they are extremely well executed . j ROOrS WITHOUT TIE feEAMfc. /z/ 249 . The following design is commended by Dr. Rofcison , and " has been executed with great success in the Circus , or Equestrian Theatre in Edinburgh , the width being 60 feet . " This roof is the same as the last described , with the addition of the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off some of the weight , and by their greater uprightness exert a smaller thrust on the walls . " Fig. 42 , 250 . Figure 43 is a sketch of a roof in Westminster school , taken from Smith 's Specimens of Ancient Carpentry . It exhibits one of the most common forms of trusses used by the Gothic architects . The timbers are so disposed as to throw the pressure a considerable way down the walls , and at the same time in a vertical direction . /z/ " . mm /z/ Fig. 43. 251 . " The centre aisles of churches being often higher than side ones , the same effect as when a tie continues through may be produced by connecting the lower beams by means of braces to the upper ones . " The following sketch illustrates this principle It represents half a truss . " The lower tie B is so connected with the principal tie beam A , by means of braces b , that the foot of the principal rafters can not spread without stretching the tie A* Tbe /z/ iron rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B , and is better than timber , . because the shrinkage of timber ones would be particularly objectionable in that situation . The oblique position d renders it efficient in opposing the spread of the rafters " * Fig. 44. 252 . We have now given the common and the most ingenious methods , which have been devised for the construction of roofs without ties . However perfectly they are made , they will always produce some strain upon the walls . This strain , where the walls are very massive , is of little consequence . The Gothic builders , many of whose roofs have stood for centuries , and will yet outlast many modern structures , did not depend wholly upon the skilful /z/ adjustment of their trusses , but made their walls of prodigious thickness , or else sustained them by heavy buttresses . Had their , roofs been placed upon such walls as are commonly erected at the present day , they would not have outlived their authors* " A wall 60 feet high and 3 feet thick could not withstand the action of a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thin walls depend very much for their stability upon cross walls , cross beams , and roofs , and if an arched ceiling is desfred in the building , it would in most cases be better to obtain it by increasing the elevation of the walls , than by omitting the tie beam , and thus endangering their stability . This is with more confidence recommended , as very little height is usually gained by omitting tie beams. * /z/ Note . This Chapter is taken with little alteration from TredgoloVs Carpentry. 253 . The proportions oflhe timbers depend so much upon the design of the framing of a roof , that it would be impossible to furnish rules that would apply directly t all cases ; nevertheless , by considering a few cases , the method that may be adopted will be seen , and consequently may be applied to designs made on other principles than those already shown . In roofs , as in floors , I have talen tle constant number from a comparison of roofs already executed , and known to ststnd* VM6Tredgotd , p.n. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , queen posts , and suspending pieces* 254 . The king post is intended to support the ceiling , and , by means of the braces , to support part of the weight of the roof* The weight suspended by the king post will be proportional to the span of the roof ; therefore , to find the scantling , , Rule . Multiply the length of the post in feet , by the span in feet . Then multiply this product by the decimal 0.12 for fir , or by 0 . 1 3 for oak , which will give the area of the king post in inches ; and divide this area by the breadth , and it will give the thickness : or by the thickness for the breadth . 255 . Queen posts and suspending pieces are strained in a similar manner to king posts , but the load upon them is only proportional to that part of the length of the tie beam suspended by each suspending piece or queen post . In queen posts the parts suspended by each is generally half the span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queen post or suspend- ! ing piece , by that part of the length of the tie beam it supports also in feet . This product multiplied by the decimal 0.27 for fir , or by 0.32 for oak , will give the area of the post in inches ; and dividing this area by the thickness will give the breadth . Example . In the roof , Fig. 30 , each queen post supports one third of the tie beam , or 1 3.3 ft. of it , * and the length of the queen post is 6 ft. ; therefore 13.3 x 6 x 0.27 = 21.546 , the area in the shaft in inches . If the thickness of the truss be six inches , then 3.6 , nearly , and the queen posts should be 6 inches by 3.6 . I have put it 6 by 4 in the table , Art . 229. 256 . These rules give the scantling in the smallest part of the pieces , and in order to avoid the bad effects arising from the shrinking of the king or queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and the timber should be well seasoned . Hard oak makes /z/ the best , because it will be least compressed by the ends of the principal rafters . 257 . It has been proposed to let the ends of the principal rafters abut against each other , and to suspend the king post by straps of iron ; but a piece of good carpentry should depend as little on straps as possible , and it would be better , and less expensive , to make a king or queen post wholly of cast iron , than to depend on wrought iron . The breadth of a cast iron king or queen post should be about one fourth of an oak one , to be equally strong . By a method to be described in the chapter on joints , &c.; the rafters abut against each other , and the tie beam is suspended by piece ; bolted on each side ; which is perhaps the best in use . Tie beams . 258 . A tie beam is affected by two strains , the one in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other is a cross strain from the weight of the ceiling . In estimating the strength , the thrust of the rafters need not be considered , because the beam is always sufficiently strong to resist this strain . The pressure or the weight supported by the tie beam will be proportional to the length of the longest part of it that is unsupported . But there are two cases , one where the weight is merely the weight of the ceiling ; the other where there are rooms in the roof . Case 1 To find the scantling of a tie beam that has only to support a ceiling , the length of the longest unsupported part being given . Rule . Divide the length of the longest unsupported part by the cube root of the breadth ; and the quotient multiplied by 1.47 will be the depth required for fir , in inches ; or multiply by 1.52 , which will give the depth for oak , in inches . Case 2 . In the case where there are rooms above the tie beam , the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 131 , 132 . Example to Case 1 . The length of the longest unsupported part of the tie beam in the roof frig* 33 is 17 feet ; and let the thickness of the truss be 9 i /z/ inches . Then the cube root of 9 is 2.08 very nearly ; therefore , jr - = 12 inches , the depth required . 259 . Tie beams are often unnecessarily cut to pieces with mortises , where the king or queen posts join them . It is much better to make very short tenons to the lower end of these posts , and to support the beam by means of straps . * Principal rafters* 260 . In estimating the strength of principal rafters , I suppose them to be supported by struts either at or very near to all the points where the purlines rest upon them . The pressure on a principal rafter is in the direction of its length , and is in proportion to the magnitude of the roof ; but this pressure does not bear the same proportion to the weight when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts ; therefore the same constant number will not answer for both cases . Case 1 . To find the scantling of the principal rafter , when there is a king post in the middle . Rule . Multiply the square of the length of the rafter in feet , by the span in feet ; and divide the product by the cube of the thickness in inches . For fir multiply the quotient by 0.96 , which will give the depth in inches . Case 2 . To find the scantling of a principal rafter , when there are two queen posts . Ride . Multiply the square of the length of the rafter in feet , by the span in feet ; and divide the product by the cube of the thickness in inches . For fir multiply the quotient by 0.155 , which will give the depth in inches . The thickness is generally the same as the king or queen posts , and tie beam . Example . The length of the principal rafter in Fig. 30 is 14.5 feet , and the spanjs 40 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ of the length is 210.25 , and the cube of the thickness 216 ; there-fore , 210.25x40X0.115 fi near , y . that is , the principal rafters should be six inches by six inches . Straining beams . 261 . A straining beam is the horizontal piece between the beads of the queen posts . In order that this beam may be the strongest possible , its depth should be to its thickness as 10 to 7 . Rule . Multiply the square root of the span in feet , by the length of the straining beam in feet , and extract the square root of the prqduct . Multiply the root by 0.9 for fir , which will give the depth in inches . To find the thickness , multiply the depth by the decimal 0.7 . Struts and braces* 262 . The part of a roof that is supported by a strut or brace is easily ascertained from the design , but the effect of the load must depend on the position of the brace ; when it is square from the back of the rafter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it has the same inclination as the roof the same strain will be thrown on the lower part of the principal rafter as is borne by the strut , but as the degree of obliqueness does not vary much , I will not attempt to include its effect in the rule for the scantling . Rule . Multiply the square root of the length supported in feet , by the length of the brace or strut in feet ; and the square root of the product multiplied by 0.8 for fir , will give the depth in inches ; and the depth multiplied by the decimal 0.6 , will give the breadth in inches . /z/ Example* In the roof Fig* 30 , the part supported by the brace or strut is equal to half the length of the principal rafter , or 7 feet ; and the length of the brace is 6 feet . Therefore x/ ( x/7x 6 ) X 0.8 v/ ( 2.646 X 6 ) X 0.8 = 3.985 X 0.8 ** 3.188 , the breadth ; and 3.188 X 0.6 = 1*9128 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece intended for a brace , a principal rafter , or a straining beam , be crooked , the round side should be placed upwards . 263 . I have now laid down rules for the principal parts of a truss , but in so doing I have not taken into the account the different weights of different kinds of roofing , nor the different degrees of inclination , lest the rules should become too complicated . It only remains now to give the rules for purlines and common rafters . Purlines. 264 . The stress upon purlines is proportional to the distance they are apart ; and the weight being uniformly diffused , the stiffness is reciprocally as the cube of the length . Rule . Multiply the cube of the length of the purline in feet , by the distance the purlines are apart in feet ; and the fourth root of the product for fir , will give the depth in inches ; or multiplied by 1 .04 , will give the depth for oak : and the depth multiplied by the decimal 0.6 will give the breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded , and the breadth need not be more than from 2 to 2.5 inches . The depth may be found by the following rule : Rule . Divide the length of bearing in feet , by the cube root of the breadth in inches ; and the quotient multiplied by 0.72 for fir , or 0.74 for oak , will give the depth in inches . /z/ Example . Let the length of bearing of a rafter of Riga fir be 7 feet , and the breadth 2 inches . The cube root of 2 is 1.26 nearly ; there- fore &#9632; * ' - as 4 inches , the depth required . /z/ 266 . Fir makes the best common rafters and purlines , because it is not so subject to warp and twist with the heat of roofs in summer as oak ; much however depends on the quality of the timber , as oak from old trees often stands very well . /z/ 267 . The construction of domes " appears to be the most difficult task in the art of carpentry . , But the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is , that a round building , which gathers in at top , like a glasshouse , a potter 's kiln , or a spire steeple , instead of being the most difficult to erect with stability is of all others the easiest . Nothing can show this more forcibly than daily practise , where they are run up without centres and without scaffoldings : and it requires gross blunders indeed in the choice of their outline to put them in much danger of falling from a want of equilibrium . In like manner a dome of carpentry can hardly fall , give it what shape or what construction you will . It can not fail unless some part of it flies out at the bottom : an iron hoop round it , or straps at the joinings of the trusses and purlines , which make an equivalent to a hoop , will effectually secure it . And as beauty requires that a dome shall spring almost perpendicularly from the wall , it is evident that there is hardly any thrust to force out the walls . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d /q/ the tangent is inclined about 40 or 50 degrees to ( he horizon . Here it will be proper to make a course of firth horizontal joinings. 268 , " We doubt not but that domes of carpentry will now be raised of great extent The old Halle au Bled at Paris , of 200 feet in diameter , was the invention of an intelligent carpenter , the Sieur Molineau . He was not by any means a man of science , but had much more mechanical knowledge than artisans usually have , and was convinced that a very thin shell of timber might not only be so shaped as to be nearly in equilibrio , but that if hooped or firmly connected horizontally , it would have all the stiffness that was necessary ; and he presented his project to the magistracy of aris* The grandeur of it pleased them , but they doubted of its possibility . Being a great public work , they prevailed on the Academy of Sciences to consider it . The members , who wece competent judges , were instantly struck with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a thing so plain had not been long familiar to every house carpenter . It quickly became an universal topic of conversation , dispute , and cabal , in the polite circles of Paris . But the Academy having given a very favorable report of their opinion , the project was immediately carried into execution , and soon completed . " 269 . " The construction of this dome is the simplest thing that can be imagined . The circular ribs which compose it consist of planks nine feet long , 13 inches broad , and three inches thick : and each rib consists of three of these planks bolted together in such a manner that two joints meet . A rib is begun , for instance , with a plank of three feet longstanding between one of six and another of nine , and this is continued to the head of it . No machinery was necessary for carrying up such small pieces , and the whole went up like a piece of bricklayer 's work . At various distances these libs were connected horizontally by purlines and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the work had reached such a height , that the distance of the ribs was two thirds of the original distance , every third rib was discontinued , and the space was left open and glazed* When carried so much higher that the distance of the ribs is one third of the original distance , every second rib ( new consisting of two ribs very near each other ) is in like manner . discontinued , and - the void is glazed . A little above this /z/ the heads of the ribs are framed into a circular ring of timber , which forms a wide opening in the middle ; over which is a glazed canopy or umbrella , with au opening between it and the dome for allowing the heated air to get out . Ml who have seen this dome say , that it is the most beautiful and magnificent object they have ever beheld . " 270 . " The only difficulty which occurs in the construction of wooden domes is , when they are unequally loaded , by carrying a heavy lanthorn or cupola in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a mere shell , it would be crushed in at the top , or the action of the wind on the lantborn might tear it out of its place . Such a dome must therefore consist of trussed frames . " * 271 . The following figure represents a truss for a dome , when the interior dome is not required to be open to a great height , and a tie A A can be introduced . C C are curved ribs in two thicknesses , with the joints crossed and bolted together . It is calculated for a span of 60 feet , but may be extended to 120 feet . B B are posts which may extend upward to form the lantern . Fig. 45 , 272 . Two principal trusses may be placed across the opening parallel to each other , and at a distance apart equal to the diameter of the lantern , as A B and C D in the next figure ; with a sufficient number of half trusses to reduce the bearing of the rafters to a convenient length . . RobisorCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Fig. 46. 273 . If do opening is required at the top of the dome , two principal trusses may cross each other at right angles , in the centre of the dome , one being placed so much higher than the other as to prevent the ties interfering . /z/ Fig. 47. 274 . " The construction of domes without horizontal cross ties is not difficult when there is a sufficient tie round the base . The most simple method , and one which is particular useful in. qmall domes , is to place a series of curved ribs so that the lower ends of those ribs stand upon the curb at the base , and the upper ends meet at the top . When the pieces are so long , and so much curved that they can not be cut out of timber without being cut across the grain so much as to weaken them , thej should . be put together in thicknesses , with the joints crossed , and well nailed together : or , in very large domes , they should be bolted or keyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already described , as applied to roofs , ( See Art . 239 ) . The method of making curved ribs in thicknesses has been used in the construction of centres for arches from the earliest periods of arch building ; and it was first applied to the construction of domes by Philibert de Lorme , who gives the following scantlings for different sized domes : * For domes of B4 feet diameter , 8 inches by 1 inch . /z/ These ribs are formed of two thicknesses of the scantlings given above , and are placed about two feet apart at the base . The rafters are notched upon them for receiving the boarding , and also horizontal ribs are notched on in the inside , which gives a great degree of stiffness to the whole. * Fig. 48 is a section of a dome conFig. /z/ strncted in this manner ; and Fig. 49 a projection of a part of the dome , with the rafters and inside ribs . " t Fig. 49 .

Fig. 50. 276 . The following sketch " represents a dome executed for the Register office of Edinburgh , by James and Robert Adams , and is very agreeable to mechanical principles . The span is 50 feet clear , and the thickness only 4.6. " * Fig. 51. 277 . The following figure shews the principle upon which the dome of St Paul 's , in London , was constructed by Sir C. Wren . A cone is introduced , which supports the heavy lantern at the top . /z/ Fig. 52 , It is evident , that a heavy weight at the top of a dome , when supported by the straight wall of a cone , or a straight stick of timber , as A B , produces no transverse strain ; but if it be supported by the curved sides of the dome only , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bis very considerable . The introduction of the cone , therefore , in the dome of St. PauPs , to support a heavy cupola , was very judicious . But in constructing domes of less magnificent dimensions , it would be entirely sufficient to surround them with iron hoops about the parts where the strain would be most considerable . /z/ Note . This Chapter is taken entire from T%edgoWs Elementary Principles . 278 . Partitions , in . carpentry , are frames of timber for dividing the internal parts of a bouse into ' ropms : they are usually lathed and plastered , and Sometimes the spaces between the timbers are filled with brick work In modern carpentry there is no part of a building so much neglected as the partitions . A square* of partitioning is of considerable weight , seldom less than half a ton , and often much more ; therefore a partition should have an adequate support : instead of which , it is often suffered to rest on the floor , which of course settles under a weight it was never intended to bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be necessary to support a partition by means of the floor or roof , it should rather be strapped to the floor or roof above it , than be suffered to bear upon the floor below ; because in that case the cracks along the cornice would be avoided ; and in such cases the timbers of the floor or roof must be made stronger . A partition ought , however , to be capable of supporting its own weight ; for even when doorways are so placed that a truss can not be got the whole depth , it is almost always possible to truss over the heads of the doors . 279 . Partitions that have a solid bearing throughout their length do not require any braces , indeed they are better without it , as it is easy to stiffen them by struts between the uprights , and thus the shrinking and cross strains occasioned by braces are avoided . When braces are introduced in a partition , they should /z/ be disposed so as to throw the weight upon points that are sufficiently supported below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be often practicable to give a partition a solid bearing throughout , it is better not to do so , because all walls settle ; therefore the partition should always be supported only by the walls it is connected with , so that it may settle with them . If the partition have a solid bearing , and the walls settle , fractures mu6t necessarily take place . Also , when a partition is supported at one end by the wall of a high part of the building , and by the wall of a lower part at the other end , it will always crack either close by the walls or diagonally across . I state here the consequences that maybe expected in the usual kinds of foundations ; there may be some where the settlement is ' so small as to produce no sensible effect ; but such instances are rarely met with . Much may be done by making the base of a wall in proportion to the whole weight it is intended to support ; but this belongs to another department of the building art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports , either at the ends or other convenient places , and the framing should be designed accordingly ; that is , so that the weight may not act on any other points than those originally intended to bear it . The best points of support are the walls , to which the plastering of the partition joins ' . 280 . Partitions are made of different thicknesses , according to the extent of the bearing ; for commoq purposes , where the bearing does not exceed 20 feet , 4 inches is sufficient ; or , generally , the principal timbers may be made /z/ And partitions should be filled with as thin stuff as possible , so that it be sufficient to nail the laths to . Two inches is quite a sufficient thickness . When these filling in pieces are in long lengths , that is , when they exceed 3 or 4 feet , they should be stiffened by short struts between them ; or , what is much better , to notch a continued rail across the uprights , nailing it to each . /z/ It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless timber is only an unnecessary load upon the framing , and increases the risk of failure at considerable expense . The thicknesses above mentioned apply only to partitions that have no other than their own weight to bear . When a floor is to be supported by a partition , it must be prepared for that purpose . It would , however , be impossible to give any rules for such partitions , as the design must be varied according to circumstances , which differ so materially in almost every case as to render particular rules useless . 281 . The pressure in the direction of any of the pieces may be found by applying the principles given in the preceding parts of this work ; and also the scantlings of the timbers that would be able to sustain such pressures . The following data will assist in forming an estimate of the pressure on the framing of partitions : The weight of a square of partitioning may be taken at from 1480 pounds to 20 pounds per square . The weight of a square of single joisted flooring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weight of a square of framed flooring , with counter flooring , at from 2500 to 4000 pounds . As great nicety is not required in calculating the scantlings , ihe highest numbers may be taken for long bearings , and the lowest for short ones ; as the one gives the weight in large mansions , and the other that in ordinary houses . The shrinkage of timbers , and still more often imperfect joints , cause considerable settlements to take place in partitions , and consequently cracks in the plastering ; therefore it is essential that the timber should be well seasoned , and also that the work should be well framed , as a slight degree of settlement in a partition is attended with worse consequences than is produced by a like degree of settlement in any other piece of framing . 282 . Fig. 53 shows a design for a trussed partition with a doorway in the middle ; the tie or sill is intended to pass between the joisting under the flooring boards . The strongest position for the inclined pieces of the truss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trussing pieces should never greatly differ from an an- i /z/ gle of 40 degrees with the horizon . The horizontal pieces , a a , are intended to be notched into the uprights , and nailed : in partitions for principal rooms , one on each side might be used . Fig. 53. i 283 . When a doorway is near the side of a room , which is often necessary , in order to render a room either convenient or comfortable , the partition should be trussed over the top of the door , as shown in the following figure . The posts , A , B , should be strapFig. /z/ ped to tbe truss , and braces may be put in the lower part of the truss in the common way ; but it would be better to halve these braces into the uprights which would bind the whole together . In order to save straps the posts A , B , are often halved into the tie C D ; in that case , the tie should be a little deeper ; and al , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halving , perhaps this is the best method . Partitions should always be put up some time before they are plastered ; that the timbers , should they cast , may be put right again . This precaution is not so necessary where the timber has been a considerable time cut to the proper scantlings , or well seasoned . The arrises of all timbers exceeding 3 inches should be taken off , to allow room for a sufficient key for the plaster . /z/ Taken ( zqith a few omissions ) from TredgoWs Elementary Prinr eiples of Carpentry 284 . The joints having to support whatever strains the pieces joined are exposed to , should be formed in such a manner that the bearing parts may have the greatest possible quantity of surface * , provided that surface be made of the best form for resisting the strains . For , should that part of the joint which receives the strain be narrow and thin , it will of course either indent itself into the pieces to which it is joined , or become crippled by the strain ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of the framing . /z/ /q/ i The effect of the shrinkage and expansion of timber should he considered in the construction of joints . On account of the shrinkage of timber dovetail joints should never be used in carpentry , as the smallest degree of shrinking allows the joint to draw out of its place m % and , consequently , it loses all its effect in holding the parts in their proper situation . Dovetail joints can only be used with success when the shrinkage of parts counteract each other ; a case which seldom happens in carpentry , but is common in joinery and cabinet-making . Joints should also be formed so that the contraction or expansion may not have a tendency to split any part of the framing . The force of contraction or expansion is capable of producing astonishing effects where the pieces are confined , and may be sometimes observed in framing that has been wedged too tightly together in improper directions . The powerful effect of expanding timber is well known to quarry-men , as they sometimes employ its force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object to be attained should always be kept in view , as that which is excellent for one purpose may be the worst possible for another . This consideration then must guide me in the division of this section , which will be considered under the following heads : i . Of lengthening pieces , that are strained in the direction of their length . ii . Of lengthening pieces exposed to cross strains ; and building . beams . iii . Of lengthening beams that have to resist compression * iv . Of joints for framing . r . Of joints for ties and braces . Of lengthening pieces of Timber , that are to resist strains in the direction of their length . 286 . The simplest and perhaps the best method of lengthening a beam is to abut the ends together , and place a piece on each side ; these , when firmly bolted together , form a strong and simple connexion . Such a method of lengthening a tie is shown by the /z/ following figure ; and is what ship carpenters cdlljishmg a beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in this case depends or Fig- 55. /z/ a f /z/ the bolts , and the lateral adhesion and friction produced by screwing the parts together . The dependence on the bolts may be much lessened by indenting the parts together , as shown by the upper part of the annexed ( jgure ; or by putting keys in the joint , as shown by the lower side Fig. 56. /z/ i of the same figure ; but the strengthf the beam will be lessened in proportion to the depth of the indents . The only reasons for not depending wholly on bolts are , that thould the parts shrink ever so little , the bolts lose a great part of their effect ; and the smallness of the bolts renders them liable to press into the timber , and thus to suffer the joint to yield . The sum of the areas of the bolts should never be less than two tenths of the area of the section of the beam ; and it is not a good practice to put the bolts near to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams is that called scarfing , where the two pieces are joined so as to preserve the same breadth and depth throughout ; and wherever neatness is preferable to strength this method should be adopted . From Fig. 57 to Fig. 60 four methods of scarfing are shown . The first , Fig. 57 , is the most simple ; it depends wholly on the bolts , and in this and like , cases , it is best to put a continued plate /z/ tif iron dn teach side for the beads of the bolts , plates may be bent* and let into the beams . Fig. 57. mmea*m /z/ a s /z/ The ends of the 288 . The annexed figure is a joint &at; would do without bolts , but it is clear that the strength would not be quite so great as half Fig. 58. /z/ a the strength of an entire piece . The key or double wedges , at a , should only be driven so as to bring the parts to their proper bearing , as it would be better tcf omit it , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint . It is not necessary that there should be a key , except when bolts are to be added , and then it is desirable to bring the joints to a bearing before the bolts be put in . The addition of bolts and straps makes this an excellent scarf . 289 . The following figure is tl slight modification of the last described scarf , where the keys are supposed to be of hard wood ; Fig. 59. /z/ if of a curled grain* so much the better . In this form the scarf is easiei to execute , and equally as good as the last , when bolts are used . 290 . The next figure represents a scarf where the oblique joints* in the last examples are avoided , and ' the same degree of /z/ // strength is obtained ; at the same time it is very simple and easy to execute* Fig. 60. / /z/ * * u r i f* 291 . To determine the length of a scarf , in joining beams , it is necessary to know the force that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The researches upon this subject have already been laid before the reader in Chap . VIII , Part I. To apply them to our present object , let AB , in the succeeding figure . Fig. 61. /z/ c be part of a scarfed beam , strained in the direction of its length , and put together without bolts . Now it is plain that the strength of the part c b must be exactly equal to the force that would cause the fibres to slide at the dotted line c d 5 for if the part c d were shorter , the joint would be less strong than it is possible to make it . - Also , if the depth of the indent a c be too small , it would be crushed by the strain ; consequently , the parts must have a certain proportion , so that the joint may be equally strong in each part . 292 . In the first degrees of extension and compression the resistance is equal , therefore the depth of the indent a c must be equal to the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal ; and it is evident , that when there is. only one indent , as in this example , the depth a c should be one third the whole depth .. Also , let d be the depth of the beam , and m the number of indents : then - 3m sa the depth of each indent . Or the sum of the depth of the indents must be equal to one third of the depth of the beam . /q/ 293 . To determine the length of the part c d , we must know foe ratio between the force to resist sliding , and the direct cohesion of the material . Let the ratio be as 1 : n ; then c d must be equal to n times c b ; that is , in oak , ash , or elm , c. d must be equal to from 8 to 10 times c b . In fir , and other straight grained woods c d must be equal to from 16 to 20 times c b. 294 . Hence may be derived some maxims that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In oak , ash , or elm , the whole length of the scarf should be six times the depth or thickness of the beam when there are no bolts . ii . In fir the whole length of the scarf should be about twelve times the thickness of the beam , when there are no bolts iii . In oak , ash , or elm , the whole length of a scarf depending on bolts only , should be about three times the breadth of the beam ; and for fir beams it should be six times the breadth . iv . When both bolts and indents are combined , the whole length of the scarf for oak and hard woods may be twice the depth ; and that for fir , or soft woods , four times the depth . Of lengthening beams that are intended to resist cross strains* 295 . Beams to resist cross strains require to be lengthened more frequently than any others , and , from the nature of the strain , a different form must be adopted for the scarf from that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . There are cases where beams are exposed to both strains at the same time , but the cross strain is generally that of the most importance . Of this we have an example iu the tie beam of a roof , Where the strain in the direction of the length is very small compared with the cross strain . Let C D , Fig. 62 , represent a beam strained by a load at E , and supported at the ends . All the parts above the middle of the depth , b c , will be compressed , all below will be extended ; therefore , the square abutment a e is better for the upper side than any complicated joint whatever j and it is evident , that all oblique /z/ joints should be avoided on the compressed side . . in this figure the whole of the strength of the lower side depends on the holts and strap . Fig. 62 . C b 296 . The following figure shows another form , where the lower side is indented so as not to depend wholly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key is introduced to tighten the scarf . It will readily appear , that had the joint been cut to the dotted line instead of the oblique fine , the strength would have been much impaired . 297 . The annexed figure represents an atfgular view of a scarf , where it is jointed the contrary way . An iron plate at A B is supFig. /z/ tri a posed to be removed , which shows the tongue at the end of the scarf . This method appears to me to employ more of the strength of the timber than any other , and is very well adapted for a tie beam where it is strained both across and in the direction of its length . In all these cases the depth of the indents , and the length of the scarf , will be obtained by the same rules as for beams strained in the direction of their length . See Art . 292 to 294 . In scarfing beams to bear a cross strain it would be a great advantage to apply hoops or straps instead of bolts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be easy to form the scarf so that hoops might be driven on perfectly tight . There is no part of carpentry that requires greater correctness in workmanship than scarfing ; as all the indents should bear equally , otherwise the greater part of the strength will be lost . Hence we see how very unfit some of the complicated forms shown in the old works on carpentry were for the purpose . It is certainly very absurd to render the parts difficult to be fitted , when the whole of the strength depends on their fitting well . " But many , " says professor Robison , " seem to aim at making the beam stronger than if it were one piece ; and this inconsiderate project has given rise to many whimsical modes of tabling and scarfing. * " /z/ Of Building beams . 298 . The manner of building beams has already been considered in Art . 136 to 139 . It may not be . superfluous here to remark , that the position of the indents is not a matter of indifference . If two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ends 1 , the pressure of a weight applied in the middle would cause them to bend , and the touching surfaces would slide against one another ; the upper piece sliding towards each end upon the lower one . This sliding is effectually prevented by indenting the surfaces , as shown in figure 65 , when the pieces are bolted Fig. 65 . Fig. 66. * Art , Carpentry y supplement to the Enc Brit , // together ; but if the same indents be reversed , as in Fig. 66 they produce scarcely any effect , and nearly the whole strain is upon the bolts . Wherever the principal strain on the beam may happen to be , to that point , as at C , Fig. 65 , the indents should direct their square abutments ; that is , towards the straining force . When the beam is uniformly loaded , the greatest strain is at the middle . 1 have often seen , in drawings , all the indents put the same way , and sometimes as in Fig. 66 ; otherwise the preceding remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of the indents be too small in a built beam , they will not be capable of resisting the pressure ; and if they be made too deep , the number of fibres will be diminished , and consequently the strength of the beam ; therefore there is a depth for the indents , by which a maximum of strength will be gained . Duhamel undertook to ascertain the proper depth by experiments* ; and the general rule I have given in Art . 138 , agrees extremely near with the case he tried* Of lengthening beams that are intended to resist compressing forces . 299 . When a post or strut is required to be longer than timber can be procured , as sometimes may occur in the construction of wooden towers , spires , wpoden bridges , or centres , the same form of joint or scarf is applicable as when the piece is pulled in the direction of its length , with this difference , that there must not be any inclined or oblique parts in the scarf . Figs : 57 , 58 , 59 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for posts or ties , only it would be better to tongue the ends , as in Fig. 64 . In Fig. 55 a piece on each of the four sides would be necessary , without some other mode of strengthening it should form a part of the framing to which is to be applied . It is not a very neat method of piecing a strut , but it is one that is very convenient , espe- Transport des Bois , p. 498 . It /z/ /q/ /z/ eially in temporary structures , such as centres , where it may generally be braced in one direction , and where a more laboured form of joining would be much out of place . $5 . Of joints for framing . 300 . Of joints for bearing purposes* The joint of a binding joist into a girder is an example of this kind ef joint . The greatest strains upon the fibres of a girder are at the upper and lower surfaces , and the strain gradually decreases towards the middle of the depth , where it becomes insensible ; hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the depth . The upper side being compressed , it is imagined by some writers , that the tenon might be made to fill so tightly that the strength of the girder would not be impaired by it , but this is a mistake ; for any one who knows any thing of the practice of carpentry knows that it can not be done in an effectual manner : besides , the shrinkage of the joist would soon render it loose , however tightly it might be fitted in the first instance . Considering then that the best place for a mortise in a girder , or other beam in a like position , is at the middle of its depth , the next point is to consider the best place and form for the tenon . If the tenon be near the lower side , it will evidently have the advantage of employing most of the strength of the joist ; but this on account of the strength of the girder can not be adopted ; therefore , the form in general use , represented in Fig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . The tenon being one sixth of the depth , and placed at one third the depth from the lower side . 301 . Binding joists , or any other beams in a like position , should never be made with , double tenons ; for , as Mr. Price has judiciously remarked , it weakens the timber framed into , and both tenons seldom bear alike ; besides , in pinning it rarely happens that there is'a draft on both tenons , unless the pin be as tough as wire. * /z/ All horizontal timbers for bearing purposes should be notcned upon the supports rather than framed between , Wherever it can be done , as much additional strength is gained by preserving timbers in continued lengths . The same observation applies to inclined timbers , such as common rafters . See Art 83. 302 . Of the joints of framing . The object td be obtained by a system of framing is to reduce all the pressures into the directions of the lengths of the pieces composing the frame ; therefore the form of the joint should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pieces . As when the direction of the strain does not coincide with the axis of the piece strained , the strain will be much increased . Now , from the form of the joints commonly employed , it must generally happen , that by skrinkage , or settlement , the joints will bear only upon the angular points of the joint ; which not only gives a considerable leverage to the straining force , but also , by the whole bearing being upon an angle , that angular point must be either indented or crippled by the strain , which of course causes a further settlement . The extent of the evil of partial bearings becomes very manifest when the strains are considerable . In the centres of the Bridge of Nuilly seven ot eight pieces in each frame were split from end to end , and many others bent considerably ; and in these centres the joints were not very oblique , otherwise the effects would have been more serious* Perronet was sensible of the cause , and in order to correct it , he formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the other extremity of the piece was the centre . This method was adopted for the joints of the centre for the Bridge of Sainte Maxence , and also in that for the Bridge de la Concorde , at Paris ; and it was effectual in preventing the splitting and bending of the pieces . Circular abutments have been strongly recommended by Prof. Robison , and they certainly might be employed with much advantage . The principle is similar to the well known contrivance called the ball and socket ; and to the joints of animalj , where with considerable latitude of motion , uniformity of pressure is preserved . That they require more labour , I am well aware but were the labour doubled , it would be comparatively a trifling object in JrifeJ /q/ in framing of importance ; and for any other purpose it is not recommended . It is obvious , that when the one end of the piece moves* a cor* responding movement will take place at the joint , and when the radius of curvature at the joint is small , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint will be scarcely perceptible . For in a roof of a 30 feet span a sinking of six inches in the middle would not cause the joints to slide more than one tenth of an inch . I will now proceed to notice some of the joints of most common occurrence , and point out the advantages to be obtained by altering the forms of them . When one piece is perpendicular to another , as , for example , a post upon a sill , the most usual , as well as the most easy method , is to make the joint square , with a short tenon of about one fourth of the thickness of the framing , to retain it in its place . But if the joint be not very accurately cut , the . whole load will bear upon the projecting parts ; consequently , the centre of pressure will seldom coincide with the axis of the post , and its power to resist the pressure will be much lessened . If , instead of cutting the joint square , it were cut to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a very little care in cutting the joint would make the centre of pressure coincide with the axis . Fig. 67. /z/ 303- Now whether the joint be square or angular , a slight inclination from the perpendicular will throw the pressure upon one corner ; but if the joint be described from a centre situate in the axis , and with a radius not much greater than half the breadth of the post , as is shown in the following figure , then , with any change /z/ of position , the joint will slide till the pressure be uniform upoa the joint ; and if the joint be moderately well made , the pressure will not act with any sensible leverage upon the post . Fig. 68 , 304 . When the pieces to be joined are not at right angles to one another , the joints may be of two kinds ; the principal rafter of a roof affords an example of each . Before proceeding to show the nature of these joints , it is necessary to state , that the direction of the strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles laid down in Chap . 1 , Part II , remain sensibly the same , whatever may be the form of the abutting joints , except in as far as the form of the joint alters the point of bearing ; which may in some cases cause the pressure to act with a leverage nearly equal to half the depth of the beam . The strength of the joint itself depends upon its form , as it may be so made that there will be a tendency to slide , which it would be well to avoid , without having recourse to straps* The resistance at the joint is always most effectual when the abutment is perpendicular to the strain , but where the angle formed by the inner sides of the pieces is very acute , this kind of abutment can not be obtained , at least not without wounding the tie too much . Let ABC , Fig. 69 , be the joint of a principal rafter upon the tie beam ; where the dotted line A B shows the direction of the straining force , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a c perpendicular to B a ; then , by the principles of the resolution of forces , c a will represent the force pressing on the inclined part , B a , of the joint 5 and there will be a force represented by B a to be sustained by the abutment B d . And , as this abutment will resist JX- v. /z/ the force most effectually when it is perpendicular to . it , therefore B d should always be perpendicular to B a ; the same will be true in whatever direction the straining force acts . Fig. 69. x The foregoing figure shows one of the most common joints ; B a and B d are the abutting surfaces , which are to be perpendicular to each other ; and b e shows the tenon , the thickness of which may be about one fifth of that of the framing . * This joint might always take better hold of the tie beam than it is generally made to do , without any risk of weakening it . In general B d should somewhat exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be left a little open at a , in order that it may not be thrown off at B by the settling of the roof . 305 . The following figure is a form that is approved by some writers , but by others it is considered inferior to the one already Fig. 70. described . The dotted line shows the form of the tenon ; but it would be better put together in the same manner as the joint to be described in the next article . 306 . Fig. 71 is a very good form for a joint , as b c is perpendicular to the strain , consideripg the strain to be in the direction of the rafter , which is near enough to the truth for our present purpose . The best method of forming this joint is shown by the pro- /z/ 17t /z/ jecled sketches A and B ; as by this method it is easy to see when they are accurately fitted ; whereas in a mortise and tenon joint this oannot be done , and they are often very imperfectly fitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71. /z/ " k. r* /z/ 307 . Fig. 72 shows a joint with a curved abutment ; the line B A represents the direction of the strain ; and c the centre , which should be in this line . The radius for describing the joint should be greater than half the depth of the rafter ; and the part between a and b , of the joint , should be left open , to admit of any degree of settlement that may take place . The projected sketches C and D show the planner of forming the joint . /z/ p Fig. 72. * ' " t Sometimes double abutments are used in joints , but it requires both great accuracy in workmanship , and also that the roof should not settle more or . less than the workman allows for , in order to make both abutments bear equally ; therefore I consider one good abutment preferable to two . Prof. Robison very justly remarks , that " because great logs are moved with difficulty , it is very troublesome to try the joints frequently to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interior parts . This should make us prefer those joints whose efficacy depends chiefly on the visible joint . " But to make double abutments still further increases the difficulty , without adding any thing to the security of the joint . 308 . The joint at the upper end of a principal rafter differs from that at the lower end in some respects ; but the difference is not material in respect to the principle of forming the joint . Making the king post larger at the head enables us to get a more effectual abutment : and this abutment should be , in common joints , square to the back of the rafter , as at A , in Fig. 73 , with a short tenon shown by the dotted lines . When the head of the post is /z/ not sufficiently large to get the abutment square to the back of the rafter , it is usual to cut it as at B. In either case the oint should be left a little open at a ; so that when the roof settles it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the roof settles , unless it be provided for the change , the whole bearing will be on the upper angles of the joints , as at a , and these sharp angles will indent into the king post , or become bruised in proportion to the degree of settling , and of course increase it . And as all roofs will settle more or less , the carpenter will see how important it is to make the joints bear on the opposite corner when first fitted . To remedy this defect , I would propose to make the joint in the form of a circular arc , in order that the pressure on every part may be equal , whatever degree of settling may take place . A joint of this kind is shown below , by Fig. 75 . Fig. 73 . The same remarks will apply to all similar joints ; such , for example , are the joints between the braces or struts and king post at C and P in the preceding figure . /z/ But the joints D and B would be better formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 , where a b is at right aqgles to b c . The reason for this form is given in a preceding article . ( Art . 306 . ) The joints may be made as shown by the projected sketches E " ftnd x Fig. 74. 309 . A joint with a curved abutment is shown in the following figure ; B C represents the middle of the depth of the rafter , and c the centre from which the curve is described ; the radius Cc should not be less than half the depth of the beam . A and D are projected sketches of the joint . In Fig. 75 , E shows a joint for the straining beam of a roof , and G is a projected sketch of the joint . #@# As a furthei* security , the /z/ Fig. 75. piece F might be nailed upon the queen post C. The lower part of the figure shows the joint for struts or braces . 310 . Instead of the common method of framing the king or queen posts between the ends of rafters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters abut against one another , end to end ; and to notch a piece on each side and bolt through these pieces . I have called these pieces suspending pieces , because they serve to Fig. 76. n ft /z/ l/v m &#9632; &#9632; /z/ JOINTS AND STRAPfc , /z/ suspend the tie beam . ( The term post is ridiculous , because it conveys a false notion of the office of the piece ; but it is difficult to change a term in common use . ) Fig ; .76 and 77 show this Fig. 77. /z/ i i i i &#9632; i i i . / ...

It has been long in use for centres , bridges , and roofs , as may be seen in the plates of the bridge at Schaffhausen , the bridge of tlitter , near Berne , the roof of the Riding House at Moscow ; and in some very good roofs lately executed in this country . The German carpenters , and , I believe , many others , put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to equalize the pressure . This method is not , however , so useful in timber work as it is in stone work ; and I would , for the joints of carpentry , give the preference to putting a plate of cast iron between the abutting surfaces . /z/ Of joints for tits and braces* /z/ 31 1 . There is no part of carpentry where defective joints are attended with such serious inconveniences as the joints of ties , nor are there any other joints so often ill constructed . It is not easy to make a good tie joint , from the very nature of timber , and therefore many ties should not be used where it is possible to avoid them I have before stated , that " dovetail joints should never be used in carpentry " ( Art . 284 ) ; and the maxim can not be too strongly urged , wherever the joint is intended to hold the parts together . For let A , in the following figure , represent the angle of a building , where the wall plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a b being the cressway of the wood , will shrink in drying ; and as the other piece is the lengthway , its shrinking will be insensible ; theiefore a very small degree of shrinkage will allow the joint to draw considerably , as is shown by the dotted lines . A joint made as shown in the annexed figure , avoids any danger of giving way from the shrinking of the timber , and is better than any dovetail joint whatever . Fig. 79. /z/ m Dovetail joints , or dovetail tenons , have been used in various parts of carpentry such as the collar beams of small roofs , the /z/ lower end of king and queen posts , and for joining plates and the like . In all these cases they are the worst kind of joints that can be used . The carpenter 's boast must also be classed as a dovetail joint equally as defective as any . 312 . The following figure shows a method of notching a collar beam , C , into the side of a rafter , R , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stout pin , of tough but straight grained oak , is an excellent addition to a tie joint , and is more economical than iron bolts . The excellence of wooden pins is fully shown by their extensive use in ship carpentry , as they form the chief connexion of ship timbers . 313 . The best method of cocking or cogging the tie beam upon the wall plate , is shown by Fig. 81 . Fig. 81. /z/ Of Straps . 314 . " A skilful carpenter , " says Prof. Robison , " never employs many straps , considering them as auxiliaries foreign to his art ; " and indeed they are seldom necessarj , except to suspend the /z/ tie beam to the king post and to secure the feet of the principal rafters to the tie beam of a roof* Strap for king or queen post* In Fifr 73 s shows a strap for suspending the tie beam to a king or queen post its bold of tjfce post may be improved by turning the ends , as at d d , in the section ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bolte , give the strap a firm hold ; or staples , as in Fig* 74 , may be used for a , slight roof . The strengths of straps for different beatings are stated below . When the longest unsupported part of the beam is 10 feet , the strap may be 1 inch wide by 3 sixteenths of an inch . 15 1.5 1 fourth 20 2 1 fourth . These dimensions are quite sufficient for common purposes ; but where the machinery of a theatre , or other heavy loads , are to be borne by the tie beams , the straps must be made stronger in proportion to the load . Where suspending pieces are used instead of queen posts , the same kind of strap will apply , as is shown in Fig. 77. 315 . Strap at the foot of a principal rafter* A strap at the foot of a principal rafter is intended , to form an abutment for it , in case the end of the tie beam should fail . If the strap be put too upright , it will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof settles ; and as it is intended to prevent the rafter foot sliding along the tie beam , an oblique position , as shown by Fig. 70 and the one annexed , will be the moat effectual . Straps Fig. 82. of the same size as are used for the king post will be Sufficient . In bolting on straps they ought to be drawn tight ; Mr. Price recom- r w /z/ ( roads square bolts for this purpose ; he says , " for this reason , if you use a round bolt it must follow the augur , and can not be helped ; but by helping the augur hole , that is , by taking of the corners of the wood , you may draw a strap exceedingly close , and at the same time it embraces the grain of the wood in a much firmer manner than a round pin . " Sometimes a bolt is used put through square from the back of the rafter , with cross plates at the head and nut* Fig. 69 shows this method , the dotted lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thin plates of iron decay very rapidly , particularly in damp situations ; therefore they should be well secured against rust by being painted as soon as they are made . Mr. Smeaton , writing on this subject , says , u I had observed , that when iron once gets rust , so far as to form a scale , whatever coat of paint or varnish is put over this , the rust will go on progressively under the paint . " The method he used to pre- ; vent iron rusting was to heat the whole of the iron work to about a blue heat , and immediately strike it over the surface with raw seed oil ; the next day , if properly done , it appears as if a coat of varnish had been laid on . By this method the pores of the iron become filled , and effectually protected from corrosion . Another method , that is easily applied to small articles , consists in heating the metal , and rubbing it over , while hot , with wax . By this process the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fastenings might be rendered much more lasting by boiling them in linseed oil . This is often practised by slaters , to protect their nails from rust . As it is difficult to heat large articles , a coating that can be applied in a cold state is much better . One that dries quickly , and , it is said , perfectly preserves from rust the metals upon which it is laid , is described in the Repertory of Arts , Vol. 27 of the second series . It is prepared as follows : Grind to an impalpable powder one part ( by weight ) of black lead ( plumbago ) , with which mix four parts of sulphate of lead , and one part of sulphate of zinc ; to this mixture add , by degrees , sixteen parts of boiled linseed oil . ' " * /z/ As strapping is often applied to prevent accidents , and to connect the parts when the timber itself is likely to decay , it is obvious that the iron work should be rendered as durable as possible , and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more stress upon this point , because it is often neglected , and is of importance .
