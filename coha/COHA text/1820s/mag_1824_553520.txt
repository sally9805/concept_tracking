txt ART . XIV. - Au . *1bstract of a New Theory of the Formation , of the Earth . By IRA HILL , A. M. Baltimore , 1823. pp. 211 . FRoM the days of Sanchoniathon down to the present time , ingenious men have been much given to the amusement of world-making ; and the number of those , who have found pleasure in this occupation , seems not to have been lessened by the increasing light of science and philosophy . The discovery of new truths has rather multiplied than diminished rihe difficulties of these undertakings , and served only to bring more courageous champions into the field , by heightening the glory of triumph ; as the renowned knight of La . Mancha was stimulated to untried exploits in proportion to the hazard and uncertainty , which seemed to await his *dventures . No task could be imagined more easy at first , than that of c*onstructing a globe like our earth ; it was reduced to a sort * mathematical problem ,  --  ' matter and motion being given , rto make a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it yielded with the utmost readiness to the plastic mathematics of the wonder working cosmogonist . Worlds sprang up around him at his bidding , and he had only to sit in tranquil admiration of the workmanship of his hands . Among the moderns , Descartes has been the most successful in solving problems of this description . By his Wild rule Of whirling vortices and circling spheres , ' he constructed the earth , the planets , the sun , and the heavens ; and after such prodigies of execution , where is the // wonder , that he should affirm it to be within the compass of his power , having a quantity of matter and motion to produce an animal ? ' It is true , the worthy Dr Keill 's indignation was kindled at the boldness of the philosopher , and he gravely pronounces this an insuperable problem , ' and warmly demands , with what confidence he could pretend to solve so intricate a problem , who blundered so much in the easiest and most abstracted things in nature ? ' With how little reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerate judge . The early cosmogonists did not confine their labors to the earth , but embraced the sun , moon , stars , and the universe . The astronomer , Xenophanes , took the stars to he patches of clouds , which were lighted up at night , and extinguished in the morning . As for suns and moons , he said , they were numerous , and that different climates of the earth were accommodated with distinct sets . The great Anaxagoras , the preceptor of Socrates and Pericles , was among the noted astronomers and cosmogonists of his time . According to him , the firmament is an arch of stone , the sun an inflammable body about as large as the ancient Peloponnesus , and the stars are stones whirled up from the surface of the earth by the swiftness of the circumarnbient air , which set them on fire , and gave them a circular motion . Diogenes was not satisfied with these theories . He declared the stars to he hot pumice stones , originally fixed in the sphere of the heavens , and serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed as breathing holes of the world . Other philosophers affirmed , that the sun was globular and hollow , containing fire within , which produced light by streaming out through n cavity on one side . When this cavity was stopped , the sun was eclipsed . Aristotle believed the universe , sun , moon , stars , the earth , man , animals , plants , and all things else to be eternal , having always existed in the same general forms as at present . The business of world-making , therefore , he deemed a gratuitous work , and unworthy of a philosopher . Burnet has a long chapter to confute this notion of Aristotle , that the world is eternal , and to prove the science of cosmogony not to be of such trifling moment , as the Stagyrite would have it . But he was too much interested in the subject to be an in&gt; // partial reasoner , as will be seen hereafter . In Plato 's system , ideas and forms only existed from eternity , and the world and all substantial things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many are the deep speculations scattered through the ancients concerning the origin of things , the soul of the world , and the mundane egg . One sect believed the Deity himself to be the universe , and as late as the thirteenth century the body of poor Amalric was dug up and burned , on suspicion of his having abetted this tenet in his lifetime . The Persians had their Oromades and Arimanius , a good and evil principle , engaged in perpetual contention , till Mithras calmed their rage , and set them at work in forming a world . The Egyptians , Hindoos , and Chinese have not been deficient in schemes and theories of cosmogony . The Epicurean plan , which has made much noise in the world , and seems to have been for some time a sort of thriving heresy among the ancients , received its first elements from the genius and labors of Leucippus . This philosopher invented the doctrine of atoms , or original particles of matter , indivisible and indissoluble , out of which the earth and all terrestrial things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in moulding these materials into a system , for when Democritus imbibed the sentiments of Leucippus , he found the entire mass of his predecessor 's particles in a state of unutterable confusion , and desperate warfare . To open light into this abyss of contending atoms , and give rule to their wild disorder , Democritus perceived it necessary to impose wholesome restrictions and definite laws . He laid it down as an axiom , that the *p&amp;na *tsys ! h7 , first magnitudes , as he called them , were eternal ; and , also , that from eterniLy all these particles had possessed a uniform motion , each in the same direction , and with the same velocity . Thus prepared , he commenced the great work of constructing a world ; but how far he actually proceeded , or whether his accustomed employment , of laughing at the follies and vanity of mankind , allowed him leisure to prosecute his task with suitable diligence , we have no means of being informed . The merit of completing the structure belonged to Epicuins , a philosopher renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness of manners , although man ) // of his followers added little credit either in principles or conduct to the name of their master . He contrived to bridle the roaming atoms , and subdue them to his pleasure . A remarkable oversight was detected in the axiom of Democritus , which ascribed an equable motion to the atoms , and sent them forward in parallel right lines . Thus situated , they must move forever without coming in contact . This was a fatal blow to the whole system , as neither a world , nor any part of a world , could rise into existence , except by a concussion and coalescence of these primeval atoms . The fertile mind of Epicurus easily overcame this apparent obstacle . He found out , that , notwithstanding the particles moved in right lines , yet these lines were not parallel ; and however small the angle in which two or more particles were moving toward each other , they must at last meet . Here the concourse began ; two united particles soon met with a third , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms of harmony appeared in any part ; millions of combinations were gone through ; the war was furious and dreadful ; the imagination has no power to conceive the number of objects , the variety of forms , which arose and perished in the strife of these chaotic elements . But the time came when one particle after another found its appropriate place , its sympathizing particle , and then began to appear things in regular shapes and consistency . These atoms were of all forms ; some were round , others cubical , triangular , hooked , cellular . The hooks clenched themselves into the cells , and in this close contact formed hard substances , rocks , precious stones , and metals . Atoms of irregular forms combined into substances of different densities , as clay , earth , soil ; and last of all came the globular atoms , which constitute water and other fluids , and can only be kept on the earth by resting in cavities . Thus the globe , trees , plants , animals , and all terrestrial things were brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atoms maintain a harmonious union , which the ordinary force of infringing atoms can not dissolve . Such was the contrivance by which Leucippus , DemocriIns , and Epicurus , made the world , or rather their discovery of the manner in which the world made itself . Cudworth . TVeu ' Series , No. 18. 35 // writes learnedly to prove , that Leucippus deserves not the honor of the original discovery , and would fain tear the laurel from his head , where it has flourished so long , and place it on the brow of Pythagoras , or some earlier sage . We are not convinced by the arguments of Cudworth , but in so grave a matter we would not decide with precipitancy , reserving to ourselves the right of further inquiry and consideration . A system like this of Epicurus , a system of atheism and absurdity , however ingenious and highly wrought , could hardly have survived its author , had it not been embraced by a few of the loftiest minds of antiquity , and immortalized by the powerful , the brilliant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary man , entitled De Rerum . JV'atura , is a methodical exposition and defence of the atomical physiology , and more strikingly combines the richness of a poetical fancy with the deep thought of philosophy , a universal knowledge , refinement of taste , and polished elegance of language , than any other similar composition ancient or modern . As it runs through the whole domain of nature , and seeks the causes of all things , physical and moral , its topics are innumerable ; many of them dry and crabbed , it is true , and such as no magic of fancy nor skill in poetry could adorn ; but where the subject will admit , almost every line discovers a master 's hand , and every period breathes the spirit and glows with the imagery of poetical inspiration . The opening of the several hooks , and the episodes , are particularly beautiful . The poet talks wisely on the origin of government and the arts , on the ' principles of politics and morals ; and foolishly enough on physics , because his axioms are false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact ; the wonder is , that with so much folly at bottom , he could rear an edifice so magnificent and imposing . He never labors for a reason , and the facility with which he accounts for every phenomenon in nature , without deviating from hi* first principles , proves the astonishing reach of his ingenuity , and the resources of his marvellous intellect . In the judgment of Dryden he was closely copied by Virgil , especially in the Georgics . Dryden characterizes him as a sublime and daring genius , whose thoughts are mascu* // line , and full of argumentation , ' and from whose warmth and energy proceed the loftiness of his expressions , and the perpetual torrent of his verse , where the barrenness of his subject does not too much constrain the quickness of his fancy . ' Julius Scaliger calls him an incomparable poet , incomparabilis poeta . He affected the old dialect , and although the variety , thus attained , adds to the copiousness of his language , and sometimes to the sweetness of his expressions , yet it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear accustomed to the more modern and regular phraseology of Virgil , Horace , and Ovid . But good judgus have been unanimous in extolling the uncommon elegance of his latinity . In this respect Casaubon places him above all the Latin writers . Lucretius latinitatis author optimus . By the premature death of the poet , his work was deprived or his last touches , and this may account for the occasional dark spots in the beautiful polish , which he has communicated to the body of his style . Cicero was the editor and publisher of this postbumous poem . If the voice of antiquity is to be heeded , and the critics trusted , the illustrious editor was not highly gifted with the qualities most requisite for the task he undertook ; and it is reasonable to suppose , that defects escaped his notice , which the author 's revising hand would have removed . Notwithstanding the singular notion of Anaxagoras , mentioned above , respecting the nature of the sun and stars , this philosopher was the first to lay the foundation of a rational system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of an iutellig*nt mind , or a being , who had knowledge and power to govern and arrange them according to his xviii . Had this great truth been rigidly adhered to , the immense absurdities , which bewildered the minds of later philosophers on this subject , would have been avoided . It has been said , and probably with truth , that some of the ancients borrowed their notions of the creation from the book of Genesis . Juvenal testifies , that the writings of Moses were known to the Romans , and proof is not wanting , that the same knowledge was common to the Greeks . It can not be doubted , that Ovid 's description of the creation , in the first book of the Metamorphoses , was copied from the Bible . Tbe facts , and frequently the language , correspond with the narrative of the Jewish lawgiver. // Ante mare et tellus , et , quod tegit omnia , coelum , Unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe , Quem dixere Chaos , rudis indigestaque moles ; Nec quicquam , nisi pondus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important features , resembles the Mosaic account not less closely than these opening lines . The poet yields to his fancy , and , for his machinery and embellishments , draws on the mythology of the times ; but his cosmogony , his account of the early wickedness of mankind , his deluge , his Deucalion and Pyrrha , are all derived from the first chapters of Genesis . During a long lapse of centuries , from the time of Ovid , little seems to have been done in contriving any better mode of world-making , than the ancient sages had employed , or in attempting to penetrate more deeply into the mysteries of creation , than is warranted by the revealed truths of Scripture . After a wide blank of ages , Descartes came forward as the inventor of a new system of cosmogony . To his exploits we have already alluded . Next to Descartes may be ranked Dr Burnet , as well in the wildness of his theory , as in the **xtravagance of his conceptions , and the native fertility of his imagination . No modern world-maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated it more gorgeously . In the extent of his aims he falls behind the contriver of the vortices , for he looks no farther than the origin and revolutions of the terrestrial ball ; whereas , Descartes grasps in the theory of his whirlpools the systems of all worlds , and puts in motion the wheels and springs , of universal nature . In imitation of his predecessors , Dr Burnet begins with the elements of chaos , which he fashions without difficulty to his liking . We will not follow him through his processes of creation , but take the world as it rose in primitive freshness from his hands , and hint only at the disastrous revolution by which , in consequence of its peculiar conformation , it was doomed to be convulsed and disfigured . This globe of earth , he informs us , was at first round and smooth , not deformed by frowning , craggy mountains , nor marred with such unseemly bays and oceans , as now rest on its surface . Rivers there were , but not like modern rivers , hurrying along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids ; they moved with tranquil dignity to an expanse of glassy waters , whose // repose no angry tempest invaded . Neptune was a powerless monarch then , nor had A*olus strength to raise his slumbering storms and winds . The elements were friends to one another and to man , and had not learnt to wage the devouring wars , to which they have since been so much addicted . Then were the happy days of which poets sing , the golden age , the perennial spring Ver erat aeternum , placidique tepentibus auris Mulcebant zephyri natos sine semine flores . The fruits of the earth came forth in spontaneous abun*. dance , man lived without labor , the plains and the hills were always green and fragrant , made fertile by the moisture of dews and the beams of the sun , the heavens were bright , and the season without change . Such was the world before the delude , and it is one of the chief labors of bishop Burnet to explain the causes , by which it has been reduced to its present condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavier and harder parts settle to the centre ; around the globe thus conglomerated he spreads a layer of water ; and above this comes a solid crust , which constitutes the surface of the habitable earth . As this surface was never overshadowed by clouds , nor cooled by rains , it was exposed perpetually to the scorching heat of the sun . Cracks began to appear , which grew broader and deeper , till at length they penetrated to the layer of water , and this outer covering fell with tumultuous uproar into the nether abyss ; the waters gushed out , and the general deluge ensued . Mountains reared their sightless heads in one part , immense caverns yawned in another to receive the outpoured oceans from the central regions , vapors ascended , clouds gathered , rivers foamed over precipices , and the beautiful temple of the world was converted into a ruin . Mortals , whose lot has been cast in these degenerate times , can form but a feeble conception of the primitive earth ; such only as we have of the splendor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contemplating its fallen columns , its decaying monuments , and buried edifices . But the catastrophe , bewailed more than any other by Dr Burnet , was the terrible shock , which the earth suffered in being wrenched from its original posture in regard to the sun . He says , when the earth escaped so narrowly from being // shipwrecked in the great deluge , it was so broken and disordered , that it lost its equal poise , and thereupon the centre of its gravity changing , one pole became more inclined towards the sun , and the other more removed from it , and so its right and parallel situation , which it had before to the axis of the ecliptic , was changed into an oblique , in which skew posture it hath stood ever since , and is likely so to do for some ages to come . ' How many ages , the ingenious author does not predict . He seems wholly absorbed with the calamity itself , which has caused the changes of the seasons , the extremes of winter and summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the furious conflicts of the elements ; and so great is his horror at these things , that he assures us , if Archimedes could have found a place to fix his lever , he should wish him to have been employed in no higher ehterprise , than that of prying back the earth to its original posi. tion , thus restoring to us the comfort of a perpetual spring , which we have lost by its dislocation ever since the deluge . ' After having described the formation of the earth , its past changes ,  --  and present disorders , the author concludes his theory by a methodical account of its final dissolution ; and although his work defies the majesty of science , and boasts little of the wisdom of philosophy , it claims an honorable rank among the trophies of fancy . Whiston made a New Theory of the earth , resembling in some of its features the one just noticed . It was his opinion , that a comet was cooled by a long voyage beyond the orbit of saturn , its atmosphere condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet , constituted the chaos mentioned in the Scriptures . The eccentric orbit was changed to one of a more circular form . The nucleus of the comet was converted into a central solid , and around this was the abyss of waters made by the condensation of the comet 's tail . The whole was enveloped in an exterior covering , which the ingenious theorist , being a mathematician , cal .. culated to be two hundred miles thick . This envelopement was dry and habitable , and the affairs of the world went on quietly and prosperously , till , in an evil hour , the earth ran into the tail of a comet , which was suddenly condensed to rain , and poured so heavy a burden on the surface , as to break the outer shell , force the waters from beneath , and produce a // universal deluge . When the earth was happily rescued from this perilous adventure in the comet 's tail , the rain ceased , and the waters fled for refuge , some into the beds of oceans , seas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have ever since been confined . Many other theories might be enumerated . Leibnitz , the rival of Newton , believed the earth to be an extinguished sun , on the surface of which , as it gradually cooled , vapors were condensed into water . The notion of Buffon was much the same , except that he believed the earth and other planets to be only fragments of the sun , splintered from its surface by the concussion of a comet , which had unwittingly broken loose from its orbit , and hurried to its destruction in the consuming embrace of the king of fires . Kepler thought the earth a living animal , sustained by a regular circulation of internal fluids , and winging its way through the heavens by its own vital energy . According to Demaillet , says M. Cuvier , the globe was covered with water for many thousand years . He supposed that this water had gradually retired ; that all the terrestrial animals were originally inhabitants of the sea ; that man himself began his career as a fish ; and he asserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet with fishes in the ocean , which are still only half men , but whose descendants will in time become perfect human beings . ' Thus , in following the chain of theories , we might go on from step to step , till we should find ourselves swallowed up and lost in the deep gulf of the controversy , which has raged with so much heat between the modern Neptunians and Vulcanians . But we design not to push our inquiries so far . Our purpose is answered , if it has been made to appear , as we trust it has , that precedents are sufficiently numerous and respectable to rescue any person from the charge of a misuse of time or talents , in devising new theories of the earth ; and especially ought the ambition , which prompts to such an enterprise , to be considered praiseworthy and highminded , after so many champions have retired discomfited from the field . We have the satisfaction to feel , therefore , that we have discharged our duty towards the author of the new theory before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no apology is necessary on his part for giving himself up to these pursuits , and that he is borne out by examples , which // he may well be proud to imitate , in claiming his theory as an original one . ' Should any reader doubt the accuracy of this statement , we beg he will again look over what we have written . Some , perhaps , may have the fastidiousness to say , that the very name of theory carries with it an air of suspicion , and that , in the important matter of world-making , it is better to have one plain fact , than a thousand theories , which can be little more , after all , than so many hypotheses , conjectures , or speculations . Others may fancy themselves wise in discovering few indications of a sound understanding , or rational science , in the theories we have sketched , and be ready to lament with Juvenal , that common sense is so rare a quality among the inhabitants of the earth , and to declare , that , if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of truth and wisdom , than the courageous attempt of Democritus Junior to prove the whole world insane . Such impertinent objections as these , we shall not stop to answer , but proceed without delay to the author 's new theory . As far as we can judge , he is a decided Vulcanian , although much less inveterate in his enmity to water , than some other disciples of this school . In his analysis of chaos , the element of water holds a conspicuous place . In fact , the body of chaos itself seems to have been of a fluid , pulpy consistency , and the author affirms , that when the earth was first shaped into a sphere , there were no rocks nor stones in the whole confused mass , ' so well is he versed in the scenes , Where eldest Night And Chaos , ancestors of Nature , hold Eternal anarchy , amidst the noise Of endless wars . ' Notwithstanding the acknowledged abundance of water in the wild dominions of Chaos , our theorist 's favorite element is fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . At first , it would seem , the fire was latent , and without heat , and the author explains the manner in which this important property was elicited . When the world was fashioned , ' he says , the concussion of particles of matter in consolidating would produce heat . ' The greater the uproar , therefore , the more violent the heat , and the sooner the // work would be accomplished . By some accident , the chaotic elements did not resolve themselves into a regular and well constituted mass ; volumes of fire were pent up within impenetrable barriers of earth and stone , where they increased in fury and strength , till they burst from their confinement with terrible explosions and devastation . Immense rocks were torn from their roots in the nether recesses of the earth , and thrown up to be mountains on its surface . Frightful caverns opened their dark vaults to receive the waters , and make new oceans . In this way , all the dry land has been raised above the face of the deep ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are indebted for continents* islands , seas , lakes , rivers , mountains , hills , vallies , and every variety of conformation , which renders the globe a fit dwelling place for man . This will suffice for an outline of the author 's new theory . In a case so obvious , we deem it unnecessary to enter more fully into its general merits ; but we should do injustice both.to the theorist , and to such of our readers as may not have been favored with a perusal of his works , were we to pass over in silence his account of the time and manner in which our continent came into being . All those parts of this western hemisphere , through which run the ridges of the Andes , the Stony Mountains , and the Alleganies , were raised at the time of the general deluge , and were the cause of that catastrophe . The masses of rocks , which form these mountains , were thrust up by one tremendous explosion of the central fire , and the superinchmbent waters , thus driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overspread the old world , and destroyed the inhabitants , as recorded in the Scriptures . The north east part of America had a much later origin , although the author forbears to mention the precise period when this event took place . He dwells chiefly on its effects . The regions of Greenland and Labrador arose at once ; a current was forced to the south west , which , after scooping out the excavation now called the Bay of Funday , swept with awful grandeur ' over the New England States . Nova Scotia rested on strata not to be shaken . ' Long island was produced by the junction of this torrent with the ocean . And now ensued a fray , worthy to be recorded in all vera* // cious history , and to stand in high places among the annals of departed ages . We give the description in the author 's own inimitable language . The current of the ocean overspread all the low lands of the Atlantic states , and was enjoying uninterrupted dominion where our largest cities , delightful plantations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its imperial authority was attacked . The waters , which had been confined beyond the mountains , as if ambitious of a nobler sway , now burst the bounds that had confined them , and with an irresistible impetuosity rushed to attack the ocean , which had extended beyond his natural domains , and presumed to assault the mountains . The majestic Hudson , elated by the conquest of the firm barriers that confined him , armed with the soil and fragments of the mountains he had conquered , in awful grandeur overspreading the country , dared dispute the power of the ocean . Accelerated by the numerous auxiliaries from the mountains , and strengthened by arming himself with every rock that opposed his passage , the ocean himself retired at his approach . But from the attack of the powerful Hudson , who moved from the mountains of freedom , the tyrant ocean would have held his dominion over the most luxuriant parts of the middle and southern states . He would have extended Long Island to the highlands of Jersey , and destined the site of the emporium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a barren plain . The Hud. * son turned the proud currents of the ocean to the south , removed the sands and rocks , which would have united the island to the main , and preserved a harbor unequalled in the world . ' pp. 96-98 . Such were the daring attempts , such the proud success of the Hudson . But notwithstanding this humiliating discomfiture of the ocean , its towering pride was not subdued ; it made other encroachments , rushed headlong into other encounters , and again met with a like disgraceful repulse . Listen once more to the author . As the God of nature never formed a nobler stream , or one which is capable of being converted to more important uses than the Susquehanna , it is to be expected that such a river would weigh much either in favor or against our theory. - This noble river rescued from the gloomy embrace of the ocean millions of acres , which now are adorned by rich harvests , pleasant villages , and magnificent cities . Before the ocean was met by the Susquehanna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Delaware , and was again pressing his forces towards the mountains . Had this noble river been an experienced warrior , standing on the // top of the Alleganies , surrounded by invincible legions , and marked the foe of freedom marching to defile by his footsteps the holy sanctuary of liberty , he could not have moved more effectually to repel the baleful intruder . As the accumulated force of the Susquehanna approached , the current of the ocean was again driven from the shores , and turned to the south . ' p. 102 . Should our inquisitive readers not be satisfied with these specimens of the author 's manner , and with this brief sketch of his theory , we can do them no better service , than to recommend the perusal of the work itself . We should be happy to unfold to them his new theory of the tides , but our allotted space is already filled up , and we can only assure them , that this is quite as novel and edifying , as the theory of the earth and of deluges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as Newton and La Place , and chooses to wear no chains but those of his own fabricating . If we have succeeded in gathering his meaning , the tides are caused by the rays of light passing through the atmosphere ; but we will not diminish , by broken hints or imperfect descriptions , the pleasures in store for the curious , who may engage in a thorough examination of the subject . Should the thought intrude itself upon any person , after reading the above remarks , that we have not a due respect for the science of geology , he will be in a mistake . We think it a noble and useful science , and worthy of the great minds by which it has been so much improved within the last half century . It is not the science to which we object , but the theory ; not the facts , but the speculations ; not the realities , but the dreams . Geology , in its legitimate objects , is a science of observation and analysis , and should be confined within its proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the component parts of the earth , are subjects capable of investigation , and have their utility ; but inquiries about the original elements of chaos , and the formation of the globe out of these elements , are as preposterous as they are fruitless , and , in the present stage of mental progress , they will rarely gain admittance into a mind , from which philosophy and common sense have not been banished*.
