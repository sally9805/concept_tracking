Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : DREAMS . from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream ! My spirit not awak'ning , till the beam Of an Eternity should bring the morrow . Yes ! tho ' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow . ' T were better than the cold reality Of waking life , to him whose heart must be , And hath been still , upon the lovely earth , A chaos of deep passion , from his birth . But should it be  --  that dream eternally Continuing  --  as dreams have been to me In my young boyhood  --  should it thus be giv'n . ' T were folly still to hope for higher Heav'n . For I have revell 'd when the sun was bright I ' the summer sky , in dreams of living light . And loveliness ,  --  have left my very heart Inclines of mine imaginary apart From mine own home , with beings that have been Of mine own thought  --  what more could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once  --  and the wild hour From my remembrance shall not pass  --  some pow'r Or spell had bound me  --  ' t was the chilly wind Came o'er me in the night , and left behind Its image on my spirit  --  or the moon Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon Too coldly  --  or the stars  --  howe'er it was That dream was as that night-wind  --  let it pass . I have been happy , tho ' in a dream . I have been happy  --  and I love the theme : Dreams ! in their vivid colouring of life As in that fleeting , shadowy , misty strife Of semblance with reality which brings To the delirious eye , more lovely things Of Paradise and Love  --  and all our own ! Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known . Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : VISIT OF THE DEAD . from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) Thy soul shall find itself alone  --  Alone of all on earth  --  unknown The cause  --  but none are near to pry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude , Which is not loneliness  --  for then The spirits of the dead , who stood In life before thee , are again In death around thee , and their will Shall then o'ershadow thee  --  be still : For the night , tho ' clear , shall frown : And the stars shall look not down From their thrones , in the dark heav'n ; With light like Hope to mortals giv'n , But their red orbs , without beam , To thy withering heart shall seem As a burning , and a ferver Which would cling to thee forever . But ' twill leave thee , as each star In the morning light afar Will fly thee  --  and vanish :  --  But its thought thou can'st not banish . The breath of God will be still ; And the wish upon the hill By that summer breeze unbrok'n Shall charm thee  --  as a token , And a symbol which shall be Secrecy in thee . Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : EVENING STAR . from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) ' T was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , in their orbits , Shone pale , thro ' the light Of the brighter , cold moon , ' Mid planets her slaves , Herself in the Heavens , Her beam on the waves . I gaz 'd awhile On her cold smile ; Too cold  --  too cold for me  --  There pass 'd , as a shroud , A fleecy cloud , And I turn 'd away to thee , Proud Evening Star , In thy glory afar , And dearer thy beam shall be ; For joy to my heart Is the proud part Thou bearest in Heav'n at night , And more I admire Thy distant fire , Than that colder , lowly light . Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : IMITATION . from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) A dark unfathom 'd tide Of interminable pride  --  A mystery , and a dream , Should my early life seem ; I say that dream was fraught With a wild , and waking thought Of beings that have been , Which my spirit hath not seen , Had I let them pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth inherit That vision on my spirit ; Those thoughts I would controul , As a spell upon his soul : For that bright hope at last And that light time have past , And my worldly rest hath gone With a sight as it pass 'd on ; I care not tho ' it perish With a thought I then did cherish , Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : In youth have I known one with whom the Earth from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) How often we forget all time , when lone Admiring Nature 's universal throne ; Her woods  --  her wilds  --  her mountains  --  the intense Reply of HERs to OUR intelligence ! 1 . In youth have I known one with whom the Earth In secret communing held  --  as be with it , In day light , and in beauty from his birth : Whose fervid , flick'ring torch of life was lit From the sun and stars , whence he had drawn forth A passionate light-such for his spirit was fit  --  And yet that spirit knew  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had o'er it power . 2 . Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought To a ferver by the moon beam that hangs o'er , But I will half believe that wild light fraught With more of sov'reignty than ancient lore Hath ever told  --  or is it of a thought The unembodied essence , and no more That with a quick'ning spell doth o'er us pass As dew of the night-time , o'er the summer grass ? 3 . Doth o'er us pass , when , as th ' expanding eye To the lov 'd object  --  so the tear to the lid Will start , which lately slept in apathy ? And yet it need not be  --  ( that object ) hid From us in life  --  but common  --  which doth lie Each hour before us  --  but then only bid With a strange sound , as of a harp-string broken T ' awake us  --  ' T is a symbol and a token . 4 . Of what in other worlds shall be  --  and giv'n In beauty by our God , to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their heart 's passion , and that tone , That high tone of the spirit which hath striv'n Tho ' not with Faith  --  with godliness  --  whose throne With desp'rate energy ' t hath beaten down ; Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown . Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : A wilder 'd being from my birth from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) A wilder 'd being from my birth My spirit spurn 'd control , But now , abroad on the wide earth , Where wand'rest thou my soul ? In visions of the dark night I have dream 'd of joy departed  --  But a waking dream of life and light Hath left me broken-hearted . And what is not a dream by day To him whose eyes are cast On things around him with a ray Turn 'd back upon the past ? That holy dream  --  that holy dream , While all the world were chiding , Hath cheer 'd me as a lovely beam A lonely spirit guiding  --  What tho ' that light , thro ' misty night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely bright In Truth 's day  --  star ? Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : The happiest day  --  the happiest hour from Tamerlane and other poems ( 1827 ) The happiest day  --  the happiest hour My sear 'd and blighted heart hath known , The highest hope of pride , and power , I feel hath flown . Of power ! said I ? yes ! such I ween But they have vanish 'd long alas ! The visions of my youth have been  --  But let them pass . And , pride , what have I now with thee ? Another brow may ev'n inherit The venom thou hast pour 'd on me  --  Be still my spirit . The happiest day  --  the happiest hour Mine eyes shall see  --  have ever seen The brightest glance of pride and power I feel  --  have been : But were that hope of pride and power Now offer 'd , with the pain Ev'n then I felt  --  that brightest hour I would not live again : For on its wing was dark alloy And as it flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul that knew it well .
