txt ART . Vi. - The Life and Correspondence of Major Cartwrighz* . Edited by his Niece , F. D. CARTwRIGHT. 2 vols . Svo . London . 1826 . TuE distinction between great wit and madness is not more nice , according to the satirist , than that between revolutions and revolts , reformers and alarmists . Even with minds of a passable share of liberality , there is , we fear , some little odium in ill success . The hero is not always complete to the vulgar eye , // unless he gains his point ; and he may think himself happy to secure even the secondary fame of the martyr . Nay , the reformer , who has incurred the disapprobation of an age or a people , that he has been unable to carry along with him , sometimes even with the best grounds for his appeal , fails to have his sentence reversed by posterity , though it be , in common cases , the most impartial of tribunals . The adventurer in physical philosophy is much more secure of this posthumous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , and the glory of discovery necessarily remains with him , who demonstrates them first . But the opinions of the political philosopher may be entirely just , his aims most patriotic and laudable , and a future age , or a different community , may applaud and adopt them , yet he himseW if he do not meanwhile fali into oblivion , remain the victim of the obloquy which he incurred during his lifetime . The reason is , we suppose , that if not his principles , at least the circumstances under which he would enforce them , and the means and occasions he selects , are to be estimated by the mutable moral circumstances of society ; and that the expediency by which his enterprises arc to be measured , is often not more easily ascertained by posterity than it is at the moment of action . Besides , as a politician may sometimes in his theories transcend the possible in this imperfect condition of things , so he may outgo the general progress of opinion in his age or nation ; and , though this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sober judgment , affect the estimate of his mode of contending for it . To not a few of these political reformers it happens , indeed , as to the pioneer in a new country , who enters the wilderness , and perishes in it , which his children afterwards inhabit in safety and opulence . They , who thus unsuccessfully lead the war against the political errors of their own age or country , can hardly , at least , expect praise from those whom they have vainly attempted to mend . If they can not content themselves with that reward which arises , according to metaphysicians , out of the mere perception of truth , apart from the praise which is due to the discovery of it , they must therefore carry their appeal to those from whose later age , or more fortunate moral circumstances , a less partial judgment may be hoped . Perhaps the subject of the memoir , of which the title stands at the head of this article , has some claim to enter an appeal of this sort with us on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and events is proving // the worth and truth of his opinions in his own country . His principles appear , indeed , to have been much better suited to the meridian of America than of England , where it was his fate , through a long life , to labor in their assertion with an ardor , which might be deemed importunate in a cause less honest , and to die nearly as remote as ever from their accomplishment , while , in the mean time , the rancor of party has heaped a thousand scurrilities on his name . We doubt if even in America , the name of this sturdy champion of reform is associated with just notions of his views and character , and whether it does not borrow some stigma from the names in whose company it has often come to us . It was , indeed , a principle of his , that if his cause was good , it was a small concern with whom he went forth to battle for it . Yet this old radical , ' this heart of sedition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are apt to name with a Hunt and a Cobbett , has numbered among his friends , or coadjutors , some of the best and wisest geniuses that have adorned our age ; a Pitt , a Fox , a Sheridan , a Jones , a Wilberforce , a Whitbread , a Parr , and a Price . The history of his various political connexions presents some edifying commentaries on the progressive growth of patriots into placemen ; and it will probably strike most readers of the occurrences of his times , that neither the extreme to which our reformer was accused of carrying his doctrines , nor the emergencies of the period , will account so well for the desertions and the persecutions he experienced , as certain other considerations , which , to the disgrace of human nature , are so common in politicians , as scarcely any longer to be considered a reproach . In fact , xvhile our upright reformer adhered , with his characteristic pertinacity , to what he deemed the strait line of political rectitude , he found a great many of his associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , it may be presumed , rather a private than a public expediency . He was a very Sysiphus , whose rock of reform never reached the summit , though he gave it his shoulder full half a century . But whatever disrespect or ill success may have pursued our champion on his own soil , his name deserves a better reception on ours , where the doctrines of liberty have a wider sway , and where gratitude , too , interposes some claim in his behalf . At a time when no member of the British parliament seems to have conceived , either the justice or the policy of conceding // independence to the colonies , Cartxvright had the boldness and the forecast to propose it , suggesting , in his work entitled *1iurican Independence , a union between the colonies and the mother state , under separate legislatures . The issue is panegyric sufficient on this proposition , of whose advantage to England Mr Laurens was so sensible , that when asked his opinion of it , he made this forcible reply ; That it was better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it would render the kingdom thus united too forrnidTh4e to the rest of the world . ' Home Tooke declared , that half a dozen such men as Cartwright , in each county , would have arrested the American war . Indeed , the date of our obligation is older yet ; for it appears from Evelyn 's Memoirs , that symptoms of resistance to the mother country having manifested themselves in New England in bis day , conciliatory measures were adopted in consequence of representations made to the council by Colonel Cartwright , an ancestor of the Major 's . As the reformer himsell ; during many years , and by various publications , proved the steadfast friend of America , he seems to have the like claim with another venerable name , to reparation in the gratitude of this fortunate shore , for xvbat he may have lost in behalf of liberty on another . With a feeling of this kind , combined with a natural and more general interest for all the votaries of liberty , we propose , though the biography of the reformer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it some particulars of bis life , with the xvish to introduce to the better acquaintance of our countrymen a character not , perhaps , generally understood by them . John Cartwright was born on the seventeenth of September ( old style ) , 1740 , at iXlarnham , in Nottingbamshire . His family was of remote antiquity , and suffered in its possessions by adhering to Charles the First . One of his ancestors was an intimate of the celebrated Cranmer , and married his daughter ; and , on the dissolution of the abbeys , received three of them from that prelate , then Archbishop of Canterbury . The abbey of Ossington , a part of this benefaction , is still in the family . The father of the subject of our memoir , was a man of much energy of character , and was also something of a reformer ; for to him the public is indebted for the abolition of that bughear to decayed gentlemen , the practice of giving vails to servants . This measure was solemnly proposed by the Duke of Norfolk , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // who first carried it into execution ; for such was the indignation of the serving-men at this invasion of a venerable abuse , that it was really expected the attempt would he followed hy serious consequences . John used to say , that his father had a genius for encountering difficulties , of which a better proof can hardly he mentioned , than that he was thirty years en6aged in persuading the gentry of his neighhorhood to the undertaking of a public work , whose expense did not , in the end , exceed eight thousand pounds . Of the brothers of the reformer , George is well known as the author of a Journal of Sixteen Years ' Residence in Labrador , and Edmund was a useful mechanician , celebrated for the invention of the power-loom . At five years of age , John was sent to a grammar school at Newark , and afterwards at Heath Academy , in Yorkshire , to neither of which seminaries does he seem to have owed much obligation . He often complained of the deficiency of his early education , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut his own ; and , like a good many others , he was forced to make up by self instruction , for the neglect or ignorance of the pedagogue . He made some proficiency , however , in mechanics and practical mathematics , by means of which he was afterwards a useful associate to his ingenious brother , Dr Cartwright . His vacations , and a good part of his childhood , were passed under the roof of John Viscount Tyrconnel , who had married his father 's sister , and whose sturdy whiggism may have given some bias to the youthful mind of his nephew . it is of this zealous old politician that the story is told , that when divine service was performing in his chapel at Belton , he was observed to be greatly agitated during the reading of the prayer for parliament , stirring the fire with violence , and muttering impatiently to himself , Nothing but a miracle can mend them . ' Young Cartwright 's parents wished to retain him at home , and educate him to agricultural pursuits . But though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplative , he was desirous of active employment , and in a sudden fit of enthusiasm for the great Frederick , who was then successfully building up Prussia at the expense of her neighbors , he left home to enlist in his service as a volunteer . This brilliant scheme , which , with a temper as impatient of tyranny as his , was likely to end in Spandau or Magdeburg , had fortunately a more sober termination in his being allowed , at the intercession of his mother , to enter the navy of his own country . The // young sailor was at the taking of Cherbourg , and subsequently in the celebrated seafight between Sir Edward Hawke and the Frehch admiral Conflans , in which , of the twentysix men he had under his command , thirteen were killed at his side , himself escaping with a slight scratch from a splinter . Lord Howe being afterwards selected to a service of some danger , in the same expedition , chose only one lieutenant and two midshipmen to accompany him , of whom Cartwright was one ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old Captain Baird , the companion of Lord Anson , seem greatly to have excited the admiration of our young hero . The former was habitually taciturn , and had a solemn gravity of countenance , which procured him from the sailors the nickname of Black Dick ; ' and Cartwright used to relate , that it was a saying among them , We are going to have some fun in the fighting way , for Black Dick has a smile on his face . ' While yet a midshipman , and at the age of twentyone , Cartwright turned his attention to the improvement of the exercise of the great guns on hoard ship , and his suggestions are given by his friend Falconer , the poet , in his Alarine Dictionary , under the article Exercise . ' Always impatient of inaction , he also proposed to Lord Howe to burn some French men-of-war lying at the mouth of the Charente ; a project declined as too hazardous , but with high commendations of the young man 's spirit and intelligence . In 1762 , he was promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be first lieutenant of the Guernsey , then on the Newfoundland station , where he was appointed by Sir Hugh Palliser , his deputy or surrogate within two districts ; in 1767 , he was made deputy commissary to the Vice Admiralty Court in Newfoundland . In these posts , and during the whole of his naval service , he possessed the confidence of his superior officers , and excited sentiments of kindness in those under his command , which some of the most distinguished veterans in the navy used afterwards to acknowledge in strong terms . Among them were Admiral Young , Admiral Berkely , Admiral Charles Hamilton , and Captain King , who accompanied Captain Cook round the world . The first seiit for his old friend on his death bed , to remind him of their early friendship ; and the last used to say , with tears in his eyes , that his friend Cartwright had been a father to him . During his residence in Newfoundland , he made a short // exploratory journey into the interior , as far as a lake which he named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of the river Exploits . To this expedition , which occupied him ten or twelve days , and in which , as occurred to him on occasions of a different kind , he left his over-wearied companions hehind him , he often reverted with great satisfaction , remarking that he did not wonder at the attachment of hunters and hackwoodsmen to this wild and independent sort of life . Amidst these solitary birch woods , whose stillness was seldom disturbed hy a deer , or even a hird , and where the whole days ' refreshment was perhaps a few whortle or cranherries , it was a luxury to sit at night by a fire of pine branches , on which he broiled his supper of reindeer 's flesh , and then to sleep soundly on a bed of birch hark and leaves . On his return from this country to England , he brought with him an Esquimaux woman , from whose astonishment at every thing she saw , I derived , ' he says , a singular entertainment . ' Though brought up a barbarian , she soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , of those passions which distinguish polite ladies in refined countries ; for , though a fright herself , she found much fault with the Englishwomen 's dress , and could by no means allow them to he handsome . To the men , on the contrary , she showed much more justice . There is a well known story of this woman , that , on being shown the interior of St Paul 's , she was so struck with astonishment and awe , that her knees shook under her , and , leaning on her conductor , she asked in a tremulous voice , Did man make it , or was it found here ? ' When informed that she must return to her own country , the money for her support heing expended , she asked why she could not go into the woods , and kill venison ; and when told that she would be hanged if she killed venison in England , she laughed heartily , exclaiming in a tone of great contempt , Hanged for killing venison ! That s too foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his characteristic disinterestedness , gave in a memorial in behalf of his successor in the deputy ship , representing the inadequacy of the pay , though he had himself , for five years , suffered all the inconvenience of it without murmur . In this year he published a letter on the ornamental designs for ships ' heads , moved thereto , it would appear , from seeing the head of a ship called the Queen , decorated , not with some gentle personijlcaiion of Queen Charlotte , but with a ferocious lion , // with jaxvs distended for carnage . He suggested in this letter a nautic order of architecture , an idea he afterwards matured in his designs for a temple of naval celebration . He wrote , too , though unacquainted with the inventor , a strong commendation of Bentinek 's newly invented chain pump . On the commencement of the Spanish war5 on account of the Falkland Islands , he was invited by Lord Howe to he one of his lieutenants , and gladly accepted the offer ; hut on the dispute being adjusted , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured by the hardships he encountered in Newfoundland , and which continued indifferent for many years after . He was at one time given up hy many of the faculty ; hut his life was saved by the celebrated Dr James . During this interval he was not idle , however , hut employed it in writing a pamphlet on the rights and interests of Fishing Companies ; and , notwithstanding his had state of health , was extremely anxious to be sent on the northern expedition which went out under Captain Phipps . His attention to this subject may be seen in the information , which he supplied to Dames Barrington , in his work on the possibility of approaching the North Pole . In the expeditions of Ross and Parry , at a later day , he felt a very lively interest . In the year 1772 , he drew up a plan for a perpetual supply of English oak for the navy , of which a reverend hishop candidly remarked , what might have been said of many other schemes of our reformer , We are not honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , after ten years ' endeavor on his part to bring it to the notice of government , was afterwards partially adopted , but without any acknowledgment of its author . In 1774 , he wrote his Letter to Edmund Burke , ' and his attention became turned to political subjects . It was in this year , and about the time that our Patrick Henry broached the same idea here , that he began to print his Letters on slrnericctn Independence . On publishing this work , he caused a short argument to he printed , which , together with the tract itself , was distributed to the members at the door of parliament . He did not argue this great question , like some of his contemporaries , on the ground of charters or acts of parliament , nor , like others , on that of expediency , but on the broad foundation of natural and inherent right . It is , ' says he , a capital error in the reasonings of several writers on this subject , that they consider the liberty of mankind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go about to prove or disprove their right to it , by grants , usage , or municipal statutes . It is not among mouldy parchinents that we are to look for it ; it is the immediate gift of God ; it is not derived from any one , but is original in every one . ' I deny that Magna Charta is the basis of the English constitution . It is indeed a glorious member of the superstructure , and was but a formal declaration of rights already known to be the constitutional inheritance of every Englishman . ' His arguments probably made little impression on the public , which had neither gone so far in the science of liberty , nor was of such a temper towards the colonies , as to render them palatable . Taxation no Tyranny , with its narrow principles and unapt illustrations , was better seasoned to its taste , having already gone through three editions . If the welfare of the governed is any argument in these great questions , the present situation of this country says as little for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is honorable to those of this uncompromising assertor of liberty . Cartwright published a second edition of his work in 1775 , in which year he was appointed major of the Nottinghamshire militia , the title by which he was generally distinguished afterwards , and is best known . He was indefatigable in training this corps , exerting in its discipline his customary inflexibility . On one of the training marches , perceiving that the men loitered in an unmilitary manner , he assured them lie would find means to prevent such irregularity in future , and the offence being repeated the next day , he drew them up just as they came in sight of their quarters for the night , and facing them about , marched them three miles back . Another anecdote will show what opinion was had of his integrity . A soldier had been sentenced to be flogged , and was advised , as he had a vote for Nottingham , for which place the Major was proposed , to plead to him for forgiveness . It will be of no use , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to encounter many petty intrigues in this post , and was much annoyed and thxvarted , as his political opinions hegan to be known . He kept it , however , with proportional pertinacity , till in the year 1791 , having attended a meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the destruction of the Bastile , the Duke of Newcastle sent to inform him , that in consequence of it he could not promote him to the lieutenant colonelcy of the regiment , then vacant . A less determined man would have resigned // in such circumstances ; but the Major was in no humor thus to oblige his pursuers , and even when resort was had to the supposed authority of an act of parliament to displace him , be still remained deaf to the hint . At length the duke commissioned another major in his place ; but to this , considering it illegal , he paid no attention , declaring he should still appear in uniform at his post . His dismission was accomplished at last , in 1792 , by virtue of some recent act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended his post better ; and we may learn from this anecdote both his obstinate resistance of what he thought injustice , and what sort of odium this untractableness was fitted to excite in his opponents . An old acquaintance used to say of him to his wife , Your busband , madam , is the best bred obstinate man I ever was acquainted with . ' A transaction , which took place in 1776 , proved that this firmness obtained also in his political principles . He had always been eager of promotion in the navy , and Lord Howe being appointed at this time to command against the colonies , signified to the Major a desire of having him along with him in America . Cartwright , though very sensible of the advantages of the proposal , and though he was then attached to a lady whom by these means he would have been put into a situation to marry , had the integrity and spirit to refuse it , at some risk even to his reputation as a soldier , alleging that he could not do wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproved . It is stated by his biographer , that some proposition bad been made to him about this time , of a command in the American navy ; but I thought , ' said he , that nothing could absolve me from my duty to my own country , and that I ought to stick to the old ship as long as there was a plank of her above water . ' In this year he received the freedom of the town of Nottingham , the compliment being rendered more grateful by being made at the same time to Sir George Saville ; and he wrote his earliest work on parliamentary reform , the first , with the exception of some tracts by the late Earl Stanhope , ever expressly published on the subject . From this time forward he was devoted to the two great objects of annual parliaments and universal suffrage ; through what difficulties , and with what eventual ill success , is well known to such as are conversant with the history of the times . The work referred to , was called Take your Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , entitled The // 377 Legislative Rights of the Commonalty Vindicated ; ' in both these tracts he lays down equal representation as a right , and annual election as a security for its preservation . It seems that a passage in Take your Choice ' gave vehement offence to the Duke of Richmond , who , with the hook in his pocket , and the offensive leaf turned down , introduced himself to the author . ' The interview , thus inauspiciously begun , had a very different issue from what is usual with two controvertists , resulting not only in mutual satisfaction as to each other 's sentiments , but in a friendship and correspondence of some duration . A short time after , in April , 1777 , Major Cartwright presented to the king an address recommending peace with America , and proposing the union , which he had suggested in his *dmerican Independence . I heartily wish , ' says he in a letter , that his majesty may be wise enough , and good enough , to pay attention to it , as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . ' His book led him to an acquaintance with Mr Burke , which , from the tory principles always felt perhaps , and , soon after , openly professed by the latter , was probably of very short duration . One of our politician 's most intimate associates was Lord Efiingham , who had refused to serve in the American war from like scruples with his friend 's . This nobleman used to say , that he though.t Lord North 's life of the greatest consequence to the country , *s it was evident , should he die , there would come into the cabinet seven spirits worse than the first . ' The publication at this time , of a pamphlet by the celebrated Dr Price , justifying every material principle asserted in American Independence , ' gave great pleasure to its author . It is with infinite satisfaction , ' says he in a letter , that I find the wisest and best men now adopting the plan I was the first to propose four years ago , of entering into an alliance with the colonies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted himself in the following year to form a Society of Political Inquiry , and the plan , though ineffectual , probably laid the foundation of the Society for Constitutional Information , instituted in 1789 . In the latter end of the year , he was invited to stand for the town of Nottingham ; but , on the offering of another candidate , his friends advised him to decline . He was equally unsuccessful in the county , his opponent being supported by the Duke of Portland , who wrote to Major Cartwright , alleging the near relation of the rival candidate to his Grace , and warning him // against a second disappointment . To this the Major replied , that he himself was rather more nearly related to his Grace , if pedigree gave any pretension to a seat in parliament ; that as to disappointment in another election , he should do , as he presumed his Grace would , what he thought best for the public good ; and , that his Lordship might see he was above flattering any man , that lie must necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a set of very bad ministers . His subsequent efforts for a seat in parliament met with no better success , nor had he ever an opportunity of pressing his political views in that assembly . One cause of this was probably his uncompromising opinions as to the purity of elections . He always declared he would not expend a shilling in an election , even for a ball ; and it was in one of these borough negotiations , that he begged it would be remembered , that he had no political gratitude . ' When in the year 1779 , the British fleet was driven into harbor before the combined fleets of France and Spain , Major Cartwright on the spur of the occasion , formed a plan of defence uniting military and naval operations , to the merit of which the Duke of Richmond , and General Debbieg , bore honorable testimony . He likewise planned a defence of the dockyard at Portsmouth , and devoted some attention to a system of naval surveying , by which to ascertain the exact movements of a fleet during action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as useful in clearing up points respecting maneuvres , involving sometimes the reputation of officers . In the beginning of the next year , a general meeting for the redress of grievances was held in the county of Nottingham , of which he was the original mover . The Duke of Portland was chairman of the committee of correspondence voted by this meeting , and his brother , Lord Edward Bentiuck , was chosen a deputy to the convention from the petitioning towns . Cartwright was chosen deputy for the town of Nottingham . Soon after was held at the King 's Arms the Westminster Committee , in which resolutions were passed on the state of the representation , and of which Sheridan was chairman . And in the same spring , our politician accomplished what he had long had at heart , the establishment of a Society for Constitutional Information . He himself wrote the first address of this Society , which included some of the first talent and respectability of the kingdom ; among the rest , Dr Price , Granville Sharp , // General Fitzpatrick , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Richmond , Sir Cecil Wray , Alderman Sawbridge , Sir John Sinclair , Sheridan , Day ( author of Sandford and Merton ' ) , Dr Edwards , Stratford Canning ( uncle of the present premier ) , the Earl of Selkirk , and others . He was the author also of a Declaration of Rights , ' published and distributed by the Society , which Sir William Jones said ought to be written in letters of gold . ' Though little apt to mention what was flattering to himself , the old Major used to relate with great pleasure , that the immortal Chatham exclaimed , on reading this production , Aye , this is right , this is very right . ' He enforced the same principles in The People 's Barrier against Undue influence and Corruption , ' published in the same year . In November of this year , 1780 , he was married to Anne Katharine Dashwood , eldest daughter of Samuel Dashwood of Well Vale , Lincolushire . Circumstances had deferred this union for nine years . Their constancy was rewarded by fortyfour years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , not only the chief happiness of his life , but its prolongation beyond the ordinary term of man . He always addressed her in his letters , as his dearest and best friend . ' In the following year were written his Letters on the Inequality of Representation , and the Inadequacy of Petitions to Parliament for mere Reform in Public Expenditures . ' In consequence of the death of his father at this period , he was , for some time after , much engaged in the arrangement of family matters . On this occasion he gave an instance of his usual singular disinterestedness . He had , some time before , expressed an apprehension that his father 's will might be too favorable to himself , to the injury of others , and it was probably owing o his representations that the old gentleman made a new one , constituting his eldest surviving son George , his executor and heir to his principal estate . George had been unfortunate in some speculations in Labrador , and his embarrassments made him desirous of disposing of the family estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his residence on it , devoting himsef at the same time so assiduously to settling the family affairs , that for a twelvemouth he seldom labored less than eleven hours a day . His care of his family was incessant ; his grandfather used to say , He was born to be the father of it ! ' He found time , however , to submit to Lords Howe and Keppel a plan for raising the Royal George , // which , with the fate of many of his propositions , though allowed to be the best , was never put in execution . Nor did he forget his favorite project of parliamentary reform , though it would not he very interesting to mention all the meetings for the l ) romotion of it , in which he bore a part . At one which Fox called at Westminster , to apologise to his electors for his resignation , our politician remarked , that though he had beard much of the impracticableness and absurdity of equal representation , it seemed to him there was no greater hardship in giving every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his being taxed in the minutest article of food and raiment . Speaking of Fox a day or two previous , he said , 1 wish his constituents would give him three thousand pounds a year , and keep him out of office ; ' and of Lord Shelburne he held the same tone . The last time I saw him , ' he writes , he said all I could possibly wish ; he was not then a minister . ' This ministerial malady seems also to have seized on Lord Rockingham , who , when the question of reform was brought forward by Mr Pitt , in 1782 , had the misfortune to forget the day of the discussion ! Indeed this staunch champion of liberty found , in the progress of his career , so many hollow or lukewarm patriots ; so many very moderate Whigs , ' as somebody once called Dr Robertson ; that it was not without reason he said , Cmesar has friends , Pompey has friends , but none are friends to Rome . ' On this same subject of reform he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have his franchise , and a manufacturer in Birmingham shall have none , would puzzle any casuist on earth , except those in our House of Commons . ' He persevered however , in spite of defection and defeat , in his political plans and efforts , which , from this time till 1788 , were as various and earnest as ever . He promoted the Society for Constitutional Information , and corresponded with the chief patriots of the day in Ireland ; he procured petitions from the various unrepresented towns , in aid of Mr Pitt 's plan of reform ; and he wrote to that statesman his hope , that his specific scheme would completely reinstate the people in their rights . The cause of reform wore at this time a more promising aspect than at any other period of its history , being espoused not only by such as might be stigmatized as low bred and discontented meddlers , but by men of rank and consequence , and ostensibly by ministers themselves . He wrote , also , during this period , a repy to Soame Jenyns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the efforts of Clarkson and Sharp for the abolition of the slave trade . The French Revolution , at this time in its infancy , and wearing the most auspicious aspect for the liberties of mankind , was welc*rned , it may he supposed , with the liveliest pleasure hy this earnest apostle of freedom . On the eighteenth of August , 1789 , he addressed , in this spirit , a letter to the Committee of the Constitution of the States General . ' Not only , however , was this fair prospect soon overciouded in France , hut the excesses of the Revolution wrought very disastrously on the cause of reform in England . Not a few of its friends , who had heen willing enough to restore the edifice of the Constitution to what they deemed its pristine beauty , were terrified by the storm , which seemed likely to tear it from its foundations , and thought it more prudent to remain in a leaky house , than to enter on repairs amidst this convulsion of the political atmosphere , much less to pull it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was no whit less tenacious of his principles , because he saw them disfigured and abused ; nor did he forgive those who , with less pertinacity , yielded them to the alleged expediency of the day . Of Mr Pitt 's sincerity he began to entertain some douhts . His friend , Dr Jebb , had told him long before , that politically speaking , Pitt was the worst man living , and would go greater lengths to destroy liberty , than any minister ever did before him . ' Cartwright , at this time , stopped far short of his friend , in his censure of that energetic minister . I confess , ' he says , that though on parliamentary reform , and a few other points , he has not satisfied me , my objections go no farther than doubts , and these doubts are mixed with hopes of somewhat great and good in future . ' Men may differ as to the policy of the two parties in this crisis ; hut the subsequent censure of Mr Pitt by the father of reform , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far from sharing in the republican notions disseminated by Paine and others . On the contrary , he assiduously labored to counteract them in the popular societies of the day , not merely on Machiavel 's principle , that it was wise to retain forms , but in the honest persuasion that the spirit of the English constition was highly favorable to liberty . The events of the year 1793 , both foreign and domestic , probably gave his rising suspicions of Mr Pitt a more definite character . The alliance of the sovereigns against France , he // regarded in the light in which posterity will , on the whole , be Jikely to view it ; as not more reconcileable with p&amp;icy than national justice . It may he worth our while , ' said he , to consider what company we are to keep in this affair . ' Of these confederates to revenge the murder of a king , one had seized the throne of her husband hy means of that very crime , and the others had gone shares with her in the plunder received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bold mockery in ministers , ' he added , to propose to a nation , lovers of justice and freedom , a part in such a confederacy . ' At home , the prosecutions instituted by the government against the friends of reform , gave him more serious uneasiness , and , indeed , spread no small dismay among the people , who beheld them urged by the the very minister , that , a few years before , had been seen solelmly to pledge himself in the same cause . Major Cartwright took a deep interest in the fate of Muir ; his strong feeling breaks out in the letter , which he wrote in his hehalf to the Duke of Richmond . It is long , ' says he , ' since I had offered your Grace any of my thoughts ; but a letter from on board the hulks , which I have just read , hears down all reluctance . Read that letter , my Lord , I beseech you ; if the writer merit the treatment he has received , I also , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if he be the victim of that corrupt system , which your Grace and I have labored to reform it is needless to say more . ' But the trial of bIt , the printer of Newark , gave him still greater uneasiness . This young man was fined fifty pounds for each publication , and sentenced to four years ' imprisonment , for publishing two addresses , one of which was originally drawn up by Cartwright himself , and received the sanction of a society composed of tbe most distinguished characters of the day . He attempted , but in vain , to take this unfortunate man from his fate , by coming forward to prove himself the author of the obnoxious paper . The sentence proved the ruin of Holt 's affairs , and caused his premature death . Yet , on this occasion , Cartwright 's stern sense of duty , brought him forward to exculpate the minister , of whom , as he says , experience had taught him to think so badly , from the charge of having himself , as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the paper on which Holt 's prosecution was founded . Mr Pitt , he tells the editor of the Monthly Magazine , was not a member of that society , nor of any other having similar objects . // The trials of Home Tooke , Hardy , Theiwall and others , followed shortly after , and such was the consternation they excited , that many of the most zealous members of the constitutional societies sought anxiously to withdraw their names from them , and to shrink if possible into obscurity . Though the conviction of Tooke and the others would have made the situation of Cartxvright himself not a little critical , he appears to have felt no personal anxieties ; and far from concealing his connexion with the prosecuted reformers , he addressed ti* the Duke of Portland , then secretary of state , his old friend , and former political associate , a request for permission to visit Tooke in prison . In the letter preferring this request , he not only avows his personal friendship for the prisoner , but alleges as an additional reason of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years cooperated with him in the matter of parliamentary reform , and that it was indeed the great happiness of his life to have been active in the very cause , for which the accused was suffering . His grace replied , that Mr Cartwright could have only the same permission to visit Mr Tooke , which government allowed to other persons ; a refusal we presume , in plain English , to admit him at all . In the event of these trials Cartwright , as may he supposed , felt a profound interest . On that of Hardy , he says , Gibbs spoke like an angel , ' and Erskine , who made a speech of six hours , ( some length in those days ) , was at last so exhausted , that he could not be heard by the jud0es , and an intermediate person was obliged to repeat what he said . These trials , ' he writes to a friend , will turn out as I expected , vindictive and iniquitous , and instead of suitable prosecutions for smaller offences in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against liberty and its virtuous defenders . ' Hardy 's acquittal gave him incredible satisfaction , and he communicated it to his family in the following letter ; Hardy is acquitted . J. C. ' When Tooke was pronounced not guilty , ' the air , he says was rent with shouts of joy , and Felix trembled . ' After they subsided , Tooke , who during the whole trial had conducted himself with wonderful firmness and readiness , addressed the court in a few words , and then said , " I hope , Mr Attorney General , that this verdict will be a warning to you not to attempt to shed men 's blood , on lame suspicions and doubtful inferences . " He then turned to the jury , and thanked them for his life . Every man of them shed tears . This brought tears to // the eyes of Tooke who , during a six days ' battle , had stood as dauntless as a lion , giving a stroke to one and a gripe to another , as if he were at play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely sufficient to reach their room and return ; yet on first forming it , the panel bore such evident marks of management and partiality , that Erskine said to Tooke , " They are murdering * When it is added , that there were but four of the jury who thought at all favorably to Tooke , it may *ie imagined what they thought of the trial . Had these trials , ' said Cartwright , ended otherwise than they have , the system of proscription and terror , which has for some time been growing in this country , would have been completed and writton in innocent blood . ' On Thelwall 's trial , the Duke of Richmond , his old acquaintance and a brother reformer , made , to use his own words a sneaking figure ; ' and Sergeant Adair 's opening speech of seven hours , nearly lulled him to sleep , as it actually did the Chief Justice . Notwithstanding his deep concern in these proceedings , our politician , during all the time they lasted , never failed to write home from London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute instructions respecting the management of his farm at Brothertoft ; an evidence of a certain constancy of spirit , which distinguishes here and there a few . Tooke , as we have mentioned , showed no want of a manly tone on his trial . When urged by Chief Justice Eyre not to acknowledge his handwriting too hastily , he broke forth with great spirit ; I J ) rotest before God , that I have never done an action , never written a sentence in public or private , I have never entertained a thought on any political subject , which taken fairly , with all the circumstances of time , place , and occasion , I have the smallest hesitation to admit . ' The evidence given on the trial , by his friend Cartxvright , was of a piece with the confidence and honesty of this declaration . Though interrogated by the attorney general as to his own private opinions , and how , under their uidanc e , he would act in particular cases , he did not seek to shelter himself under the legal excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the witness , but answered them with a fearlessness against which the judge thought fit to caution him . It seems evident from his testimony , that Tooke , no more than himself , ever aimed at subverting the constitution and monarchy . The Society for Constitutional Information , of which , together with many of the first minds in // the kingdom , they were members , was designed to promote the recovery for the people of what were deemed their lost rights , representation in parliament , universal suffrage , and annual parliaments . Its members were men , probably , whose views differed essentially , some of them not going all the length of these objects , while others may have gone beyond them . But in regard to Tooke , the testimony of Cartwright is direct , that he was so far from inimical or disrespectful to royalty , that he at all times held the aristocratical and regal branches of the government as excellent in themselves , and that , with reform in other particulars , they would compose a more perfect constitution than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching some expression said to have been made , about strangling the vipers aristocracy and monarchy , said he did not remember it , but if it had been used in speaking of governments where monarchy and aristocracy were enemies to freedom , he should have thought it extremely well applied . Had I thought , ' said he , there were any conspirators in the society , I would have assisted in bringing them to justice . ' He did not look on Mr Paine 's writings , for instance , as any more a conspiracy to overturn the government , than any other discussions on government . Chief Justice Eyre observed to him , that , in connecting himself with bad men , he could not be sure that he would not be carried beyond his own purpose ; ' and that his declaration that he would sign a petition for reform with any man however bad , though it might be very sincere , was not very prudent . The popular story goes , that the patriot replied to this remark , that he came not there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He made no reply , however , at the moment ; but he used to say , that in the stage-coach of reform , he certainly no more regarded the company he kept , than when he served in the militia with what Arthur Young called the dregs of the people , or in the navy , with the refuse of the night-cellars of London , and felons from Newgate . Lord Wellington , I suppose , said he , concerned himself but little about the private character of the soldiers with whom he gained the battle of Waterloo . This mode of thinking , aside from its abstract justness , might be pardoned in one who constantly , at elections , saw in persons of the highest rank , and the greatest pride , condescensions to the lowest arid basest of mankind , which he himself was never known to practise . // In the course of Tooke 's trial , a letter from him to Lord Ashhurton appeared in evidence , in which he thus states the ( lifference of opinion between himself and his friend Cartwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man had an equal right to freedom , to representation as the security of that freedom , and to a vote as the means of being represented ; and that his final conclusion was , that every man should have an equal share in the representation . Now , my lord , t conceive the error to lie chiefly in the conclusion ; for there is a great difference between haviun an equal right to a share , and a right to an equal share . ' In 1795 , he published his Commonwealth in Danger , ' in answer to Arthur Young 's Example of France a Warning to Great Britain . ' Young had in his work treated our reformer with that small share of ceremony , used by political controvertists in all countries to their antagonists , he their private virtues what they may ; and after bestowing liberally on hiurt ihe epithets of Jacobin , cut-throat , thief , and reformer , ( names of like contempt , probably , in his esteem ) paid him the farther compliment of recommending his works to the notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Young 's , that he was an indiscriminate admirer of all the acts of the French Revolution . But however he might lament its excesses , he honestly avowed that he had never seen the moment , when he wished to behold the ancient despotism again riveted on that people ; and there are not a few who will think him in the right . Young probably repented this virulent abuse , as he introduced himself , a few years after , to the politician of Brothertoft farm , and a cordial intercourse ensued between them . During the year 1795 , our reformer , though much indisposed in health , was employed in drawing up various petitions . Being unable from illness to attend a county meeting at Lincoln , he prepared and sent a petition ; and on its being rejected there without a reading , determined to present it to the House of Commons in his individual name . In his letter to Fox , accompanying it , he says , As long as memory remains to me , I can not forget the obligation of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have given to the two execrable bills now pending . ' These were probably Lord Orenville 's bill for the safety of his majesty 's person , ' and Mr Pitt 's for preventing seditious meetings , ' which two bills very much changed and extended the law touching treason and // sedition . To this Fox replies , I need not apprize you that my sentiments with regard to universal suffrage are far different froni yours ; hut this difference , on an important point , has never prevented me from doing justice to your character , and sincerely admiring that ardent zeal , which has constantly animated you for the liberty of mankind . ' Upon presenting the petition , after remarking that he himself had never had the support of the gentleman from whom it came , who had , on the contrary , been the strenuous supporter of iMr Pitt , till that minister ahandoned the principles which had raised hini to popularity and power ; Fox added that strong encomium , which appears as a motto to our reformer 's Biography ; He is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the highest rank of public characters ; and whose purity of principle , and consistency of conduct through life , command the most respectful attention to his opinions . ' In the following year he wrote The Constitutional Defence of England , Internal and External , ' a work recommending the general arming of the people , and was proposed as a candidate for Boston , with such success as might he anticipated for one , who declared he would not expend a farthing in consideration of being elected , nor ring a hell , nor even contribute to a hail . In the year 1797 occurred an alarming mutiny in the British navy , on which occasion Cartwright xvrote to his friend Admiral Young , suggesting the employment of Lord Howe , called the father of the navy , ' to bring back the disaffected to their duty . Lord Howe , it is known , was afterwards successfully used for this purpose . Our reformer , after many ineffectual efforts , succeeded also in assemhling a respectable meeting at Boston , where he proposed and carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons hy Mr Tierney . This Boston meeting was not gotten up without much pains . Of the chief persons on the popular side , wearied , it would seem , by ill success , or alarmed by the times , some wished to see the example first set hy places of greater importance , and a great many , though sensible of its propriety , doubted the expediency of at present acting up to their conviction . This mode of reasoning was no I ) ovelty to our reformer ; hut was very unacceptable to one , whose views no complexion of times affected . It is not uncommon , ' was his frequent remark , to hear persons say in seasons of emergency , they have nothing to do with politics ; it would he as laudable to declare , they had nothing to do with // morality . ' He produced this same year , his Appeal on the English Constitution , ' of which this indefatigable man published another edition in 1798 . In the temper of the day , these publications were made not wholly without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a letter , that nothing can now be published in favor of liberty without considerable risk . The decision against Wakefield 's publisher appears to me decisive against the liberty of the press , and indeed after it one can hardly conceive how any prudent tradesman can venture to publish anything , that can , in any way , be disagreeable to ministers . ' In fact , the difficulty Cartwright had in finding a publisher for his second edition , obliged him to become his own bookseller . For several succeeding years till 1802 , he was much occupied with the affairs of his brother , Dr Cartwright , whose various inventions were as unprofitable to himself , as they were conducive to the prosperity of the country . Many piracies had been made of his patents , in detecting which the Major displayed his customary indefatigableness . His friend , Lord Stanhope , proved a very useful witness on the trials , from his profound knowledge of the principles and practical application of mechanics . The subject of a temple of naval celebration , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought forward a design , among others , which was pronounced by persons of the best taste , to be by much the noblest , and which the venerable West declared ought to immortalize its author . Among the designs he offered , were five nautic orders of architecture ; and of the decorations some have been since adopted in the monument of one of the naval heroes of Great Britain . His work called The Trident , ' contains the particulars of this scheme , in which he labored with his usual energy and his usual success ; for after several years of toil , and an expense of five hundred pounds to himself , it was finally rejected . He could scarcely be brought to believe , that the prejudices existing against him had any share in preventing its adoption . Such was the ill favor in which our politician was held by the government , or at least by its partisans and emissaries , that it led , ridiculously enough , to the apprehension of an agent of his , sent into Yorkshire to collect evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession was found a letter of instructions from Cartwright , which met the same fate as // Roderick Random 's Greek diary , and seems to have puzzled the Bow street officer , as much as Roderick 's production did Captain Oakum and his sapient council . Under the mask of drawing-off rollers and crank lashers , the decypherer thought he had found something extremely dangerous to the state . On learning the fate of his unlucky emissary , the Major hastened to leave a note with the attorney general , saying , that as his agent was suspected of having been sent on an improper errand , he was ready to explain the business . His majesty 's officer , however , whose head ran on nothing less than treason or sedition , sent to say that no information from the Major could he of any use . When the truth came out , he was happy to excuse himself by a polite note to our patriot . In the following year , 1803 , was published his Letter to the Electors of Nottingham , ' which , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side , called a senseless jargon , and the Monthly , on the other , complimented for its nervous and animated eloquence . He finds much fault in this publication with Mr Reeves , for calling the English constitution a monarchy , and with Arthur Young , who had asserted that the Commons House of Parliament was not intended to represent the Commons of England . The threatened invasion of Napoleon spread , at this time , dismay throughout the country , and turned the Major 's attention to other matters . He was anxiously employed in devising a mode of defence ; and particularly in promoting meetings in Lincolushire , to represent the unprepared situation of that coast . He made a plan , also , of a flying drawbridge , which met the approbation of the late Sir John Moore ; and a pike of his invention , though not adopted by government , was much praised by military men of different nations . A model of it has since been sent to Greece . The riots at Nottingham in this year , made him remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , there was no cry through the kingdom , no inquiry after the perpetrators . But now , when the popular voice was on the side of freedom , and there was some tearing of coats , the nobility and gentry were liberal of their subscriptions to suppress both . It may be mentioned among the evidences of the alarm that prevailed in England of an invasion , that the Morning Chronicle thought it necessary to state , that Mr Secretary Yorke had written to the Lord Lieutenants not to drive the country on the approach of the enemy , but only to remove horses and oxen . ' // The country seems to have been in no state of preparation ; and , indeed , in the temper of the times , it was not easy to select a mode satisfactory to all parties , when the friends of the people beheld in a standing army , the bulwark of the augmenting power and arbitrary measures of the government , and the ministry were too jealous of the revolutionary spirit of the day , to put arms into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular party , and was strenuously urged by the subject of this memoir , to enrol and arm the population . Of this plan Fox writes to Cartwright , that its practicableness was doubtful , even if men could get the better of their alarms at democracy ; but that these alarms made it now impossible . It is vain , ' says he , to hope that you , who mean freedom , can ever get your systems patronized by those , whose wish it is to enslave the country more and more . ' Cartwrigbt was not only extremely apprehensive of an invasion , hut believed that England rather than Ireland would be the scene of it ; an opinion which is justified by the declarations of Napoleon , as given in a well known work . His publication on this subject , called England 's 2Egis , ' appeared , for the first time , in 1804 . In the year following , our politician , whose increasing interest in public affairs rendered his agricultural pursuits irksome to him , let his estate in Lincolnsbire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State of the Nation , ' in a series of letters to the Duke of Bedford , urging the necessity of popular interference by public meetings , for obtaining a reform of representation , and a removal of ministers , He writes on this subject to his friend Wyvill , Alihough the spell of Mr Pitt 's direfril power is broken , it might be as well to let the public see that meetings may once more be held , without being dispersed by servile magistrates . ' The language of the opposition , in regard to the ministry , was , at this period , not a little bitter . Its unexampled profligacy , the abominable corruption of the government , ' the fallen character of the minister , ' freedom betrayed , ' and the wicked audacity of unbridled power , ' are the expressions of Cartxvright , reechoed or justified by his political correspondents . Yet these were by no means always willing to second his movements against this state of things ; and on the occasion of his urging a meeting in Middlesex , he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Dundas , Earls St Vincent and Stanhope , and Grey and Fox , very flattering replies indeed , but all concurring // in the opinion expressed by the last , that it was no time to agitate the question . Indeed , ' says his biographer , this time , in the opinion of many persons , never came at all , ' or , at least , the Major never had the happiness to hit on it . His friend Stanhope seems to have discovered the secret , and fairly confesses himself weary of the dull old road of meetings of the freeholders convened by the aristocracy . We find the unwearied Major busy , nevertheless , at this time , in promoting a meeting in Middlesex , and several other meetings . In November , 1806 , he was invited to stand for Boston , where , as usual , he was unsuccessful in the canvass ; and , in 1807 , he put forth several publications on his favorite political topics . In this year the whigs gave way , in the administration , to a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others , in recommending his systems of defence . Having drawn up the schedules of two bills , one for arming the people , the other for their more complete representation , he was very anxious that his friend , Sir Francis Burdett , should bring them forward during the session of 1808 . Burdett , through indisposition , and from a pretty sober conviction , besides , that he should meet no support , suffered the session to pass without presenting them , to the no small dissatisfaction of the zealous Major , who had spent six months in their preparation . He writes to Lord Stanhope on this subject , The time is flying ; the session draws near its close ; before another , the king of Sweden may cease to reign , Spain may be completely French , Turkey partitioned , and Napoleon in readiness to direct to the destruction of this country , all his immensity of means . ' Such were the terrors of the name , which has passed on the tide of times ' into history . In the affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken out , he felt the same kind of interest as in the advancement of constitutional freedom in his own country . He addressed to the Viscount Materosa , one of the Spanish deputies then in England , several letters on the form of the constitutional government , recommending the same plan of defence that he had proposed for England . He sent him also his newly invented spear . At a meeting held in Middlesex , he moved a resolution approving the reestablishment in Spain , of the ancient government of a kino ' and an independent Cortes , so balanced as to secure liberty . It was this form of polity , formerly common to all the feudal nations , that he wished 10 see restored , in what he considered its purity , to his own // country . He moved another resolution expressive of a hope , which time has sad*y disappointed , that what had been lost to liberty , by the levity and excesses of France , might be regained by the gravity and virtue of Spain . The progress of reform is not slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France , of all the continental nations , is perhaps the nearest to freedom , and Spain the farthest from it . In 1809 , he answered a publication of Lord Selkirk 's , who had argued against the general principles of his constitutional system , chiefly from what he had witnessed of the effects of extensive representation in America . In the August of this year , he exerted himself with some success at a meeting at Hackney , where thanks were voted him for the ability and perseverance he had shown in the cause of parliamentary reform . In August , 1810 , he sold his house at Enfield , and removed to James street , Buckingham Gate , with the same view which had caused his previous removal , that he might , as he said , be nearer his work . ' In the following year , he bestirred himself in getting up a dinner-meeting of the friends of reform , at the Crown and Anchor , which took place on the tenth of June , and , in the same month , it was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that purpose . A letter from Sir Philip Francis , on the subject of this meeting , is worth inserting as entirely characteristic . He says , My resolution on the subject of your kind letter , was founded on experience , and taken with deliberation . I can not alter it . You are the only person to whom it would be unbecoming in me to say , that I am not young enough to embark again in what I believe to be a hopeless enterprise . I doubt the actual existence of an English public , for any great national purpose ; and , if it exists , I am not its debtor . As far as I can judge , the mass of the English population is inert . The country has lost its passions , and is not fit for action . This general opinion is open to exceptions , and you are one of them . ' The distress which prevailed this year , in Nottingham , Derby , and Leicester , deeply wounded the mind of Major Cartwright ; and in the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , he addressed a letter to a respectable frame-work knitter , on their folly and impolicy in destroying property . This letter was circulated gratis in the disturbed districts , and had a salutary effect . In the succeeding year , learning that thirtyeight persons , who had assembled in Manchester // to consider a petition for parliamentary reform , had been apprehended , and sent to gaol fifty miles from their homes , on the charge of having administered an unlawful oath , he determined to go himself to the spot , in order to give them the advantage of a defence . He had the pleasure to find his exertio* rewarded by their acquittal , and he proceeded thence on a kind of political tour , which gave great scandal to the friends of government . It was interrupted , however , by only one unpleasant circumstance . A small number of working mechanics having assembled at Huddersfleld , to pay their respects to the father of reform , ' were disturbed by the appearance of a militia officer , with several constables , who came to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . The business not being conducted in the most polite manner , the spirit of the old reformer was roused , and he sturdily refused to permit his papers to be searched . ' After a long altercation , one of the party , more courteous than the rest , begged as a favor to himself , that the Major would acquiesce in the examination , which ended , and a constable left in attendance , he was allowed to retire to sleep about half past three in the morning , a most unseasonable hour to this veteran of seventythree , who seldom transgressed ten o'clock . Next morning , accompanied by constables , with the additional escort of a crowd of curious spectators , he went in his carriage to the magistrate , who finding nothing more treasonable among his papers than some drafts of petititions , allowed him to pursue his journey . The result of this political tour , was a vast number of petitions got up in various places , of which four hundred and thirty were consigned to the care of our tourist . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure , from the office of the under secretary of state , a copy of the warrant served on him at Huddersfleld . This circumstance with others was stated in a petition , presented in the House of Lords , the first of June , 181 3 , by the late Lord Byron , who said of the petitioner ; He is a man , my lords , whose long life has been spent in one unceasing struggle for the liberty of the subject , against that undue influence which has increased , is increasing , and ought to be diminished ; and whatever difference of opinion may exist as to his political tenets , few will be found to question the integrity of his intentions . Even now , oppressed with years , and not exempt from the infirmities attendant on his age , but // unimpaired in talent , and unshaken in spirit , frangas , non fiectes , he has received many a wound in the comhat against corruption ; and the new grievance , the fresh insult , of which he complains , may inflict another scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied however , a small part of his petition , which consisted chiefly of examples of various obstru*i ? ns to the right of petitioning , and persecutions of those attempting it . This right , it states , inestimable in particular for giving peaceful vent to discontents , is treated as a sort of treason ; while those who exercise it , are stigmatized as criminals , and pursued by violent strainings of the law , and even by courses wholly illegal . The petition was rejected in both the Lords and Commons , on grounds foreign to its merits ; the objection in the latter being the usage of the House , to receive no bill that was printed . In the August of the next year , 1814 , our veteran suffered a severe indisposition , and was , in his own words , so near a certain bourne , that , had not Dr Maton turned me short round , I should probably have slipped in . ' His chief anxiety , however , during this indisposition , was that he might live to finish his letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , two species of traffic which he classed together in enormity . The plan of making the slave trade piracy , since adopted by his own country , and by others , was developed first in these letters . Nine months before the death of the reformer , he had the great satisfaction to find his views adopted in the Message of the President of the United States , and to learn , a few months later , the conclusion of a treaty between this country and Great Britain to the same effect . In 181 5 , he made , in Scotland , a second political tour , during which he delivered some lectures . Having written various letters to the person , who was to continue these after his departure , his widow , two years afterwards , wrote to inform Cartwright , that she had been offered a large sum to give them up to government , and that , in justice to her family , she must close with the proposal . Cartwright answered laconically , that it gave him infinite satisfaction to find that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to make the best bargain she could of their contents . ' it were tedious to mention all the meetings on the subject of reform , of taxes , and of standing armies , attended or promoted by this unwearied champion of the people . His efforts seemed , towards the close of 1816 , to be in a fair way of bearing fruit . // Flattering testimonies of respect were paid him from the many meetings held throughout England , and petitions thronged in from all sides . He surveyed with prodigious satisfaction the coaches employed to transport these huge rolls of parchment from his house to St Stephen 's Chapel . One of these from Manchester , signed by nearly forty thousand persons , was designedly permitted hy Lord Cochrane to unrol as he presented it , and drag its tedious length on the floor . But this prospect was soon clouded hy the panic produced by the Report of the Secret Committee , and Lord Sidmouth 's Circular to the Lord Lieutenants of the disturbed counties . Loyal addresses were got np* the habeas corpus act was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major Cartxvright and his coadjutors ran such risk of being placed in the same conspicuous situation , as Home Tooke and others a few years before , that even his friends began to cast on him the same censures from fright , as his enemies from anger . Our patriot remained xvonderfully unmoved , amidst all this abuse and ridicule , which sometimes reached him from conspicuous quarters . Mr Canning , in his place in the House , called him the old heart in London , from which the veins of sedition in the country were supplied . ' The Times ' said , the reformers had brought back the day of the Crusaders , when , as the story goes , an army marched to the holy city with a goose at its head . The Major set himself to work , nevertheless , to evade the new acts of parliament restricting public assemblies , by setting on foot petitions by twenties . At a meeting in Palace Yard , in the following year , a resolution was adopted for presenting to Major Cartwright , the patriarch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions of half a century ; while the spotless purity of his own life would have done honor to the noblest cause . ' A very different notoriety awaited him in Devonshire , whither he went , not long after , on a visit to Northmore , the poet . A provincial ministerial print pre*xed to the alarming intelligence , in capital letters , the word *BEWARE . ' He published in this year , two political tracts ; in one of them is engraved a model of a polling table , for the purposes of the ballot , a mode of voting advocated by Cartwright from the earliest period of his political researches , though incorrectly spoken of in the Edinburgh Review , as a suggestion of Benthamn 's . We find him sending also to Mr Adams , now President of the United States , the second part of his England 's *gis , ' with // his Appeal to the Nation . ' There is inserted in the biography an answer from Mr Adams to the letter accompanying these , in which he says , You exhibit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost said , the only example of an Englishman who understood , and openly stated , the real inerits of that great question , on which the continued union or severance of Great Britain and her colonies depended , but from which all , or the greater part of the nation , shrank or averted their eyes. * In the year 1819 , our reformer was engaged in an enterprise well fitted to bring down on him the arm of authority , and certainly very novel , as originally projected , to parliamentary and constitutional practice . Learning *that some persons at Birmingham intended , in the words of his biographer , to urge in a manner never before attempted , ' the claim of that town to be represented , he determined to visit Birmingham , and prevail on them to change , in some degree , their object , and mode of proceeding . ' It had been their intention to elect four members , and claim for them a seat in the House ; the Major wished them to elect but one , who should be styled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and who should be empowered to present a letter to the Speaker ; thus , as he said , attempting a new mode of application , by sending a petition in form of a living man , instead of one on parchment . ' The pretty natural consequence of his taking part in these proceedings , was a bill of indictment against him for conspiracy and sedition ; on learning which he left the metropolis , whither he had returned , and rode ninety miles to Leamington , in a single day ( though then in his eightieth year ) , in order to meet the charge , and prevent the warrant 's being served on him in London . Having entered his bail , and returned home , he forthwith applied himself to his favourite objects , as if no prosecution had been hanging over him ; interesting himself in behalf of the sufferers at Manchester , and especially in the proceedings at St Petersfield in this year . He could hardly be persuaded , that the prosecution against himself would be persisted in ; and when he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Roxburgh , whom he had summoned with much sangfroid , My dear lord Duke , you have probably heard of my having been indicted for conspiring against the Constitution . ' To Northmore he says , with more vivacity , The work of hell is already begun , in a gross and flagrant packing of the jury // I am in great hopes this trial may serve the cause of reform . ' When the jury was struck off , he strongly remonstrated against the injustice of limiting the panel to esquires , and argued with such spirit and ability , as to draw an expression of admiration from the master of the Crown Office . As he found his arguments of little avail , he declared he could only consider the manner in which the jury was composed , as a legal assassination of the defendants . ' Had he lived to see the amended jury bill , it would have repaid him amply for this prosecution . On the same day of the month , five years after , Mr Peel proposed to extend the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Major Cartwright as an instance of the extreme inconvenience of the contrary plan . The interval between the notice of trial and the assizes , naturally one of some anxiety to his family , he passed with his usual equanimity . The trial was originally to have come on in March , 1820 , but froni the indisposition of Mr Justice Best , it was postponed , to his great mortification , till August , his friends still flattering themselves that the prosecution xvould be allowed to die away . Meanwhile , he took the chair at a meetiub held to celebrate the birth day of the queen , and petitioned the Commons for reform in parliament , in his own name , and in very uncompromising language . At length , on the fourteenth of August , the trial caine on , and after a defence adapted rather to recommend his political opinions , than ensure his acquittal , for which purpose he did not even produce a witness , he and the other defendants were found guilty . It was not till the 29th of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Court of King 's Bench , when he was sentenced to pay a hundred pounds , and to be imprisoned till it was paid . The judge , while pronouncing sentence , spoke with so much respect of the character of the patriot , that our Major declared that he surely thought he was going to offer him a reward , instead of inflicting a fine . Before he left the Court , he produced from one of his waistcoat pockets , which he always wore of unusual size , a large canvas bag , out of which he deliberately counted a hundred pounds in gold , dryly observing ( though we know not whether he meant to pun ) , that they were all good sovereigns . Very cordial greetings awaited him as he left the court , from his friends , who thought him happy to have escaped a long imprisonment at his ate ; a sentiment he could by no means coincide in , a he thought it hard to pay a // hundred pounds for a delusion , ' that being the only crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political efforts of all sorts , and from this time till his death , he was equally husy in them . He published , among other things , in 1821 , Hints to the Greeks , ' which seemed , as a general omcer remarked , the results of long experience in the art of war ; and wrote , also , some resolutions Ibr a meeting at Hackney , a Letter to the Edinhurgh Reviewers , and his Letters to Lord John Russell . In February , 1823 , was held the last Middlesex mee*in* he ever attended , where , with his usual intractableness , he refused to give up his resolutions for some others proposed , and finally carried them almost unanimously , after having spoken in their favor with great energy He was at a meeting at Lincoln , on the twentysixth of March , and in May , he published The Constitution Produced and Illustrated , ' his last best work , ' as Northmore denominated it , and of which Dr Parr remarked , that the author wrote with more energy the older he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man of his age , capable of producing such a work , adding , in a laughing tone , " except myself . " ' Cartwright was then in his eightyfourth year . On this , as on a former occasion , he was obliged to become his own publisher . He wrote , likewise , a letter to the President of the Greek Congress , and to one of the Greek deputies . It was in the September of this year , that he had the gratification of extending his hospitality to the wives of the two principal leaders in the Spanish Revolution , Quiroga and Riego , who , while their husbands were yet buffeting its storms , had taken refuge in England . They were received under the roof of the aged patriot , with the usual kindness and courtesy of his private demeanor , increased by his interest for the cause in which they were sufferers . In the agonies endured by the family of Riego , while the fate of that unfortunate chief was in suspense , he sympathized so acutely , that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate was sealed , he circulated in all parts of London , a handbill recommending to the friends of liberty to wear mourning , and promoted a subscription for a monument , of which he himself drew the design . On the 9th of February , 1824 , was written the last of his compositions that appeared in print , entitled A Problem . ' // His long and active life was , however , drawing to a close , and he began to be sensible of it . In a visit to Admiral Free .. man , his old messmate , and a brother midshipman at the seafight between Hawke and Conflans , he confessed the feebleness which he carefully bid from his family ; and he told another friend I have strong indications that the old machine is nearly worn out . ' On the 13th of July , 1824 , he had the gratification of receiving from the venerable Jefferson , a long letter on various interesting political topics , the signature of which , he observed with pleasure , was as firm as that of the Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sage of Monticello , and mine of eighty-one years , ensure us a speedy meetin*r ; we may then commune at leisure on the good and evil which , in the course of our long lives , we have both witnessed . ' This letter he answered on the twentyeighth of July . His last effort was to dictate a letter to the Mexican envoy . He was now evidently sinking very fast . Alone with his friend , Holt XVhite , he said to him , White , they would not insure my life at Lloyd 's for a fortnight . ' Amidst his last sufferings , he expressed his surprise that , with a frame so exhausted , he should find it so hard to die , but exclaimed emphatically , God 's will be done ! ' Two days before his death , General Michelena , the envoy spoken of above , sent to inform him that the scheme of Iturbide had failed , and that the liberty of Mexico might he considered as established . ' On hearing it , he exclaimed with fervor , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' These were almost his last words . He expired on the 23d of September , 1824 , being within a few days of the close of his eightyfourth year . He was buried at Finchley , on the thirtieth , followed , according to his desire , by only a single mourning coach ; but numbers of the poor crowded to witness his interment . A subscription for a monument was set on foot a few days after , at the meeting for which his friends and political admirers expressed their sentiments of his public and private worth , in terms which may be best described by a version of the passage from Tacitus , prefixed to his biography . There was nothing he so thirsted for as Liberty . Alike just in all the relations of life , as a citizen , a politician , a husband , and a friend , insensible to interest , pertinacious of right , tin assailable by fear . ' The reader can hardly look back without respect , on this history of a life devoted with energy , and without remission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aimed at objects abstractedly so just , and apparently so conformable to the spirit of the English constitution , that to us in this country , to whom the principles of popular liberty are familiar , the odium into which they brought our reformer , with a large and most respectable portion of the British public , seems somewhat extraordinary , especially as he had for coadjutors , at different times and in his various plans , so many persons of the highest talents and virtue . This may , perhaps , as well as the lukewarmness in his allies , of which he complains so much , be more intelligible from recollecting the general state of parties in England , the particular complexion of the times , and probably some peculiarities of character in our reformist himself . When he first came before the public in that shape , the only political distinction existing in England , was that between Whigs and Tories , of whom it has been said , that the latter believed in the divine right of kings , and the former in the divine right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Whigs ; but besides , that he found among them a very large portion , whose whole political zeal was a struggle for place , it is pretty evident from his work on American Independence , that his ideas respecting the theory of government , and the rights of the people , far outran the doctrines of most of that party . A politician , who had the boldness to argue the question of the colonies , on the broad ground of natural and inherent rights , was not likely to carry along with him , especially with the doctrine of universal suffrage in his train , any large portion of the aristocratical monarchists of England , whose largest notions of liberty hardly transcended the glorious revolution and settlement of 1688 . They did not disdain , indeed , to employ the ancient rights of the people of England , ' as a watchword in their attacks on the power of the crown ; nor were they indifferent to possessing in the House of Commons , a body of independent gentlemen , as a balance to that increasing influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the crown , might extend their views to the obtainment of annual parliaments ; but it is doubtful , whether , among all our reformist 's coadjutors in that body of men , there was one who would have been willing , in the event , to confide to the people such a share in the government as he sought for them , and as his plans , in their accomplishment , would have brought about . // Had Cartwright lived in a republic , we can not help thinking he xvould have made a much better and stancher republican , than he did monarchist . Yet he always professed an attachment to the government of his own country , which we have no reason to doubt . But though he declared it to be of all systems the most admirably adapted , in its purity , to secure happiness and liberty , it is somewhat questionable , whether the rexrtn in representation , by which he would have restored that purity , would be , at this day , and in the altered nature and circumstances of the commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of the English Constitution , *xitb its large tincture of monarchy and aristocracy . The most popular branch of the British parliament is anything but a representative body , in the proper sense of the term , and is composed , for the greater part , of persons placed there by those , who have a deep interest in supporting the power of the crown , and the influence of the aristocracy . That the House of Commons is a great bulwark of the people and liberty ; that it embraces no contemptible amount of intellect and knowledge ; and that , with the aid of that public opinion which , in some way , makes itself heard in all countries , it is a most efficacious check of the monarchical and aristocratical branches of the government , is all evident enough . But Arthur Young spoke very truly , when he denied it to be , even in theory , a representation of the commons of England ; nor is it quite apparent how it can ever become so , with permanent safety to the government in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so in fact , and so effectual to that end wa* the plan he projected , that it could not fail to prove a stone of stumbling to nobility and gentry , who were not quite prepared to see the influence of the other estates transferred so largely , and in the end , perhaps , entirely to the commons . Charles Fox and Home Tooke demurred at his universal suffrage , and one of his Whig friends tells him plainly , that however they might use the people for their own purposes , they could never think of diving power to any but those in whom they could confide . Mr Fox 's sincerity in the cause of reform is very suspicious . It is told of him , that he declared it to be a fine thing for argument in the House , but not fit to be carried into execution , and that he used to say , Whenever any one pushes a plan of reform , say you are for nothing short of vot*. xxv , . - No. 57. 51 // annual parliaments and universal suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the history and political constitution of England , have long been divided into two parties , the first of them contending that the liberties of the commons , especially their right of representation in parliament , are coeval with the Saxon laws , but that they suffered gradual encroachments on the part of the crown ; that they were not originated , but only reasserted , under Charles the First , and subsequently confirmed by the Revolution . The other party , with Mr Hume in the van , have always treated these aIlcient ribhts in the commons as imaginary . They consider the early attacks mentioned in their annals , on the power of the crown , to have been only the resistance of a turbulent aristocracy , by whom the liberties of the commons were as little thought of , as they were themselves impatient of kingly encroachment . These liberties , they assert , are wholly of modern growth , and for this plain reason , that the commons of England were in former days so poor and dejected , that neither had they any property or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a body for any rights to inhere in . Cartwright was of the former school ; and in claiming the right of the people to general representation , and the restoration of annual parliaments , he deemed himself to be vindicating nothing more than the ancient privileges of the English commons . But it was not on this ground merely , that he made his stand for these rights of representation and annual election , declaring them to be as unalienable as that liberty whose chief security they were , and which he asserted to depend neither on charters , laws , nor usage . With all respect for the politicians , who busied themselves with this controversy , it seems to us that however interesting as a portion of history , it went but a little way towards settling the real point of dispute between them , which was , after all , only a question of more or less popular influence in parliament . To politic*d reasoners on this side of the water , who take the safety of the people for the supreme law , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about forms so obsolete as those debated in this controversy , appears of little moment ; and the importance attached to it by both sides , only serves to show how apt men are , in the language of lawyers , stare decisis , and to shrink from the admission of principles , which may involve they know // not what deviation from the existing order of things . The adherents of the established system could scarcely have insisted , however , that it was unchangeable according to the circumstances of society and property , else they might have been at some loss to defend the happy revolution of 1688 , or excuse the coming in of king William of glorious memory , any more than the invasion of William the Conqueror . The advocates of reform hardly required the authority of ancient usage , for changes which they justified on a much broader ground . Neither party , in truth , cared to express openly , the one its aristocratical , and the other its popular inclinations . As it must have been pretty obvious to both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been to produce a body unlike any practically known to the constitution , since the day of the Roman Conquest at least , it can excite no wonder , that the question should be regarded by the adherents of government , as a conflict between monarchy and democracy . However correctly our reformer may have construed the ancient English constitution , and however auspicious his aims to the general cause of liberty , their results to the existing institutions of his country were somewhat more questionable . There were not a few , however , who , either from party zeal or conviction , cooperated with him in the propagation of his views , and declared , as Lord Shelburne expressed himself that the house of Commons ought to be free in every circumstance of its constitution , and that the rights of the people consisted in annual elections , and a total change of the representation . ' But it would appear , that a great many of these found a sudden change come over the spirit of their dream , ' on the breaking out , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The storm seemed so portentous , and threatened such trouble in the whole social and moral atmosphere , that many good patriots were alarmed at the very name of reform , and clung steadfastly to church and state , as to a plank in shipwreck . Public opinion in England suffered a sudden revulsion , in which the minister would seem to have had his full share ; for the arbitrary measures , by which he enforced the public quiet , caused no small astonishment to the friends of reform , and leave his respect for liberty somewhat of a problem at this day . Our reformer , on the contrary , separating the principles from the practice of his FrencA* // neighbors , with none of the sensibilities of the aristocracy , moreover , on the score of their influence , or of the cler*y , it may be presumed , for the safety of the church , could be brought to see no reason against the correction of abii*ses at home , in the excesses which had attended it abroad ; but rather an argument for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people was the best security against their violcace . He had besides , all his life , had very little respect for the expediency , ' which both foes and friends had so often tPrown in the path of his efforts ; and he avowed , that the only sort he could conceive of was the restoring of affairs to their just basis , the ancient , free , English Constitution . Even had the justness of his construction of it been more apparent , the wisdom of this pertinacity , at such a crisis , may create mother doubt . It is a bootless task to struggle against popular &amp;a.ms , in seasons of peculiar excitement ; but , on the other hand , it is scarcely a more favorable period for reform , when thin ccrrent of public affairs runs smooth , and the rocks , which threaten the bark of state , are overlooked in the tide of prosperity . The various publications of Major Cartwright , of which we have mentioned many , and of which a copious list is subjoined to his biography , were chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His English Constitution Produced and Illustrated ' contains the substance of these , which , indeed , might be included in two ; the necessity of an actual representation of the people , to express their will ; and of arming them , in order to enforce it . In all his writings there is manifest a fervent love of liberty ; a refejence of it to immutable principles of our nature ; and a strong bias in favor of popular rights and power . With opinions and sentiments of this complexion , and zith bis inflexibleness in asserting them , he would naturally d*axv on himself detraction and ridicule from a very large patty of the British public . They , who thought he aimed at nothing less than to pull down the state , were easily led to think that his private manners answered to these mischievous political desio.ns . From the distinguished names , which he numbered among his correspondents and allies , it may be supposed , however , that this blind prejudice was confined chiefly to the vulgar , who are found in all parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who differed from him on fundamental points of politics , have rendered justice to the integrity of his motives . We // have seen what eulogium was passed on him by Mr Fox in parliament , and the very judge , who sentenced him on his conviction for the transactions at Birmingham , bore testimony to his public as well as private honesty . From personal ambition he seems to have been entirely free ; I would always , ' he says , rather support than move ; ' and provided things were well done , he was quite careless of appearing in them . 1-us darling objects advanced so slowly to accomplishment , that it was happy for him he possessed a most ahounding patience , being content , ' he was used to say , to deposit the acorn in the ground , provided posterity might live under the branches of the oak . ' A person once exclaimed , on hearing some instance of this noble indifference to private gain , They will never persuade me that this man wants a revolution , that he may share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence of principle , he gave an example in the case of his brother , Dr Cartwright . When this gentleman received ten thousand pounds from parliament , to indemnify him for losses on inventions , which have so materially benefited Engla ud , the Major , though he had unrepiniiigly sacrificed for him a large part of his own fortune , would make no interest on the occasion , with the members , because he was of opinion that government was not hound to indemnify individuals for losses in private speculations . ' In his domestic manners he was the very reverse of the uncompromising champion , that he appeared in the arena of public concerns . He was very accessible to such as wished to consult him , especially if they required his assistance . As these could approach him without introduction , he sometimes suffered from his unguarded charity , which embraced equally all parties and sects . Like all good-hearted people , he was extremely fond of children , in whose sports he would join with great glee , saying , like the Vicar of Wakefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of happy human faces . ' Notwithstanding his incessant occupation with politics , he introduced them rarely into conversation , and discussed them with temper . He had some facility of adapting his conversation to his company , and added to this feature of a polite man , a fund of information and agreeable anecdote , gathered from his various conversation with men . By the poor , whose friend he was , as well in private life as in politics , he was highly beloved . He was a model of punctuality in business , especially in answering letters , of which Cobbett says ( if he be authority // for anything ) , that he wrote a hundred in a week , hy way of episode to his other labors , ' which were not small , as he left behind not less than eighty works on various subjects . This studious labor was the counterpart of his industry in pursuing his public aims . Indeed , the most remarkable feature of his character , was , as we have said , his dauntless perseverance . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenience and difficulty ; nor the certainty of obloquy and ridicule , ever turned him from his purpose . His own insensibility to these , led him to exact the same diligence from others , with too little allowance for circumstances , and perhaps some slight degree of intolerance , lie was heartily tired of the delays of his political friends , and the nearer they approached what he deemed the indispensable point , the higher his anxiety rose that they should leave nothing undone . But this pertinacity may be fairly set down to his solicitude for the public weal , rather than any conceit in his own judgment , as he was willing enough to follow , if others would only go on . He was very anxious to inspire his own firmness into all his political coadjutors . When Hobhouse was committed to Newgate , the old Major , hearing that his friends advised some kind of recantation , in order to shorten his imprisonment , hurried off to exhort him against it ; but , ' said he , I found my errand unnecessary ; the youn* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great glee , that when the meeting and dinner took place at the Crown and Aiichor in 1809 , for the promotion of parliamentary reform , at which more than twelve hundred persons attended , there was one man present , who was after his own heart . This man , having had his shoulder dislocated , in getting into the room , went to a surgeon to have it set , and then returned to the dinner . Lie acted pretty steadfastly on his favorite maxin* , that a great deal might be done , not only by striking while the iron was hot , but by striking it till it was hot . His feeling on the subject of public concerns coincided with that of Lord Charlemont , who thought that in the pursuit of what is right or salutary , no patriot should be discouraged by defeat , since , though he should not live to witness success , he may lay a foundation for the success of his survivors . So Cartwright , writing to the Duke of Bedford , exclaims , Surely , my Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose means are corrupt , to he afraid of making efforts till they have conviction they shall succeed . In the best sense // they always succeed . In such a cause , defeat is far from disgrace . They cause discussion , which , when they do not deviate into faction , is the soul of their cause . ' One feature of faction , at least , made no part of our reformer 's character . Regarding human nature on the bright side , and interpreting most favorably the actions of others , he was averse to all detraction and personal abuse , and discountenanced by his example that indiscriminate invective , which has been everywhere the scandal of party politics . His private conversation was remarked for a scrupulous regard to truth , as well as for simplicity of language . His diction was in this , as in his writings , forcible and pithy , but not exaggerated . His manner had no vehemence . In his argumentative compositions , the matter is often diffuse , and the manner desultory , for he had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ignorance of which gave perhaps to his English style that purity and correctness , for which it has been admired by good critics . As he advanced in age , his style became more compressed , and his last writings , when upwards of eighty , are acknowledged to be his best . In public , where he often appeared as a speaker , he made no pretensions to oratory . He went strait about convincing his hearers , dealing out good sense in correct language , but at a length which was sometimes tedious to those less zealous than himself , and which was the theme of some ridicule with the presses to which he was obnoxious . He was generally heard , however , with respect and even deference ; and it was bis great influence , no doubt , with a large class , which made him the conspicuous mark for ribaldry and ridicule . But though his delivery was usually cold and deliberate , he was sometimes animated to warmer efforts . When noticing , on one occasion , some unjust aspersions on Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recollections of his favorite profession , drew from him a burst of eloquence , which excited the continued plaudits of the assembly . Though familiar with defeat in his public career , he has given some examples of political perspicacity , and aided in the accomplishment of some objects , which both entitle him to the merit of a wise politician , and establish his claim as a benefactor of mankind . His boldness in foreseein1* , and in his suggestions for preventin* , the issue of the American war : that firmness in resisting abuse . to which his country is perhaps // indebted , in a good degree , for her improved jury bill ; even his justification of the French Revolution , while , with many good and wise patriots , its excesses had caused its first principles to be forgotten ; are , among others , evidences of a firm purpose , and a sagacious mind . Even in cases where his policy may seem more questionable , his merit is not small , who , amidst the crowd of wicked and scheming politicians , receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to whom his enemies can only object , that he is mistaken .
