Mine are the red autumnal skies  --  The wither 'd leaf  --  the perish 'd flower  --  The charms of nature in decay  --  The knell of summer 's wasted day  --  The last bird 's song in the faded bower . PREFACE . Let those who may chance to open this little volume for the purpose of criticism , here be assured that it contains nothing worthy of their attention . It is the earliest essay of a youthful muse , designed as an humble offering to a dear circle of friends , whose partiality and patronage have not unfrequently cheered an hour of gloom and despondency ; and also to those noble bosoms who not only love to uprear and nourish every little bud of genius , but feel a generous pride in overlooking the faults of inexperience , and in forgiving the presumptions of a youthful mind , which as yet knows no direction but the impulse of its own wild , untaught nature . Every careful person will readily acknowledge the unprudence of young authors publishing their first productions . Even the immortal Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considerations which would render such a step not only allowable , but advisable ; and those considerations , too , might originate in something independent of the author 's merit . Since the Prospectus for this work was issued , the author has indulged in many a bitter hour of despondency ; for at times she felt herself wholly incapable of maintaining the place she had so imprudently assumed . Yet when she seriously reflected on the motive which had induced her to the undertaking , she felt new confidence , and determined to proceed . She would , however , assure the Public , that she is not blinded to her own imperfections , and that she indulges no sanguine expectations with regard to her little volume . It is indeed a mere trifle ; yet humble as it is , those for whom it was originally designed , will not disdain to receive it . The Dramatic Piece was not originally designed for publication ; and it was the advice of a literary friend that induced its appearance in this collection . The story from which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the drama pursues the story in sentiment , style and plot , too closely , to claim the merit of originality . She is fully sensible that there can be but little to interest the stranger in the " unpremeditated effusions " of a young female , whose life has been principally devoted to the performance of duties , which are calculated to employ almost every exertion of the mind , and who has consequently but sparingly enjoyed the advantages of study and meditation  --  those indispensable requisites in forming a finished scholar . Any thing produced under the influence of such circumstances , can not rationally be expected to emulate the refined eloquence of a Landon , or the rich variety of a Hemans . Yet such a trifle , if treated with indulgence , might possibly prove a stepping-stone to something less unworthy to occupy a place in the temple of literary applause .

Sir William Wallace This passage , my brave lads : Hear ye the shouts , The fiend-like yells of victory ? On  --  on ! Perchance some noble Scot has dar 'd to scorn The vile usurper 's might ; perchance he bleeds In just defence of freedom 's holy right And Scotland 's ancient priv'lege . Lo ! the moon Lights up our rugged path : Yon rising star  --  Alas , my Marion ! this is the hour I was to meet thee , love ! But hush , my heart , Thy tender breathings ; they but ill beseem The holy ire that nerves the warrior 's soul To deeds of glory ! Hark , another shout ! On , on ! Attendants . Attendants We follow thee  --  Wallace . Sir William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  An apartment in Ellerslie Castle Lady Marion . Lady Marion O , I have waited long and lonely here ; And yet he comes not ! I have watch 'd the moon Through half her nightly course ; and lo , she sinks Behind the western hills . The rising star , The signal of his coming , now looks down Three hours on the horizon ! Ah , methinks The fates have dealt unkindly ! I would fear  --  But hark , there is a sound ! A chieftain 's form Emerges from the mountain shadow . Lo ! ' T is gone ! ' t is gone ! The setting moon did fling A parting gleam athwart the lonely cliffs . And mock 'd my tremulous sight . The wild young breeze , In reckless mirth , did strike its joyous wing Against the mountain firs , and told to echo  --  A sound like that of distant hoofs . Alas ! If peril hovers o'er my lord  --  if he Be doom 'd to suffer wrong  --  ah , would that I Might share his pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in Scottish realms Are not hostilities forgotten ? Lo , The nobles yield their castles to the usurper . And smile and fawn on Edward and his minions , And kiss the hand that rivets on their chains ; While the poor peasantry forget the rights Of sacred liberty and their own firesides , And in mistaken reverence of those Who are no longer lords , but crouching slaves , They coolly view the ravage of their homes , And lift not up the hand of opposition ! Now the portentous calm of liberty , Entomb 'd without a struggle , spreads its reign O'er this devoted clime , and peace is here . Alas , the inglorious peace of barter 'd freedom ! Contention thus being over , whence could rise A peril to my lord ? Is not Monteith , ( The noble son of a most noble sire ) , Who took my Wallace hence , indeed a friend ? He comes  --  oh bliss , he comes : I see his plume Wave in the moon 's last beam . ' T is he ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tartan 's folds : He comes to meet his anxious Marion . Where art thou now , my Wallace ? O , my Wallace ! ' T was but the shadow of a quick-wing 'd cloud That mock 'd my tortur 'd vision ! all is hush 'd ; The lonely mountain lists no passing step ; No chieftain 's plume is dark in Luna 's beam ; And the proud cliff looks pale ! Not yet , not yet ; What evil has betided thee , my husband ? Ye spirits of the air  --  ye viewless forms Of unembodied bliss  --  ye happy shades Invisible  --  ye ever living things , That hover o'er the virtuous  --  I have caught Your unearthly hymnings , when the mournful watch Of night 's dark noon did gloom the face of nature , And the pale trembling stars look 'd awfully distant ; And ye have whisper 'd joy to this sad heart In seasons of its loneliness : Alas , Why have ye left me now ? The deep , rich tone , Which nature 's pure devotion loves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloud Of dark forebodings bov'ring o'er my soul , And feeling shrinks from something yet unmask 'd By dread futurity ! Enter Halbert . Hal . Halbert Where is my master ? Alas , what means his long protracted stay ? Marion . Lady Marion Would I could tell thee , Halbert , Wak'st thou yet ? Methought all eyes in Ellerslie were shut . Save Marion 's ! Hal . Halbert Ah , gentle lady , sleep Sits strangely on the aged Halbert 's couch , When Wallace is away . Marion . Lady Marion Thou faithful one , The generous love thou bear'st thy noble master , Shall make thee dearer to his Marion 's heart , Ah , dost thou weep ? Hal . Halbert Seest thou yon little star ? Marion . Lady Marion I 've watch 'd it long : ' T was with its rising beam My Wallace promis 'd to return ! Hal . Halbert Behold , How black a cloud is passing o'er it now ! Marion . Lady Marion Indeed , its light is hid . Ah , thinkst thou not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Scotland 's glory , Shrouded in tyranny 's deep midnight pall . Marion . Lady Marion Name not our country 's wrongs . If Wallace live , What more can Marion ask ? Hal . Halbert Or Halbert ? Marion . Lady Marion See ! The little star looks bright again : Perchance , To-morrow 's sun will smile away our fears , And joy again be found in Ellerslie . Go then and seek thy rest ; thy hoary head , Methinks , not well beseems such weary hours Of unacquainted watchfulness . Mean time , I too will court the soothing arms of sleep . Hal . Halbert I will obey thee , lady : I will seek , But thou hast not commanded me to find . The shield of heaven be o'er thee and thy Lord . Exit . Marion . Lady Marion And thee , good Halbert . Here I 'll rest my head On this soft cushion ; it has often prest The warm cheek of my Lord , when listless noon Sat on his sultry throne . Ah , it shall steal Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fling their light athwart my throbbing brow : And I shall leave this weary sense of pain , And dance along the beauteous field of love ; And flowers shall crowd beneath my joyous feet . And then I 'll pluck the bright wing of the morn , And soar away to thee ; and then I 'll sing The song thou lov'st , my little " Thusa ha . " A singing voice without . Hark ! are they coming ? Have they spread their feast ? I hear a sweet voice  --  an unearthly tone : It is the breath of opening paradise  --  Or bright-wing 'd wanderer from elysian climes , Mingling the echo of his mystic harp With the responsive sigh of earth-wak 'd music . Voice without . Voice without 1 . The white moon is sinking , O'er the flower-crown 'd steep , And its last ray is drinking The wave of the deep ; A bright star is beaming  --  The signal star , And a fond heart is dreaming Of one afar . 2 . The young breeze is blowing On the brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a chieftain 's side . Bright angels are keeping Their silent watch . And pure spirits are weeping O'er the slumbering Scots ! 3 . A lone one is sighing In the night 's pale ear , And the rocks are replying To a chieftain 's spear . ' T is passing  --  ' t is over , The black deed is done , And the widowed lover Is on earth alone ! 4 . Lo , the pure one 's spirit Is borne on high , With saints to inherit Immortality : The woes of the oppressed She shall not see ; She is blest with the blessed ; With the free she is free ! 5 . Young freedom is raising Her standard on high , And her beacon is blazing In each chieftain 's eye . She is timidly waving Her blood-earn 'd plume , While a tyrant 's engraving A seal for her tomb ! 6 . She is fallen  --  she rises  --  The struggle is o'er , The tyrant 's last footstep Is hear 'd on her shore ! The bright hand of glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say Scotland is free ! Marion . Lady Marion Hist ! Do I dream ? or is there indeed a voice Prophetic in my ear ? I felt a calm Steal softly o'er my soul ; and then there came Such melody of thought  --  such sooth 'd sensation , That I did deem myself a little wild-rose , Blooming where green boughs sigh 'd and fountains murmur 'd , And stars breath 'd spiritual music . Lo , ' t is gone , And I will smile , and say it was a vision Of sunny beauteous things , so sweetly blent , They seem 'd all like a seraph 's radiant hand Sweeping his harp of love . Come , gentle spirit , Sweet soother of the weary heart , and light ; Again thy passing beam of heaven , and fling Its rich glow o'er my soul . Delightful sleep , Angels might yield to thee .

The solemn calm which reigns o'er Ellerslie , Seems like the breathless moment of suspense , When two proud hosts meet on the opposing field , And face to face , await in awful silence , The signal of the battle . Do I hear The sound of tramping hoofs ? They near apace : It must be he . Oh , blessed Virgin  --  blood ! Enter two of Wallace 's attendants , bearing a wounded stranger . What is the matter ?

Hide thy wrongs , Poor , bleeding , suffering Scotland ! I would rise And hurl the tyrant from his usurp 'd throne , And place thee on the mount of fame and freedom . But  --  but , alas ! ' t is vain ; and I will quench The holy flame of patriotic fire Which rushes thro ' my soul . With thee , with thee , Angel of Ellerslie  --  sweet spirit of love ; With thee will Wallace shut himself from man , And dream of freedom !

Heaven bestows No dearer privilege on wayward man , Than to relieve a fellow mortal 's woes , To heal his wounds , and pour the balm of peace . A virtuous deed repays itself with gain . Could she who is the wife of William Wallace . Feel aught but kindness springing in her heart , Ill worthy would she be to soothe the pain Of one whom he could risk his life to save . Stran .

Marion . Lady Marion Alas , What treachery ? Is any aim 'd at thee , My husband ? Mar . Margaret None at William Wallace , lady , Which is not shared by every true-born Scot . Our country is degraded , and she was torn From her high eminence of glorious freedom By horrid treachery ! Do not the instruments of Edward 's power Swarm in our land ? The plund'ring Heselrigge , With yester 's rising sun , dispatch 'd his nephew To Bothwell castle , with an armed force , To seek out traitorous papers , ( base pretence , To shield them from the epithet of robbers ! ) But I did scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vengeance . To appeal Against so black a deed of tyranny . I sought the haughty governor of Lanerk . And laid the case before him . He avow 'd The whole transaction ; and with something like A smile of cold contempt and nettled pride , He bade me go in peace . I left his gates , But ere I had proceeded many paces , His nephew cross 'd my path . " Now , " he exclaim 'd , While fiercely dreadful roll 'd his eyes of rage , " Thou hoary headed villain , I will wreak My vengeance on thee . Down with Bothwell 's lord , My noble lads , and all its wealth is your 's  --  All save the beauteous Helen . " Fierce indeed The contest that ensued .

It was among his last requests , that Mar Should be my dearest charge , save thee alone , I sought the silent well , and calling thrice , Receiv 'd no answer ; but my blazing torch Threw its bright beam athwart the wounded Earl . He spoke not , mov 'd not , and his wrinkled brow Wore the sad hue of death . I sought in vain Some generous aid , to raise his cold remains From their low gloomy bed .
