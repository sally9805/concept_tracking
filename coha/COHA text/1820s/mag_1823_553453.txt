txt ART . XXII. - The Loves of the . /lngels ; a poem . By Thomas . Mioore . New York and Philadelphia , reprinted , 1823 . MR MooRE 's talents are unquestionably peculiar , both as to their extent and their character . He has given to English literature a poetry equally delightful and original ; and in some of the lesser and lower requisites of poetry-in exquisite melody of language and sparkling elegance of imagery-no one has approached him . He is the great song writer of this day ; and ages have passed , since a poet lived , who could compress within the compass of a short and simple melody the graceful tenderness , the spirit and the system , that place Moore 's songs upon the pianos and in the mouths of all the singing men and women in his own land or in ours. * And this is not all ; he is almost as powerful in satire as in song . In some of his political pieces , there are , mingled with much nonsense and weakness , sarcasms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to his malice . But he has tried* a yet higher flight , than either song or satire ; in Lalla Rookh he failed somewhat , because he could not make long poems as much better than any one else , as he could songs , but no reader of poetry could begin any one of the tales in that book , and leave it unfinished , and no one could read many pages there , and not feel the burning thoughts and words , which came from no lips untouched with fire . * Mr Campbell 's patriotic son , , s are too sublime to enter into this comparison , and belong to the highest order of lyric poetry . // *54 April , So much praise we willingly concede to him ;  --  and it is lamentable , that powers so admirable should be associated with qualities , which merit the severest reprehension , and must excite disgust . We do not speak too strongly . Mr Moore bears about with iiim the burthen of depraved , licentious tastes , and his genius is cramped and polluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , for it is not difficult to trace in his writings the effort to be pure , struggling with the habit of being gross ; the strife of endeavor and resolution in conflict with this determined depravity . It is no little praise to say , that he really seems to have striven and fought in earnest , and the success , which must result from such endeavors , has already rewarded him in a degree commensurate with the reality and earnestness of his exertions . Moore has constantly grown better as a poet , and-. - so far as his poetry is a test-as a man , since he first came before the public . It is not many years since it was a rude and indecorous thing to speak to a lady of Anacr*on Moore ; and an expurgated edition of his four volumes , original and translated , would have made so very thin a book , it was not thought worth the publication . From this abyss he emerged , and made many good songs , which might be read or sung by any one . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unexceptionable . After this course of preparation , he made his great attempt , and wrote Lalla Rookh , in which there is absolutely nothing , that should keep it out of a decent parlor . At present he has taken one step farther , and published the Loves of the Angels . We were almost about to say , that this was a retrograde step , but it would be perhaps rather more just to say , that he is but where he was , and the rooted vulgarity of his tastes and the sensual tendency of his imagination are made more distinctly visible by his staining such a subject with their pollution ; he has chosen to unite the holiest of created existences with the holiest of passions , to make himself a theme ; and we feel , that it was a profanation to approach his work with gross impurity clinging to him . We would not , however , be understood to charge Mr Moore with hypocrisy in treating religious matters with occasional demonstrations of reverence . We verily believe , that he has much regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he makes Sacred Songs , ' and breathes an aspiration after heavenly // things-sometimes-in heartfelt sincerity . The leaven of earlier corruption has , however , not yet done its work , and while we gladly acknowledge , that a good influence is apparently active in separating the pure from the impure principles within him , we may regret , that the dregs still rise so frequently to contaminate the whole . We would however do him justice , and therefore admit , that he often seems to strive to give his poetry-as he has given the Ilinda of his Fire-worshippersA soul , too , more than half divine , Where through some shades of earthly feeling , Religion 's softened glories shine , Like light through summer foliage stealing . ' It is unfortunate , that he does not oftener succeed in the attempt ; but tastes and habits confirmed by long indulgence are not to be overthrown in a moment , and he is himself as yet , if we may use such a comparison , but as a fallen angel ; with a voice attuned to celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wing , which should have borne him up to the empyrean , folded in weakness , and glittering , but with the night dews of earth ; aspiring to reascend to heaven , but doomed by his own depravity to wander here . The name of this poem has been long before the public , and with some seemed of itself to be quite proof enough , that the poem must be absurd and ridiculous . We confess we were not disposed to think so . Irseemed to us not impossible , that Mr Moore had been induced to choose this subject by the consciousness , that he could touch it without profanation , or by the hope , that the contemplation of such things would purify and elevate his mind . We did venture to hope , the poet would have been borne upward by his theme from the licentiousness of his prevalent imaginations , into loftier and purei* feelings . We have been disappointed . His thoughts seem to have wandered to heaven , only to seek and find there new luxuries for the revelling of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his failure not to any unfitness in his subject to become the theme of the loftiest song , but to his inability to attain unto it . Few poets have dared to pass the flaming bounds of space and time , ' and give their imaginations lea*.re to range among the endless and boundless existences of an imperishable world . There are , however , instances , in which authors of ima*ina // tion have essayed to lift themselves above the smoke and stir of this dim spot , which men call earth . ' All the beauty of Hogg 's most beautiful poem arises from the conceptions of spiritual existence , with which it is stored , and which , whether correct or false , are distinct and glowing . To come nearer home , our own Irving has written few things so sweet and touching , so solemn and yet so delightful , as his reflections on St IVIark 's eve . Why is it that subjects of this kind are so rarely attempted ? Is it thought , that , as the flowers which bloom where spirits live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be sung over the decay of the dying or the ruins of the dead ; - that nothing of contrast is there ;  --  the brightness of noon is not preceded by the awakening beauty of the dawn , or followed by the dying hues of sunset ;  --  and no clouds are there to arrest the sunbeams , and clothe themselves with its glory ? It may seem , that this stern necessity of our nature compels us to rest in the belief , that nothing can have to us any distinctness or life , that nothing is placed within the grasp of our conception , but the things which grow and perish on the surface of the earth ; it is , however , most certainly any thing but pleasant to believe this . In exact proportion as the brutal parts of our nature are enthralled by the nobler attributes of humanity , we are dissatisfied with the littleness and worthlessness of all things about us , and , refusing to regard the objects of this life , as an adequate end to our endeavors , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves in imagination and in hope to heaven . There are moments in the life of most men , when there is a feeling , as if darkness and chains had broken away ; when the affections are pure and peaceful , and the thoughts are ranging free and high ; when the existence , the love , and the presence of God are borne in upon our souls , with a power , thmit will not be wiThstood , and the heart is swelling , as if it would open to receive the whole influence of the Deity . We may well believe it is at such times , that man is most like to that which his spirit may be ; and how idle would it seem to him , or rather what a loathing horror would it excite to tell him then , that his mind could not wander beyond th' grave , and must rest satisfied with the belief , that they , whom he had loved and lost , were spiritual essences , without form or substance , // which his hands might as well lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach . Every thing in his heart and in his mind would rise up to refute the falsehood ; there would be a voice within him too loud and too distinct to be misunderstood or disregarded , and it would tell him , that the world of spirits is not an unimaginable abyss of nothingness , but the home of sentient , active beings , as conscious of individuality , and as full of thought and of affection , as they were before they went from time into eternity . The doctrines of a future state are not to be proved by logical deductions from the truths our senses teach . It was well said by the author of the Light of Nature , ' that not one in a hundred was ever satisfied with the arguments brought to prove the existence of God and another life , unless he was convinced , that these propositions were true , before he began to reason about them ; because they , whose hearts and intellects are shrouded in a darkness , which is not penetrated by the higher proof to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition of the soul-can scarcely be enlightened by the feebler ray of reason . All knowledge and all belief rests , of course , upon intuition , as its first and necessary foundation ; but is it therefore true , that the belief of spiritual truths must be referred to sensual perceptions , as its only primary source ? There is an intuition of the soul , as of the eye . Man does not believe in his Maker , b*ecause he can institute a train of reasoning , a series of exact and logical inferences , and then feel his mind persuaded by his own arguments ; but because he sees him ; - sees him in clouds , and hears him in the wind ;  --  and though argument and inference may afterwards sustain and confirm him in this belief , it could scarcely have originated from them , for it is only to those who already believe and feel , that there is a God , that his power and love are borne upon every sunbeam , and uttered in the breathing of every wind . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more to prove the reality of the sanctions of a future state , than is done in Butler 's Analogy ; yet all that is done there is to show , that the probability of this truth is sufficiently strong to warrant our acting upon it . Reasonihg , mere argument , can do no more ; but is there not in the heart of every man , who has any religion , a deep conviction , that far more than // this is true ? When infidelity denies the infini4 and eternal attributes of God , and urges , that the power , and wisdom , and love manifested in the universe prove the existence and operation of a cause adequate to the effects that appear-that is , of a God , if we please to say so , clothed with enough of divine attributes to make the world as it is , but that they do not prove , that there is one with sufficient love , or wisdom , or power , to make the world better than it is , it is not reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , but the heart that replies , for all the sin and suffering , the weakness and the wretchedness of man , and for all the disorder and desolation , which man has inflicted like a curse upon the world , we know that he who made it is love and wisdom . We know then that God is illimitable , and that we live again , not because we can go back logically from effects through causes to a first cause , and not because we can gather from a world of ceaseless change , where every change of every thing is but a step towards decay and dissolution , proof of a coming state , which shall be eternal and absolute ; but because , whenever earthly feelings do not so close around us , as to shut out every glimpse of heaven , we can see and feel , that there is a power somewhere , which can be limited and controlled by no other power , and that , while our bodies perish , the life that is in us dieth not . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts with as much force the character and condition of the eternal world , as its existence . We are driven by the necessity of our nature , to give a form and an individual existence to every thing , which we would make the subject of thought . There is not a sermon written from the heart , or preached with power , that does not speak of departed spirits , as perfectly retaining their recollections , their affections , their consciences , their identity . We can not speak to a child , of heaven , and hid him be good , that he may go up from the grave and live there happily , but we give him at once an idea of another life , differing little from this in its external and apparent circumstances . We can not stand by the bed of the dying , and comfort him who is convulsed with the agonies and tremblinb with the horrors of death , but by awakening within his soul the hope and the belief , that his being is sown a natural body , to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to be ,  --  still to be a man with all the thoughts and feelings , // which make him such , unharmed , untouched by the dis-. ease , which restores the frame he no longer needs to its original elements . Now these imperious , these unavoidable convictions of the mind and heart , upon which rest all the truths that dignify , and all the hopes which cheer humanity , should scarcely he considered as nothing more than the necessary weaknesses and wanderings of imperfect beings . Are they not rather glimpses of light permitted to shine upon our upward path , that we may not be in utter ignorance whither it shall lead ? At any rate , who will deny , that impressions of an individual and substantial existence in another life are sufficiently strong a2d universal to give the most profound and spirit-stirring interest to poetry adequate to them ? It seems from the preface , that the Loves of the Angels was originally much more limited in extent , and somewhat different in its character . It was intended as an episode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing , but finding that lord Byron had chosen the same subject for a drama , he chose to come first before the public , that he might  --  to use his own words- ' give himself the chance of a heliacal rising , before the luminary , in whose light he was to be lost , should appear . ' The Loves of the Angels is hardly as interesting as Lalla Rookh . There are in it no very striking passages , at least none that strike us as exhibiting so much power as many in the different tales of his larger work , though it contains much beautiful poetry , together with an abundance of conceits , which are generally more remote and obscure , than Moore 's images are apt to be . There is not enough of story , and what little there is of it is not very well imagined or very well told ; upon the whole , we should say it had fewer beauties and fewer faults , rather less nonsense , and decidedly more dulness , than any thing he has written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin it himselfTwas when the world was in its prime , When the fresh stars had just begun Their race of glory , and young Time Told his first birth-days by the sun ; When , in the light of Nature 's dawn Rejoicing , men and angels met On the high hill and sunny lawn ,  - -  Ere Sorrow came , or Sin had drawn Twixt tuna and heaven her curtain yet ! // When earth lay nearer to the skies , Than in these days of crime and wo , And mortals saw , without surprise , In the mid-air , angelic eyes Gazing upon this world below . * * * * One evening , in that time of bloom , On a hill 's side , where hung the ray Of sunset , sleeping in perfume , Three noble youths conversing lay ; And as they look 'd , from time to time , To the far sky , where Daylight furl 'd His radiant wing , their brows sublime Bespoke them of that distant worldCreatures of light , such as still play , Like motes in sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transmit each moment , night and day , The echo of his luminous word ! Of heaven they spoke , and , still more oft , Of the bright eyes , that charni 'd them thence ; Till , yielding gradual to the soft And balmy evening 's influenceThe silent breathing of the flowersThe melting light , that beam 'd above , As on their first , fond , erring hours Each told the story of his love , The history of that hour unblest , When , like a bird , from its high nest Won down by fascinating eyes , For Woman 's smile he lost the skies . The first who spoke was one , with look The least celestial of the three- * * * Sighing , as through the shadowy Past , Like a tomb-searcher , Memory ran , Lifting each shroud that Time had cast O'er buried hopes , he thus began . ' Then the first angel tells his story . He came to earth once on a time , upon some business which is not *particularly mentioned , and saw accidentally Lea ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she proved to be purer than he , and , though she loved him , it was without passion . After a while , // 1823 . Moore 's Loves of the singels. when it was about time for him to think of returning home , there happened to be a festival , at which Lea and her angellover were present ; here , for the first time , he drank that liquor , Whose drops , like those of rainbows , smile Upon the mists that circle man , Bright'ning not only earth the while , But grasping heaven , too , in their span ! ' that is to say , wine ! The banquet over , he sought her in her accustomed bower , and while telling her he must soon depart , and soliciting some slight favor as a token of her love , he accidentally alluded to the spell word , which would expand his wings , and bear him to heaven . She eagerly demanded to know that spell , and promised on that condition to bless him ; he told the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her shoulders , and she flew to heaven , leaving her lover essaying in vain to follow her ; for his power had departed , and his wings were paralyzed . The fo*lowing passage describes this catastrophe with spirit : While thus I spoke , the fearful maid , Of me , and of herself afraid , Had shrinking stood , like flowers*beneath The scorching of the south-wind 's breath : But when I nam'd-alas , too well , I now recall , though wilder 'd then ,  - -  Instantly , when I named the spell , Her brow , her eyes uprose again , And , with an eagerness , that spoke The sudden light that o'er her broke , " The spell , the spell ! -O speak it now , And I will bless thee ! " she exclaim'dUnknowing what I did , inflam 'd , And lost already , on her brow I stamp 'd one burning kiss , and nam 'd The mystic word , till then ne'er told To living creature of earth 's mould ! Scarce was it said , when , quick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught The holy sound ; her hands and eyes Were instant lifted to the skies , And thrice to heaven she spoke it ' out With that triumphant look Faith wears , When not a cloud of fear or doubt , // April* A vapor from this vale of tears , Between her and her God appears ! That very moment her whole frame All bright and glorified became , And at her back I saw unclose Two wings , magnificent as those That sparkle round th ' Eternal Throne . Whose plumes , as buoyantly she rose Above me , in the moon-beam shone With a pure light , which-from its hue , Unknown upon this earth-I knew Was light from Eden , glistening through . Most holy vision ! ne'er before Did aught so radiant-since the day When Lucifer , in falling , bore The third of the bright stars awayRise , in earth 's beauty , to repair Thnt loss of light and glory there ! ' The second is an angel of far higher rank and nobler attributes . His only fault was a thirst for knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived to amuse himself pretty well with resolving sun-beams into their original elements , and , as new stars were born , flying from one to the other to see what they were made of , until women were created , and the whole passion of his soul was at once concentrated upon the new riddle . After a long and rather tedious search , he succeeded in finding Lilis , ' who comprised within herself , all that could interest and charm in womankind . There was a maid , of all who move Like visions o'er this orb , most fit To be a bright young angel 's love , Herself so bright , so exquisite ! The pride , too , of her step , as light // Of eyes that , when by anger stirr 'd , Were fire itself , but at a word Of tenderness , all soft became , As though they could , like the sun 's bird . Dissolve away in their own flameOf form as pliant as the shoots Of a young tree , in vernal flower ; Yet round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hourTwas not alone this loveliness , That falls to loveliest woman 's share , Though , even here , her form could spare From its own beauty 's rich excess Enough to make all others fairBut t was the mind , ' Of course he fell violently in love , and she , not content with returning his affection , very unfortunately reciprocated his curiosity ; for while they were together one day , she prayed , or rather commanded her lover to come to her , arrayed with all the glories , which he wore in heaven . He obeyed , and the fire , which was pure and innocent in his celestial home , had become a destroying flame , from his own depravity ; and Lilis was consumed in his arms ! The story is , of course , a repetition of that of Semele . Of the third angel there is no story to tell . He and his mistress were exceeding good , being guilty of no sin but that of loving each other ; but for this they were doomed to wander upon earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make a long extract , which will be rather a favorable sample of the whole poem . And thus in humbleness they trod , Abash 'd , but pure before their God ; Nor e'er did earth behold a sight So meekly beautiful as they , When , with the altar 's holy light Full on their brows , they knelt to pray , Hand within hand , and side by side , Two links of love , awhile untied From the great chain above , but fast Holding together to the lastTwo fallen Splendors from that tf*e . Which buds with such eternally , Shaken to earth , yet keeping all Their light and freshness in the fall // Their only punishment , ( as wrong , However sweet , must bear its brand , ) Their only doom was this-that , long As the green earth and ocean stand , They both shall wander here  --  the same Throughout all time , in heart and frameStill looking to that goal sublime , Whose light remote , but sure , they see , Pilgrims of Love ! whose way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the while , to all the strife , True love encounters in this lifeThe wishes , hopes , he breathes in vain ; The chill , that turns his warmest sighs To earthly vapor , ere they rise ; The doubt he feeds on , and the pain That in his very sweetness lies . Still worse , the illusions that betray His footsteps to their shining brink ; That tempt him , on his desert way Through the bleak world , to bend and drink , Where nothing meets his lips , alas But he again must sighing pass On to that far-off home of peace , in which alone his thirst will cease . All this they bear , but , not the less , Have moments rich in happinessBlest meetings , after many a day Of widowhood past far away , When the lov 'd face again is seen Close , close , with not a tear betweenConfidings frank , without control , Pour 'd mutually from soul to soul ; As free from any fear or doubt , As is that light from chill or stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by them shed bac*k again ! - That happy minglement of hearts , Where , changed , as chemic compounds are Each , with its own existence parts , To find a new one , happier far ! Such are their joys-and , crowning all , That blessed hope of the bright h*ur , When , happy and no more to fall , Their spirits shall , with freshen 'd power , // Rise up rewarded for their trust In Him , from whom all goodness springs , And , shaking off earth 's soiling dust From their emancipated wings , Wander for ever through those skies Of radiance , where Love never dies ! ' We are at a loss to conceive the inducement under which Mr Moore wrote the notes to this poem . The learning with which they are overlaid , though all second hand , could not have been collected by him without a good deal of labor ; and yet no one class of readers will be instructed or pleased by it . The learned theologian will smile at it ; the gentle reader will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while all will think that it savors too strongly of pedantry , to become a real scholar , like Mr Moore .
