tageous , because this staple is more valuable to the state than any other . If the price of gold and silver be reduced by an unnatural increase of quantity , the cost of labor and all the materials requisite for working the mines , such as provisions , quicksilver , iron , and machinery , will be increased in the same ratio . Hence all those mines , which under favorable circumstances would do little more than meet the expense of working . must stop , when the price of silver and gold is reduced , and that of the articles necessary for subsistence and use is raised . If , for example , a thousand pounds of ore yield ten ounces of silver , and these ten ounces of silver be just enough to pay all the charges of production , the mine may be worked without a loss ; but if the value of silver fall , by an increased quantity in the market , since the same amount of labor and other materials are requisite to produce the silver as before , and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine can no longer be worked ; and that a duty , which should end in this result , would be most impolitic and ruinous . The only effectual laws for increasing production , and consequcatly a 1 ) rofit to the nation , will be those which afford the strongest encouragement to exf ) ortation . The great political economist , Ricardo , in his chapter respecting taxes on gold , has some remarks touching this subject , which do not seem to us altogether sound . To make their views the more easily apprehended , by those members of the Congress not well versed in studies of this nature , the committee illustrate them by referring to the old regulation under the Spanish system . They affirm , that it is the same thing in effect , whether a tax be laid on the precious metals in the hands of the miner , as formerly , or a duty on exportation , which is supposed to be paid by foreigriers . If the miner were now obliged to paya tax of twenty per cent , or give one fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately find that he could not pursue his business without ruining himself . But the result would not be varied , although it would come less direct , if the same amount of duty were laid on exportation . The foreigner would pay it , in the first instance , it is true , but lie would pay it in goods at a l ) rice advanced in proportion to the duty , and these goods the miner must purchase at this advanced price , by giving one fifth more gold for them , than he // would have done , had no duty been laid ; which is just the same to him , as if he had paid one fifth of his gold in a tax , and bought the goods at a proportional price . The same will hold true of all the goods he purchases , whether of domestic or foreign production , be*iause the prices of all will be raised alike . The effect of these principles has already been seen in Mexico . The freedom of commerce now enjoyed , has reduced the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the old restrictive system of Spain . The consequence has been a corresponding reduction in the price of home manufactures , notwithstanding the prejudices of the people in favor of their old habits , the impulse of interest , and the exertions of native enterprise to give the goods of home production an ascendency in the market . The committee close their report with two observations , in the nature of precautions , in one of which it is hinted , that a constitutional question is involved in the subject . They state that such a measure , as the one contemplated in the proposed duty on the exportation of the precious metals , would derange the negotiations , which have been instituted in forming companies abroad for working the mines , and by which the fidelity of the government was virtually pledged to ensure as favorable prospects , at least , as those which existed when the engagements were made . The mining companies of Europe , employing in Mexico the capital of Europe , are conferring a great benefit on the nation , and actually providing the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has contracted abroad . Thus a mutual interest is growing up between Mexico and the European governments , by reason of the facilities afforded in Mexico for a profitable employment of capital , the consequent stimulus given to industry and enterprise , and the new and intimate commercial relations , that must necessarily be established . But impose this duty , and a check will be given to the companies already formed ; it will prevent others from forming , and create jealousy , and a suspicion of the good faith of the Mexican government , and a distrust of its future wisdom and firmness . The objection to the duty , on constitutional grounds , arises out of the local situation of the mines . The constitution of // the Mexican Republic provides , as in the United States , that all taxes shall fall as equally as possible on each part of the union .. Now the principal mines are situate in a few only of the provinces or states . A tax on silver , therefore , would not be equally borne , but settle most heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed Linconstitutional . How far this argument deserves consideration we forbear to decide , but presume it should be allowed as much weight at least , as similar arguments in our own congress , where it has never been complained , that the watch towers of the constitution were guarded by drowsy sentinels . We have thus presented , in as perspiceous a manner as we could , the principles contained in the report of the committee on finance and mines , together with such illustrations and remarks of our own , as have occurred to us in pursuing the subject . The sound policy and just views of the committee must be obvious , and a clearer proof of the wisdom of the Mexican congress could hardly be adduced , than the fact , that this report was unanimously adopted , and no additional duty was laid on the exportation of gold and silver . The committee state explicitly , that in their opinion the nation would be benefited by taking off the existing duty of three and a half per cent , but as this subject was not referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended . This duty will doubtless soon be removed by the same enlightened policy , which has prevented its being increased . Mr Alarnan 's last report to the congress shows the Mexican goverumnent to be sedulously devoted to the best interests of the nation . Vigilant attention is bestowed in affording all the encouragement , which the present state of the country will possibly admit , to every branch of industry , to the means of education , to agriculture , manufactures , and internal improvements . During the disasters of the revolution , many of the old colleges have been neglected , and have gone to decay , by reason of their revenues being withheld or diverted to other channels . Some of these will be immediately restored , and others established ane*v . A spirit begins already to prevail , in a few places , which promises good results . In San Luis Potosi there has been a voluntary subscription of fortytwo thousand dollars , for establishing a college ; measures are adopting to restore another in Guanaxuato ; and in Celaya // one is now in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed , and the governments of some of the states are preparing to establish them in all the towns and villages , by passing Jaws and apj ) ropriating funds for the purpose . Schools on the plan of mutual instruction have been successfully established in San Luis Potosi , Guadalaxara , Guanaxuato , and other places . It is an omen in the highest degree auspicious for the future liberty and prosperity of the southern republics , that their rulers apply themselves with so much zeal in advancing the cause of education . Colombia has set a brilliant example , both by her laws and her practice ; and the recent munificence of Bolivar , in aiding the schools of his native city , Caracas , has added a lustre to his name , which can never fade away , even if the glory of his conquests in defence of justice an ( l liberty should perish . It is a laudable effort , which the Mexican government are making , to restore and preserve all the ancient documents in the archives of the viceroyalties , and also the relics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this work , and the arrangement of some of the branches is already completed in alphabetical order Mr Alaman relates , that the index alone to the documents pertaining to the branch of tobacco , which have been assorted and arranged , comprises two folio volumes . The branch of excise has an index , which , together with the printed tracts on the subject , extends to eightytwo volumes . The number of documents , which have been transferred to the secretary* s office in three branches alone , namely , finance , ecclesiastical benefices , and indulgences , amounts to four thousand five hundred and ninetysix . All these are so arranged , that , by the aid of the index , any document can be immediately found . A curious history of the oppression , folly , and superstition of the old Spanish government in Mexico , will probably be one day drawn from this mass of materials . Many specimens of antiquity are still preserved . A museum to contain the whole is proposed . Improvements are taking place in the manufactures of Mexico , caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of making articles nearly as good , to secure for them a market . Cotton spinning machines , on the plan of those in the United States , have been erected // with entire success . Privileges and monopolies for cotton manufactories have been solicited from congress , but as yet these have not been granted . A paper manufactory is established at San Luis Potosi , and another is erecting in the vicinity of Mexico . At Durango a glass house is in successful operation . Agriculture is pursued with more advantage than formerly ; olive trees , vineyards , silkworms , and coffee are ctiltivated , and promise to open a wide and profitable field for future industry . In short , the prospects of Mexico never shone so brightly as at the present moment . A form of government is adopted , which has been the deliberate choice of the people ; internal commotions are qtiellcd ; the arts and the enjoyments of peace are taking place of the distractions , privations , and sufferings of war ; habits conducive to a new and better state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change will soon be understood and deeply felt . The government is in the hands of men , whose patriotism and virtue have been tried by a long and bitter experience . Gaudalupe Victoria , and General Bravo , the President and Vice President of Mexico , have been conspicuous actors through the whole revolutionary scenes ; they have always been found on the side of humanity , justice , and liberty ; skilful in war , brave in battle , and true at all times , they have resisted tyranny with equal firmness , whether in the person of a Spanish viceroy , or a self styled emperor ; their ambition has been to see their country independent , enlightened , and happy . With such men as these , aided by the political wisdom of others less known , but not less worthy , the liberties of Mexico are secure . We have fears , that the federative system of government will fail of its ptirposes , that some of the extremes are but ill qualified to act wisely for themselves , and that the parts in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by the head . A temporary experiment of the central system , like that of Colombia , would have been more safe . But whatever intermediate events may occur , the result is certain ; the Mexican people are fully qualified to govern themselves , and they will soon learn to do it in the best way .
