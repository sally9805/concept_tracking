txt ART . VI1. - Leetures on the Elements of Political Economy . By THoI'LAs COOPER , lvi . D. President of the South Carolina College , and Professor of Chemistry and Political Economy . Columbia , S. C. 1826 . Svo. pp. 280 . THE author of this volume has long been known for his literary enterprise , as well as for a singular versatility of talent , exhibited in several treatises on a variety of subjects . He held a high rank , in the first place , as a writer on those connected more immediately with his profession . We have heard him spoken of as a chemist and mineralogist of no common attainments . With the extensive and intricate science of law and of jurisprudence , general as well as local , he seems to have been familiar . He is the translator of the elementary Institutes of Justinian , and the elaborate , practical commentator on that work ; and we believe he was the first to make accessible to American students a book , about which they were destined to hear so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal education , was placed far beyond their reach . It is now on the shclves of every lawyer 's library . In profound political inquirP ? s , too , Dr Cooper has not been inactive . We have seen essays from his pen in this department , which can not Ibli to have a certain degree of interest with the mass of icadeus ; for whatever may he thought of the soundness of the principles , or of the accuracy of the reasonings by which they are established , they display at least ability , and are entitled to the praise of l ) C*1Ig written with spirit and perspicuity , although they are upoa difficult and somewhat abstruse questions . // Dr Cooper is president of the South Carolina College ; and havhig been relieved from the professorship of Rhetoric , Criticism , and Belles Lettres , which , it seems , devolved upon him as l ) Lrt of his official duties , he delivered , at the request of the trustees , a series of lectures to the senior class on the science of political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It lays no claim to the merit of much originality in anything . The author says , that he writes not for the adept . It was his business to introduce the pupils under his care to a full knowledge of the science in all its departments ; and he hesitated not to gather his materials from every quarter , where they most advantageously presented themselves to his view , without always trying to throw over them an air of novelty , and sometimes without even changing the language of the author to whom he stood indebted , when it appeared to him to express the reasoning and the principles clearly and forcibly . His style is not always perfectly to our taste ; it sometimes wants dignity , and in some places is even destitute of ordinary care ; faults hardly excusable , we should say , in a professor of belles lettres and criticism ; yet the general characteristic of it is to bring home plainly to the student 's mind the aim and the sentiments of the writer ; and in comparison with this , all other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to a more particular examination of this volume , the occasion suggests to us the propriety of saying a word or two on the importance of giving the science of political economy higher ground at all our principal seminaries of education . We think the study of it in every way advantageous . If the student becomes thoroughly interested in it , he will be led to a careful investigation of the most important facts in the policy of nations , and thus to a knowledge of their situation , of their various natural productive powers , of their resources , of their connexion and transactions with each other , of their institutions , of their character , moral as well as intellectual , of everything , in short , which has raised them , or which tends to bring about their decline . National wealth lies at the foundation of national intelligence , and indeed of all true national greatness . It was the accumulation of that , which first drew the strong line of distinction between the savage and the civilized . Polished states owe to it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , and enabling a comparatively small number to provide // the necessaries of life , and supply the common wants of every individual in society , it leaves the residue at leisure for grander and more extensively useful pursuits . It thus gives birth to the sciences and arts , to discovery , invention , improvement of every kind , and carries indefinitely far the purest and noblest enjoyments of which we are capable , as well as all those comforts and conveniences , which are indispensable to our existence . The object of political economy is to show , whence this wealth first arises ; how it is naturally diffused throughout society ; what are the easiest and most efficient causes of the production of it in any particular nation ; and the true way in which governments can best secure its judicious appropriation and encourage its rapid advancement . Ought not the study of it , then , to be earlier and more extensively known , in our own country especially ? The protection of enterprise , and of wealth in some shape , forms the sole aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present intention to speak of the utility of this science to the legislator or the statesman . This should bo , in fact , obvious to every intelligent man ; for every intelligent man in our country may be called upon either to fill those responsible stations , or to investigate strictly the legislative ability and the l ) nblic administration of those who do . We are now , however , lookin at the subject from an humbler point of vie*v* As a discipline to the pupil 's mind , this study is peculiarly useful . It leads him into that sort of reasoning and of intellectual effort , which is required by all the great transactions of life . As a source of extremely pleasing as well as profitable intelligence to him , of a far more refined nature , too , than that which we have already mentioned , it holds a still higher rank in our estimation . To the inexperienced graduate at any of our colleges , who has not studied the subject scientifically , nothing can be more unintelligible and mysterious than the extensive business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a vast and complicated piece of machinery , which may have excited his wonder , perhaps , but which has never called forth his active curiosity , and of which the parts that are the most familiar , and fall continually under his observations are equally unknown , and seem to him equally inexplicable . Such , for example , is the nature of money , of banks , of Pm diffusion of credits , and the circulating medium in all its shapes and varieties . It would require the greatest mental power for him to comprehend , unaided , the origin of these and their // influence in the accumulation of wealth , and in the improvements of society . The science of political economy explains this , and enables him to do it easily . It points him to a few simple general principles , which reign through all the phenomena , influencing and controlling the whole , and which serve as the master springs to rebulate the great movement of commerce and of enterprise in every department of human industry . This is the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislator . We speak of it now merely as it is interesting to the student . The knowledge of some branches of political economy , too , is of much importance to the profitable perusal and even to the frill understanding of history . The study of the former , as we have said , leads the student to a careful examination of the latter . But as history is now read at many of our seminaries of education . it is little better than romance or mgeulou s fiction . The power of the historian over minds as they are commonly instructed , lies principally in his eloquence or in the charm of his style , or in the narration of some singularly fortunate or singularly tragical events , which are after all , perhaps , of slight consesequence in themselves ; while the truly valuable details are passed by as tedious and unprofitable . The groxvtb , and the decline , and the various revolutions of empires , depend much on the powerful , thou h usually unnoticed character , of their laws , and of the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , to adopt . It is to the examination of these that the student 's mind is immediately conducted by the study of political economy . It is this alone which will lead him to trace to their original sources all just and valuable national wealtL prosperity , and improvement . Without some knowledge of it , the celebrated maxim of Bolingbroke , that History is philosophy teaching by example , ' can never he true . We are not sure of seeing aright the lineaments or individual character , nor of ascertaining the exact truth of any of those startling incidents , which usually excite in common minds the most intense interest . The materials of the story may be false or imperfect . The biographer may be partial . The historian may be partial . It would be most strange , indeed , if either of them were not so . But the great events , springing as they do from laws generally promulgated , and from public political acts , which every one has an opportunity of examining , and of seeing their influences , are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political Economy . the records of these things , with which alone political economy has to do , there is nothing to fear from falsehood or favor . May we not point out to the student also another , a still higher and more elevating pleasure , which lie is to derive from the study of political economy ? The noblest truths in natural theology are here unfolded to him . He sees the wise and the benevolent designs of Heaven in even the most sordid passions of our nature . The true , the real interests of all nations and of all individuals appear to be in perfect unsion , and indeed inseparately joined . The enlightened selfishness of a man or of a people , although accompanied by no generous feeling , and even , it may be , prompted by avarice and a spirit of covetousness , and desires that look not kindly on the rights of others , is yet made , by the beneficent arrangements of Providence , to administer most effectually to the furtherance of those rights . It subserves the purposes of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It adds immediately to the accumulation of their wealth , and leads , in the plainest manner and with unerring steps , to the rapid increase of national wealth , and to the general improvement of all the enjoyments of social life . Such , we say , are the effects which the science of political economy shows will naturally spring from truly enlightened selfishness , kept , as it always must be , within the limits of honesty . Is not this a noble lesson for the intelligent youth thoroughly to study ? His own true interest can never be the instrument of evil to others ; it is the minister of the highest and most extensive good . This might have been a most fruitful theme in the hands of Paley . The science of natural theology has , however , been confined to our discoveries in the material world . Its noblest field of inquiry is among the affections of the mind . It has been little thought of here . There are some speculations in our most recent treatises on political economy , which we have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because they have never examined their true bearings upon the subject with which they are connected . Of what use , for example , ' says the undisciplined legislator , of what use to us are your subtile inquiries into the nature and origin of rent , occupying , as they do , so large a space in your most popular works ? They may be curious . They may be interesting to you . Your ingenious theory seems fair , and all its results may be unanswerably true . But cui bono ? And how is it available to us in // the enactment of laws , or in any one of our political inquiries ? ' We find no difficulty in answering such questions as this . Let it be remembered , that rents are intimately connected with capital , with profits , with wages , in short , with every branch and division of wealth . There is a mutual dependence among them all . Particularly let it be remembered , that the question has arisen , how rents should be taxed ; and this it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , they oujit to be wholly exempted , because the tax will fall doubly upon the same property . The estate itself is first fully taxed , and then the proceeds , which are but part of the estate , are again separately taxed . Others , again , may think this tax ought to be laid freely , and without hesitation , because it falls upon a class of l ) eoPle in the community who can best afford to pay it , and whose property has risen in value by the natural progress of opulence , without any meritorious efforts of their own . It is a tax , too , they say , which will hardly touch consumption . It affects neitber the wages of labor , nor the profits of stock , nor the price of any articles of necessity or convenience in the market . It is for the solution of such queries as these , that the disquisitions we have mentioned are useful . We may apply similar remarks to many others . But it is time to return to the volume under examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigation of subjects , about which there can arise any doubt with regard to their utility , or with regard to the valuable practical results to which they may lead . His greatest efforts are , as they should be , upon the most important questions . Sometimes these may seem to betray him into an undue warmth of feeling , and induce him to make severe , though they are brief , animadversions upon the conduct of our national government , rati*er unnecessary and unsuitable ; but all this arises , we su**pose , from a deeply settled conviction of the high importance , and of the unanswerable truth of the principles he is maintaining . In these inquiries be collects together , in short and forcible paragraphs , all the arguments in flivor of his own views of the subject , and then , in the same clear and impartial manner , states and ansxvers those on the other side . There are some points , it is true , in which we do not agree with him . There are some omissions , too , some well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed unnoticed . For the writer of a text book , * , or * ** national this is wrong . In discussin* I *xmJpu , great // question , which is now pressed upon our attention in newspapers and pamphlets from every quarter , about the utility of governmental encouragements , ' for the protection and support of any particular branch of domestic industry , he has neglected to say anything in reply to what may be thought the most popular argument in their i*ivor . This argument is , that admitting them to be unprofitable to the great mass of the community , and even in the long run to the individuals themselves , whom they are particularly designed to benefit , they are still essentiaHy and indispensably necessary in order to secure on a firm foundation our own national independence . The answer to this is perfectly simple and satisfactory . They secure in the same proportion , and to exactly the same extent , the independence of all other nations with whom we ( led . They are naturally as much dependent upon us , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports , they will not take ours . They must be free from us . They must place no reliance upon us . They must turn from us their commerce and their capital , and pour it into new and untried channels , for the benefit of other more generous nations . Or they may learn , like us , selfishly to rest themselves on their own resources alone . XVe know not where the advocates who use this argument can stop . Surely it can not be short of absolute independence . It is in vain to make a distinction between the necessaries of life and luxuries . The line of separation can not be drawn between them . The latter , in fact , soon change their character , and become indispensable . Different countries , then , are to be wholly independent of each other ; and why may not different parts of the same country be also , for similar reasons , independent of each other , states independent of each other , towns independent of each other , nay , to carry the argument home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpardonable abuse of the term so to appropriate it . It is an independence of which the savage or the baronial lord might fairly boast . It is an independence which breaks the enlightcuing spirit of commerce , and shuts up nations within Chinese walls . The most flourishing states , at the moment of their highest elevation , when they were closely connected with every part of the civilized world , by the golden chains of successful commercial enterprise , were , according to this doctrine , in the most perfect state of absolute dependence . It was not till all these connexions were dissolved , and they had sunk in degra // dation , that their true independence commenced . But this statement can not be just . There is a natural dependence of nations upon each other , as there is , some situations , are productive exclusively of some peculiar fruits , which can not elsewhere be profitably procured . Let nations follow this as their guide . In a rich and rising community , the opulent capitalists i-nay be as dependent upon the poor laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it is with nations . It is the mutual dependence of individuals upon each other , which knits and binds society together , and leads them all to the most harmonious and the most rapid advancement in wealth , in intelligence , in every kind of improvement . In the same manner , though on a much larger scale , it is with the mutual dependence of nations upon each other . To this alone do we owe all the mighty efforts of commerce ; and what Ii 0hts , what a general diffusion of generous feeling and multipled means of human happiness , has it not everywhere spread ? It was some such reasoning as this that we looked for from the pen of I ) r Cooper . We know he is an absolute foe to every one of the principles in the old selfish system of political economy . He should have shown it here . In a text book every popular argument against an important doctrine ought to be met and answered . If it be l ) assed unnoticed , it will be thought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind , which crowd in upon us , to make room for a few remarks on a single subject , on which we have a right to feel considerable interest . It is a matter of surprise to us , that Dr Cooper has.given the sanction of his authority to the singular errors of Malthus . He warmly embraces the theory of population , maintained by that writer . He ranks it , indeed , with Smith 's Wealth of Nations . The next step in the advancement *f this science was the Essay on the princ*pie of Population of Air . Malthus . ' All the prominent doctrines of the Essay are then drawn up by our author , in a long series of propositions , which are supported throughout the volume . We have said this was matter of surprise to us . It is , because it seems to us at variance with the enlightened views , which generally govern Dr Cooper in his other speculations . his great principle is , that there is a vis medicatrix naturcc at work everywhere . and that the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the rules of justice , obviously tend to the most rapid advancement of his own condition , and to the most rapid advancement also in opulence and improvement , of the whole community to which he belongs . Our author must say , the principle is not applicable here . Population has a natural and necessary tendency , as be maintains , to go beyond the means of subsistence . It constantly needs , therefore , check and control . Population had a natural and inevitable tendency to overreach subsistence ; since the human race , where subsistence was easily obtained , had a tendency to increase in a ratio approaching a geometrical ratio ; while the increase of food could not proceed beyond an arithmetical ratio , and even in that case , had its limits . Hence , instead of encouraging population , which no where and at 110 time needed it , the wisest course for the sake of the poor as well as the rich , was rather to throw obstacles in its way ; it being evident that the poor would live better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in demand . ' p. 11 . Neither be , nor any of the advocates of this system , has told us what are to be the proper and the truly effectual restrictions on this dangerous tendency of population . It is unnecessary that they should . We believe the great principle , which we have cited , to be as applicable here , as it is in every other department of nature . Some of our views on this subject we have stated at considerable length hitherto . But it is by no means exhausted . And as the doctrine , which we have labored to refute , though peculiarly gloomy , and in collision with the most glorious truths , and extremely injurious , too , in its consequences , is still a favorite one , countenanced by able writers on political economy , and becoming , as it seems , fashionable in our own country , we shall not think our time misspent in calling our readers ' attention to it again ; keeping clear , however , as far as possible , of what has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our author has written in support of the doctrines of Mr Malthus , he has the following strictures upon Mr Everett 's New Ideas on Population . ' To this last work we have , on several occasions , called the attention of our readers . Although in some respects defective , we still think it contains enough to refute the celebrated theory of Malthus . But there is one consideration laying at the root of the whole business , which he Mr Everett does not seem to have thought of . Who is to employ these laborers ? In the first instance , and when they are not wanted ? // Suppose a farmer having grazing land barely sufficient for the fattening ten oxen , should purchase fifteen . Is it not clear that if he continues to maintain the fifteen on the land barely sufficient for ten , although they may exist , none of them will fatten ? Suppose this farmer has grazing land sufficient to fatten twenty oxen , but has not capital enough to furnish himself with more than ten , is it not evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is circumscribed by his want of power to buy them ? Suppose a community with all its employments filled , the whole of its capital embarked and engaged , and the whole of its working population hired , and every mode of employing labor already occupied , who is to give labor , and wages , and subsistence , to a constantly increasing crowd of laborers beyond the demand ? Those already in employ , and who have already filled to the utmost every vacant situation , will not give up their means of subsistence to new comers . What is the *result ? Competition ensues ; the new comers offer to work for less compensation ; the rate of wages is lowered ; the power of purchasing food is diminished ; subsistence is more scanty ; and a half starved laboring population , produce a sickly debilitated offspring , a prey to diseases of all kinds . At length death , by thinning the ranks of the working class , brings the supply to a level with the demand , and cures the evil . This is the inevitable progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1825 . Preface , page 14 . ) It is in vain to talk then of laborers furnishing their own subsistence . Before they can be employed at all , there must be surplus capital and a demand for their labor . Who will employ them who does not want them ? ' The want , the demand must exist for labor before laborers can be employed . Till then , they are not merely an useless , but a burthensome addition to the population . ' pp. 5237 , 238 . But there is one consideration , also , which Dr Cooper does not seem to have thought of ; or else he has assumed the whole ground of the controversy , and taken for granted the very question in dispute . Business , we say , continually increases ; capital is always accumulating ; employments are multiplying as constantly and as rapidly as human beings ; greater calls for industry arise , and new and broader avenues to wealth are opened for the spirit of activity and enterprise . Our author , however , seems to go here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that they are incapable of keeping pace with the progress of population ; although he gives us no reasons for this inference . This , we say , is // begging the question . He offers no farther considerations on this particular head , than those we have quoted in the foregoing extract , and we confess we can see nothing like an argument there , for all the points of the disputed subject are assumed . Some of the facts we have just stated are too obviously true to require any direct proof . There is a continual , an unvarying tendency towards an equal progress in the increase of our species , the accumulation of capital , and the multiplication of employments , and this in consequence of the extension and improvements in agriculture , in commerce , in manufactures , in every branch and department , in short , of human industry . It is true , each one of these principles may , and often will , in its turn , for a time prevail over and outdo the others . Even the rapid increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laborers . This is a demand , however , which will not be very long without a corresponding supply . Then population increases most rapidly , and at no distant period will overtake and outstrip , though not check , the accumulation of capital . The business is overdone . The laborers for a very short period may find the demand for themselves slack , and employments scarce . But in the mean time the rapid accumulation of capital , so far from being stopped or even retarded in its career by the great increase of consumers , goes on in fact with an accelerating force merely in consequence of that increase . This moves and keeps it in profitable action , until the required supply is furnished . The restrictions on the one operate as a stimulus to the other . The doctrine of checks and balances applies here , as in every other part of nature . We know perfectly well , that the rapid progress of opulence calls for more and more laborers to keep it productively employed , while these again , in their turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they mutually aid each other onward . We do not believe that either of the great principles we have mentioned naturally tends to continue excessive . We say naturally , because vicious political institutions , operating to debase the character of a people , and pervert and change their true motives to action , may lead to different results , and will require different rules for estimating their causes . These exceptions , however , are not to be taken into the account . It is the natural tendency of population always and unremittingly more and more to overreach the means of subsistence , about which the inquiry is now raised . This is the true question on which we are at issue with Dr Cooper . // It does not at all diminish our surprise at his embracing the theory of Maithus , when we recollect that recent writers on political economy , Mill and M'Culloch , for example , have done the same thing . Dr Cooper is not one of those men , who take a name instead of an argument . lie commonly , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the reasonings on which any great principle is founded , before he is willing to adopt and make it his own . Now the reasoning of both the economists we have cited seems to us here entirely inconclusive and false . That of M'Culloch is made up almost entirely of assumptions like those of our author ; Mill 's is more specious , and merits a more accurate examination . As we are somewhat anxious to do our little towards settinig matters right on this subject , we shall briefly review the ground taken by the last named writer , and ascertain how well his positions are supported . His whole treatise is in high repute . It has never , we believe , been republished in this country ; probably , therefore , it is not in the hands of many of our readers . He thinks that if the increase of capital , and the increase of population , kept pace with each other , all xvould go on perfectly well . But he agrees with Maithus and our author in supposing , that the latter has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hence arises the danger . After having stated , at length and elaborately , the increase of population , he says , We come next to consider the tendency which capital may have to increase . If that should increase as fast as population , for every laborer produced the means of employment and subsistence would also be produced , and no degradation of the great body of the people would ensue . As soon as it is understood from what source all increase of capital must be derived , the opinion of its rapid increase can no longer be retained . All increase of capital is from savings . ' p. 51 .. He then speaks of the motives to saving which may exist among the various classes of people in any community , and insists that they are comparatively few and inefficient . This disposition to save is still so xveak , in almest all the situations in which human beings have ever been placed , as to make the progression slow . That the same will continue to be the case , appears to be secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , he says , have not the means of saving . It is nee&amp; // less , therefore , to speak of their motives . The rich have no desire to do it . It is well known , however , that a class of rich men , in the middle of a class of poor , are not apt to save . The possession of a large fortune generally whets the appetite for immediate enjoyment . And the man who is already in possession of a fortune , yielding him all the enjoyments , which fortune can command , has a feeble inducement to save . Why should he deprive himself of present enjoyment , to accumulate that , of which the use to him is so insignificant ? ' p. 52 . The same sort of reasoning as this he applies in detail to all the intermediate classes , to the affluent , to those with moderate fortunes , to those in easy , comfortable circumstances . They all , he says , are totally destitute of any strong motives to save . When a man possesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , food , clothing , lodging , and all other things sufficient not only for comfortable , hut pleasurable existence , he possesses the means of all the substantial enjoyments of human life . The rest is in a great measure fancy . The pleasures , which can be added to those of which he is thus in possession , are comparatively neither numerous nor strong . That any considerable proportion of mankind , with all the temptations of instant enjoyment , will forego , to any considerable degree , the most substantial pleasures , in order to accumulate the means of a few fanciful pleasures at a distant period , our experience of the laws of human nature forbids us to suppose . ' p. 53 . We are sorry we have not room for more copious extracts from this writer 's remarks on the subject . The result of all is , These considerations prove , that more than moderate effects can rarely foxy from the motives to save , ' while the tendency of population to increase rapidly he has fully proved , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is always overreaching and pressing on the former , among some classes of society . This produces all their misery . But it seems to us , that in this enumeration of the causes of increasing capital , Mr Mill has passed unnoticed one of the strongest principles of our nature ; a principle , which adds infinitely more to it than all the other causes together . We mean the mere spirit of accumulation itself . Let it not be confounded with avarice , or the mere sordid love of property , which as much retards the general accumulation of wealth , as the passion to which we refer promotes it . This is not to be // ranked among the calculating motives , of which Mr Mill has been speaking . It is just , it is generous , it is often united with the highest degree of patriotism , benevolence , philanthropy . What noble instances of these have we had among our merchants , who owe all their gains to the spirit of which we are speaking , who are still pursuing them with unabated ardor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on foot , it is started , or receives its most efficient support , from the body of those enterprising men , whose strongest and most prevailing passion is still the love of accumulation . It is not , in fact , until after this has become in some measure extinct , that avarice commences its reign . Then the mind may turn from enterprise to contemplate what enterprise has gained . It was the answer of an opulent merchant to a young adventurer , who asked him how much wealth would satisfy him , and at what amount he should be perfectly willing to stop , At no cenceivable amount , ' said he , our aim for ever is to procure more. * And so it is in every department of human genius and industry . Possession brings satiety . An active mind never is content with being stationary , to however noble a height it may be exalted . It is the wise ordering of Providence , that its happiness lies not in repose . Whatever paths it may be pursuing , its great and growing desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has long left all its compeers far behind it . The passion for accumulation is thus an instance , though a very humble one , it is true , of the most powerful and persevering principle of our nature ,  --  the principle of unceasing advancement , the principle which drew tears from Alexander , because he had no more worlds to conquer . It is to this , we believe , and not to the selfish , calculating motives of comfort and convenience , which Mr Mill has enumerated , that we owe the vast fabrics of opulence , which we see rising around us , from commerce , from manufactures , from agriculture , from every quarter , in fact , where human enterprise is left free . These remarks are a sufficient reply to the reflections we have quoted , on the few and slight causes , which necessarily make capital accumulate slowly . We might have contented ourselves with simply denying the fact . We know , indeed , that it does sometimes increase with astonishing rapidity , and for a long period too , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of various places in our own country , everybody may turn to convincing instances of this . The ratios here // might often be reversed* Capital has gone on geometrically , population only arithmetically . Mr Malthus and his disciples must go on the assumption , that the real price of food is rising and becoming gradually higher from century to century , in every advancing country . This , however , we suspect , is far from the truth . On the contrary , we believe , it as invariably falls and becomes lower . The division of labor succeeds in cheapening this , as it succeeds in cheapening all the other comforts and conveniences of life . Nor are discovery and invention chained and compelled here alone , where they are most wanted , to be inactive . It is impossible , perhaps , to estimate the uniformity or the variations in the real price of an article from period to period , by any particular standard or measure of value , because , in the mean time , the standard or the measure may also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may command more money now , and probably more of every other article of convenience or luxury , than it would a century ago . But it does not therefore follow that its real price has absolutely risen . The real price of everything else brought into comparison with it has evidently fallen . The real price of this , too , may have fallen , although not so much , perhaps , as that of all the various commodities with which it is directly or indirectly exchanged . The declining motion in the prices of these has been so rapid , compared with that of the other , that this will seem to be stationary , or its apparent motion may be rising , while it is , in fact , lowering along with the rest , but more slowly and unsteadily . These reflections will explain all the phenomena , that can be urged against us on this subject . There is , however , one circumstance which proves to us incontestibly , that the price of food rapidly falls as society advances in opulence . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . It is , that a far less proportion of the labor of a whole community is necessary to furnish articles of food to supply the wants of its citizens , than was required in the earliest stages of its progress . In savage life , every man is obliged to toil or hunt for the necessaries of life , in order to procure for himself sustenance from day to day . In the childhood of society the case is continually improving , although it may for a long time wear something of the same character . But in its full maturity and manhood , when it has arrived at high degrees of opulence and prosperity , how chauged is its // situation in this respect , and how small the number of those , compared with that of the great mass of the community to which they belong , who are called upon , and must make it their sole business to procure and distribute the means of subsistence , sufficient to meet and satisfy the continually multiplying demands . It is to be observed , too , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society . They become refined , grow more and more luxurious , and are not to be so easily appeased or turned off . It is not necessary for us , however , to dwell upon this , or to trace minutely its particular causes . Food evidently becomes cheaper . This may be owing mainly to the extension of agriculture , or rather , we should say , to improvements in every department of the vegetable kingdom ; for corn is not the only basis of subsistence , nor indeed in all cases indispensably necessary to it , as Mr Malthus and his followers seem in all their reasonings to assume . How far these improvements may be extended we can not calculate . They seem to us indefinite . Discovery and invent *n , those mighty agents , which are the most busy and productive when necessity calls them to her aid , will find nature here , as elsewhere , inexhaustible . The farther they have proceeded , generally , the more chiar and boundless is the field before them . We know not why there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most alarming , and seems most inconsistent with Heaven 's great general law of universal benevolent design . The fruitful nutritious powers of the earth we believe to be infinite . Let us not give way , then , to the weak , disheartening apprehensions , which seem to have arisen from some of the speculations we have just been considering , that , unless checked by war , by disease , by famine , or pestilence , population must so increase , as at no distant period to overrun all the cultivable parts of the globe , and drain them completely of their fruits and of their resources . Such fears ought not to be allowed to mingle themselves with the views of an enlightened philosophy . The writers of the new school estimate the tendency of population to increase by the ratio , in which it can actually increase under the most favorable circumstances . We have a right to apply the same principle in estimating the tendency of food to increase . The question then is , not what amount of this , compared with the population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount it is capable of procuring if at any time it were imperiously called for . Suppose that all the // controllable checks on its increase , of which there are many , were suspended , and that the labor , ingenuity , and wealth of an opulent community were for a very short period applied to the growth or to the procuring of various kinds of food alone , we believe that a geometrical ratio will feebly express its tendency to increase , if the amount of it be at intervals compared with the progress of the society from its earliest efforts . It certainly never does multiply in that proportion , and the reason is apparent . It is not wanted . There would be a wild , pernicious waste , the destructive influences of which must be felt by every class of people , if it were so produced . Production would infinitely exceed , for a time , profitable consumption . We have a right , however , to consider such to be its natural tendency of increase , if it be fair to speak , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human species . It is only applying the same principle of reasoning to both . The truth is , there is no propriety in so speaking of either of them . Food has no natural tendency to increase , as we have formerly said , even in an arithmetical ratio . Man increases it . Man is capable of increasing it indefinitely at pleasure , and far beyond any ratio that has been assigned to the multiplication of the human race . Even in those very countries , where the laboring classes seem to approach nearest to the borders of famine , there is waste and profusion of subsistence , and vast stores of unappropriated wealth , which might be all turned to the production of infinitely larger quantities , if these were efficiently demanded . The suffering poor may not be able to bring any of this ill-used abundance within their reach . Why is this ? Vicious political institutions have cursed them . Or , what is not improbable , they have not chosen aright the professions or the callings , which can alone empower them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a full demand . At any rate , there is no universal scarcity of food ; nothing that approaches to a general want . There is enough , if it were brought within their reach . It was our wish , and our intention , to carry our remarks on this question to a greater extent , than we are at present permitted to do . Many other strong considerations in support of our opinions are now before us . But we have already transgressed our limits , and must close this article . Before taking leave of Dr Cooper 's book , however , we are bound to say , that we have hardly spoken so much at length of its merits as it // deserves . With a few exceptions , it abounds in enlightened views and clear statements . It is written throughout with force an ( l spirit , and may be recommended to such pupils , as wish to run over a brief outline of the important branches of the science , and awaken a livelier interest in the more extensive study of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
