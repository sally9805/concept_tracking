txt ART . XIV. -. /2n Essay on the law ofyatents for new inventions . By Thomas Green Fessenden , counsellor at law . Boston , 1822 , 8vo . THE law of patents for inventions is daily becoming more interesting in this country , on account of the extraordinary mechanical genius of our countrymen , and the rapid advances which have been recently made in manufactures and the useful arts . A very large amount of property is invested in these branches of industry , which is daily increasing by means of labor-saving machinery . The constitdtion of the Union has given to congress tbe prerogative of granting to inventors a monopoly of their discoveries and improvements , as a reward // due to the application of genius and industry to objects so es-* sential to national prosperity . Whether congress has wisely exercised this power , in the details of the patent laws , is a large question , upon which we do not choose to enter in this short notice of a treatise on the subject . It would seem that in confining the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not providing adequate means to prevent patents from being improvidently issued , our legislators have not evinced their usual liberality , wisdom , and skill . But we have nothing to do at present with the policy of the law ; our concern is with that system of judicial interpretation , which has been built up on the statutes , copied as they are from the English code , and consequently borrowing and reflecting mutual light from the decisions , which have been pronounced in the tribunals of the two countries . A good treatise on the law of patents and the kindred subject of literary property , as secured by copy rights , is very much wanted by the profession . A great deal has been done by the national courts of late towards settling its principles , and applying them to the great variety of nice and difficult questions , which occur in this branch , which has not improperly been called the metaphysics of the law . ' Indeed , the human mind has never been employed upon any subject of a practical character , which tasked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deducing its principles in a scientific manner , collecting and classifying the cases , analyzing each case , so as to bring under the proper head the various points adjudged , and subjecting them all to the test of free and candid criticism , would certainly form a very valuable addition to our digests or abridgments of the law . We are sorry that we can not conscientiously say , that Mr Fessenden 's compilation , a second edition of which is now presented to the public , fulfils what the profession have a just right to expect from such a work . In the first place , it entirely passes over in silence some of the most important heads of the subject , such as the extensive jurisdiction , which the Court of Chancery exercises in preventing the infringement of patent rights , as well as copy rights ; the general question of jurisdiction ; and the vast field of conflict between the state and federal authorities , as connected with this matter . The great case of Livingston and F*ilton against Van Ingen , in the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state to grant a monopoly of the navigation of its waters by steam boats is discussed , is entirely unnoticed . It may indeed be said , that it was not expedient or proper to notice that case , because the same question is now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States , the only tribunal competent to give it a final determination . But we can not think this a sufficient reason for altogether omitting a cause , which was so ably debated by very eminent counsel , and which , besides the general doctrines involved in it , contains a great deal of useful collateral information on the subject of injunctions , and Mr Chancellor Kent 's valuable exposition of the English patent laws . The reader might safely have been trusted with an abstract of so leading a case , even if it were accompanied with a caveat against the heresies contained in it , or what would have been still better , a candid and critical examination of those heresies . If , however , this latter task ought to have been left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for keeping out of sight an adjudication of a very respectable state tribunal , which throws so much light upon the subject of the work before us . Nor is this all . The book is extremely deficient in that methodical arrangement and lucid order , which is indispensable in what is to serve both as an elementary treatise and as an index to the reporters and to preceding abridgers . It contains no original matter whatever ; and does not give a proper Statement of the principles on which the cases , which are quoted , depend . It does not analyze each case , and refer the different principles it contains to their appropriate heads ; but copies the cases at large ( and sometimes with the arguments of counsel and marginal notes ) from the original reporters , and leaves the reader to grope his way as well as he can through a long labyrinth , for which the compiler furnishes no other or better clue , than is to be found in the book from which he makes his extracts . The case of Evans against Eaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of Mr Wheaton 's Reports , in which it takes up the unreasonable length of more than fifty pages , into Mr Fessenden 's book . This long and tedious case , which we think must be read over several times before it can be perfectly understood , ought to have been carefully dissected , and the elementary doctrines , which could fairly be deduced from it , should have been arranged and pre // sented under the various heads , to which they respectively belonged . The most ordinary index maker would not think of jumbling them together under one title , and least of all should the whole case have been given en masse , as a part of the text of an elementary work on a particular branch of the law . If this is to be considered as only a digest of authorities , humble as is the task of the mere abridger , he can not be said to execute it with fidelity by merely copying the marginal notes from the books of reports ; and if it was thought desireable to give the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been annexed in the appendix , as Mr Montague has done in his treatise on the law of partnership . Upon the plan here adopted , it would be quite an easy mechanical task to make a law book : - Search the indexes for the different heads of your matter , copy from preceding elementary writers some of the general principles belonging to it , extract from , or rather cut out of the reporters the cases , which have been adjudged upon it , make a title page and index to the whole , secure your copy right , and send the book to your printer . Among the cases entirely omitted in this compilation , and some of which are of very great importance , are the following : Lx parte Fox , 1 Ves. &amp; Beames , 67 . Hope v. Stevenson , 3 Bos. &amp; Pul . 565 . Hill v. Thompson , 3 Meriv. 612 . The King v. Wheeler , 2 Baruwell &amp; Ald. 344 . Moore v. Reid , 9 Johns . R. 521 . Morrill v. Worthington , 14 Mass . R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lx parte O'Reilly , 1 Ves . Jur. 112 . Parsons v. Barnard , Same v. Wigton , 9 Johns . R. 144 . It does not appear , that the editor has made any considerable additions to the former edition , except the case of Evans against Eaton , above referred to , and the very able judgments delivered by Mr Justice Story in the Circuit Court , which contain a great body of valuable learning on the law of patents , which have already appeared in Mr Gallison 's and Mr Mason 's reports , but which the reader may find it convenient to have collected in a single volume .
