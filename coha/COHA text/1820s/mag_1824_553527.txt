B* DUDLEY ATKINS TYNG , Esq . Counsellor at Law . Boston , 1823 . WE have prefixed to this article the titles of three series of legal reports , the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice and elsewhere , to stand in need of any commendation at our hands . Our journal , on more than // 37* April1 one occasion , has borne ample testimony to their merits . We will venture , however , at the risk of being chargeable with recurring to the subject somewhat frequently , to say a few words respecting each of them in this place , and to subjoin some other observations , which , in the perusal of these volumes , have been suggested to our minds . Mr Wheaton is not wanting to the high reputation he has attained , as a faithful and acccimplished reporter of the decisions of the most elevated law court in the union . The present volume indicates the same care and industry , the same happy talent of discriminating the leading points in the evidence and in the argument of counsel , and the same skill in recording and illustrating them , which have characterized preceding volumes of his reports . While they contain many cases of practice , which only settle the rules of judicial proceeding in the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , which do not go to affect the condition of extensive classes of men ; they yet contain many more , which , in the broad scope of the important principles established by them , cover the dearest rights of all the confederated repub. * lics of our nation . When we consider the vastly comprehensive range of the adjudications of the court , whose legal opinions these reports embrace , and advert to the character of the jurists who preside there , chosen out of the legal learning and talent of whole sections of the country , and of the eminent counsel1 who practice at its bar , many of them filling a space in the eyes of the nation , which no others fill , we shall discern ample reason for concluding these reports to be destined for after ages , no less than for the passing times . The Supreme Court of the United States did not rise up , like the state courts , merely as a successor , almost unchanged in form or name , of institutions over which a hundred years had accumulated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ushered into being by the warmth of popular excitement , nor was its progress upwards into the sphere of vigorous action heralded on by the acclamations of those , who , the loudest to praise , are still the promptest to censure . It was a court wholly new in its name , organization , powers , process , thrown forth on the country in naked simplicity , instead // of being invested with the prescriptive respect due or deferred to ancient institutions . To say that it was forced to contend with all the prejudices and misconceptions , which cast a cloud around the dawning of our national constitutions , is far short of the reality ; tbr its duties brought it directly in conflict with those prejudices and misconceptions in their worst , their most aggravated shape . As entrusted with the execution of the laws , it was necessarily thrust forward to bear the brunt , in the first instance , of all the opposition levelled against the federal h ad ; to enforce the collection of revenue ; to punish riots , which the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflamed into insurrections by popular clamor ; to maintain the neutrality of the nation in spite of the usurpations of foreign armaments , consuls , ministers , and directories ; to compel obedience to commercial restrictions , of which they on whom they fell most heavily , would not acknowledge the utility , efficacy , or expediency ; to withstand the pretensions of individual states to independent sovereignty ; in short , to gua ? antee the integrity of our constitution , wherever that instrument opposed the feelings or combated the claims of constituent members of the union . XVith such an immense mass of obstacles for it to struggle through , in order to reach its present dignity and maturity , it needed all the influence of sober and reflecting men , all the concentrated strength of national authority , all the virtues of judges like Jay , Rutledge and Marshall , of master minds and pure patriots , to ensure its success . Whilst we most earnestly deprecate , therefore , as fatal to the peace and good order of the nation , all attempts to exalt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent , and we will add equally respectable in their sphere of operation , we may be permitted to regard it with sentiments of honest and honorable exultation . So long as that admirable fabric of government , which the sagacity of our fathers conceived and planned , whose elements they cemented with their hlood , which has outlived the storms of revolutionary commotion and of party violence , so long as that monument of public virtue and political wisdom endures , the decisions of this court will continue to acquire increased value , interest , and importance , in proportion as the refines. // Law Reports . April , and cultivated millions of our enterprising population swell the tide of their numbers , and enlarge the bounds to which their arts , arms , freedom , industry , and religion extend . And we rejoice , therefore , that the profession possesses so able a reporter of the decisions of this court , himself a distinguished member of its bar , adding to the legal acquirements , commonly gained by eminent counsel in this country , an intimate knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more peculiarly the subject of discussion in the federal courts ; and , besides , ornatus uberrimis artibus , versed in the refinements of a tasteful and elegant literature . New York and Massachusetts were the first of the American states , which , ( in the same year , 1804 , ) revived the ancient system of causing those judicial decisions , which established important principles of law , to be published under the authority of government ; and they have reaped the fruit of this enlightened policy in acquiring the valuable series of Reports , of which the two last volumes are now before us , from the hands of Mr Johnson and Mr Tyng . These publi* cations have signally answered their main purpose , and have served to fix the construction of statutes , to authenticate the doctrines of expository law , to rescue them from the fallacious and uncertain guardianship of tradition , and to diffuse sound notions of individual and public rights through their respective states . They are cited also with respect , as exhibiting the opinions of wise and learned men , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have thus exer. cised a useful influence far beyopd the limits of the states which they control . The present volume of the Massachusetts Reports contains a very unqualified attestation of the merits of Mr Johnson , accompanied by a well deserved encomium on the court , whose decisions he reports , pronounced by chief justice Parker . We are in the habit , ' he observes , in delivering the opinion of the court , in the case of Packard vs . Richardson , of showing great respect to the decisions of the supreme court of that state ( New York ) ; for that bench , ever since we have been enabled to judge of its character by the masterly Reports of Mr Johnson , has been distinguished by great learning and uncommon legal acumen. ** // With some inequalities in th. * execution of the different vomines published by these veteran reporters , they all contain a faithful representation of the facts in each case , and the judgment of court thereon , with the reasons on which the judgment Was founded . Mr Tyng has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr Johnson ; but in important cases , they both pursue much the same method of reporting , and the method which in such cases , as remarked by us in a former article , we think decidedly the best , which is , to give a succinct statement of facts agreed or stated in pleading , the points made and authorities cited at the bar , and the opinion of the court at full length . ' After having each reported a larger number of cases than any other American author , and larger than any Englishman excepting Sir Edward Hyde East , and the younger Mr Vesey , they have now closed their useful labors ; and we sincerely hope they may find the evening of life as happy to themselves and to their friends , as its noontime has been serviceable to their profession and to their country . We do not undertake to lay before our readers any account of the adjudged cases reported in these volumes . Each contains cases of uncommon interest , which , whether we regard the research and ingenuity displayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity exercised by the court , will richly repay the student for all the labor of the closest examination ; and with such cases every liberal practitioner will hasten to make himself acquainted . No lawyer , therefore , who aims at anything above mediocrity , would thank us for an attempt to select or abridge what he must be familiar with in its extended form . To other persons it would present a dry repast ; since there is but a small portion of the law , and that not the most important , which will bear the process of transmutation into light reading , or can be usefully transferred into the pages of a work devoted to the purposes of general science and literature . The vast and increasing multiplication of reports , as well as law treatises , is a very remarkable fact in our legal history , which the publication of these three volumes in the last year , and of several other English and American reports brings into view in a striking light . This , we are aware , has been a standing subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain , and , like that , it has continued augmenting , in spite of the remonstrances of the wary and . prudent , until it is no longer a factitious grievance or an imaginary burthen . An English judge , in the reign of Charles II , told the bar that the reports were at that time grown toG voluminous ; for when he was a student , he could carry a complete library of books in a wheelbarrow ; but that they were so wonderfully increased in a few years , that they could not then be drawn in a wagon . ' He might have gone but one generation back , and found the reports comprised in a score of volumes , and the treatises hardly more numerous , when , as Jenkins informs us , the only elementary books used were Littleton , Perkins , St Germaine , Brooke , the old Tenures , Fitzherbert , the old Natura Breviuin , Finch , the Law Lexicon , and Dyer . Fuller , concerning whom one of his enemies said in a string of puns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose head seems owl like , fuller of folly than wit , and whose words are fuller of falsehood than of truth , ' *. *-has left a quaint cjuibbling passage yet more to the point in the Worthies of England . I can but admire , ' says that eccentric writer , at the comparative paucity of the books of our common law , in proportion to those written of the civil and canon law . Oh ! how corpulent are the corpuses of both those laws ! Besides , their shadows are far bigger than their bodies , their glosses than their text ; insomuch that we may bury two thousand pounds and upwards in the purchase , and hardly compass a moiety of them ; whereas , all the writers of the common law , except they be very much increased lately , with all the year books belon*ing thereunto , may be bought for threescore pounds or thereabouts ; which with some men is an argument that the common law embraceth the most compendious course to decide causes , and by the fewness of the books is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the canon and civil laws . Yet it is most true , that common law books are dearer than any of the same proportion . Quot libri tot libree holdeth true in many , and is exceeded in most of them . ' The last clause of this extract is as sadly true now as it was then ; but we fear the common law in our day is fallen away from any merit , which it might once have claimed , on the score of the narrow compass in which it was comprehended . It is stated by Mr Hoil'man , that several thousand volumes of // law treatises , and no less than six hundred volumes of reports have been published in England since the accession of the second Edward . ( Syllabus of Lectures . ) Whether this computation be exaggerated or not , we have no means of ascertaining with certainty ; but , including in it a few broken reports and some few reports of important single cases , we imagine it may be tolerably accurate . And in our times , when the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a polished commercial people , whose interests embrace the whole range of the globe , and are affected by a diversity of passions , relations , and circumstances unparalleled in any preceding age of their history , an accelerated increase is given to the redundancy of reports , which annually issue from the presses of England . But it is in our own country , where there are so many independent sovereignties contributi.ng to the multiplication of reports , and where every well read lawyer must keep up with the progress of legal knowledge in every department of it , and on both sides of the water , that the subject appears to demand the most seri6us attention . Previous to the year 1804 , but eight volumes of indigenous reported cases had been printed in America ; and the lapse of only one fifth of a century has added to the number one hundred and ninety volumes , exclusive of many valuable reports of single cases . Of these , eighty nine volumes and part of a few others are occupied with the decisions of the state courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports have been published in fifteen states , and in eight of them there is a reporter appointed and commissioned by the public authority , in addition to the reporter of the decisions in the Supreme Court of the United States . ( Griffith 's Law Register . ) Whither is this rapid increase of reports to lead us , and what are to be the end and consequences of it ? If year after year is to be thus prolific of its annual harvest of reports , we do not ask what fortunes will ere long be capable of compassing the purchase of a complete law library , but we ask what mind will be adequate to the task of storing up the infinite multiplicity of decided cases ? These cases are not all , it is true , authoritative ; they are of very unequal value ; they consist for the most part of obvious applications of well known principles ; and therefore it // is not necessary nor desirable for the practitioner to study every case that may happen to be reported . But still , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish - has been decided agreeably to your views , and for sufficient reasons assigned by some respectable court of law ; and if your antagonist cites an adverse case precisely in point , which you had overlooked , your situation is at least a very awkward one , even although the case adduced be not of conclusive authority as a precedent in the court where you practice . Besides , the same point is not seldom differently con* sidered in England and America , in Massachusetts and New York . In proportion as these discrepances multiply , the uncertainty of the law increases ; and the only remedy then is to recur to first principles , to fix ourselves anew upon  --  the eternal foundations of reason , ' the alleged life of the law ; ' for otherwise the study of these contradictory decisions will serve only to bewilder and hecloud , instead of aiding the understanding . Is there no means , then , of checking the progress of the multitude of flying reports , ' to use the words of Sir Ilarbottle Grimston , which daily creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crudites , ' which threatens* ere this age passes away , to deluge and overwhelm the ancient landmarks of the law ? Let us not be misunderstood . We do not weakly set about to call in question the utility of publishing select decisions of our law courts , which , in a system of jurisprudence where an adjudged case is not merely the opinion of wise and learned men , but also nearly as binding as a provision of the Legislature , is undoubtedly of great and manifest advantage . Still less do we intend any reflection on works of so much intrinsic worth as the subjects of this article . Let not our language receive either of these interpretations . We simply mean to intimate a belief , that law reports are increasing so fast , that the benefit is becoming a very chargeable one , and to propose the fact as a thing for consideration , without attempting to indicate any expedients whereby to mitigate the evil , or to check the tendency of our system to abuse . Whilst upon this subject , however , we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confusion arising from the multiplicity of reported cases , and diminishing the mass of the standai*d books of reports , by applying the prun*. // ing knife to the excrescences of the trunk and root , without inquiring for the present , whether there is any feasible process for regulating the luxuriant growth of the branches . To explain our ideas , and show clearly the advantage of what we propose , it is necessary to take into view some preliminary considerations . The principles of the common law , let it be remembered , are built upon precedent . The great bulk of ' it is composed of the decisions of wise judges , of judicial construction , which , Sir Edward Coke says , in long succession of ages hath been fined and refined by an infinite numbei ' of grave and learned men , ' until it is , become a sort of learned reason . ' No matter whether you regard this body of construction , according to the idea of many , as originally fortified by statutes , that have perished in the lapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as others maintain , for the evidence merely of immemorial usages and customs consecrated by ages of observance , no matter whether it appears among the cases of a report , or has been skilfully incorporated into the pages of an abridgment or treatise , it is still construction , and stands as the law purely , because it is an established decree , recorded for a precedent . ' The judgment , by which any particular point was solemnly adjudged , is the legal evidence , whereby that point , whenever it is drawn in question , is proved to be sound law . The corner stone of our law is authority . The leading inquiry , therefore , in every case is , whether the principle investigated has ever been deliberately adjudged ; the next , whether that decision hath since been confirmed , or else overruled. , or qualified , or denied , or doubted in some later decision of equal authority ; then we must ascertain how far it may have been modified by provisions made by statute ; and sometimes , but rarely , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at war with all the dictates of common sense , that no court of justice would now sanction its application to the case in hand . It is evident , therefore , that legal decisions do not , like other things , become enfeebled by their age , but rather gain additional authority as they grow venerable from years . Their antiquity , when they subsist undenied , is a proof that they wear the sanction of time , who is wiser than all the coexist* ing wits in the world . ' Hence the old reporters , the Year Books , Plowden , Dyer , Coke , are still resorted to by the // V jurist as the wells of English undefiled , ' and sustained as authority in our courts . The old Roman law books , the responsa prudentum , the praaorian edicts , full into desuetude on the completion of the Institutes , Code , and Pandects . But it is not so with reports in our law , of which digests and abridgments are published because the very best of these are for the chief part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law , it is true , like Littleton and others of the ancient authors , are cited as authority for opinions , which are unsupported by any known decision ; but sue instances are an exception to the rule , and not the rule itself ; and are admitted either for the extraordinary merit of the book , or more frequently because it is presumed , that the doctrines advanced in it are deduced from decisions , which , in the early periods of our law , failed of being elsewhere and otherwise recorded . The principle is applied to the most excellent abridgments and treatises , no less than to those of questionable goodness . Viner is no authority ; cite the cases that Viner quotes ; that you may do ; ' are the words of Sir Michael Foster . ( Burr . 1 . 364 . ) Lord Redesdale made a similar observation con .. cerning Blackstone . I am always sorry to hear Mr Justice Blackstone 's Commentaries cited as an authority ; he would have been sorry himself to hear the book so cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish Chancellor . ( Sch . and Lefr . I. 327 . ) Hence the original reports will not soon , if ever , cease to be useful , at least for the purposes of occasional reference and of citation as authority , if not of constant perusal . Now while the old reporters , those who flourished under the Tudors and the Stuarts , contain many cases of the greatest value , important leading cases , on which large portions of the law are wholly dependant , they abound with others , which the abolishment of the feudal tenures , the extension of commerce , and the consequent elevation of the law of contracts in general to the place once filled by the law of real estate , and many radical alterations introduced by statute or otherwise , have been rendered of little use even in England . And the proportion of cases of the latter kind is vastly increased with us , where , in addition to the same causes , whicVhave operated in the proper country of the common law , the novelty of our government , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visible in the simplification and constant changes of our law , are all conspiring to lead away its streams more and more from their fountain head . Now we suggest , whether it would not he a valuable and acceptable thing for the profession , if the old reporters , instead of being republished here entire , were circulated in editions adapted to the exigency of the times , and of our country , the reports of each individual author being retained by themselves in the proper form of reports , but with the omission of the obsolete cases , and with suitable references and critical annotations . The bulk and expense of the reports would be sensibly diminished , by thus striking out the vast number of cases , which it is morally impossible should now , or at any future time , be quoted as authority in America . But a greater good might be achieved by means of the illustrations , which ought to accompany these works . Such an edition , for instance , should present the reader with an account of the merits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court a safe or a dangerous guide , whether he was a faithful or unfaithful reporter , on which point alone , in the case of conflicting precedents , the decision of a cause might happen to turn . The history of the book and of the writer are matters of curiosity , if nothing more , concerning which , although there are abundant materials extant , yet the common editions of our reports but seldom afford us any information . But in the compilation of such a work there is most room for the exertion of profitable industry in the elucidation of the cases themselves ; for let it comprehend a complete history of each case deduced from the first adjudication of the point , through intermediate decisions down to the present day , and it would be more valuable for instruction , and , if enriched with a proper index , more convenient for citation and reference , than all the abridgments in the world . By turning to any case in those reports , you would then have the law , as it was actually administered and expounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mis* takes of the digests and law treatises , and at the same time you could see how far forth the case continued an authority , whether it was correctly reported or not , in what respects it had been contradicted , or modified in its principle or appli // *82 ( April , cation , by subsequent decisions , whether it had been invariably respected by courts and legislatures , and still stood unimpaired , a venerable monument of the wisdom of olden times , or whether it had been undermined directly or indirectly by the action of time , and in fine , what was now the whole state of the law in relation to that individual case . How such an edition of some of the best of the old reporters might be received , we know not ; but we are inclined to the belief , that it would supply a desideratum in Jegal scienee , which the discursive ingenuity , and prolific industry of the age have as yet left unattempted.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
