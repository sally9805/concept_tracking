" ' T is true Composing is the nobler Part , But good Translation is no easy Art ; For though Materials have long since been found , Yet both your Fancy and your Hands are bound ; And , by improving what was writ before , Invention labours less , but Judgement more . " Roscommon . TO THE PUBLIC . The Gentle Shepherd appears to have been first published in Edinburgh in the year 1725 ; and , since that period it has gone through many editions in Scotland and Ireland . In England and America it is but little known , because the dialect in which it was written is not generally understood by the natives of those countries . To divest it of its shackles has been my aim , and consequently I have employed my best abilities in reducing it to that standard of the English language in which it now appears . Those , who can peruse it in its original style , will reap little satisfaction from a perusal of this . For them it was not intended . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the generality of English readers , might meet with a favourable reception . Besides some alterations in the songs and different parts of the play , I have ventured to add a third scene to the fourth act , which appeared wanting . How far I may have succeed in my attempts , and have formed a right conjecture , time only can disclose . A. ALLAN . Fredericton , New Brunswick , Ist March , 1798 . TO THE PRINTER 's DEVIL . Sweet-scented Sir , It has been somewhere remarked , that " the Poets , conscious of their own inability to oppose a storm of spleen and haughty ill-nature , have an ingenious custom among them of choosing some " distinguished character to patronise their works . " There being a lust in man no charm can tame Of loudly publishing his neighbour 's shame ; On eagles ' wings immortal scandals fly , Whilst virtuous actions are but born , and die ! " This , sir , has induced me to dedicate this performance to you , knowing , that , if it is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refreshing smiles of your brilliant countenance , and that none will dare to sap what you defend . Protect it then , and I shall take it civil ; But few , I think , will combat with a Devil . A. A. PROLOGUE . Old plays , like clothes , require some alteration : And this , it seems , has had a small translation ; Perhaps enough to keep the herds from blushing , For foreign climes they sought a little brushing . Long did their dialect circumscribe their station , Till Thalia 's sympathetic kind compassion Taught them to lisp a language more in fashion . It sometimes happens ( may it here prove true ! ) That things transplanted gain a brighter hue , When mov 'd with caution to another soil , And ample product pay the lab'rer 's toil , A poet 's harvest seldom yields him much , Except of censure , ridicule , and such ; Yet ' t is a pity , when they rack their brains To please you , with their most melodious strains : They 'll twist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win your praise , And gain a simple wreath of humble bays . These their rewards : yet few there has attain 'd Rewards like these , though many a poet 's strain 'd , And lost himself , before the prize he gain 'd ! Just so with us :  --  like poets , ev'ry feature We twist and turn , to please each kind spectator ; Our fate is one ,  --  the strain determines all ,  --  And by your smiles we either stand or fall . To gain these smiles we 'll strain dramatic laws , Convinc 'd exertion will ensure applause ! DRAMATIS PERSON . MEN . Sir William Worthy . Patie , the Gentle Shepherd , in love with Peggy .

SCENE .  --  A Shepherd 's Village and Fields , some few Miles from Edinburgh . Time of Action within Twenty-four Hours . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. Scene .  --  A Shepherd 's Village and Fields . Patie and Roger lying on the Grass . SONG I. Pat . Patie My Peggy is a young thing Just enter 'd in her teens , Fair as the day , and sweet as May , Fair as the day , and always gay : My Peggy is a young thing , And I 'm not very old , And well I like to meet her when She 's walking to the fold . My Peggy sings so softly When on my pipe I play , By all the rest , it is confess 'd , By all the rest , that she sings best : My Peggy sings so softly , And in her songs are told , With innocence , the choice of sense , When walking to the fold . This funny morning , Roger , cheers my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How cheerful ' t is to see the rising plants , To hear the birds sing o'er their pleasing chants ! How healthy ' t is to breathe the morning air , With all the sweets it bears , when void of care ! What ails thee , Roger , then ? what makes thee groan ? Tell me the cause of thy ill-season 'd moan . Rog . Roger I 'm born , O Patie ! to a hapless fate ; I 'm born to strive with hardships sad and great . Tempests may cease to jar the restless stood ; The fox and crow to seek for lambkins blood ; But I , oppress 'd with never-ending grief , Must long despair of lighting on relief . Pat . Patie The bees shall loathe the flow'r , and quit the hive ; Willows , on boggy ground , shall cease to thrive ; E'er flighted love ( unworthy thought to fear ! ) Shall spoil my rest , or ever force a tear . Rog . Roger So might I say ; but it 's not easy done By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have so sweet a voice , and smooth a tongue , You are the darling of both old and young . If I attempt to sing , or aught to say , The girls will scoff and giggle all the day ; Oft drive me homeward with a heavy heart ; And seek occasions to increase the smart : Yet , I am young , and full your match in size , And quite as likely to a maiden 's eyes : For ev'ry sheep you have , I 'll show a score ; Who can do that are far from being poor . Pat . Patie What then , my friend ? Perhaps a narrow heart May in the use betray a selfish part : If that be so , what signifies your store ? A mind that 's peevish ever will be poor . Rog . Roger Nine cattle smother 'd when my hovel fell ; Three were bewitch 'd that I could never fell . In winter last , I bore a heavy blow ,  --  Some scores of wethers perish 'd in the snow . Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mine , Less you would loss , and less you would repine , He , that has just enough , can soundly sleep ; The surplus only troubles folk to keep . Rog . Roger May plenty flow upon thee for a cross , That thou may'st feel the pang of many a loss ! O , may'st thou dote on some fair haughty wench , That ne'er will stoop thy burning thirst to quench ! ' Till , fagg 'd with whining , like a boy at school , You own that one may fret that is no fool . Pat . Patie Six good fat lambs , I sold them , ev'ry foot , At the West Port , and bought a handsome flute Of plum-tree made , with iv'ry ferrels bound ; A charming whistle , with a pleasant sound : I 'll be as happy , with this pliant tool , As you , with all your cash , you silly fool . Rog . Roger Fy , Patie , fy ! I 'm not a churlish beast ; Some other thing lies heavier at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; It makes my flesh all creep yet with the fright . Pat . Patie Now , to a friend , why this mysterious show ; To one , whom you and all your secrets know ? Strange are your dreams ; as strangely would you hide Your well-seen love and stubborn Jenny 's pride . Dispel your fears , disclose your mind to me , And soon you 'll find her mind with your 's agree . Rog . Roger Indeed , now , Patie , you have guess 'd too true , And there is nothing I will keep from you : ' T is Jenny 's shyness preys upon my mind , And robs my rest ; her treatment 's so unkind , Whene'er we meet , wherever be the place , The blush she quickly raises in my face . She favours Bauldy , he that drives the car ; But spurns at me , and says I smell of tar . Pat . Patie But Bauldy loves not her , I tell you that ; He sights for Neps , so there 's a tit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her less , but , ah ! in vain ; I still must dote , and bear her proud disdain . My Colly is a cur I much regard , And , though he sawn 'd , a kick was his reward : If I had fill 'd a nook within her breast , She would have shewn more kindness to my beast . When I begin to tune my pipe and horn , With all her face she shews the utmost scorn . Last night I play 'd , ( you never heard such spite ! ) " O'er Boggie " was the tune , and her delight ; Yet , of her cousin , tauntingly inquir 'd If she could tell what tune I play 'd , and sneer 'd . Flocks , wander where you like ! I do not care ; I 'll curse my fate :  --  of Jenny I despair . Pat . Patie Well , do so , Roger ; who can help mischance ? Since Jenny feels herself so free from wants ; Yonder 's a rock , both rugged , high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the lover 's leap . Rog . Roger I need not make such haste to spill my blood ; My life 's been longer than it has been good . Pat . Patie You fool , leave off that silly whining way ; Seem careless ; there 's my hand , you 'll win the day . My Peg , you know , is grac 'd with ev'ry charm Jenny can boast of , and a heart as warm ; Yet , when indiff'rence on her brow does reign , A like return is sure her greatest gain : To foster frowns begets in time contempt , Change but your manner and she 'll soon relent : Let Jenny know there 's others to be had ; Go , court another , and she 'll go quite mad . SONG II . Roger , when your Jenny seems to take a flight , And to meet your fondness with a jeering flight , Only take it easy ; soon she 'll quit her scorn ; Women know full well that they for men were born . Girls , while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , are artful ; but , observe their eye ; That 's the best instructor for to know their mind ; There you may discover how she is inclin 'd . Soon as e'er you find her in a pleasant mood , Make it then your bus'ness to be understood ; Then 's your time to push ; speak without delay ; Whilst the sun is shining , mind to make your hay . Should she be determin 'd not to change her state , Must you go distracted , or e'en curse your fate ? Let her please her fancy ; if she does persist , She may die a maiden , you be better blest . Rog . Roger Kind Patie ! now heav'ns bless your honest heart ! You 're still so lively , and have such an art To hearten one ; for , now , as clean 's a leek , You 've cherish 'd me since you began to speak : So , for your pains , I beg you 'll freely take A fine new plaid , of my old mother 's make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross 'd with black ; I never had it yet upon my back : Well you deserve it , since you 've been so kind To clear my anxious doubts , and cheer my mind . Pat . Patie Well ! rest you there ; and , since you 've freely made To me a present of your fine new plaid , Accept my flute ; and she , that 's now so nice , Will give her hand , if you 'll take my advice . Rog . Roger As you advise , I 'll promise to observ't ; But you must keep the flute ; you best deserv't . Now , take it out , and give us " Far away ; " For , I 'm in tune to hear you sing or play . Pat . Patie ( Rising . ) But , first , we 'll take a walk up to the height , To see if all our flocks be feeding right : By that time , oat-cakes , and a slice of cheese , Will make a breakfast that a laird might please ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To season meat with health instead of spice ; And , when we 've ta'en the grace-drink at the spring , I 'll do my best to whistle , play , or sing . SCENE II . Peggy Peggy , sola , singing . SONG III . Tune .  --  Corn-Rigs are bonny . My Patie is a lover gay , His mind is never muddy , His breath is sweeter than new hay , His face is fair and ruddy : His shape is handsome , middle-size , He 's comely in his walking ; And , O , his piercing , killing , eyes ? ' T is heav'n to hear him talking . His speech is manly and sedate , With sweetest accents flowing ; It strikes , it wins , and has the fate To set my heart a-glowing . When late he vow 'd he would be mine , With what enraptur 'd pleasure I felt my easy heart incline To hope for such a treasure . Enter Jenny . Jen . Jenny Come , Peg , let 's fall to work upon this green ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's clear , the sky unclouded blue Will make them like a lily wet with dew . Peg . Peggy Go farther up the stream , to yonder vale , Where all the sweets of summer do prevail . We 'll end the washing whilst the morning 's cool , And , when the day gets hot , we 'll to the pool ; There bathe ourselves ; ' t is healthy now in May , And prove refreshing on so warm a day . Jen . Jenny Peg , when we 're undress 'd , what will you say If our two lads should chance to come that way , And see us so ?  --  That jeering fellow , Pate , Would taunting say , Ah , girls ! you 're not bleat . Peg . Peggy We 're far from any road , and out of sight ; The lads are with the flocks beyond the height . Now , Jenny , tell me why you pride to pain And treat your wealthy wooer with disdain ? The neighbours round observe , as well as I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why . What ails you at him ? he 's without a flaw , And worthy you the best day e'er you saw . Jen . Jenny ' T is not my pride to give a lover pain , Nor yet my wish to treat him with disdain . Though Roger 's rich , he still must bear the smart ; His awkward ways will never win my heart . He dresses well , indeed , and with great care , And few goes neater to the kirk or fair ; Yet , never did I hear him sing , or say , Except , How d'ye ? or , There 's a pleasant day ! Peg . Peggy The lad is bashful from respect and fear ; Hatred for love is very hard to bear ; But you 'll repent it , if his love grows cold : Who likes a haughty maiden when she 's old ? And , should you tarry ' till the market 's past , You 'll only get our leavings at the last . Fy , Jenny ! think , and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single life a crime . Peg . Peggy Nor I. But love , in whispers , tells us plain , What I to you , I think , need not explain . Jen . Jenny If Roger loves me , Peg , ' t is very well , But such a tale I never heard him tell . He stares and sighs , and I can guess the cause ; But who 's oblig 'd to spell his hums and haws ? Whene'er he ' tempts to speak his mind more plain , I 'll tell him frankly ne'er to do't again . They 're fools that slav'ry like and may be free ; The men may all content themselves for me . Peg . Peggy Well ! please yourself . For me , I have a mind To be as yielding as my Patie 's kind . SONG IV . If ' t is joy to wound a lover , How much more to give him ease ! When his passion we discover , Oh ! how pleasing ' t is to please . When we see a lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! how sweet to heal his anguish , And return him love for love . Jen . Jenny Now , Peg , how can you like that rattlescull ; A very de'il that aye must have his will ? We soon shall hear of quarrel , noise , and strife , Between you two as soon 's ye 're man and wife . Peg . Peggy I 'll run the risk ; nor have I any fear , But rather think each lengthy day a year ' Till I with pleasure mount my bridal bed , Where on my Patie 's breast I 'll lay my head : There we may kiss as long as kissing 's good , And then you know , there 's none dare call us rude : I 'll try to please him ; yes , ' t were good my part To aim at that , and he 'll give me his heart . Jen . Jenny He may , indeed , for a short space of time , Caress and flatter whilst your humours chime ; But , when restraint bespeaks his freedom lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , then , of long days of sweet delight , One day be dumb , and , all the next , he 'll flight ; And may be , in a surly fit , ne'er stick To lend his loving wife a  --  gentle kick . Peg . Peggy Such coarse-spun thoughts as these want force to move My settled mind ; I 'm too far gone in love . Patie to me is dearer than my life ; I only wish to be his lawful wife . There 's not a herdsman walks beneath the skies Has such a smile , and two such glancing eyes : And , then , he speaks with such a winning art , His words they thrill like music through my heart . How gaily can he sport ! how gravely storm About hobgoblins that the fancy form ! Each day , when he 's alone upon the hill , He reads such books as do improve his skill . He is  --  but what need I say that or this ? I 'd spend a month to tell you what he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gate , The rest seem fools compar 'd with my dear Pate ; His better sense will long his love secure : Ill-nature lurks in souls that 's weak and poor . Jen . Jenny Hey , cousin Peg ! I guess , before it 's long , Your witty Pate will put you in a song . O ! ' t is a pleasant thing to be a bride , When whining brats get round the fire-side , Yelping , for this and that , with tedious din ; To clothe those brats then you must card and spin . One scalds itself ; another 's lost its shoe , One breaks its shin , another burns your clew ; A scuffle ' tween them oversets your cream , A cuffing follows ,  --  after that  --  a scream : Then helter-skelter ; home 's a little hell ; And Pate 's abuse gets worse than tongue can tell . Peg . Peggy Yes , to be a wife is sure a pleasant thing , When round the fire-side our young one 's spring . If I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , and keep them tight . Now , Jenny , can there greater pleasure be Than see our children toying at our knee ; When all they aim at ,  --  nay , their greatest wish , Is to be flatter 'd , and obtain a kiss ? Can there be toil in watching lay and night Those little pledges of our love 's delight ? Jen . Jenny But , Peggy , poverty 's the worst of all , Should on your heads mischance and begg'ry fall : For , little love or little cheer can come From ragged clothes or empty pantry-room . Your cows may die ,  --  a flood may bear away , From off your meads , your winter 's stock of hay . A heavy drift of snow , on yonder hill , May many ewes and many wethers kill . A dealer buys your butter , wool , and cheese , And , ere the day of payment , breaks and flees . Your hopes are blasted , all your money 's spent , The laird looks gloomy , he must have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take your land , ' T is hard to give what ye can not command . Dear Peg , be wife , and lead a single life , Troth , ' t is no jest to be a marry 'd wife . Peg . Peggy May such ill-luck befal that silly she Who has such fears ; for , that was never me . Let folk mean well , and strive to do their best , No more 's requir 'd ; let heav'n make out the rest . I 've often heard my honest uncle say , That lads should all for wives that 's thristy pray ; For , the most prudent man can never shine , Unless his wife will second his design : Nought shall be wanting , Jenny , on my part , To gather wealth , and raise my shepherd 's heart ; Whate'er we make , I 'll take the utmost care To gain the name at market , town , or fair , For wholesome , cheap , clean , and sufficient , ware . A flock of lambs , some cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the laird his due : What 's o'er 's our own  --  With nothing then to fear , And thus with love we 'll spend the circling year ; And when he 's rich in children , stock , and land , He 'll bless the day he took me by the hand . Jen . Jenny But what if some young giglet on the green , With dimpled cheeks , and a bewitching mein . Should make your Patie think his half-worn Peg And her kind kisses hardly worth a fig ? Peg . Peggy No more of that .  --  Dear Jenny , to be free , There 's some men constanter in love than we : Nor is the wonder great , when Nature kind Has blest them with solidity of mind . They 'll reason calmly , and with kindness smile , When our short passions would our peace beguile : So that , whene'er they slight their wives at home , ' T is ten to one their wives are in the wrong : Then I 'll employ , with pleasure , all my art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night , when he comes weary from the hill , I 'll have all things made ready to his will : In winter , when he toils through rain and storm , A blazing fire , with a clean health-stone : The victuals ready ,  --  cloth spread on the board , Clean , and as good as we can well afford . Good humour and affection still shall be Guards to my face to keep his love for me . Jen . Jenny A dish of marry 'd love right soon grows cold , And gets insipid , too , as folks grow old . Peg . Peggy But we 'll grow old together , and never find The loss of youth , when love grows on the mind . Children and their 's make sure a firmer tie Than aught in love the like of us can ' spy . See these two elms that grow up side by side , Suppose them , some years since , bridegroom and bride ; Nearer and nearer ev'ry year they 've prest , ' Till wide their spreading branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully blest . This shields the other from the eastern blast , That , in return , defends it from the west . Such as stand single ( a life so lik 'd by you ! ) Beneath each storm with ev'ry blast must bow . Jen . Jenny I 've done .  --  I yield , dear cousin , I must yield ; Your better sense has fairly won the field , With the assistance of that blind boy 's dart , Who sports and plays about my fickle heart . Peg . Peggy Alas , poor pris'ner ! Jenny , that 's not fair , That you 'll not let fly Cupid take the air : Haste , let him out , we 'll watch as well 's we can Whether he 's Bauldy 's or poor Roger 's man . Jen . Jenny Another time 's as good ;  --  for , see , the sun Is far advanc 'd , and we 're not yet begun To froth the suds . If peevish Madge , our aunt , Comes up the stream , she 'll give 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you all my mind , For this seems true ,  --  no girl can be unkind . Exeunt . ACT II . SCENE I.

Sym . Symon With all my heart ,  --  and mind me now , old boy , I 've gather 'd news will tickle your heart with joy .

Now Cromwell 's gone to Nick , and Gen'ral Monk Has made th ' usurper 's party flee and funk , Restor 'd King Charles , set ev'ry thing in tune , And Habby says we 'll see Sir William soon . Glaud .

When the last storm made Glaud a roofless barn ; When the last stood took of my mother 's yarn , When Katey 's cow last winter got so lame ; When ' Bella churn 'd and there no butter came ; When Roger ' wander 'd where he did not know , And almost lost himself amongst the snow ; When Mungo 's mare stood still , and sweat with fright , And when a crow flew past the other night ; When Sandy 's colt fell dead upon the green , And Sarah lost a ring , was no more seen ; You . Lucky , got the blame of all fell out , And ev'ry one here dreads you round about : And well they may , that mean to do you harm ! But , me to wrong you , no ! I want a charm : And , when I next make groats , I 'll strive to please You with a bushel of them , mix 'd with pease . Mause .

Hard luck , alas ! when poverty and age Do raise such fancies , and such minds engage , That a small stock of sense should , in a twitch , Gain one the hateful name a wrinkled witch . That fool imagines I can play a trick , And that I 'm leagu 'd in compact with Old Nick , Because by education I was taught To speak and act above their common thought .

For soon the winter of the year , And age , life 's winter , will appear ; At this thy living bloom will fade , As that will strip the verdant shade : Our taste of pleasure then is o'er , The feather 'd songsters are no more ; And , when they droop , and we decay , Adieu the birks of Invermay . Behold the hills and vales around With lowing herds and flocks abound ; The wanton kids and frisking lambs Gambol and dance about their dams ; The busy bee , with humming noise , And all the reptile kind rejoice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the birks of Invermay . Hark ! how the waters , as they fall , Loudly , my love , to gladness call ; The wanton waves sport in the beams , And fishes play throughout the streams . The circling sun does now advance , And all the planets round him dance ; Let us as cheerful be as they , Among the birks of Invermay . Peg . Peggy O Patie ! let me go , I must not stay ; We 're both call 'd home , and Jenny she 's away . Pat . Patie I 'm sorry yet to part , now we 're alone , And Roger is away with Jenny gone ; They 're as content , for aught I hear or see , To be alone themselves , I judge , as we .

Patie You hurt me much to doubt my being kind ; In speaking so , you call me dull and blind : If I could fancy aught so sweet or fair As my dear Peg , or worthy of my care . Thy breath is sweeter than the sweetest hrier : Thy cheek and breast the finest flow'rs appear . Thy words excel the most delightful notes That warble through the lark or linnet 's throats . With thee I mind no flow'rs that dress the field , Or ripest berries that the mountains yield . The sweetest fruits that hang upon the tree Are far inferior to a kiss of thee . Peg . Peggy But Patie for some wicked ends may preach ; The lambs should tremble when the foxes teach . I must not stay ; I have been here too long : Another girl may make you change your song ; Your mind may alter , and I feel the wrong . Pat . Patie Sooner a mother shall her fondness lose , And wrong the child wrapt in its swaddling-clothes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease , The goat to climb , the sheep to yield the fleece , Ere I say aught to injure you , my love , Or do you wrong , I swear by all above . Peg . Peggy Then keep your oath :  --  but many men will swear , And be forsworn to two in half-a-year . Now I believe you do my person love ; But do not , Patie , let you . fancy rove : Lest I forsaken should your falsehood state . And lothe the name I 've held so dear of late . Pat . Patie I 'm sure I can not change , you need not fear ; Though we 're but young , I 've lov 'd you many a year : I can remember when I scarce could talk , And you so young that you could hardly walk , Or lisp out words , e'en then you were my choice .

Continue kind , and all my cares shall be How to contrive what pleasing is to thee . Peg . Peggy Agreed :  --  But , hearken ! Pate , I hear old aunty 's cry ; I know she 'll wonder what can make us stay . Pat .

Peg . Peggy At times it might happen such symptoms would fail ; The maid , not expecting to hear such a tale , Might blush and be silent , and still , by the bye , Deceive you yet farther , to judge by her eye . Pat . Patie Deceptions are cruel , most cruel in love ; And virtue such practice will never approve : I knew that my Peggy would never attempt What , only to maidens , can bring them contempt . Peg .

Yet , ' midst my joys , some prospects pain renew , Whilst I my once-fair seat in ruins view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , the gates fall'n from their bands ; The casements all broke down , no chimney left , The naked walls of tap'stry all berest : My stables and pavilions , broken walls ! That with each rainy blast decaying falls . My gardens , once adorn 'd , the most complete , With all that nature , all that art , makes sweet ; Where round the figur 'd green , and pebble walks , The dewy flow'rs hung nodding on their stalks ; But , overgrown with nettles , docks , and brier , No hyacinths or eglantines appear . How fast these ample walls to ruin yield , Which us 'd the peach and nect'rine branch to shield ; And , bask 'd in rays , which early did produce Fruit fair to view , delightful in the use ! All round in gaps , the most in rubbish lie , And from what stands the wither 'd branches fly . These soon shall be repair'd.  --  And now my joy Forbids all grief , when I 'm to see my boy ; My only prop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , call 'd home his mother fair . Him , ere the rays of reason clear 'd his thought , I secretly to faithful Symon brought , And charg 'd him strictly to conceal his birth , Till we should see what changing times brought forth . Hid from himself he starts up by the dawn , And ranges careless , o'er the heights and lawn , After his fleecy charge , serenely gay , With other shepherds whistling o'er the day . Thrice happy life ! that 's from ambition free , Remov 'd from crowns and courts , how cheerfully A quiet contented mortal spends his time , In hearty health , his soul unstain 'd with crime ! Now towards Symon 's house I 'll bend my way , And see what makes yon gamboling to-day ; All on the green , in a fair wanton ring , My youthful tenants gaily dance and sing . Exit . SCENE II .

Els . Elspa He does , indeed ; and 's grown a comely man ; God be his guard , and keep him from all harm ! He 's good and wise , and well deserves our care , Although I say't , that 's neither here nor there . Glaud . Glaud It seems to me that Pate has some regard For my young niece :  --  and , were he e'en a laird , Her shape and manners would his wealth reward . She 's well dispos 'd ; and , sure , I ne'er did see A girl so mild , were she no kin to me . Symon . Symon Ha !

Glaud What reasons can you have ? there 's none , I 'm sure , Unless you cast up that she is but poor . But if our Peggy marry to my mind , I 'll be to her , as my own Jenny , kind : First , for the dairy , she shall have five cows , And to that stock as many score of ewes ; And , ever after , I shall yearly give Ten lambs , at weaning-time , as long 's I live . Els . Elspa You offer fair , kind Glaud : but do n't inquire Our reason now : perhaps you 'll quickly hear . Sym . Symon Ere this day eight days it may be reveal 'd , That our denial does not slight his child . Glaud .

Jenny O father ! there 's an old man on the green , The smartest fortune-teller e'er was seen : We draw a card ;  --  he then takes out a book , Turns o'er the leaves , and gives our brows a look ; Then tells the oddest tales you ever heard : His head is grey , and long and grey his beard . Sym . Symon Go , bring him in ; we 'll hear what he can say : None shall go hungry by my house to-day . Exit Jenny .

Symon Whist , Patie ! let the man look o'er your hand ; Oft times a shatter 'd ship has got to land .

Symon He 'll soon get better . Elspa , haste you , go And fill him up a glass of usquebaugh . Sir William Sir William Worthy starts up , and speaks . A Knight , that for a LION fought Against a herd of bears , Was to long toil and trouble brought , In which some thousands shares : But now again the Lion rears , And joy spreads o'er the plain ; The Lion has defeat the bears , The Knight returns again .

Symon Friend , may your portending happen soon and true ; But , faith , I fear the de'il has leagu 'd with you To tell some tales that folk would secret keep : Or do you get them told you in your sleep ? Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Howe'er I get them , never mind your beard , Nor came I to read fortunes for reward : But , I 'll bet ten to one , with any here , That all I 've prophesy 'd shall soon appear . Sym . Symon You prophesying folk are odd kind men ! Sometimes you hit ;  --  but only now and then . The flatt'ring meaning of your new-told tale Will run like wild-fire o'er both moor and dale . Glaud . Glaud It 's no small sport to hear how Sym believes , And takes for gosped what the old man gives Of change of fortune , which is promis 'd Pate : But , what we wish , we 'll hear at any rate . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Whist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice round the sea , What I have said you shall see done In part , or no more credit me . Glaud . Glaud Well , be't so , friend ; nought further I shall say : But I 've two likely girls , brisk and gay , Yet in their teens : I wish you could foresee Such fortunes for them ;  --  might bring joy to me . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy No more through secrets I can sift Till night does close the day : ' T is but at times I have that gift , Else you would not have nay . Sym . Symon Elspa , lay on the cloth , and bring some meat , And , of your best , let this old stranger eat . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Delay awhile your hospitable care ; I 'd rather enjoy this ev'ning , calm and fair , Around yon ruin 'd tow'r , to take a walk With you , to Symon , kind friend , to have some private talk .

Roger Alas ! my daunted heart begins to fail Whene'er I'tempt to sell you out my tale , For fear some tighter lad , more rich than I , Has won your love , and near your heart may lie . Jen . Jenny I love my father , cousin Peg I love ; But , to this day , no man my heart could move : Except my kin , all men 's alike to me , And from you all I best had keep me free . Rog .

Rog . Roger That 's only when dull parent 's love of cash Two diff'rent tempers do together clash : But love , true downright love , engages me ( Though thou shouldst scorn ) still to delight in thee . Jen . Jenny What sugar 'd words from lovers lips can fall ; But grinning marriage comes and ends them all .

Jen . Jenny Were I but sure you long would love maintain , The sewest words my easy heart could gain ; For , I must own , since now , at last , you 're free , Although I jok 'd , lik 'd your company , And ever had a warmness in my breast , That made you dearer to me than the rest .

' T is bliss indeed , do let my head Upon thy breast recline , Yet still does seem to me a dream , Is Jenny now so kind ?

Sir Will .

When I reprov 'd him once ,  --  a book he brings ; With this , says he , abroad I talk with kings . Sir Will .

As we were dancing all in Symon 's yard , Sir William , like a wizard , with a beard Five fingers long , and full as white as snow , Amongst us came , saying , Keep ye , merry so ' We wonder 'd much to see his ancient look , While , from his pouch , he drew a dirty book , As we stood round him , gaping with surprise , He view 'd us not , but fix 'd on Pate his eyes ; And seriously asserted he had skill To tell our fortunes , whether good or ill .

Patrick was sent for :  --  happy lad is he ! Symon told Elspa ,  --  Elspa told it me : You 'll hear out all the secret story soon ; And troth it 's very odd , when all is done , To think how Symon ne'er before would tell , Not e'en to Pate , whom Symon loves so well .  --  Our Peggy 's love is likely to be croft .

Patie I 'm glad to hear't : but , oh ! my change this day , Whether for best or worst , ' t is hard to say : I 've found a father , gentle , kind , and brave , And an estate that few a better have .

But he has heard !  --  Too-faithful Symon 's fear Has brought my love for Peggy to his ear , Which he forbids :  --  Ah ! this confounds my peace , While , thus to beat , my heart shall sooner cease .

Rog . Roger Is not Sir William and yourself to stay Among US here ?  --  Or are you going away To London court or other far-off parts , To leave your own poor us with broken hearts ? Pat . Patie To Edinburgh straight to-morrow we advance , To London next , and afterwards to France , Where I must stay some years , and learn to dance , And two or three other monkey-tricks .

Patie What was my morning thought , at night 's the same , The rich and poor but differ in the name . Content 's the greatest bliss we can procure On this side heav'n ;  --  without it , kings are poor . Rog . Roger But an estate , like your 's , will yield content , While we must toil , live hard , and pay you rent : Fine clothes , soft beds , sweet houses , sparkling wine , Rich fare and witty friends whene'er you dine . Submissive servants , honour , wealth , and ease , Who 's not content with these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thinks not far amiss , But many a cloud hangs hovering o'er the bliss : The passions rule the roast ; and , if they 're sour , Like sickly cattle , will the fat devour . The spleen , lost honour , and affronted pride , Sting like the sharpest goads in gentry 's side ; The gour , the gravel , and each bad disease , Are frequentest with folk dispos 'd to ease : While o'er the dale the shepherd , with less care , Enjoys his sober wish and wholesome air . Rog . Roger La ! man , I wonder still , and it delights My heart , whene'er I listen to your fights . How got you all this sense I fain would hear , That I might casier disappointments bear ? Pat . Patie From books , the choice of books , I got my skill ; These best can teach what 's real good and ill . Ne'er grudge each year to spend some stones of cheese , To gain these silent friends that ever please . Rog . Roger I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose ; Faith , I will have them , should I fell my cows . But now , let 's hear how you 're design 'd to rove Between Sir William 's will and Peggy 's love . Pat .

Peggy Speak on ! speak ever thus , and still my grief But yet I dare not hope the wish 'd relief . New thoughts a gentler face will soon inspire , That with nice air swims round in silk attire ; Then I , ( poor me ! ) with sighs may curse my fate , When the young laird 's no more my cheerful Pate : But hear my vow ,  --  ' twill help to give me ease : ' May sudden death or deadly fore disease , And worst of ills , attend my wretched life , If e'er to one but you I 'll be a wife !

Be not by distress dejected , Shrink not from affliction 's hand ; Falsehood is from truth detected By the kind enchantress ' wand .

I 'll gain on uncle Glaud , he 's far from fool , And will not grudge to put me through each school , Where I may manners learn .  --  Pat . Patie  --  That 's wisely said , And what it costs him shall be well repaid ; Though without all the little helps of art , Thy native charms might gain a prince 's heart ; But now , lest in our station we disgust , We must learn modes in humble life unus 'd , Affect oft-times to like the thing we hate , And drop serenity to keep up state : Gloom when we 're pleas 'd , speak when we 've nought to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , seem gay ; Pay compliments to those we oft have scorn 'd , And scandalize them when their backs are turn 'd .

Peggy Since , without hazard , and so small expense , My lad from books can gather so much sense , Then why , ah ! why should the tempestuous sea Endanger thy dear life , and frighten me ?

For , the curs 'd hag , instead of doing me good , ( The very thought on'ts like to freeze my blood ! ) Rais 'd up a ghost or devil , I know not whether , ( I wish they were in France now both together ! ) Black hands it had , and face as wan as death , It seiz 'd me fast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , like a poor fool , Was worse chastis 'd than e'er I was at school : My heart play 'd pit-a-pat , I lost all hope , And pithless grew with fear , till they did stop ; Then , with a horrid scream , they vanish 'd quite ; And I , half dead with anger , fear , and spite , Crept up , and fled straight from them , sir , to you , Hoping you 'll help to give the de'il his due . I 'm sure my heart will never cease to jump , Till in a fat tar-barrel Manse is burnt . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Well , Bauldy , whatever 's just shall granted be , Let Mause be brought this morning down to me . Bauldy .

Sir William Worthy Such as the devils dancing in a moor , Amongst a few old women , craz 'd and poor , Who are rejoic 'd to see him frisk and sail O'er heights and bogs with candles in his tail ; Appearing sometimes like a black-horn 'd cow , Oft-times like colly , pussy , or a sow : Then with his train through airy paths to glide , While they on cats , or dogs , or broomsticks , ride , Or in an egg-shell skim it o'er the main , To drink their leader 's health in France or Spain : And , oft , by night , alarm hare-hearted fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stools Whate'er 's in spells , or if there witches be , Such fancies seem the most absurd to me . Sym . Symon It 's true indeed ; we ne'er heard that a witch Was e'er thought good , or wise , or very rich : But Mause , though poor , is a sagacious wife , And lives a quiet , and very honest , life . That makes me think this hub-bub that is past Will end in nothing but a joke at last . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy I 'm sure it will :  --  but , see , increasing light Commands the imps of darkness down till night : Bid rise my servants , and my horse prepare , Whilst I walk out to take the morning air . Exit Sir William . SCENE II . Scene .  --  A Room in Glaud 's House . Glaud , smoaking . Peggy and Jenny helping each other to dress their hair . Glaud . Glaud Children , I wish it may keep fair till night , You did not use so soon to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show And take your leave of Patrick ere he go : But do you think , now that he is a laird , Such girls as you will draw his least regard ? Jen . Jenny Though he 's young master now , I 'm very sure He has more sense than slight old friends , though poor ; ' T was but last night he did both joke and jeer , And kiss 'd my cousin there , from ear to ear . Glaud . Glaud Ay , ay , no doubt , and he will do't again ; But , be advis 'd , his comp'ny to refrain : Before , he , as a shepherd , sought a wife With her to live a chaste and frugal life : But now , grown gentle , soon he will forsake Such virtuous thoughts , and brag of being a rake . Peg . Peggy A rake ! what 's that ? sure if it means ought ill , He 'll ne'er be that , else I have lost my skill . Glaud . Glaud Ah ! poor girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and good , and gentle 's very rare : A rake 's a graceless spark that thinks no shame To do what folk , like us , think sin to name . They 'll tempt young things , like you , until you 're catch 'd ; Then turn it to a jest , when you 're debauch 'd . Be wary , then , I say , or you may rue That ever you saw him or he saw you . Peg . Peggy Sir William 's virtuous and of gentle blood , And may not Patrick , too , like him be good ? Glaud . Glaud That 's true ; and many gentry more than he , As they are wiser , better are than we , But thinner sown :  --  they 're so puff 'd up with pride , There 's many of them mocks the holy guide That shews the gate to heaven :  --  I 've heard tell Of some that laugh 'd at doomsday , sin , and hell . Jen . Jenny Watch o'er us , Father ! Ah ! that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts a God ! Glaud . Glaud Doubt ! Why they neither doubt , nor judge , nor think , Nor hope , nor fear ; but curse , debauch , and drink . But I 'm not saving this as if I thought That Patrick to such ways will e'er be brought . Peg . Peggy The Lord forbid ! yes , he knows better things : But here comes aunt , her face some wonder brings . Enter Madge . Madge . Madge Haste , haste , ye , we 're all sent for o'er the gate , To hear , and help to clear , some odd debate ' Tween Mause and Bauldy , ' bout some wicked grudge , At Symon 's house ; the knight himself fits judge . Glaud . Glaud Hand me my stuff .  --  Madge , lock the outer door : You 'll bring the girls , and I 'll step on before . Exit Glaud . Madge . Madge Poor Peg ! Look , Jenny , see the poor thing 's eyes , How weak and red they look ; ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his horse , To strut a gentle spark at E'nburgh cross ; To change his crook , cut from the bushy plain , For a nice sword and glancing headed cane ; To leave his ram-horn spoons , his milk and whey , For gentler tea , that smells like new-mown hay ; To leave the green-sward dance , when we go milk , To frisk among the beauties clad in silk . But Peg , poor Peg ! must with the shepherds stay , And take what God sends , be that what it may . Peg . Peggy Dear aunt , why do you teaze me with your scorn ' T is not my fault that I 'm not gentler born : If I the daughter of some laird had been , I ne'er had notic 'd Patie on the green . Now , since he rises , why should I repine ? If he 's made for another , he 'll ne'er be mine : And then the like has been , if the decree Designs him mine , I yet his wife may be . Madge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay , Pin up your aprons , both , and come away . Exeunt . SCENE III . Scene .  --  A Room in Symon 's House . Sir William , seated . Symon , Glaud , Patie , and Roger , hearing Bauldy 's complaint against Mause . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy And was that all ? Then , Bauldy , you were serv 'd No otherwise than as you well deserv 'd . Was it so small a matter to defame , And thus abuse , an honest woman 's name ? Besides , your going about to have betray 'd , By perjury , an innocent young maid . Bauldy . Bauldy Sir , I confess my fault , through all the steps , And ne'er again shall be untrue to Neps . Mause . Mause Thus far , sir , he oblig 'd me on the score , I knew not that they thought me such before . Bauldy . Bauldy As I was told , I readily believ 'd ; But , oh ! my bones declare I was deceiv 'd : Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witch , She 's both a fly and a revengeful  --  ; And that my carcass finds , since I was toss 'd : But I must stop ; for , yonder comes the ghost ! And the young likely witch , whose rosy cheek Sent me without my wit the de'il to seek . Enter Madge , Peggy , and Jenny . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Looking at Peggy . Whose daughter 's she wears the Aurora gown , With face so fair , and locks a lovely brown ? How sparkling are her eyes ! What 's this I find ? The girl brings all my sister to my mind ! Such were the features once adorn 'd a face , Which death too soon depriv 'd of sweetest grace . Is this your daughter , Glaud ? Glaud . Glaud  --  Sir , she 's my niece ,  --  And yet she 's not : but I should hold my peace . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy This is a contradiction ; what d' you mean ? She is and is not :  --  pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I doubt if I should make appear What I have kept a secret thirteen year : Mause . Mause You may reveal what I can fully clear . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Speak on , I 'm all impatience !  --  Pat . Patie  --  So am I ! For , much I hope , and hardly yet know why . Glaud . Glaud Then , since my master orders , I obey :  --  This comely foundling , one clear morn in May , Close by the lee-side of my house , I found , All sweet and clean , and carefully wrapt round With infant-weeds , of rich and gentle make : What could they be , thought I , did her forsake ? Who , worse than brutes , could leave , expos 'd to air , So much of innocence , so sweetly fair , So helpless young ? For she appear 'd to me Only about some few months old to be , I took her in my arms , the infant smil 'd , With such a look ' t would made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since that time She 's been an orphan and a niece of mine . You see she 's likely , I can swear she 's good , And very sure she 's come of gentle blood : Of whom I know not ,  --  neither when nor where , This to your honour I with truth declare . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy The tale seems strange !  --  Pat . Patie  --  The tale delights my ear ! Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Command your joys , young man , till truth appear . Mause . Mause That be my task :  --  now , sir , bid all be hush : Peggy may smile ,  --  thou hast no cause to blush . Long have I wish 'd to see this happy day , That I might safely to the truth give way : That I may now your worthy honour name , As best and nearest kin that she can claim ; You saw't at first , and with quick eye did trace Your sister 's beauty in her daughter 's face . Sir Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prove what you say , ' T is dang'rous in affairs like this to play . Pat . Patie What reason , sir , can an old woman have To tell a lie , when she 's so near her grave ? But how , or why , it should be truth ; I grant , I every thing that looks like reason want . Omnes . Omnes The story 's odd ! we wish to hear it out . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Make haste , good woman , and resolve each doubt . Mause . Mause Leading Peggy to Sir William . Sir , view me well : has fifteen years so plow 'd An aged face you have so often view 'd ? Sir , now does she before your honour stand , Who nurs 'd her mother , that now holds my hand ! And stronger proofs can give if you demand . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Ha ! honest nurse , where were my eyes before ? I know thy faithfulness , and need no more . Yet , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose her , who was so unkind ? Sir William embraces Peggy , and makes her sit by him . Yes , surely thou'rt my niece , truth must prevail , But no more words till Mause relate her tale . Pat . Patie Good nurse , go on ! no music 's half so fine , Or can give pleasure like these words of thine . Mause . Mause Then it was I that sav 'd her infant life ; Her death being threaten 'd by an uncle 's wife . The story 's long , but I the secret knew , How they pursu 'd with avaricious view Her rich estate , of which they 're now possest : All this to me a confident confest . I heard with horror , and , with trembling , dread They 'd choak the helpness orphan in her bed . That very night , when all was sunk in rest , At midnight-hour the floor I softly prest , And stole the sleeping innocent away , With whom I travell 'd some few miles e'er day . All day I hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journey , lighted by the moon . Till eastward fifty miles , I reach 'd these plains , Where needful plenty glads your cheerful swains . Afraid of being found out ,  --  her to secure , I then laid down at this good farmer 's door ; And took a neighb'ring cottage here , that I , Whate'er should happen to her , might be by . This honest Glaud himself and Symon may Remember well , how I , that very day , From Roger 's father took my little cot . Glaud . Glaud With tears of joy . I well remember't : Lord reward you for't ! Long have I wish 'd for this : and often thought Such knowledge sometime would about be brought . Pat . Patie ' T is now a crime to doubt ;  --  my joys are full , With due obedience to my parent 's will . Sir , with paternal love , survey her charms , And blame me not for rushing to her arms . She 's mine by vows , and would , though still unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy My niece , my daughter , welcome to my care , Sweet image of thy mother , good and fair ; Equal with Patrick ! now my greatest aim Shall be to aid your joys and well-match 'd flame . My son , receive her from your father 's hand , With as good will as either would demand . Patie and Peggy embrace , and kneel to Sir William . Pat . Patie With as much joy this blessing I receive , As one would life that 's sinking in a wave . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy raising them . I give you both my blessing ; may your love Produce a happy race , and still improve . Peg . Peggy My wishes are complete ;  --  my joys arise , While I 'm half dizzy with the blest surprise . And am I then a match for my own lad , That for me so much gen'rous kindness had ? Long may Sir William bless these happy plains , Happy , while heav'n grant he on them remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our master be , Our little wants , kind sir , you 'll eas'ly see : Th ' estate be yours , my Peggy 's one to me ! Glaud . Glaud I hope your honour , now , will take amends Of them that sought her life , for wicked ends . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy The base unnat'ral villain soon shall know That eyes above watch the affairs below : I 'll strip him soon of all to her ' pertains , And make him reimburse his ill-got gains . Peg . Peggy To me the views of wealth , and an estate , Seem light , when put in balance with my Pate : For his sake only I 'll still thankful bow For such a kindness , best of men , to you . Sym . Symon What cheerful aspects waken up the day ! I hope , sir , now , you 'll not soon haste away ? Shall I unsaddle your horse , and make prepare A dinner for you , of good country fare ? See how much joy unwrinkles ev'ry brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you ! E'en Bauldy , the bewitch 'd , has quite forgot Sly Madge 's stripes and cunning Mause 's plot . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy Freely , old man , remain with you this day ; I never from these fields again will stray : Masons and joiners shall my house repair , And skilful gard'ners shall new planting rear : My father 's hearty table restor 'd must be , And my best friends oft'times rejoice with me . Sym . Symon That 's the best news I 've heard these twenty year , New day breaks up , rough times begin to clear . Glaud . Glaud God save the King ! and save Sir William long T'enjoy their own , and raise the shepherd 's song . Rog . Roger Who will not dance ? who will not gladly sing , With mirth and glee , God save our noble King ? Bauldy . Bauldy God save the King !  --  but curse the wicked charm That tune convey 'd , when I thought little harm : But now I 'm ' greed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogg 'd , and nearly turn 'd my brains : I 'm now quite glad , and freely them forgive , To join and sing , long may Sir William live ! Madge . Madge Long may he live !  --  and , Bauldy , take a wink , Do n't foul your tongue , nor speak before you think ; And never call her old that wants a man , Left o'er your sconce some witch her fingers scan . This day I 'll with the youngest of your ramp , And ever brag that I was call 'd the aunt Of our young lady !  --  Peg . Peggy  --  And I your niece ; And to reward your care will never cease : And , my good nurse , how shall I grateful be For all thy matchless kindness done to me ? Mause . Mause The flowing pleasure of this happy day Does more than all I can require repay . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy To faithful Symon , and , kind Glaud , to you , And to your heirs , I give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as justly due For acting as kind fathers to the pair , Who have enough besides , and these can spare . Mause , in my house in calmness close your days , With nought to do but sing your Maker 's praise . Omnes . Omnes The Lord of heav'n return your honour 's love ! Enjoy his mercies , and his blessings prove ! Pat . Patie presenting Roger to Sir William . Sir , here 's my trusty friend , that always shar 'd My bosom secrets ere I was a laird . Glaud 's daughter Jennet ( Jenny , think no shame ! ) Rais 'd and maintains in him a lover 's flame : Long was he ' bash 'd ; at last , he spoke and won , And hopes to be our honest uncle 's son : Be pleas 'd to speak to Glaud for his consent , That none may wear the face of discontent . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy My son 's demand is fair .  --  Glaud , let me crave That trusty Roger may your daughter have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this estate , I 'll make him chamberlain . Glaud . Glaud You crowd your bounties , sir : what can we say , But that we owe you more than we can pay ? Whate'er your honour wills , I shall obey . Roger , my daughter with my blessing take : And still our master 's right your bus'ness make : Please him , be faithful , and this old grey head Shall rest in quietness when among the dead . Rog . Roger I ne'er was good at speaking all my days , Nor can I so much goodness duly praise : But , for my master , father , and my wife , I will employ the cares of all my life . Sir Will . Sir William Worthy My friends , I 'm satisfy 'd you 'll all behave , Each , in his station , as I wish or crave . Be ever virtuous ; soon or late you 'll find Reward and satisfaction to your mind . The maze of life , sometimes , looks dark and wild , And oft , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we stand on brinks of dark despair , Some happy turn with joy dispels our care . Now all 's set right , who sings best let me hear . Pat . Patie When you demand I readiest should obey ; And only wait to hear the music play . SONG XV . Here attend , all ye swains , And ye nymphs of the plains . Quit your flocks and your herds for a while ; Hither quickly repair , In our mirth a part share , And each lass her love meet with a smile . Hark ! the drum Hymen beats ; Hark ! how echo repears The sweet sound , as it flies swift away ; O'er hills , and o'er dales , Ev'ry ear it assails , And mocks their too tedious delay , O ! how happy is he , that contented can be To enjoy the best treasure of life ; All he 'd wish e'er to gain , He 'll be sure to obtain , In a prudent and sensible wise . Should the rover pretend That these joys will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mark how pain and disease The lewd libertine seize , Ere he reaches the height of life 's noon . But how wretched , indeed , He whom fate has decreed From the arms of his fair-one to part ! All endeavours are vain To assuage the sharp pain Which is felt in a love-troubled heart . Though life 's busy scene May oft help to serene And disperse the dark clouds of despair ; Yet when night 's silent noon Helps to add to the gloom , Who can say what the mind suffers there ! Haste this day to employ , Thus devoted to joy , And with innocent mirth let 's abound , Thus in chorus we 'll sing , While the forest shall ring With the burthen of music 's sost sound . May all present attain A life free from pain Ever strangers to discord or strise ; May the single soon find , In the maiden that 's kind , The joys of an amiable wife ! Excunt omnes . Back matter EPILOGUE . I 'm sent to ask you , how you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be nay ! But , if you think it not so much amiss , Pray shall I tell them that you answered yes ? And , from a panic , raise their souls to bliss . They 've done their best to act the scenes you 've seen , For much they hop 'd they 'd meet with your esteem : When love and loyalty inspire the lays , A love of loyalty ensures your praise . The style is humble ;  --  that I grant is true : But then , ye know , so are the actors too . I need not tell you that it would seem odd To hear a rustic talking like a god . The author 's aim was nature to impart , As that alone can captivate the heart . In passing judgement let me candour crave ; A candid judgement 's what we wish to have ; And this we fear not from a court like you , Who , though all-pow'rful , yet have mercy too ; And ne'er will term a trivial fault a crime , As oft amendment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  errors end our days : And faults are found elsewhere as well 's in plays . Give that your praise ye think deserves some same , And , what ye can not praise , forget to name .
