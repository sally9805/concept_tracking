txt *K ART . XVII. -l . The Club Room . Svo , Boston , 1821. 2 . The idle Man . New York . IT is so generally esteemed a violation of critical etiquette* for one periodical publication to enter into a formal ex*imina-* tion of the merits of another , that we should not have ventured upon the works before us , which in this respect , have somewhat of the same generic character with ourselves , had we not farther considered , that it is the only point in which they do resemble us , and that to criticism in particular , they make no pretensions . But before we commence our strictures , our readers will cxcuse us for making some reflections on the history and the value of a species of fine writing , which once acquired a high name in our mother country , and which , in a new and not less attractive dress , has grown into deserved favor in our own . The only sample of essay writing , purporting to be such , and bearing any resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ancieats , is , we believe , the Attic Nights of A. Gellius , who flourished in the reign of Trajan , the declining days of Roman literature ; - it is a farrago of independent facts , criticisms , and loose speculations . He enumerates in his preface several Grecian works of a similar nature , none of which have reached us ; and it is much to be // regretted , as this kind of composition must have been pecul .. larly suited to the light , evanescent graces of the Greek Ian .. guage ; and still more , as such works would have thrown a light , now much wanted , on the social habits of the age . Bacon first made this species of writing popular with the English , by a series of essays , which will always be reverene. - ed as a text book among English classics , for the compact yet simple form in which he has embodied the results of a deep observation in moral and social science . Cowley , fifty years after Bacon , still farther recommended this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects as were suggested by the native delicacy of his mind . Indeed he seems to have gone to prose , as to a relief from the unnatural part he was playing in poetry ; and his essays must always reproach him for having sacrificed so beautiful a natural taste , to the absurdities of the metaphysical school . Temple and Shaftesbury are principally known by their essays , and prepared the way for what may be justly esteemed an epoch , not only in this department of fine writing , but in literature hi general . We allude to the periodical essays , introduced by Steele and Addison , and afterwards illustrated by some of the great-. est wits and scholars in Great Britain . These periodical writings were peculiarly distinguished from all others , in the circumstance of their being suggested by the vices and fashionable follies of the day . They may be looked upon as a body of practical morality , illustrated by such living examples as daily occur in society . The merit of their introduction must be given exclusively to Steele ; for although Theophrastus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches of charter , given a faithful register of the human heart , yet it is rather as the abstract speculations of philosophers , than with a view to a particular application and even Montaigne , who made a still nearer approach to this kind of writing , differed in this material point , that as his examples were drawn from mankind at large , so his reflections were not peculiarly adapted to the state of society in which he lived ; . and thus the great object of the periodical writings of Steele , a reformation in the current follies and vices of the Lime , was neither intended nor effected by Montaigne . The manner in which these essays were given to the world , on separate sheets , and with an interval of a few days between // the publication of each , distinguished them from every thing of the kind which had preceded them , and was a great cause of their popularity . The leading whim in the circle of fashion , whatever it might he , was immediately caught np by these censors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited in the severity of naked truth . There could be no want of subjects , either for raillery or satire , in the various dissipations of a court and a crowded metropolis . But it was fortunate , both for Steele and the world , that by an early association with so fine a genius as Addison , he was enabled to push his inquiries beyond the limited sphere of local and temporary interests into the higher walks of taste and criticism ; to indulge in more exalted speculations in morals and in science ; and thus not to enlighten one age or nation only , but all mankind . We are desirous to express our opinion of the real merits of Addison , from the belief that the effort which of late years has been made , and we think justly made , to vindicate the re*utation of the first writers , who broke up the virgin soil ' of b literature , from the comparative obscurity into which they had been thrown , by the brightness of Queen Anne 's day , has produced in some respects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proper level , as a prose writer ; and we are apprehensive that our readers may imagine that we undervalue his actual merits , since in furthering the same good cause , we have contented ourselves with calling their attention rather to excellencies , which he wanted , than to those which he possessed . But while we have no disposition to retract our former sentiments , while in vigor , exactness , fervent and original thinking , we consider him inferior to many both of the preceding and subsequent ages , we can not deny , that in whatever is beautiful as distinguished from what is powerful , in polite wit , easy eloquence , calm philosophical reflection ,  --  in short , in the perfect harmony of delicate sentiment and graceful expression , he has rarely , perhaps never , been equalled in English literature . The popularity of the earliest essayists was almost incredible . Addison tells us in an early number of the Spectator , that 3000 copies were then daily distributed ; and Chalmers somewhere mentions , that the circulation was afterwards increased to 14,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;ries , No. 10. 41 // duced a crowd of imitators ; and the indefatigable Drake* ( to whom we must acknowledge great obligations in our inquiries into , and our speculations upon , the present subject ) has enu-. merated no less than two hundred and thirteen periodical pa-. pers , which intervened between the commencement of the eighteenth and that of the nineteenth centuries . A small pro-. portion of these have been rescued from oblivion , some by their intrinsic merit , others from caprice , and now occupy a comfortable space on the shelves of most good libraries , under the general , although rather indefinite , denomination of the British Classics . This collection is composed of so many contradictory ingre-. dients , that it is difficult to speak of its character as a whole , which is to be found only in the distinguishing properties of each individual essayist . We may talk of the stern dignified morality of Johnson , the oriental magnificence of Hawkesworth , the polite irony of Chesterfield , the learned criticism of Cumberland , and the rich pathos of M'Kenzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective works , convey but a faint notion of their characters ; and we have not time to go into a deeper discussion of them . We will only remark , in general , that while they contain much of undenia-. ble value , in criticism , fictitious narrative , allegory , humorous satire , and many excellent speculations in religious and moral science ; they also contain a great deal that is absolutely worth nothing , from the manner in which it is executed , and the sub- . jects upon which it is employed . We do not object to a well written piece , because the subject happens to be local , and no longer interesting , any more than we would object to the ad-. mission of a good portrait into a gallery of paintings , because the original is some obscure individual ; if it is well done , that is enough , and will give it a permanent value as a work of art ; but , in fact , many of these essays are not only upon mean subjects , but executed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionable on the score of their gross indelicacy ; and the Connoisseur , in particular , should on this ground be excluded from the collection ; although we think it would be difficult to establish any ground on which it * Drake has devoted five full duodecimos to the British essayists ; and in the Gleaner , a work of three volumes , has compiled , from many obscure periodical publications , several essays of considerable individual merit , but which would have been lost in the uninteresting mass with which they were associated . We recommend his works to a perusal of those who have inclination to pursue these inquiries more into detail . // ought ever to have been admitted into such good company . It is remarkable that Goldsmith 's essays , in which an acute knowledge of mankind is so delightfully set off by the singular naivete of his own character , should not have been incorporated among the British classics . His Citizen of the World belongs to this department of writing more properly than to any other , and would confer at least as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , after a careful examination of these volumes , we can not but think that they now occupy a space on our shelves very disproportionate to their merits ; and were a judicious expurgation to be made of such pieces as are evidently the work of inferior hands , and originally intended only to supply such deficiences , as must often occur to the most fruitful mind in the recurrence of periodical composition , we think much useless expense might be saved to the purchaser , and enough still remain of genuine value to insure them a place in every library . In our preceding remarks we have considered these essays , in reference to their value , as samples of literature ; we will now , under favor of our readers , subjoin a few reflections on the influence which some of them have exerted over the English language ; an influence perfectly accountable , as many of them were written with the avowed purpose of forming a polite taste in letters , and most of them claimed to be specimens of classical composition . The English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gradually matured under a slow assiduous cultivation . Intellectual excellence may exist at any period ; but excellence of language can only be obtained by labor and experience . It must be purified from terms merely synonymous , barren expletives , exotic idioms , before it can become vigorous and precise ; and there must be many examples of false taste and barbarous jargon , before there can be created a high acknowledged standard of refinement and harmony . From these causes , English prose ripened slowly into perfection , and did not attain its ultimate polish until nearly two centuries after its literature had reached an elevation , which perhaps no subsequent age has surpassed . The first of those writers in English prose , whose works still continue to be the manual of every good scholar , were enabled to create them at that early period , by an unprecedented vigor of original genius . They were adventurers where man had never trod before , and // strength was more serviceable than either delicacy or grace , in overcoming the numerous obstacles of an untravelled literature . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They thought what they should say , not how they should say it . The vocabulary was , it is true , sufficiently copious for all the purposes of an elegant literature ; but they were laying the foundation stones of that literature , and in the selection , they thought only of solidiiy and strength , and wisely left the study of grace and proportion to those who should come after them . Indeed , where they aimed at a display of taste , they generally failed . Good taste must grow out of long cultivation . It is by comparison only that one thing is pronounced beautiful , another not . They had no standard of comparison ; - they wrote in a new tongue , compounded of many others it is true , but entirely like none . As was natural , however , they endeavoured to fashion it , as closely as possible , after the manner of the most polished language to which it bore any resemblance . The Latin accordingly was the model , by which all the writers ot that day more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offered to the Saxon idiom ; and this exclusive introduction of a Latin manner into a language , in which a great proportion of words was of Teutonic origin , made it at once formal , intricate , and ungraceful . The following remark of sir Thomas Browne , who , in the succeeding age , both inculcated and exemplified to the most absurd extent this adoption of a foreign idiom , will show how generally the same design had been pursued by men of letters . If elegancy still proceedeth , ' says he , in his Enquiries into Vulgar Errors , and English pens maintain that stream we have of late observed to flow from many , we shall , within a few years , be fain to learn Latin to understand English , and a work will prove of equal facility in either . ' This excessive infusion of the Latin , however , although unfortunate in other respects , much invigorated our language by the magnificence of its vocabulary , and the sententious structure of its periods . We have said , that where the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed . They were taken with gaudy images and foolish conceits , as barbarians are captivated by glaring colors arid glittering tinsel ; finery they mistook for beauty . Sir Philip Sidney 's Arcadia is an example in point , *Mch , in spite of its wild romantic sweetness , is going fast into // oblivion from this insufferable affectation . The euphuisms and the quibbles which found their way into the most serious discourses in the reign of James I , ( that monarch of punning memory , ) are a still more melancholy exemplification of perverted taste . The violence of party spirit during the civil wars , and the acrimonious topics upon which the pen was chiefly employed , were unfavorable to the development or the cultivation of grace in composition . Milton , the most distinguished writer of the day , who , as Wordsworth has remarked , though a Hebrew in soul , was deeply imbued with classical literature , ' constrained his rich and glorious imagination into the rigid inver* sions of the Latin idiom ; and it was not until the Restoration , ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genius of a dead one , was entirely laid aside . There was still , however , a lingering of the pedantry of the former age , which threw a shade over the glowing compositions of some of the finest geniuses of any age or country ; but this wore off by degrees , under the influence of the social , though licentious manners of the court of Charles II , which naturally introduced a less stately , and a more free and familiar style , both of thinking and writing . This was bringing the language nearer to the tone of ordinary life ; and , notwithstanding what may be said of wells of old English undefiled , ' there is much more of the genuine raciness of its native soil in it thus improved , than in the stiff and latinized phraseology of older writers . Dryden , by the variety and flow of his periods , was the first to bring into disrepute the staid formalities of his predecessors . But Cowley , who is perhaps never more a poet than in his prose compositions , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sagaciously remarked by Murphy , * ) of that sweet , easy , and perfectly natural manner , which was afterwards still farther recommended by the pure taste of Tillotson and Temple , and finally brought to a high polish under the graceful genius of Addison . Indeed , Addison professed to have modelled his style almost exclusively upon Tillotson ; but he is neither so feeble nor so prolix , and it is easy to discover in him a much nearer resemblance to the naivete and elegant simplicity of sir William Temple . The English language has received its greatest impulses under the patronage of female sovereigns . Under Elizabeth it was subdued , and under Anne , if not perfected , was at least Vide Murphy 's Essay on the Genius of Dr Johnson . // put in the right road to perfection . Many coexisting circumstances united to produce such a refinement of language at this latter period . The intimacy into which the higher ranks had been thrown of late years with the French nation , and consequently with its literature , b* their own domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfavorable effect upon English verse . It introduced that cold mechanical structure , to which the English heroic measure was almost equally well adapted with the French . But it was otherwise in prose , and the gay colloquial graces of the French tongue had a favorable influence upon the cumbrous pedantry of the English . In the further advancement of letters , criticism came now to be studied . Men had already seen a sufficient number of examples in every kind of writing , to form a high standard of excellence . The men in office , too , under queen Anne , were ( as has been well observed by Drake ) more or less imbued with a taste for letters , and were thus enabled , by authority as well as by inclination , to inculcate their literary partialities . But a principal cause of the refinement of style at this period is to be attributed to the peculiar intellectual character of the existing writers , and of Addison more than all the rest . This character was not marked by the exuberant imagination , or intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but by a subtle and ingenious wit , shrewd observation , and acute delicacy of taste . The turn of thought , induced by this constitution of mind , naturally disclosed itself in a style best suited to the exhibition of its peculiar beauties ; a style which by its simple , conversational , and idiomatic character , was well adapted to light familiar topics , or to calm , philosophical reflection , or to sober , dispassionate reasoning ; which , although not powerful or adventurous , and exceedingly loose and incorrect , might yet rise by an easy flow into a high pitch of graceful eloquence , and which , free from inversion , pedantry and art of any kind , might win its way to the heart by the expression of natural sentiment in the most natural manner . These qualities constitute the substratum , the primitive basis on which the style of queen Anne 's day was formed ; and it is curious to observe the different effect produced by the action of different individual tastes on this general basis . In Swift , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connected by the general tenor of this pure and // perspicuous style ; and the gaudy and studied fancies which abound in most of the prose writings of Pope , sparkle only on the surface of the same sweet natural diction . But it was most happily suited to the simple genius of Addison . Indeed he recommended it no less by tho. *critical precepts , than by the example of his periodical writings ; and to these , more than to any other cause , must be referred the introduction of a polite taste in English composition , at the commencement of the last century . Still much remained to be done , to a perfect organization even of this pure style of composition , which was often loose , feeble , and ungrammatical . The successive labor of many fine writers gradually supplied these defects , and made it both vigorous and correct ; and before the appearance of the Rambler in 1750 , it had been carried to a point which it can not hope to surpass in the gracefulness of Melmoth , and the Attic simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important era in the history of English style . Johnson would have been fitted by his giant strength to have grappled with all the obstacles that impeded the first adventurers in our language . He was therefore well fitted for the mighty task which he assumed in a riper period of that language of reclaiming the **rec* ri*pien*z , those fleeting beauties which had already escaped in the lapse of years , and of preventing their future progress to oblivion , by chaining them down to a permanent standard of accurate definition . His researches as a lexicographer no doubt much contributed to the elaborate pomp of his diction , by storing it with all the . obsolete terms of a copious vocabulary . But he was still farther led to it by the natural complexion of his mind . He wanted a language that would afford scope for the free play of a grand and vigorous intellect ; he would have broken through the fine and delicate texture of the style of Addison . He accordingly preferred the sententiousness of a Latin idiom ; he was a great admirerof Browne* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished than any of the elder writers for antiquated , latinized phraseology ; Johnson would , in all probability , therefore , have attempted to reintroduce the old fashioned dialect , but happily the taste of the age was too far advanced to admit of it , and he substituted a measured antithetical construction of sentence , which although in the highest degree artificial , was both more elegant // and more conformable to the idiom of his native tongue , than the awkward inversions of the old school . He still farther invigorated his language with a great number of Latin derivatives , and technical terms of science . By these expedient* he built up a grand and imposing style , well fitted for the exhibition of brilliant fancy and powerful thought , but very ill adapted to the common purposes and every day business of life . These two peculiar manners of Addison and of Johnson may be looked upon as the extreme and opposite points in English composition , which no writer can go beyond without feebleness on the one hand , or bombast on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a natural tendency ; where extraordinary efforts are demanded , the foriner manner seems tame and cold , while in the familiar topics of common life , the latter has a truly ridiculous air of ostentatious formality . Many examples of these failures may be found both in the Spectator and the Rambler , and still more in the productions of their countless imitators . The Rambler was not in great demand at the time of its publication ; but it made a permanent impression on the character of English style , and by presenting a captivating model of vigorous composition , has done much to preserve the energies of the language , from being frittered away under the servile and humble followers of Addison . New beauties constantly developed themselves under these mutual influences ; and as philological criticism soon advanced the grammar of the tongue to a high degree of accuracy , we may look upon the last half of the last century , a period emnbel-. lished by the pens of Hume , Johnson , Hawkesworth , Goldsmith , Burke , Robertson , Gibbon , Junius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing ; ( our remarks will be understood as applying to language , and not to literature ; ) a period in which precision , perspicuity , copiousness , grace and vigor , in short whatever constitutes the perfection of style , were carried to a height which has not since been surpassed , and seldom been equalled . English composition , then , may be said to have reached its meridian during the last half of the eighteenth century ; what its tendencies have since been , and what they are now , forms an interesting subject of inquiry ; and we trust our readers will pardon us , if we make a few general reflections // upon it , although we fear we have already trespassed upon their patience , by the length of our remarks on the influence of periodical writings . Language , no less than literature , has a constant tendency to change ; what is capable of hging made more perfect , is also capable of hecoming less so , and with this principle of revolution within it , having once reached its acme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both reflection and the experience of past ages will suggest to us several causes perpetually acting to produce such a revolution , and will enable us to determine with some degree of accuracy , its probable symptoms . The art of printing , a cause unknown to the ancients , is extremely unfavorable to the general preservation of a pure standard of composition , since hy the increased relish , and consequently the increased demand for hooks , which it creates , it induces the ignorant to write , and the learned to write rapidly , and of course negligently . Thus the language becomes debased alike in the hands of dunces , and of men of genius ; and we think we may see examples of this , every day of our lives . Another cause of depreciation is the tendency to abstract speculation , which seems to prevail most in the advanced age of a nation . Philosophy shines hrightest in the last page of Grecian literature it cheered the decline of the Roman and in Great Britain , the fondness for metaphysical science seems to have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from being confined to prose , at the present day enters deeply into the very spirit of her poetry . Now the influence of all this upon language is decidedly bad , inasmuch as it tends to substitute the complex abstract phraseology of science , for the simple intelligible dialect , which naturally grows out of the habit among the earliest writers of directing their attention to the visible objects of external nature . A. third source of this adulteration ( paradoxical as it may appear ) is the tendency to excessive refinement . Language in time gets to be cultivated as a luxury ; sound is preferred to sense ; and even good writers , infected with the same effeminacy , grow dissatisfied with the simple familiar forms of antiquity , and superadd the embellishments of their own more luxurious taste . A fourth and a last cause , and which is most operative on feehle minds , is that indiscriminate passion for notoriety , which . N'eu ' &amp;ries . No. 10. // prompts them , in the despair of obtaining it by surpassing their predecessors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conceit . With these causes at work to undermine the purity of a language , it requires the utmost vigil*nce to preserve it long in a healthful and vigorous state . The symptoms above enumerated indicated the corruption of the Latin tongue ; and perliaps a curious observer might fancy , that he already discerned something like these symptoms of degeneracy in the style of the popular English compositions of the present day . A few examples must sumee to explain our meaning . A favorite manner with some , even of the best writers of our time , is that ornamented and highly artificial style , which is well illustrated by the philosophical writings of Stewart . No model of fine writing enjoys greater celebrity . Now we can not but think , that for the severe subjects upon which it is employed , this manner is the very worst possible , and every wa*$r inferior to the chaste and simple diction of his learned predecessor , Dr Reid ; indeed , whatever may be the subject , we think such a fastidious selection of melodiaus epithets , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with directness , manly vigor , or simplicity of thought . Although this effeminate taste has prevailed to excess of late years , among the Scottish writers more particularly , yet w* think it is not so prevalent , nor half so pernicious , as that mystical , fine spun , indefinite phraseology , whose object seems to be , rather to conceal thought , than to express it . Coleridge 's Auto-Biography , Peter 's Letters to his Kinsfolk , ( both of which have gone into American editions , ) are two examples among others that occur of this popular species of writing . It seems to have been borrowed from the very worst manner of the German mystics . Writers of this class never talk directly to the purpose . They explain to you what a thing is , by enumerating all that it is not , and , in the management of their ideas , remind us of the manner in which our Indians are said to have treated their captives , setting them up as marks for their arrows , not to hit , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have also great proneness to abstract speculation , to which their mystical dialect is admirably fitted and should the reader escape from this double darkness , without being utterly confounded , he will carry off such cloudy indistinct notions of things , as will be of very little service to him in his intercourse with the world . // A third , perhaps the most numerous , and certainly the most contemptible class of writers , consists of those , who , from corrupt taste , or a greedy appetite for notoriety , wander from the plain and beaten track into all kinds of affectation . The most current of these affectations is a&amp;'uncommon familiarity , even homeliness of manner , and a forced , foolish sensibility , which claims to be extreme naturalness . All this is very pitiable , and , if widely cultivated , would in a short time melt down the very marrow of our language into the insipid prattle of a nursery dialect . The best sample in this way is found in the productions of a body , who ( as we have somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves in the temple of contemporary fame , as the Cockney school ; and who , first in poetry and afterwards in prose , established their claim to this title , no less by the smart city air of their sentiments , than by the seat of their peculiar jurisdiction . We regret that the influence of these writers should not have been circumscribed by their own Cockney land ; and still more deeply , that they should have found some men of unquestionable genius on this side of the Atlantic , who have condescended to adopt their puerile affectations . From what we have said , we would not have it understood as our opinion , that English style has suffered any material or general debasement , or that it is in any immediate danger ; on the contrary , when we consider the unprecedented fertility of the press of late years , we are astonished at its purity , and we could select many fine writers of the present day , whose chaste and eloquent diction would adorn the most flourishing period of the English language , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we should always be solicitous for the preservation of beauties so delicate and perishable in their nature , as forms of expression , and that we should not only expose , and guard against corruption , but against the least tendency to corruption . We are the more solicitous , from the peculiar relation in which we stand to England , in this respect , a new people with an old language . Our own streams are fed from the more copious fountains of her literature ; and if these are in the least degree contaminated , how shall ours escape the pollution ? The style hitherto predominating in the compositions of men of education in our own country , has been for the most part that plain , unvarnished style , better fitted to give information // than delight ; ivell suited to an intelligible disclosure of facts , hut foreign to all the ambitious purposes of fine writing . Still we have had examples of this in more than one name , that will be remembered with gratitude by l ) *sterity . Franklin , Dennie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left us evidence of the distinctive physiognomy of their minds , no less in the peculiar merits of their style , than of their senti-* ments ; and many more , were it not invidious , might be enumerated , who , in the present increasing appetite for letters , are cultivating with success the most refined beauties of English composition . The Sketch Book , however , is the only one pertinent to our purpose , as developing a new form , and constituting the last link in the series of periodical essay writing . We ought not , however , to omit the fashion , which essay writing assumed , under the auspices of a confederacy of men of wit and learning , first in Scotland , and not long after in England , at the commencement of the present century . W* allude to the Edinburgh , and the Quarterly Reviews , which ( very different from any thing that had before passed under the same title ) may be considered as a miscellany of independent essays on every possible variety of topic , suggested and illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired amonos writing , treating as it did t all classes by this new kind of of matters in abstruse science and solid literature , no less than of polite taste and superficial criticism , is a powerful evidence of a far more extended and a deeper cultivation in the mass of good society , than existed in the days of the Spectator . What has been the influence of these Reviews , or of this kind of writing in general , for it has been liberally imitated , is an interesting subject of discussion , but this is not the place for it . We will only add , that it may be considered fortunate for the cause of truth and of good taste , that every subject , whether religious , l ) Olitical , or literary , has been discussed upon opposite principles in these two leading Reviexvs ; and that whatever , in other respects , may be their individual merits or demerits , we must always remain grateful to the one , for the dili6ence and the discrimination it has manifested in bringing before the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other , both for the accuracy of that *eographical research , which has enabled it to *akc an important addition to tile sum of human knowledge // and for its solicitude in preserving the English tongue , by precept and example , in the perfection of its classical purity . That species of periodical essay writing , which had contitiued in Great Britain , * with little iptermission , from the first appearance of the Tatler , disappeared under this extreme popularity of reviews and magazines . It has , however , arisen within a few years in our own country , with new and very different attractions . The Sketch Book certainly forms an epoch in the history of this kind of literature ; for although of the same generic character with the British essayists , it has many imponant specific peculiarities . The former were written , as we have before remarked , with a direct moral tendency , to expose and to reform the ignorance and the follies of the age . The Sketch Book , on the other hand , has no direct moral purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its comic scenes ( which by the bye we think its best ) we have the broad caricature of a truly original humor , but not a faithful delineation of the state of society in any age or place . Neither do the beautiful pictures of English life hold out any direct moral aim , but are distinguished by the same rich coloring of sentiment that pervades , and , in fact , gives a character to the whole work . In one word , as the principal object of the British essayists was to instruct , so they have for the most part given a picture of common life , in simple language ; while the principal object of the Sketch Book , being to delight , scenes only of exquisite emotion are selected , and painted in the most exquisite , but artificial language . We confess , that we are somewhat apprehensive of the influence of a work , uniting such uncommon richness of thought and expression , upon our general taste , and doubt it may give younger readers , at least , a disrelish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Addison . Of one thing we are positive , that it is the very worst model in the world for the imitation of writers , especially of young writers , who , wanting genuine sensibility , will only expose the beggarly condition of their thoughts the more , by arraying them in this gorgeous apparel . * Had we space , it would be an interesting occupation to trace the development of periodical composition , in our own country , through a series of magazines and literary journals , some of them of great merit , and of miscellaneous essays , bearing too near a resemblance to the general design of the British essayists , to admit here of a particular specification : in which latter class , the Old Bachelor and the $almagundi may he cited as productions of the greatest merit . // V* . r*ssay fl'rd'rng . April , The Sketch Book has been followed by several other works on the same general plan of publication . Of these the most known here are the Club Room and the Idle Man . The former , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matter , is the work of severaFhands , and was discontinued , without any assigned reason , after having grown into a lean volume of something less than two hundred pages . The latter is as obviously the work of one individual , and is now publishing in separate numbers , and at irregular intervals , at New-York . The uncommon merits and popularity of the Sketch Book are in themselves a great obstacle to the immediate success of a work fashioned upon any thing like a similar principle ; and however general might be the resemblance , were it merely formal , a comparison would very naturally be made between the two productions , and the latter , although possessing considerable individual merit , be much depreciated by it . The Club Room not only incurred this disadvantageous comparison , by the general design of the publication , but we think , in one or two instances , very injudiciously authorized it , by an adoption of similar topics , and a similar current of thought , in which , as might be expected , cold conceits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genuine sensibility . In other parts of the work , again , we have reason to complain of a negligence or want of finish , which betrays the youth and the inexperience of the writer . A work of this nature , conducted by several minds , possess* es a great advantage over that directed by one only , in the greater variety it affords both of matter and manner . We become in time familiarized even to the excellencies of a writer , which , unless relieved by the contrast of an opposite manner and turn of thought , are apt to weary us with their monotony . There is , however , a corresponding disadvantage resulting from this variety , in the want of unity and continued interest , which , without much care , it will occasion to the work . The only means of remedying this , is the early introduction of one or more characters , as in the Tatler , Spectator , &amp;c. who by an uniform consistency , an identity of sentiment and conduct , may form a rallying point for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was injudiciously neglected by the writers in the Club Room , who made no use even of the club of characters introduced in the // prefatory chapter . By this negligence , they voluntarily gave up their only method of exciting in the bosom of the reader , that perpetually increasing interest which would lead him to be blind to many deficiencies in his author , or to supply them from the excited state of his own imagination . With all these deductions , however , the work contains several pieces of considerable pretension both to beauty of composition , and to originality of invention . Indeed , in the exertion of this faculty , we think it most successful . We will make a few short extracts , and let them speak for themselves . A piece , entitled the The Village Grave-Yard , ' is pregnant with a solemn strain of sentiment , ( indeed somewhat too solemn for the general character of the work , ) which , in more than one place , reaches very near to sublimity . We select the following eloquent climax as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so short an extract can do no justice to the merits of the article . I never shun a grave.yard  --  the thoughtful melancholy which it inspires , is grateful rather than disagreeable to me . It gives me no pain to tread on the green roof of that dark mansion , whose chambers I must occupy so soon  --  and I often wander from choice , to a place where there is neither solitude nor society . Something human is there  --  but the folly , the bustle , the vanities , the pretensions , the competitions , the pride of humanity are gone . Men are there , but their passions are hushed , and their spirits are still-* malevolence has lost its power of harming-appetite is sated , ambition lies low , and lust is cold-anger has done raving , all dispute s are ended , all revelry is over , the fellest animosity is deeplyburied , and the darkest sins are safely confined by the thicklypiled clods of the valley-vice is dumb and powerless , and virtue is waiting in silence for the voice of the archangel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' we have the narrative of an apparition , artfully contrived throughout , and the mind of the reader is insensibly led on to the expectation of some supernatural event , by a chain of mysterious and pensive meditation . The subject of the narrative is a young German , of an abstract , visionary temper , who in a journey to the place of residence of his betrothed bride , is overtaken by the night at a lonely inn in the midst of an extensive forest . After a suitable description of the desolate , dilapidated condition of the ancient edifice , line thus proceeds : // LApril , I extinguished the light and lay down without undressino* but the thought and scenes of the evening had taken strong ho*d of my mind , and I could not sleep . I did not feel troubled , but there was an intensity of thought and feeling within me , that seemed waiting for some great object on which to expend itself . I rose and wafk ed to the window : the moon was shining beautifully bright , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of the trees , and showed nothing distinctly . All was silent and motionless-not a breeze , not a sound , not a cloud -- the earth was dim and undistinguishable , the heavens were filled with a calm light , and the moon seemed to stand still in the midst . I know not how long I remained leaning against the window and gazing upward , for I was dreaming of things long past , of which I was then , though I knew it not , the only living witness ; when my attention was suddenly recalled by the low but distinct sound of some one breathing near me . I turned with a sudden thrill of fear , but saw nothing . ' The breathing becomes still more distinct ; and after an earnest but fruitless scrutiny , he continues , I sat down on the bed in great agitation , and it was a considerable time before I could at all compose my mind  --  the fact was certain , but the cause inscrutable . I rose and walked across the chamber . I made three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still impressed with the belief , that what I had heard was no natural sound . I was not now in a state to be easily deluded , for my senses were on the alert , but my mind perfectly calm . The old floor groaned under every tread , but the noise excited in me no alarm ; I did not even turn when the planks sprung and cracked behind me long after my foot had left them . But , good God ! what were my feelings when I heard distinct footsteps following my own ! the light tread of naked feet . I stopped instantly just as I had made a step  --  the tread ceased , and a moment after I heard a foot brought up as if to support the walker in this unexpected pause . Could it be echo ? I struck my foot upon the floor  --  the sound was short and sullen , and was not repeated-I walked on , but the steps did not follow ; I turned and paused again -- all was still . I walked back , and as I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it I can not tell , but something passed me , and a soft sigh floated along with it , dying away in distance like the moaning of a gentle wind , It was indistinct as it passed , but as I listened to catch its last lingering , I knew the voice of Gertrude ! " Hermann , " it said , in a tone so tender and mournful , that my eyes filled with tears , and I seemed to hear it long after it had ceased . // " Gertrude , " I cried aloud ; the same sweet sigh answered me , and for an instant I caught the dark beam of her eye ; there was no form , but I saw her own look , that deep melancholy gaze-it was but a moment and it was gone . " Gertrude , " I cried again , " if it be thou , do not fly me , come to me , beloved ! " A pause of deeper silence followed ; my eyes *ere fixed on the air where I had lost her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move like the waving of a garment ; their motion at first was indefinite and hardly perceptible , but gradually increased till they parted and rolled away , leaving a brighter space in the middle . This had at first no determinate form , but soon began to assume the outlines of a human figure . I shall never forget the sensations of that moment , my hair rose , my flesh crept , and drops of sweat rolled fast down my cheeks ; yet it was not fear . I can not describe the emotion with which I watched the figure growing more and more distinct , and even when I saw the face of my own Gertrude , all thoughts oC earth were swallowed up in those of eternity ; I stood in the presence of a spirit , and felt myself immortal ! The triumph was short , it was too like herseff , the eyes were closed , but it was her own graceful form , though attenuated and almost transparent-her own face , pale and languid , but oh , how beautiful ! at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me with a tenderness I could not bear-I sunk on my knees and hid my face , I felt her approach ; I did not raise my eyes , but I knew she was near me by a glow of more than human happiness ; a hand was laid upon my head- " Hermann , " said the same sweet voice , " dear Hermaun ! but one year more ! " and the sound floated away . I looked up , she was already disappearing , she smiled on me , and the form faded , and the shadows gathered over it . I had sunk on the floor exhausted ; the first feeling I remember , was one of unutterable grief and loneliness ; but the next was joy at the thought that I was not to endure it long- " but one year more and I shall be with thee forever . " I could not feel more certain of any fact of my own experience , than that Gertrude was dead , and I should soon follow . ' This is the apparition of a very poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is revealed , reminds us of the delicate spirits of Ossian , through whose shadow y forms the stars were dimly seen to twinkle . ' We will make an extract from one more piece only , The Voyage of Discovery . ' It is the sketch of a lively fancy , and professes , in a letter from the North Pole , to give an account of that hitherto undiscovered region of fairy-work . The natNew Series , No. 10. 43 // ural phenomena of the polar seas are well set off in the embellishments of a playful imagination . To those who are fond of building castles out of the summer cloud , I would by all means recommend a voyage into the northern seas ; as there is an infinite de*L more variety , more of the sublime , more of the grotesque and fanciful , in the clear blue ice , which here shoots up like a steeple glittering in the sun to the height of a hundred fathoms-there floats majestically a huge ruined castle , with its moat and drawbridge , its massive archway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers . Sometimes a whole Dutch city seems to be moving over the face of the waters ; every thing square and regular , the shiny roofs just peering above the waves , and , upon a nearer view , the very terraces and stoops , where I have imagined I could discern the rich burgomaster himself , puffing his tranquil pipe . And then by a sudden turn of the ice , it would change into an India fleet under full sail , royal and studding-sails stretching to the wind , every thing full of life and motion . Or , as it bore down upon me , some mighty cavern would open to my view , where I could distinctly see the solemn interior of a Gothic church ; the dark vaulted roof , the long pillared aisle , and the pointed window , while the blue rays darting from within seemed to shed a glory over the whole . And then again the scene would shift to a rich and various landscape , mountains and rivers , fields and forests , cities and villages growing into view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented at the very court of Winter , and in the palace of his frozen majesty is unexpectedly introduced to several notable personages , with whom he had before some slight acquaintance in his own country . I instantly knew that I must have arrived at the chamber of the Winds , and , looking upward , I beheld a crowd of spirits drawn up in the threshold to oppose my passage , who were blowing at me with all their might . Two , who stood foremost in the group , were particularly formidable . The nearest of these , who had just crawled out of a deep and murky den upon my right , had a dark , sour , weatherbeaten face , which I could but just discern through the thick mist in which he was enveloped , and under which I observed him endeavouring to conceal a rough and ragged-edged knife . I immediately recognized him as one of the great leaders of the Winds , known with us by the name of North-Easter , who is accustomed to sit and watch at the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if peradventure he should catch any unlucky wight upon his way , unprotected by an impe // netrable coat of mail , he pounces upon him , as a spider upon his prey , wraps him in his mantle of fog , as in a cobweb , drags him to his den , and there murders him at leisure with his dull and torturing implement of death . The other I took to be Boreas . He was a tall , active , athleticlooking fellow , with a fine open countenance , though exceedingly fierce , and in his right hand he brandished a double-edged sword , that was as bright and as sharp as a razor . I took care not to get quite within its reach , though , as he sometimes made a blow at me , 1 felt myself almost cut in twain by the mere wind of the stroke . While I stood hesitating on the course to be pursued in this extremity , a figure , clothed in black armor , made its appearance in the back ground . As it drew nearer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , of a grave demeanor , and rather a heavy-moulded countenance , but about whom there was still something uncommonly attractive ; for , as he beckoned me to him , which he did without altering a muscle of his face , I felt myself moving in the same sort of way , and with as little will of my own as the straws on an electric plate . My musket first started off in a right line with its muzzle towards him , and then , as if pulled by an irresistible weight , the arm which was holding it followed ; - one of my legs next flew up at right angles to the other , and presently my whole frame began to glide along , like one of the side-scenes of a theatre , with an accelerated velocity , the winds opening to the right and left for my passage , until I came musket and leg slap up against the grave gentleman in black . I was about to apologize for the awkwardness of the situation ; but he had turned his back u  |p0  n me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttering a sing lab e , or seeming to mind the shock in the least , began to climb the steep and slippery ascent , drawing me after him , without stopping to permit any change of position , in the same odd and mysterious way . Surely , thought I , ( for I did not dare to open my lips , ) this can be no less than that mighty wizard of the north , whom we are accustomed to call Magnetism ! The huge cavern , into which we were travelling , grew darker and darker as we receded from its entrance , till at length we were in perfect gloom , when a dazzling light flashed suddenly before me , and I beheld , a little above , a most beautiful female , clad in a robe of fire , leaping from crag to crag , in a thousand fantastic attitudes , and constantly dancing before us , like the celebrated Will-of-the-wisp . Nothing could be more resplendent than the ' arched roof of icicles , and the pale green pillars which supported it , illuminated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak . From the brilliance of the figure , the rapidity and eccentricity of her motions , I took her to be Electri // city ; and I could plainly perceive , from certain side-long glances and coquettish airs , that she had taken a great shine to my sable conductoi- . ' The piece throughout is in good keeping , written with a sprightly humor , and although xvit*out a moral either obvious or implied , is upon the whole as creditable to the work as any thing in it ; and the personifications are sometimes deli. - neated with a graphical spirit , not unworthy of a disciple of Spenser . We have said , that there is no moral inculcated by this article ; but we do not think the worse of it , or of the work in general , on that account . Fine writing , simply as such , maintains as wholesome an influence over the character , as most poetry , painting , sculpture , or any other of the fine arts , Which , though to the eye Idlesse it seem , hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation , and by withdrawing the ever craving appetite of man , from the pleasures of sense , to the purer pleasures of the intellect . This consideration should have weight with those who , measuring works of this description by their cynical standard of cui bono ? do not consider that a good moral purpose may be effected , although no direct moral precept is inculcated . There are several other pieces of merit in this little work , hut we have not room for further extracts ; and we shall content ourselves with the observation , that we think it in general more successful in the display of mere invention , than in that of deep sentiment , or of comic humor . The good or bad consequences , which we have stated , as resulting from that variety observable in the Club Room , are in no way applicable to the Idle Man , which as obviously is , for the most part , the work of one hand . The same coloring of sentiment is spread over ever part  --  the comic , the tender , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coloring is the same . In the portraits of character throughout the work , it is still the same ; find the heroes of the more prominent pieces have but one personal identity , under the modifi-. cation of different circumstances , and this identity they enjoy in common with the Idle Man , who of course takes upon himself all the unappropriated speculations in the book . It is , indeed , true , that one or two other outlines of character are attempted , in which we think the author 's success is somewhat equivocal . The one above mentioned is that of a person // of natural sensibility , nurtured from infancy in the most perfect domestic seclusion , in the society of his books , his own thoughts , and of nature . In such company he would be likely to learn very little of what is called the world , and to be but indifferently accommodated to Its necessities . We , accordingly , find him of a dreamy , enthusiastic temper , building castles of the brain , and , in the dearth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He becomes morbidly alive to such little troubles as most men would shake off in the eagerness of worldly occupation . But , on the other hand , he is exquisitely sensible to much that is imperceptible to worldly eyes in the retired beauties of nature . His heart expands under the influence of a wide benevolence that takes in every object in the creation ; Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in every thing . ' Now this , although an amiable and a beautiful character , is more likely to excite deep interest in a few , than favor in the hearts of many ; because the generality of men , either from constitution or habit , have too little in common with this cultivated sensibility , to feel corresponding emotions : And we think that the advantages which the work before us derives , from unity of character , are counteracted in some degree by the peculiar and unassimilating features of that character . We will now introduce the author to our readers , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is led into the following just reflections on the labors of periodical composition . 1 know that it is an arduous undertaking for one whose mind rarely feels the spring of bodily health bearing it up , whose frame is soon worn by mental labor , and who can seldom go to his task with that hopeful sense sustaining him , which a vigorous and clear spirit gives to the soul . To know that our hour for toil is come , and that we are weak and unprepared  --  to feel that depression or lassitude are weighing us down , when we must feign lightness and mirth  --  or to mock our secret griefs with show of others not akin , must be the fate of him who labors in such a work . This is not all . When our work is done , and well done , the excitement which employment had given us is gone  --  the spirits sink down , and there is a dreadful void in the mind . We feel as powerless as infancy , till pushed to the exertion of our strength again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we s a 1 never do so well again ; and know how churlishly the world receives from us that which will not bear comparison with what we have given them before , // Yet these sufferings have their rewards . To bear up against ill health by a sudden and strong effort , to shake off low spirits , and drive away the mist which lies thick and heavy upon the mind , gives a new state of being to the soul cheerful as the light . To sit at home in our easy chair , and send our gay thoughts abroad , as it were on wings , to thous*hds  --  to imagine them laughing over the odd fancies and drolleries which had made us vain and happy in secret , multiplies and spreads our sympathies quietly and happily through the world . In this way , too , we can pour out before the world thoughts which had never been laid open even to a friend ; and make it feel our melancholy , and bear our griefs , while we still sit in the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet loses not its delicacy ; it lays itself bare , but is still sensitive . ' The burthen of the complaint is as old as the Rambler , but we bave no where seen its joys and its sorrows so beautifully contrasted . The Son is one of the most pleasing articles , perhaps the most so , of any in the whole collection , and that we may do the work justice , we shall be as copious in our selection from it as our limits will permit . It exemplifies the peculiar character and vein of thought , which we have denoted as pervadmg the whole work . " The sun not set yet , Thomas ? " " Not quite , sir . It blazes through the trees on the hill yonder as if their branches were all on fire . " Arthur raised himself heavily forward , and with his hat still over his brow , turned his glazed and dim eyes towards the setting sun . It was only the night before that he had heard his mother was ill , and could survive but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from society , and being a lad of a thoughtful , dreamy nun had made a world to himself . His thoughts and feelings were so much in it , that except in relation to his own home , there were the same vague and strange notions in his brain concerning the state of things surrounding him , as we have of a foreign land . The main feeling which this self-made world excited in him was love , and like most of his age , he had formed to himself a being suited to his own fancies . This was th' romance of life , and though men with minds like his make imagination to stand oftentimes in the place of real existence , and to take to itself as deep feeling and concern , yet in domestic relations , which are so near , and usual , and private , they feel longer and more deeply than those who look upon their homes as only a better part of the world which they belong to . Indeed , in affectionate and good men of a viswnitrv cast , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // sires , to turn them homeward . Arthur felt that it was so , and he loved his household the more that they gave him an earnest of one day realizing all his hopes and attachments . Arthur 's mother was peculiarly dear to him , in having a character so much like his own . For though the cares and attachments of life had long ago taken place of a fanciful existence in her , yet her natural turn of mind was strong enough to give to these something of the romance of her disposition . This had led to a more than usual openness and intimacy between Arthur and his mother , and now brought to his remembrance the hours they had sat together by the fire light , when he listened to her mild and melancholy voice , as she spoke of what she had undergone at the loss of her parents and husband . Her gentle rebuke of his faults , her affectionate look of approval when he had done well , her care that he should be a just man , and her motherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all crowded into his mind , and he thought that every worldly attachment was hereafter to be a vain thing . He had passed the night between violent , tumultuous grief , and numb insensibility . Stepping into the carriage , with a slow , w*ak motion , like one who was quitting his sick chamber * the fi*st time , he began his journey homeward . As he lifted his eyes *pward , the few stars that were here and there over the sky , seemed to look down in pity , and shed a religious and healing light upon him . But they soon went out , one after another , and as the last faded from his imploring sight , it was as if every thing good and holy had forsaken him . The faint tint in the east soon became a ruddy glow , and the sun , shooting upward , burst over every living thing in full glory . The sight went to Arthur 's sick heart , as if it were in mockery of his misery . Leaning back in his carriage , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly sensible it was day . The old servant , Thomas , who was sitting by his side , went on talking in a low monotonous tone ; but Arthur only heard something sounding in his ears , scarcely heeding that it was a human voice . He had a sense of wearisomeness from the motion of the carriage , but in all things else the day passed as a melancholy dream . Almost the first words Arthur spoke were those I have mentioned . As he looked out upon the setting sun , he shuddered through his whole frame , and then became sick and pale . He thought he knew the hill near him ; and as they wound round it , some peculiar old trees appeared , and he was in a few minutes in the midst of the scenery near his home . The river before him reflecting the rich evening sky , looked as if poured out from a molten mine . The birds , gathering in , were shooting across each other , bursting into short , gay notes , or singing *eir evening // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find all so bright and cheerful , and so near his own borne too . His horses ' hoofs struck upon the old wooden bridge . The sound went to his heart . It was here his mother took her last leave of him , and blessed him . As he passed through the village there was a feeling of strangeness , that every thing should be ju*t as it was when . he left it . There was an undefined thought floating in his mind , that his mother 's state should produce a visible change in all that he had been familiar with . But the boys were at their noisy games in the street , the laborers returning , talking together , from their work , and the old men sitting quietly at their doors . He concealed himself as well as he could , and bade Thomas hasten on . ' These reflections are singularly beautiful . He finds his mother alive , but drawing near to her last hour , and after a night of anxiety , he returns the following morning to her bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and said , she had lived with the belief that he was mindful of her , and with the conviction , which grew stronger as death approached , that she should meet him in another world . She said but little more , as she grew weaker and weaker every hour . Arthur sat by in silence holding her hand . He saw that she was sensible he was watching her countenance , for every now and then she opened her dull eye and looked towards him , and endeavored to smile . The day wore slowly away . The sun went down , and the melancholy and still twilight came on . Nothing was heard but the ticking of the watch , telling him with a resistless power , that the hour was drawing nigh . He gasped , as if under some invisible , gigantic grasp , which it was not for human strength to struggle against . It was now quite dark , and by the pale light of the night-lamp in the chimney corner , the furniture in the room threw huge and uncouth figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shadowy ministers of death appeared gathering round , waiting the duty of the hour appointed them . Arthur shuddered for a moment with superstitious awe ; but the solemn elevation which a good man feels at the sight of the dying , took possession of him , and he became calm again . The approach of death has so much which is exalting , that our grief is , for the time , forgotten . And could one who had seen Arthur a few hours before , now have looked upon the grave and grand repose of his countenance , he would hardly have known him . The livid hue of death was fast spreading over his mother 's face . He stooped forward to catch the sound of her breathing . It grew quick and faint. - " My mother . " - She opened her eyes , for the last time upon him  --  a faint flush passed over her cheek-. // there was the serenity of an angel in her look-her hand just pressed his . It was all over . his spirit had endured to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with his face upon his mother 's pillow , be wept like a child . ' This is the eloquent language of *genuine feeling , and the mysterious indefinite horrors conjured up by his clouded imagination are touched with a masterly hand . In Musings , ' he indulges a vein of sentiment which terminates in the following high contemplations . When such an one , ' speaking of the man of a refined and feeling soul , when such an one turns away from men , and is left alone in silent communion with nature and his own thoughts , and there are no bonds on the movements of the feelings , and nothing on which he would shut his eyes , but God 's own hand has made all before him as it is , he feels his spirit opening upon a new existence-becoming as broad as the sun and air-as various as the earth over which it spreads itself ; and touched with that love which God has imaged in all he has formed . his senses take a quicker life-his whole frame becomes one refined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a spirit in bliss . His soul grows stronger and more active within him as he sees life intense and working throughout nature ; and that which is passing away links itself with the eternal , when he finds new life beginning even with decay and hastening to put forth in some other form of beauty , and become a sharer in some new delight . His spirit is ever awake with happy sensations , and cheerful and innocent and easy thoughts . Soul and body are blending into one-. -. the senses and thoughts mix in one delight-he sees a universe of order and beauty and joy and life , of which he becomes a part , and he finds himself carried along in the eternal going on of nature . Sudden and short-lived passions of men take no hold upon him , for he has sat in holy thought by the roar and hurry of the stream , which has rushed on from the beginning of things ; and he is quiet in the tumult of the multitu or e as watched the tracery of leaves playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him an open and fair mindpain and death seem passing away , for all about him is cheerful and in its spring . His virtues are not taught him as lessons , but are shed upon him , and enter into him like the light and warmth of the sun . Amidst all the variety of the earth , he sees a fitness which frees him from the formalities of rule , and lets him abroad to find a pleasure in all things , and order becomes a simple feeling of the soul . Religion to such an one has thoughts and visions and sensa // tions , tinged as it were with a holier and brighter light than falls on other men . The love and reverence of the Creator make their abode in his imagination , and he gathers about them the earth and air and ideal worlds . His heart is made glad with the perfectness in the Works of God , when he considers that even of the multitude of things that are growin*np and decaying , and of those which have come and gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each was as fair and complete as if made to live forever for our instruction and delight . Freedom and order and beauty and grandeur are in accordance in his mind , and give largeness and height to his thoughts-he moves amongst the bright clouds , he wanders away into the measureless depths of the stars , and is touched by the fire with which God has lighted them-all that is made partakes of the eternal , and religion be comes a perpetual pleasure . ' The preceding extracts , short and mutilated as they have necessarily been , give but an imperfect notion of the merits of the whole work , yet they sufficiently develop that delicate feature which predominates in the moral and in the intellectual character of the writer , and produces a beautiful harn*ony between both . His descriptions of scenery derive such attraction from this moral delicacy , that we regret he has not indulged more unreservedly in them . The work abounds in those speculations , or more properly reveries , which would naturally grow out of a frequent communion between a man of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes thought him extravagant in building strong emotions upon trifling causes , and sometimes querulous in his disgust at the impertinence and vanities of the world , we must pardon these as the natural excesses of a sensibility which forms the peculiar beauty of his mind , indeed , we become almost reconcilcd to a similar alienation from the heartless occupations of the world , when we enter the magic circle of serene and simple pleasures , which he has drawn around the threshold of domestic life . When he steps beyond these precincts , and ventures upon the brisk repartee and mixed wit of social or fashionable intercourse , the quaint and forced vivacity of his manner shows that he is not in his natural element . We wish we could cud with the enumeration of these amiable beauties ; but we feel it our duty to point out a defect , which is the more dangerous from its association with these beauties . We mean an affectation of style , which disfigures some portions of the work much more than others ; but which // is so widely spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep root in the mind of the author , and have been nourished there with hopeless perversity of taste . We have before remarked in this article , that the habit of abstract speculation has led some writers of the present day into an affectation of a mystical , vague , and unintelligible phraseology . This defect of style we must lay to the charge of the Idle Man ; and we will illustrate our meaning by one or two examples . In his remarks on Kean 's manner of playing Othello , we have the following curious piece of criticism . In the passage beginning with 0 now forever Farewell the tranquil mind , there was a mysterious confluence of sounds passing off into infinite distance , and every thought and feeling within him seemed travelling with them ! ' Again , in a Letter from Town , we have this description of a person : His eyes had that look between suspended thought and inward contemplation , which makes the finest eye in the world . For the most part there was a rich haze over them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the sun bursting through a mist . ' Again , in Musings , we have the following observations upon the character of a man of fine imagination : All that the eye falls upon , and all that touches the heart , run off into airy distance , and the regions , into which the sight stretches , are alive and bright and beautiful , with countless shapings and fair hues of gladdened fancy . ' Again , on the same subject : The ordinary acts , which spring from the good will of social life , take up their dwelling within him , and mingle with his sentiment , forming a little society in his mind , going on in harmony with its generous enterprises , its friendly labors and tasteful pursuits . They undergo a change-becoming a portion of him , making a part of his secret joy and melancholy , and wandering at large among his far off thoughts ! Now the greater portion of these extracts not only give us no definite idea of the author 's meaning , but hardly furnish // the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more perplexing than that of the blind man , ( mentioned by Locke , ) who compared his idea of the color of scarlet to the sound of a trumpet . Lavater himself , we think , would have been noaplused in an attempt to explain a look between suspended thought and inward conlemplatiort , or an eye unik a rich haze over it . Then we have thoughts and feelings #*avelling off with the sound of a man 's voice into infinite distance ! So we are told that whatever the eye falls upon runs off into airy distance ; and finally , ( by a catachresis , none of the most gentle , ) that the ordinary actions of social life form asociet* in a man 's mind , and wander at large among his Jar off thoughts ! We confess all this wanders far off from our comprehensions , and we trust our author will bring his thoughts in future a little closer to the standard of common language , for the benefit of ordinary readers . In our opinion , this mystical phraseology arises from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as require the closer scrutiny of reason . Sense is refined away into the most subtle sentiment ; and the vague conceptions of the writer become unintelligihle from the indefinite language , in which they are disguised . Dark and mysterious sentiment may be conveyed by a skilful selection of definite language , and in poetry ( where this is more allowable , ) it often heightens the sublimity ; but indefinite sentiments , disguised in indefinite language , become absolute nonsense , and as such make no impression on the understanding of the reader . The work is moreover well sprinkled with such unusual and antiquated terms and phrases , as could be recommended by nothing but the infrequency of their use among writers of the present day . There is , besides , a perpetual straining after simplicity , which circumstances , as they naturally beget a quaint and feeble diction , are a serious disparagement to the intrinsic beauty of the sentiment . We have expressions like these A tree lays itself out upon the air . ' We sit in the secret of our own souls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every movement of the outward man . ' Can not make knee to , ' for can not kneel to . I can not away with it , ' for I can not endure it . The eternal going on of nature , ' for course of nature . Touch at the eye , ' for touch the eye , &amp;c. &amp;c. which feeble amplifications , when frequent , destroy the vigorous compactness of our idiom , and co*nvert particles , from // being the joints of a language , into mere supernumerary members of it . We are aware , that some of these and similar phrases are dug out of the obsolete vocabularies of some of our greatest writers . But they wrote before the full development of our language , and to revive them now is to revive not the graces , but the feebleness and inaccuracies of the days of Addison . We know there are some , who admire these affectations , as the indication of original and refined taste ; and we are for this reason the more strenuous in entering our protest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stael , when she says , ii n'est point , en general , de symptome plus sur de la sterilit*i des iddes , que l'invention des mots ; ' but we do think that the invention , or what is much the same , the revival of obsolete expressions , or any other affected deviation from established phraseology in the present perfected state of the English tongue , is an indication of excessively bad taste , as it must draw off the attention of the reader from what is really valuable in the thought , to the eccentricity of the expression ; and must authorize , by its example , every new adventurer to invade the standard of the national currency . We should be much gratified , could we flatter ourselves that our remarks , ( should they ever find their way to the author of the work before us , ) would have any influence in correcting this perversity of his delicate genius . But we have no reason to expect it , both because the whole has the appearance rather of system , than of accidental deviation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contempt for the opinions , either of reviewers , or of scholars , or of the public , upon literary productions , he frankly informs us , that the persons in his opinion most competent to form such opinions are those self-taught men , who live out of literary society ! But although from these circumstances we can not hope to make an impression upon the author of the Idle Man , we trust our remarks will in some measure counteract any baneful influence , which its undeniable virtues may have given it over the tastes of our readers. * We have said that the style of composition in our own country has in general been plain and unambitious . We intended to apply this remark , however , to scholars and to professed * We can not quit the Idle Man , without expressing our obligation to th' Muse , who has enriched these pages with such eloquent pictures of American scenery , as must add new and valuable treasures te descriptive poetry . // write , rs . The general tone of our popular compositions has been showy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and independent forms of government upon the buoyant spirits of a young , enterprising , and prosperous people . Under the continued patronage of these liberal institutions , ( which must always operate powerfufly on the genius of a language , ) we trust that the English tongue will put forth its energies with new spirit and freedom . But as this is th' Aatural tendency of our political system , we should early endeavour to regulate it ; and it is particularly incumbent on every scholar in the present daily , we may say hourly expansion , of a more cultivated literature , to set an example of pure , perspicuous , classical composition , and not to mislead the unpractised judgment into extravagance or affectation . It is more particularly the province of works , of the description we have been examining , to set this example .

We look upon them as the transitory beauties of cultivation , which may exercise a propitious influence on the public mind , when they themselves shall have passed away , and by the introduction of a finer taste , prepare it for the growth of a more elegant and a more enduring lite-. rature. @
