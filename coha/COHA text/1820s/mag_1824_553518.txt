XII. - Remarks during a Journey throu5h North dmerica in the Years 1819 , 1820 , and 1821 , *n a Series of Letters ; with an .. dppendicv containing an . dccount of several of the Indian Tribes , and the principal Missionary Stations . . llso a Letter to JUl . Jean Baptiste Say , on the comparative Expense of Free and Slave Labor . By ADAM HODGSON , ESQ . of Liverpool . Collected , arranged , and published , B* SAMUEL WHITING . New York , 1823. pp. 335 . THE author of this volume came to the United States apparently with a good intention , and a disposition to be pleased , qualities of rare occurrence in the transatlantic gentlemen , who have visited us from time to time in the character of travellers . The merit of good intention , and of a prevailing partiality for truth , undoubtedly belongs to Mr Hodgson , which can not rightly be said , we apprehend , of more than one or two of his predecessors . We do not mean , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is often falling into errors , and committing blunders , for which we ' should be puzzled to find a ready apology . Our charity would incline us , however , to ascribe these rather to a limited observation , and imperfect knowledge of our history , institutions , laws , and customs , than to any natural propensity fo ' * // seeing things in a false light , or any inherent love of misrepresentation . It is true , most wise men would think it necessary to be well assured of the accuracy of their own information , before they should proffer their services to enlighten others , and in this particular we must beg to be excused from defending Mr Hodgson , although we may still claim the privilege , of respecting his motives . He tells us , that he travelled upwards of seven thousand miles in the United States ; that is , he went from Maine to New Orleans , and from New Orleans back again to Maine . He also made an excursion to Canada and the Lakes . Hi* remarks are desultory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at others wrought up into discussions of deeper interest . On the government of the United States , and the peculiarities and manners of the people , he dilates with much freedom and confidence . The state of religion and morals among us , the condition of the slaves and the Indians , agriculture , domestic economy , missionary establishments , emigration , the cultivation and sales of cotton , tobacco , rice , and Indian corn , the comparative value of labor , stage wagons , inns , turpentine , tar pits , and numerous other subjects , edifying no doubt to the author 's friends at home , are brought under his notice , and receive the benefit of his reflections . The first pages of his work are devoted to a series of remarks , and some of them judicious , on emigration to the United States and to Canada . He enters into practical calculations , describes the economy and progress of Mr Birkbeck 's establishment , and places in a strong light the privations and distresses , which await the first settlers of a new country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no good Englishman , who values his peace and comfort , will have reasoli to bless the day , when he deserted the home of his fathers to seek for a resting place in the wilds of the new world . Even his servant James , who at first was slightly touched with the emigration fever , and began to wonder how he and his wife would look on this side of the Atlantic , ' was restored to sanity , after passing a few days and nights in the log huts of the western woods , and from these short lessons of experience was disposed to think , that he was better at home than in America . ' This man was doubtle* moved by the unerring spirit of philosophy and prudence . // Mr Hodgson gives us no flattering account of the plan adopted by the British government , to induce emigrants to settle in Upper Canada . Public lands on the borders of the old settlements are parcelled into townships , and the townships are divided into lots of one hundred acres each . These lands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take them up on the following terms . Land offices are stationed in suitable places , to one of which the emigrant must apply , after he has selected the t ? wnship in which he purposes to settle , and he receives *t ticket specifying the hundred acres , which have fallen to his share . He has no other choice , except of the township ; the particular part , which he is to occupy , is decided by lot . When he has cleared five acres , made a certain portion of road , and promised , by a formal agreement , that he will not dispose of the land under three years , he is favored with a title . The distributions are made at stated periods , and it often happens , that the impatient emigrant finds his allotted acres to be a waste of rocks , waters , or swamps . No remedy is left , bu to wait till the time of another distribution comes round , and perhaps another , before he becomes possessed of such lands as can be cultivated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family at expense , without resources or friends . In addition to these terms , the fees of office requisite for gaining possession of land amount to more than half the sum , for which they could be purchased ; so that this pretended gift of the government is in reality a burden on the unfortunate sufferers , who are seduced away from , their homes by imaginary prospects of relief and comfort in a wilderness . We can easily credit Mr Hodgson when he says , that there is not one emigrant in five hundred , who does not feel bitterly disap-* pointed on his arrival at Quebec ; ' and we question not , that his servant James decided wisely , if this was the kind of emigration , which he contemplated for himself and wife* Our author has such a rambling way of narratina his ad-* ventures , and so successfully sets at defiance the rules ot unity and method in arranging his materials , that we shall attempt neither to unravel the thread of his wanderings , nor to bring them into a chronological sequence . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , listening to the debates on the Missouri question , and n*akin* // ready for a tour to the south . From Washington to Charleston he submitted to the discipline of being transported in the mail stage coach , a vehicle with which he seems not to have been in the best humor , and we presume for a good reason , although he bore his calamities with a spirit as philosophical and resigned as could be expected . We do not learn , that he was beset with more difficulties , or untoward accidents , than are common to travellers . His attention was occasionally arrested by scenes of novelty , and he confesses himself particularly charmed with the musical notes of what he calls the Virginia nightingales , ' or what are known to Americans by the more unpoetical name of frogs . So much was he enchanted with the nocturnal concerts of these early harbingers of spring , that for a time he thought himself listening to the songs of birds . I opened my window the first night , ' says he , supposing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two before I was undeceived . ' With the poet he might say , Ten thousand warblers cheer the day , and one The livelong night . ' He had serious apprehensions about his baggage , and , as a precautionary measure , fastened one end of a long chain around his trunks on the outside of the coach , and secured it with a padlock , while the other end was conducted to the inside , and made fast in the hand of his servant ; if he had a nibble , his attention was arrested ; and a bite showed that it was high time to sto ' How often these bites occurred , or whether our travellers were in reality attacked , and seized , and shot at , by banditti , is not recorded ; we are only informed , that two chains were broken in the service , and that the baggage was found in good condition at the end of the journey . The driver of the coach was usually a black man , and it was noticed as an odd circumstance , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who regularly went to sleep at night fall , and awoke no more till morning . The mystery was made plain , however , by the knowledge , that the laws of the United States require all mail contractors to send the mail under the charge of a white man , and that , in the eyes of the said contr*ctors , these sleeping boys are xval*e* // ful , courageous men , armed at all points to protect the mail from the assault of robbers , and the perils of accident . Our observing traveller is not the only person , who has witnessed this abuse , and wondered it should be so slow in coming to the ears of the Post Office Department . The good people of Raleigh will doubtless be somewhat surprised at the discovery , which the author made while among them , that all the streets in their beautiful and flourishing village terminate in the surrounding forest ; ' and his European readers can not but marvel , that the inhabitants of a forest should have the taste and the means , if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods a statue of Washington from the chisel of Canova . In the course of this tour the author describes a southern tavern , which , to say the least , must be highly gratifying to those , who love to hear of American hospitality , and who look forward to the time , when , in the progress of coming events , they may possibly be sojourners in this land of abundance and good cheer . Speaking of taverns in southern towns , ' our traveller says , These are sometimes quite as large , often nearly so , as the York-House at Bath . On arriving , your luggage is immediately carried to the baggage-room , that the lobby may not be crowded ; and the passengers afterwards either send it to their bed-rooms at their leisure , or allow it to remain locked up . You are then shown into a large room , which communicates with the bar , or into a reading-room filled with newspapers from almost every state in the Union . Usually about half past eight o'clock the bell rings for breakfast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tea and coffee , and every variety of flesh , fowl , and fish , wheat bread , Indian-corn bread , buck-wheat cakes , &amp;c. &amp;c . Every one rises as soon as he has finished his meal , and the busy scene is usually over in ten minutes . At two or three o'clock the bell rings , and the door unlocks for dinner . The stream rushes in and dribbles out ns at breakfast , and the room is clear in less than a quarter of an hour . At dinner , there are frequently four or five turkeys on the table , and the greatest possible variety and profusion of meat , poub. try , and pastry . The waiters , who are numerous , civil , and attentive , carve ; few persons appearing to have leisure to assist their neighbors . There are decanters of brandy in a row down the table , which appeared to me to be used with great moderation , and for which no extra charge is made . T*a is a repetition of breaj .. // fast , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost equal profusion of meat , fowls , turkey-legs , &amp;c. ' p. 106 . Who would not emigrate to such a country  --  a country , which , on the veracity of our author , may be emphatically styled the land of turkeys ? From the time he set his foot on the American soil , till he left Virginia , he does not recollect to have dined a single day without a turkey on the table ; ' and , in gentlemen 's houses , ' he often saw two . In Norfolk , on Christmas ' eve , he was told , that six thousand turkeys were in the market . Now if the marshal 's returns are to be credited , and there is any truth in arithmetic , this would make two thirds of a turkey for every individual , man , woman , and child , master and servant , in that happy town . A family circle of six persons , seated around a dinner table , would have their eyes gladdened with the sight of four turkeys invitingly placed before them ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry , and fish , mentioned above as the common fare of a tavern , what can be imagined more suinp* tuous than a Norfolk Christmas ' dinner ? After - having crossed , as he says , and as we believe , many rivers and creeks , and passed through swamps and monotonous pine barrens ; after having seen a rice plantation in . Georgetown , and been shocked at the vacant looks and ragged appearance of the slaves ; ' and after several other incidents , which we forbear to call up , Mr Hodgson at length arrived in the metropolis of South Carolina . Of the proverbial hospitality of that city , so much and so justly lauded by strangers , he was made a welcom* partaker ; and he speaks kindly of the attentions of a venerable friend , ' that was descended from one of the old patrician families , who form as it were the nobility of Carolina . ' So much was he captivated with this descendant of the patricians , that he expresses a conviction , that even in Europe he would he second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar , or a gentleman . The only sources of regret seem to have been , that this worthy friend , this green branch of the decaying trunk of nobility , whom in another place he calls a general , should be a planter and a slave holder . He was nearly reconciled to this fatality , however , when he visited the plantation with its owner , and found him a humane man , and the slaves happy *mnd glad to see their master , who talked familiarly with them . // and ordered wine and oranges for the invalids . The slaves were seen cowering over a fire , although the day was op .. pressively hot , ' and this in the middle of February . On the whole , he returned from this jaunt , with the impressions of the miseries of slavery , which his fancy had pictured , considerably weakened , notwithstanding he had been thrown into a fright at hearing , even in the presence of his benevolent friend , a company of slaves hideously called ' a gang . What there is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such violence on his nerves , he does not explain ; nor does he stop to tell why it should he winged with less melody to his ears , than the nautical name of crew , or the military one of squadron , or the civil one of company , or any other technical term , which the tyrant custom capriciously invests with the trappings of author , ity and use . From the following description of what the author considers the first society of Carolina , we almost forget , that we are moderns of the nineteenth century , dwelling in a land of equal rights and laws , and begin to imagine ourselves hack with the old Romans , in the days of the aspiring Ciesar , or the proud Tarquin . The best society here consists of a few old patrician families . who form a select circle , into which the " novi * unless distinguished by great personal merit , find it extremely difficult to gain admission . Strangers well introduced , and of personal respectability , are received with much liberality and attention . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retain something of their original attachment to the mother country , notwithstanding their sensibility to recent calumny and misrepresentation . Their manners are extremely agreeable , resembling the more polished of our country gentlemen , and are formed on the model of what in England we call " the old school . " They are , however , the last of their generation , and will leave a blank much to be deplored when they pass away . The young ladies of the patrician families are delicate , refined , and intelligent rather distant and reserved to strangers , but frank and affable to those wha are familiarly introduced to them by their fathers and brothers . They go very early into company , are frequently married at six teen or eighteen years of age , and generally under twenty , and have retired from the vortex of gay society , before even the fashionable part of my fair countrywomen would formerly have entered it . They often lament that the high standard of manners , to which they have been accustomed , seems doomed to perish with the generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of the privileges of primogeniture , and the repeated subdivision of property , are gradually effecting a change in the structure of society in South Carolina , and will shortly efface its most interesting and characteristic features . ' pp. 120 , 121 . What heart so hard as not to be melted at this dark pic .. ture , and sigh with the fair daughters of Carolina over the expiring glory of their ancestral nobility ? Who can withhold his sympathy in the melancholy forebodings of the time , when the most beautiful and interesting features of good society are to be marred and disfigured by the cruel operation of our equalizing laws , when personal worth shall be the only badge of noble distinction , when the humble race of novi Itomines shall take the stand , which merit claims , and rely on the force of virtue and character to gain the respect and affection of their fellow citizens ? How great is the pity , that no herald 's office has been established in Carolina , to avert a calamity so appalling , and prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are doomed even now to stand in mockery of their former splendor , shuddering at the fate which threatens them , without power to resist the devouring tide of degeneracy and decay . Borne down with reflections so gloomy , it is no wonder our traveller 's spirits should flag , and that he should remain not many days amidst these ruins of falling greatness . He made his way to New Orleans by the common road through Georgia , the Indian country , and Alabama . For an account of his observations and perilous adventures on this journey , the formidable swamps and flooded creeks , the stories of Indian murders , the howling of wolves , the flashing of fire flies , which C Now motionless and dark , eluded search , Self shrouded ; and , anon , starring the sky , Rose like a shower of fire , - .. - the long and dismal forests , the wretched cabins and coarse fare , the frog concerts , and the terrible panic of James , who , for two hours in a dark night and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking and profuse perspiration occasioned by the fear , that the pound of bacon in his saddle bag would allure the alligators to him ; ' for these and other matters of // high moment , we refer our readers to the narrative itself . The traveller , in passing , enters his protest against the doings of the people of Savannah , who were so unwise as to build wooden houses on the ruins of those lately burnt down , thus setting at naught the admonitions of experience , and challenging anew the fury of the elements . He commends the cautious police of Charleston , which stations a person every night on the steeple of one of the churches , ' to watch for fires and sound the alarm . The day he left Charleston , mounted on a sorry vehicle , ' he saw negroes in the cotton fields at work under a broiling sun and a driver 's lash ; and in the same paragraph he utters a hitter complaint against the excessive cold of the night . ' He stopped for a short space at Mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , to his surprise , ' he found the Dairyman 's Daughter , and Little Jane , in a bookseller 's shop . At New Orleans his emotions were of a mixed character ; with some things he was pleased , and with many offended . In the year 1815 , he informs us , there was not a Bible to be found , either - for sale , or to be given away , ' in the whole metropolis of Louisiana . It argues something in favor of the moral energy of the people , that within five years afterwards , a Bible Society was formed , and two large churches erected . From New Orleans Mr Hodgson proceeded up the Mis-. sissippi in a steam boat , and happily escaping the planters and sawyers , so terrific to the navigators of that river , he landed at Natchez . Here he lodged in the same house , and dined and supped at the same table , with the governor of the state , for two days , without knowing it . When he made the discovery , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affable and kind reception , letting it be known at the same time , that the governor was descended from a highly respectahle family in Virginia , and not concealing his special wonder , that he should have so little of the patrician in him , as to come down to the low estate of taking his meals at the common table , where there was a promiscuous assemIMage of merchants , agents , and clerks . ' And more particularly was his mind stirred up within him at this circumstance , after having met at Washington governors of other states , with far less solid titles to personal and hereditary respectability , aristocratical enough in their behavior . ' We hope to // be pardoned here , if we think the author a little capricious in some of his notions . He deplores the absence of a hereditary nobility among us , weeps at the downfall of our patrician families , laments that we are not blessed with a law of primogeniture , and then suddenly turns round and casts reproach on our worthy governors , in the same breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . We know not what this is but a contradiction . There may be a secret at the bottom , which our short vision does not penetrate . Our governors are not hereditary aristocrats ; they are novi Itomines , men of yesterday ; they have no patrician blood in them . Hence it is , perhaps , that our high minded traveller would have them know their place better , than to put on aristocratical airs even in the city of Wash- ' ington . Whoever will look into the author 's two long letters dated at Natchez , will be made acquainted with a series of very remarkable stories concerning the amusement , which the southern planters give themselves in shooting negroes . On one occasion a planter invites his friends to dinner , with the promise of a frolic , and the sport consists in hunting , after dinner , two runaway negroes concealed on his plantation . They all fired at their game , but unfortunately missed . ' . At another time a man sits all the morning in his viranda , ' with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suspects of intending to escape , and is prepared to shoot him if he moves . The author had the happiness to he acquainted with a mild young planter , ' who had lately , shot a slave ; and in South Carolina he had an account of a young negro woman being burnt alive for having murdered her master . These , and other bloody stories of a similar cast , fill several pages , and remind us of the days of giants , the exploits of robbers , and the legends of romance . We doubt not the strength of the author 's faith , but we are willing to believe , that he was very deliberately imposed on by the wags of Mississippi , and have a much firmer conviction of the extent of his credulity , than of the seriousness and veracity of his informers . He nowhere says , that he attended such a dinner party as he describes , or even saw any person hunting negroes . To the account here given of Mr Hodgson 's travels , we will only add , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1824 . Hodgson 's Remarks on . /lmerica. at a later period in the New England states . Between Portland and Saco he encountered tremendous snow drifts , and the perils of the south seemed to pursue him to the north . lie was first accommodated with what he calls a unicorn equipage , ' but this proving inconvenient in the pathless roads , he and James were thrust into a tandem sleigh about as large as a parlor coal box . ' Thus equipped , they moved heavily over the snowy waste , and were doomed at every step to see Other hills ascend , Of unknown joyless brow ; and other scenes , Of horrid prospect , shag the trackless plain. * But as their good stars would have it , they finally arrived in Portsmouth . Here the supreme court was about to commence its session , and the inns were full , and the weather beaten traveller was obliged to breakfast the next morning amid a motley group , one of the judges , and several lawyers . ' As some compensation for this disaster , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . The aspect of the court in general , ' he observes , pleased me , from the homely , suitable appearance of those of whom it was composed ; homespun clothes , with large buttons and long waists ; waistcoats with the old triangular indenture , or pointed flaps ; and hats with good broad respectable brims . ' With this hint he proceeds to draw a parallel between the dress of the Nexv Englanders , and the people of the middle and southern states , and records it as his opinion , that the New Englanders excel in their notions of adaptation and utility , and of what constitutes the agreeable and picturesque ' in the color and fashioning of outward garments . He says , that blue coats and pantaloons , and black waistcoats , meet the eye so constantly at the south as to produce a monotony , which is not seen at the north . We should do injustice to the author not to notice a new method , which he has adopted , and which we presume he invented , of classifying the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three divisions , in some one of which he finds a place for every individual in our wide spread republic . These divisions he denominates classes , and whether , in imitation of the great Linmeus , he intends to pursue his scheme into orders , genera , species , and varietie* , . // does not appear . Thus far he intimates no such design , aware , perhaps , that simplicity is the crowning beauty of all systems of classification and arrangement . His first class is comparatively small , including what are termed the revolutionary heroes , who hold a sort of patent nobility , undisputed by the bitterest enemies of aristocracy . ' They are scattered in different parts of the country , and mahy of them , at least , are delighted to trace their descent to English families of rank , and to boast of the pure English blood , which flows in their veins . ' These , together with the patricians , whom the author found in South Carolina , and as far as we can learn nowhere else , constitute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division , who , it is presumed , inherit from their fathers some share of their patent nobility , are particularly agreeable , refined , accoinplished , intelligent , and well bred . ' In families of this description , Mr Hodgson passed many happy hours , and met with little to remind him , that be was not in the society of the respectable country gentlemen of old England , who had seen something of political life , and occasionally visited the metropolis . His second class reaches to a much broader compass than the first , as it embraces politicians , lawyers , merchants , agriculturalists , and , in short , the most respectable of the novs homsnes of every profession . ' This class he places considerably below the corresponding one in England , as being less polished , not so well educated , and less scientific and profound . Mr Hodgson neyer forgets the young ladies . We have witnessed his encomiums on those of Carolina , and of the patrician order generally . Let us see how he speaks of those , who come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he says , are lively , modest , and unreserved , easy in their manners , and rather gay and social in their dispositions ; at the same time , they are very observant of the rules of female propriety ; and if they ever displease , it is rather from indifference , than from either bashfulness or effrontery . ' What lady so fastidious as not to be pleased with this portraiture ; or so vain as to think herself disparaged , in being put below the upper rank , when she is allowed to adorn with accomplishments so rt*re the station to which she is assigned ? // The Boston ladies , in particular , ought surely to feel a due self complacency , and a becoming gratitude to their generous encomiast . After praising the Quaker costume in Philadelphia , and doubting whether the characteristic shrillness of voice , which slides from the tongues of some of the fair inhabitants of that city of brotherly love , would pass without remark in England ; and after showing how it is , that the females in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much matured , and their intellect so widely expanded , as in his native island , he closes the description of his second class as follows . Among the young ladies of Boston there appeared to me to be , if less refinement than in the Carolinians , yet a very agreeable union of domestic habits and literary taste , and great kindness and simplicity of manners . ' The third class may be despatched in one word . It comprehends all , that stand on the scale below the second , and thus takes in the great mass of our population . As admirable as this new mode of classification undoubtedly is , it has the peculiar merit of tending to a still greater simplicity . By the author 's account , the first class is already in a sickly state , and must soon dwindle away , and be numbered with the days before the flood , never more to be called From the dark shadows of o'erwhclming years. * We shall then have two classes only ; beyond this point classification can not be simplified ; art can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivhich , in the important matter of settling the ranks of society among us , has hit on a method so congenial with the structure and tone of our political establishments . In conclusion , we have only to say , that we can not conceive of any possible harm in Mr Hodgson 's amusing himself with writing letters to his friends , during his rambles in America . This was natural in a man of an amiable temper , and kindly feelings . But we can not commend the judgment , which should print and publish such letters as these before us . A traveller should not believe all he hears , and be struck with wonder at all he sees , nor think the whole world has seen and heard as little as himself . A few months ' residence in a country is not enough to qualify one to write // a book on the government , manners , laws , customs , peculiarities , and morals of the people . Mr Hodgson travelled over an extent of seven thousand miles , and was always in motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of this immense region . The consequence is , that he is wise without knowledge ; he makes distinctions where none exist , and talks too much of trifles . He is credulous , and loves to tell of strange things , and repeats the idlest tales with an air of faith and seriousness . The value of the real information , which he gives , is much diminished by his want of discrimination , and by his propensity to think all people as honest and well meaning as himself . His book is creditable to his heart and his principles ; we should be glad if as much could be said of his discretion and judgtnent.
