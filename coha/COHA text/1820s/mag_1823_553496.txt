txt ART . IX. - Sketches of the domestic manners and institutions of the Romans . Reprinted , Philadelphia , 1822 , l2mo . WREN our fathers were children , they learned nothing , without paying for it a full price , in labor ; our children have all sorts of expedients and facilities contrived , by which they may play and learn too , and perhaps the result will be , that their children will refuse to be cheated into learning , and so play all . In these days , every science and every art is made // a plaything . One child is putting together dissected maps , and thereby learns geography ; another is diverting himself with a musical game , very scientific in its principles , and no doubt equally amusing and instructive ; and another is set to tvork upon the royal game of Goose , by way of becoming an expert aritlimetician . Now there is some danger perhaps , lest the children should carry the sport too far , and when their instructers turn the things they would teach into games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should learn . Man must work ; he can not earn physical or intellectual sustenance or wealth , but by physical or intellectual labor . All the concerns of this world must undergo a great change , and stand in very different relations to each other , before this decree will be revoked ; at all events it stands now , and is not to be evaded ; and therefore , a knowledge of the elements of the sciences ,  --  that is , a superficial , indistinct , indigested knowledge of certain desultory and very general elements of a few sciences ,  --  is hardly recompense enough for the abandonment of a habit of prompt , willing , and earnest exertion , which a boy may and should acquire while his character is growing . But it may be asked , since children must and ought to play , why not make their amusements edifying and useful , in such measure and manner as may be possible ? We have no objections to this , so long as their amusements are known and regarded as what they really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction , that they become worse than useless by favoring the prevalent mistake , that the principal object of education is not to invigorate but replenish the mind , and the yet more injurious notion , that a good thing may be gotten without toil . Set your child at work upon a task , suited to his age and capacity ; make him work as hard as you can without doing him harm , and compel him to learn and feel that labor , the necessary evil of life , must be borne , and if borne patiently , diminishes , till in the end it disappears . A distinct practical conviction of this truth is worth a hundred times over all the music , or geography , or history , or mathematics that a child ever learned from his playthings , since the fashion of this day came in . The same principle has been applied to literary amusc*ments whicL are calculated for children of a larger growth , and perhaps with more good . Learning has thrown by her stilts and // has come down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the midnight-lamp or the solitary toil of the student , but gathers much homage in warm summer afternoons , and often exhibits her charms to some joyous circle round a cheerful fire . True it is , that the intense respect and admiration which were formerly paid her , have become rather scarce , and the sincerity and entire devotion of most of her worshippers may well be doubted . But perhaps this is compensated by their increased number , and the wide extension of her empire . Many who would have fled from a book , between whose covers learning was suspected to lie , are tolerably willing to meet her , when she comes only as an additional charm and ornament to something they like better . If there be no royal road to learning , there is at least a fashionable one , and many walk therein , who would not have followed the old paths . Now out of this state of things much blue stockingisrn ,  --  - male and female ,  --  has no doubt arisen , and this is a sore evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in this world of compensation , and the good caused by the easy access to literature , is indubitable and important ; the tone of small talk ,  --  the great cement of society , - is much elevated ; better and higher things are made the subject of conversation ; a lady or a gentleman must know more and think more than formerly ; and this is all extremely well , for it is much better to discuss the last books than the latest scandals , however the change be effected . The Travels of Anacharsis ' was the earliest book we now recollect of this kind ,  --  - unless we consider the Athenian letters ' as entitled to precedence . In this class too , may perhaps be ranked the Waverly novels , in which magnificent productions the history of ages , over which forgetfulness had long since thrown her pall , has come forth from darkness into light , no longer an inert and shapeless mass , but moulded by the ruaster spirit of the age , into living beauty . Valerius also and Sismondi 's Julia Severa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late numbers of this journal , belong to this class ,  --  - and the book now under consideration holds a high rank among them. * It has not the form of a novel or a book of travels , but from the general liveliness of the sty*le and its occasional * Mr Bottiger , of Dresden , has published in German an esteemed work , of which the subject is in part that of our author , entitled SaUna , or the Morning of a Roman Lady . ' // wit and satire , is about as entertaining as most tales and travels . The author shall tell for himself what his purpose was in making this book ; the following extract is from the preface : It has often been remarked that , amongst all the labored volumes which have been written on the subject of the antiquities of the Romans , we possess no compendious account of their domestic custpms alone ; and that , although every well-educated person is acquainted with the Roman history , but few have an accurate idea of Roman manners . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of authors with which the generality of readers are but imperfectly acquainted ; and ladies , in particular , are deterred from the study by the classical allusions and the learned quotations , in which the subject has been usually enveloped . It , therefore , occurred to the author , that a concise account of the state of society in ancient Rome , clothed in plain language , divested , as far as possible , of Latin terms , and pruned of all subjects which offend against delicacy , could not fail to be serviceable to young persons of both sexes who are completing their education ; and might , perhaps , not prove unacceptable to some of riper years. * It contains much learning that no where else perhaps is exhibited in a popular form . The author has displayed good taste in the arrangement of his subjects , and has managed very skilfully in treating each one with due respect , enlarging upon all which his readers would be likely to find interesting and dismissing with very few words , those which could not bear many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts and statements strongly upon the memory , and if we consider how much better we remember that , by which our attention is excited than that which fatigues us , it is hardly too much to say , that most readers may be taught as much by this little volume , as by Dr Adams ' heavy work upon Roman antiquities . Moreover we find here a much more minute and exact account of a part of this subject than is to be gathered from the usual compends of Roman antiquities , and that is the domestic economy of the Romans ,  --  their indoor life and manners . It is often said that the want of all information upon this interesting topic is very great ; and so it undoubtedly is in com. * parison with the knowledge which the good people who may chance to live in the world eighteen centuries hence , may // have of our family concerns , if they are lucky or unlucky enough to have our novels and comedies . But still much may be known relating to this subject , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more may be obtained by ingenious implication . At all events , the author of this work has collected a great deal of information , much of which we know to be correct , and the remainder we shall take to be so , having neither inclination nor leisure to examine his numerous references . It is amusing to observe how little cleanliness and comfort the Romans enjoyed , with all their wealth and power and ingenious luxury . Many things with which our almshouses are supplied , were wanting in the imperial palaces of Rome . To give one instance for many , forks were utterly unknown to them ; nor were they used in Europe till Henry 1V , of France , somewhere in the sixteenth century , discovered that they were ,  --  - for certain purposes ,  --  - quite as convenient as fingers . The first fork used in christendom ,  --  a great steel thing , one prong of which would make ten forks of these degenerate days , - is now , or was lately , in the castle of Pau . It is true enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigiously , they may not have been much felt by the Romans ; since , however natural , as it were , they have become by habit and constant custom , they were originally factitious ,  --  and the power of accommodation to circumstances ,  --  of assimilation to the things about him , which exists in man , in greater perfection than in any other animal , soon makes him tolerably easy , wherever and however he lives . Notwithstanding all this , there is a difference between nations ; - between the Esquimaux Indians and the London cockneys , for instance ,  --  in point of comfort ; and certain it must be , that more of that most excellent and desirable article may he had , by any one among us , than could have been enjoyed by a Roman noble , who rode in a carriage without springs , or on a saddle without stirrups , or dined without knives and forks , or lived in a room without a chimney , heated by a brasier of burning charcoal . Their want of cleanliness really appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation who exhibited so exquisite a perception and enjoyment of beauty , as is manifested both in their many works of art , and in all // of their poetry , which speaks of , or alludes to natural loveliness of every kind ,  --  and much of this there is ,  --  should be so destitute of all desire to be clean , as we must believe them to have been , if we suppose their writers to have told the truth . it may seem that their constant and universal use of the bath rather proves the fact to be otherwise ; but the reason assigned by their writers for this excellent custom is , that the bath was necessary , as they very rarely changed their clothes . The Roman poets are full of anecdotes and allusions , which place in a very strong light the common notion in Rome , respecting the uselessness of all instruments of the broom kind . Horace tells of a sad disaster which befel a festive party in a magnificent dining-room , owing to the fall of a canopy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now if in a splendid state apartment , dust should be suffered quietly to repose in sufficient quantities to overwhelm the company and fill every dish , on no greater provocation than the fall of a canopy , it may safely be asserted that any people who would so live , must be a very dirty people indeed . It may also be mentioned among the curiosities of Roman manners , that the masters and mistresses of the world were utterly unacquainted with that article of apparel , which in these days is apt to be found in the pocket of every gentleman , and the indispensable of every lady . That our readers may be able to judge for themselves how far the author has been able so to treat his subject as to make a learned book an interesting and popular one , we will give them a few extracts ;  --  and the first shall relate to the theatrical amusements of Rome The dramatic entertainments of the Romans appear to have been always accompanied with music . They originally , indeed5 consisted in little more than dances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced : at first , in coarse , and frequently obscene couplets , which obtained the name of fescennine verses , from the name , as it is supposed , of the city whence they originated ; * afterwards in satires , still accompanied with " Fescennine verses . " The generally received opinion is , that these verses took their name from Fescennia , a city of Etruria , now Galesa , in the ecclesiastical states . But , according to Macrobins , it is derived from the word faseinum , a charm  --  and the verses were originally used as a protection against witchcraft. ' // music and dancing ; and it was not until about the year of Rome 512 , that an attempt was made to represent a regular comedy . From this period the drama progressively improved , and the plays which still exist sufficiently attest the excellence to which this species of composition arrived ; while the fortunes acquired by some of the actors afford abundant proof of the estimation *R which the histrionic art was held , notwithstanding that , according to the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those who practised it were deprived of the rights of citizens . ' The actors wore masks descriptive of the characters they represented . The origin of the custom has been attributed to a celebrated tragedian , who is said to have adopted it to conceal the defect of squinting ; but it was , more probably borrowed from the Greeks . The interior of the mask was lined with metal , or with horn , in such manner as materially to assist the power of the voice ; and its use was rendered in some measure necessary by the vast size of their roofless theatres , in which , without some such assistance , they must have been inaudible to the greater part of the audience . Yet , as they must have been destructive of that great charm of superior acting  --  the expression of the countenance-it is difficult to imagine how their eminent performers could , while so disguised , have acquired the reputation they enjoyed . ' Another singular custom prevailed on the Roman stage-the occasional div3sion of the same part between two actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate gestures . But it was probably confined to the recitation of verse , or single speeches ; for we do not find that it was applied to dia .. logue , and it was originally introduced for the convenience of a favorite performer who was rendered hoarse by his obedience to reiterated calls of " encore . " Comedians wore a low-heeled shoe , called a sock , that merely covered the foot ; tragedians , a high ba*skin that reached to the mid leg ; whence these words are used to denote the different styles of comedy and tragedy . ' The audience testified their applause , or censure , in the modern manner , and espoused the pretensions of different actors with so much heat , that the representation was often interrupted by their disputes , and quarrels ensued which not unfrequently terminated in bloodshed . Such , indeed , was the partiality of the people to theatrical amusements , that every eminent player had his party , and their absurd factions rendere*l the theatre a constant scene of riot and disorder . Persons of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length carried so far as to attract the attention of the senate ; and in the reign of Tibe ? Vew Series , Ago . 18. // rius1 the players were , in consequence , banished from Italy . The drama never recovered this biow : but dancers and buffoons gwadually found means to return to the stage ; of which they afterwards kept entire , and undisputed possession . ' The extraordinary , and somewhat ridiculous , influence acquired by the actors , excites the more surprise , as we are told that , although courted by the great , and liberally rewarded by the Vublic , * they never were freed from the restraints of the law ; which , as has been already observed , held their profession to be infamous ; and , indeed , the majority of those who embraced it were slaves . Even Augustus , who was their greatest protector , ordered one celebrated comedian to be publicly whipped through the theatres for having presumed to intrigue wAh a Roman matron ; and banished another from Italy for affronting one of the audience who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , held to be subversive of the morals of the people ; and , so late as the year of Rome 599 , a decree passed the senate prohibiting the erection of theatres within a mile of the city . But this prejudice gave way in process of time , and it is well known upon what a colossal scisle of magnificence those edifices were afterwards constructed . The first permanent building erected for this purpose within the city , was calculated to contain 40,000 spectators , and others were afterwards raised of still more stupendous dimensions* they were , at first , open at the top , and awnings were used to guard against the sun and rain ; nor were the audience accommodated with seats ; but , at a later period , they were covered , and built with regular rows of stone benches , rising above each other , and divided according to the rank of those who were to occupy them . The lowest rows were appropriated to the senators and foreign ambassadors , the next fourteen to the knights , and the remainder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats were covered with cushions , while those assigned to the lower classes were left bare . As all were equally admitted gratuitously , these distinctions gave great offence to the people ; and with the greater apparent reason , as they were not observed in the circus : but they were , notwithstanding , rigidly enforced , and inspectors were appointed at the theatres , who regulated the distribution of places according to the rank of the parties . The " Liberally rewarded by the public . " Although it is certain that the prin principal actois acquired large fortunes , whichmust have been derived from the public bounty , it yet does not appear in what manner this was bestowed . They probably profitted largely by exhibiting their talents at private entertainments . That their public engagements were not very lucrative may be conjectured from the fact , that a law was enacted , in the reign of the Emperor M. Antoninus , which limited the rewards usually given to them on extraordinary occasious to ten aurei , or about eight guineas . ' // stage was constructed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestra was equally appropriated to dancing and music . The scenery and decorations were generally ef the most splendid description , and were screened , during the ntervals of the performance , by a silken curtain . ' pp. 142-147 There seems scarcely any passion more universal than the love of the drama . It is to be found in some form or other in every nation that has made any advance towards civilization ; and no wonder ; for in the skilful representation of a good drama , many very copious sources of gratification are united . There is an exhibition of personal beauty , and graceful dignity of gesture , cultivated and heightened by exquisite art ; melody of voice and musical intonation are employed to give new expression and charm to the finest poetry ; and we are strongly excited either to laughter by humor or wit , or to tears by the suffering and despair of some buskined hero . It is certain that strong impressions are thus made on the mind and memory but as dramatic entertainments are never regarded as any thing better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a character as will best interest and amuse ; and it may be considered , in some measure , a proof of the degradation and rooted evil of human character , that plays , acted and popular plays , are every where , if tragic , unnatural and improbable , and so useless , and if comic , licentious and vulgar , and therefore worse than useless . It is difficult to believe that there is any thing inherent in the nature of theatrical entertainments , which of itself , by necessity , precludes the possibility of their being turned so far from their present course , as to subserve the cause of virtue . It is difficult to see why chaste and gentlemanly wit may not be made sufficiently amusing , why the fancy and taste may not be excited and gratified by something better than licentious allusion and imagery , and why we may not be interested by an exhibition of possible excellence struggling with possible misfortune , or of such a degree of moral strength and majesty , as may become the object of human aspiration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of the duties and realities of life . It may be said , that all this will be very well some centuries hence , if the world chances to irAprove rather than deteriorate ; but that plays must for some time to come continue as they are , or the theatres be shut . Now this considera // lion may be very just , but it is not exactly very comforting , as we do not like to believe that the time is yet afar off , when the most popular amusements shall cease to be the most licentious , and the common delight of both sexes , and all classes and ages , become somewhat better than a provocative to passion , or an idle exhibition of unprofitable and impossible greatness , distorted and exaggerated into nonsense . Another species of theatrical amusement , almost peculiar to the Romans , was provided for the inhabitants of the eternal city by all those , who would win their favor or their votes ; - . the combats of gladiators . Our author says but little about this custom , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gladiatorial murder prevalent in Rome and most cities of the empire for centuries , and often indulged to the most extravagant excess , implies so wide a deviation from the common principles and feelings of humanity , that it is to be regarded as an important fact in the moral history of man . Trajan , the pride of paganism , whose excellence was proverbial , gave those games during one hundred and twenty days , arraying against each other ten thousand gladiators . Roman knights and nobles became public fighters . The emperor Commodus ccmtended upon the common arena and drew from the common fund an enormous salary ; at least , so says Dion Cassius . This elegant and refined amusement was prohibited by the first christian emperors , but was not finally abolished until the beginning of the sixth century . It slumbered in the rudeness and ignorance of the dark ages , and is in these days confined to one country ; perhaps because in no other have civilization and refinement operated so strongly upon the character and habits of the people . In England the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has even found an eulogist in one of the most eloquent English statesmen , is a gladiatorial combat between persons very exactly trained , and very carefully prepared to bruise each other with the utmost possible force , to cut deep gashes in each other 's faces , and to beat each other 's eyes with so much vigor , as to occasion excessive swelling and inflammation , which last is considered a peculiarly desirable and pleasant achievement , as thus the blinded party may be mangled at the leisure of his opponenti // The gladiators* are not considered as having exhibited a commendable degree of spirit and skill , unless they have so crushed and beaten into an uniform mass the different features of the face , that all appearance of a human countenance is as thoroughly extirpated , as all vestiges of human feeling are , from the hearts of the joyous spectators , whose delight is in exact proportion to the number of ribs broken , the amount of the disfigurement or destruction of the features , and the degree of exhaustion and sickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fortunate as to witness the dealing of the death blow . This circumstance takes place much less frequently upon the English arena , than formerly upon the Roman . In this particular , the ancients seem to have had the advantage of the moderns ; but by way of compensation a fashion has lately come out in England of exhibiting gladiators of the softer sex . Very interesting accounts of a battle lately fought in England between two women , in which both parties were most scientifically and thoroughly mangled , have lately appeared in some English papers . Should this custom become fairly established , a gladiatorial combat in England will be as abhorrent to all the vulgar , common-place feelings of painful pity , which are usually excited by the sight of a fellow being in agony , as ever was or could have been a similar work of destruction upon a Roman stage . Our next and last quotation shall be descriptive of the Roman fashion of behavior during that very important period of human life  --  the dinner hour . The construction of their houses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the pristine simplicity of Roman manners yielded gradually to the foreign habits introduced by the conquests of the republic ; Greece furnished models of taste in the fine arts , and Asia all the refinements of sensual indulgence ; while the vast increase of wealth , the consequent progress of civilization , and the prodigious population of Rome itself all contributed to the innovation ; and luxury , at length , reached a pitch of lavish magnificence , which , although it excites our wonder , yet conveys an idea rather of barbarous splendor and profligate profusion , than of the refined enjoyments of polished society . ' * This word meant originally , as most of our readers will know , persons who contended with swords ; but it was gradually applied to all who fought in public for the entertainment of others , whatever were their weapons ; it is thus we use it . // Small figures of Mercury , Hercules , and the penates were placed upon the table-of which they were deemed the presiding genii ,  --  and a small quantity of wine was poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the repast , as a libation in honor of them , accompanied by a prayer ; it was a custom derived from the remotest antiquity , and was ever scrupulously adhered to with pious reverence . The salt was placed beside them , and was looked upon as a thing sacred ; if forgotten or spilled , the table was considered as profaned , and it was supposed to portend so*me dire misfortune . This superstition *was derived from the Greeks , as well as that of viewing it as a bad omen to be thirteen in company ; they have indeed descended to more modern times , and are not even yet entirely exploded . The table itself was held in veneration , as being sanctified by the presence of their gods , and devoted to the rites of hospitality and the cultivation of friendship ; were a solemn asseveration made , they touched it with the same reverence , as if it were an altar , and an act of violence committed there would have been punished as a sacrilege . ' The supper , if a meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called consistently with modern ideas , was usually composed of two courses and a dessert . The first consisted of eggs stained of various colors , shell-fish , vegetables , and such trifles as compose the entrem*ts at our tables ; the second comprised the ragot*ts , roast meat , and fish ; the latter , particularly , was a luxury in such request , that without it no Roman of fashion could be persuaded that he had supped . The dessert contained the usual proportion of fruit and confectionary , much in the modern style ; but it was customary to serve it on a separate table , and even the more substantial parts of the supper were occasionally brought in on portable tables , or placed before the guests on frames . Some of their greatest ( Iaint*es would be apt to startle a modern epicure ; snails , and a species of white maggot found in old timber , were fattened with peculiar care , and served only at the best tables ; stewed sows ' teats , fr ! caseed sucking puppies , * and water-rats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lamb 's fat paunch was a delicious treat .

' It was customary to drink toasts and healths ; and sometimes , when any very animating sentiment was given , the company pledged it by throwing their chaplets into the wine , which was called , " drinking the crowns . ' * During the preparations for the battle of Actium , Antony having suspected Cleopatra of a design to poison him , refused to partake of any thing at her table , until she had previously tasted it . Cleopatra laughed at his fears , and having dressed herself in a wreath of poisoned flowers , she proposed , after supper , " to drink the crowns . " Antony , out of gallantry , immediately threw the one she wore into his cup , and had already carried it to his lips , when the queen , seizing his arm , informed him of his danger , and thus proved to him that his suspicions were as groundless as his precautions were unavailing .
