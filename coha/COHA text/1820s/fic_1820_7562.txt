Trumbull , John , 1750-1831 : M'FINGAL , A MODERN EPIC POEM . from The poetical works ( 1820 ) CANTO I. THE TOWN-MEETING , A.M. When Yankies , Footnote : 1Kb skill 'd in martial rule , First Footnote : 1Kb put the British troops to school ; Instructed them in warlike trade , And new manoeuvres of parade , The true war-dance of Yankee reels , And manual exercise of heels ; Made them give up , like saints complete , The arm of flesh , and trust the feet , And work , like Christians undissembling , Salvation out , by fear and trembling ; Taught Percy fashionable races , And modern modes of Chevy-Chases : Footnote : 1Kb From Boston , in his best array , Great ' Squire M'Fingal took his way , And graced with ensigns of renown , Steer 'd homeward to his native town . His high descent our heralds trace From Ossian 's Footnote : 1Kb famed Fingalian race : For though their name some part may lack , Old Fingal spelt it with a Mac ; Which great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next edition . His fathers flourish 'd in the Highlands Of Scotia 's fog-benighted islands ; Whence gain 'd our ' Squire two gifts by right , Rebellion , and the Second-sight . Of these , the first , in ancient days , Had gain 'd the noblest palm of praise , ' Gainst kings stood forth and many a crown 'd head With terror of its might confounded ; Till rose a king with potent charm His foes by meekness to disarm , Whom every Scot and Jacobite Strait fell in love with at first sight ; Whose gracious speech with aid of pensions , Hush 'd down all murmurs of dissensions , And with the sound of potent metal Brought all their buzzing swarms to settle ; Who rain 'd his ministerial manna , Till loud Sedition sung hosanna ; The grave Lords-Bishops and the Kirk United in the public work ; Rebellion , from the northern regions , With Bute and Mansfield swore allegiance ; All hands combin 'd to raze , as nuisance , Of church and state the Constitutions , Pull down the empire , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enslave th ' Amer'can wildernesses , And rend the provinces in pieces . With these our ' Squire , among the valiant'st , Employ 'd his time , and tools and talents , And found this new rebellion pleasing As his old king-destroying treason . Nor less avail 'd his optic sleight , And Scottish gift of second-sight . Footnote : 1Kb No ancient sybil , famed in rhyme , Saw deeper in the womb of time ; No block in old Dodona 's grove Could ever more orac'lar prove . Nor only saw he all that could be , But much that never was , nor would be ; Whereby all prophets far outwent he , Though former days produced a plenty : For any man with half an eye What stands before him can espy ; But optics sharp it needs , I ween , To see what is not to be seen . As in the days of ancient fame , Prophets and poets were the same , And all the praise that poets gain Is for the tales they forge and feign : So gain 'd our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would have being ; Whence he for oracles was grown The very tripod Footnote : 1Kb of his town . Gazettes no sooner rose a lie in , But strait he fell to prophesying ; Made dreadful slaughter in his course , O'erthrew provincials , foot and horse , Brought armies o'er , by sudden pressings , Of Hanoverians , Swiss and Hessians , Feasted with blood his Scottish clan , And hang 'd all rebels to a man , Divided their estates and pelf , And took a goodly share himself . All this with spirit energetic , He did by second-sight prophetic . Thus stored with intellectual riches , Skill 'd was our ' Squire in making speeches ; Where strength of brains united centers With strength of lungs surpassing Stentor 's . Footnote : 1Kb But as some muskets so contrive it , As oft to miss the mark they drive at , And though well aim 'd at duck or plover , Bear wide , and kick their owners over : So fared our ' Squire , whose reas'ning toil Would often on himself recoil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments he applied ; As old war-elephants , dismay 'd , Trod down the troops they came to aid , And hurt their own side more in battle , Than less and ordinary cattle . Yet at Town-meetings every chief Pinn 'd faith on great M'Fingal 's sleeve ; Which when he lifted , all by rote Raised sympathetic hands to vote . The Town , our hero 's scene of action , Had long been torn by feuds of faction , And as each party 's strength prevails , It turn 'd up different , heads or tails ; With constant rattling , in a trice , Show 'd various sides , as oft as dice . As that famed weaver , wife t ' Ulysses , Footnote : 1Kb By night her day's-work pick 'd in pieces , And though she stoutly did bestir her , Its finishing was ne'er the nearer : So did this town with ardent zeal Weave cobwebs for the public weal , Which when completed , or before , A second vote in pieces tore . They met , made speeches full long-winded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then chose committees To stop all drinking of Bohea teas ; Footnote : 1Kb border=0 With winds of doctrine veer 'd about , And turn 'd all whig committees out . Meanwhile our Hero , as their head , In pomp the tory faction led , Still following , as the ' Squire should please , Successive on , like files of geese . And now the town was summon 'd , greeting , To grand parading of Town-meeting ; A show , that strangers might appal , As Rome 's grave senate did the Gaul . High o'er the rout , on pulpit stairs , Footnote : 1Kb Mid den of thieves in house of prayers , ( That house , which loth a rule to break Serv 'd heaven , but one day in the week , Open the rest for all supplies Of news , and politics , and lies ; ) Stood forth the Constable ; and bore His staff , like Merc'ry 's wand of yore , Waved potent round , the peace to keep , As that laid dead men 's souls to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderator 's Footnote : 1Kb upper half In grandeur o'er the cushion bow 'd , Like Sol half seen behind a cloud . Beneath stood voters of all colours , Whigs , Tories , orators and brawlers ; With every tongue in either faction Prepared like minute-men Footnote : 1Kb for action ; Where truth and falsehood , wrong and right , Drew all their legions forth to fight . With equal uproar scarcely rave Opposing winds in olus ' cave ; Such dialogues with earnest face Held never Balaam with his ass . With daring zeal and courage blest , Honorius first the crowd addres 'd . When now our ' Squire , returning late , Arrived to aid the grand debate ; With strange , sour faces sate him down , While thus the orator went on .  --  " For ages blest thus Britain rose , The terror of encircling foes ; Her heroes ruled the bloody plain , Her conq'ring standard awed the main . The different palms her triumph grace Of arms in war , of arts in peace . Unharrass 'd by maternal care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with liberal hand , By far o'erpaid the parent land . Footnote : 1Kb But though so bright her sun might shine , ' T was quickly hasting to decline , With feeble ray , too weak t ' assuage The damps , that chill the eve of age . " For states , like men , are doom 'd as well Th ' infirmities of age to feel , Footnote : 1Kb And from their different forms of empire , Are seiz 'd with every deep distemper . Some states high fevers have made head in , Which nought could cure but copious bleeding ; While others have grown dull and dozy , Or fix 'd in helpless idiocy ; Or turn 'd demoniacs to belabour Each peaceful habitant and neighbour ; Or vex 'd with hypochondriac fits , Have broke their strength , and lost their wits . Thus now while hoary years prevail , Good mother Britain seem 'd to fail ; Her back bent , crippled with the weight Of age , and debts , and cares of state . For debts she owed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge , And now ' t was thought , so high they 'd grown , She 'd come upon the parish soon . Her arms , of nations once the dread , She scarce could lift above her head ; Her deafen 'd ears , ' t was all their hope , The final trump perhaps might ope ; So long they 'd been , in stupid mood , Shut to the hearing of all good . Grim death had put her in his scroll Down on the execution-roll ; And Gallic crows , as she grew weaker , Began to whet their beaks to pick her . " And now her powers decaying fast , Her grand climact'ric had she pass 'd , And just like all old women else , Fell in the vapors much by spells . Strange whimsies on her fancy struck , And gave her brain a dismal shock ; Her memory fails , her judgment ends ; She quite forgot her nearest friends , Lost all her former sense and knowledge , And fitted fast for Bedlam-college . Of all the powers she once retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve , when falling , was so modest To fancy she should grow a goddess ; Footnote : 1Kb As madmen , straw who long have slept on , Style themselves Jupiter and Neptune : So Britain in her airs so flighty , Now took a whim to be Almighty ; Footnote : 1Kb Urg 'd on to desperate heights of frenzy , Affirm 'd her own Omnipotency ; Would rather ruin all her race , Than yield supremacy , an ace ; Assumed all rights divine , as grown The church 's head , like good Pope Joan ; Footnote : 1Kb Swore all the world should bow and skip , At her almighty goodyship ; Anath'matized each unbeliever , And vow 'd to live and rule for ever . Her servants humour 'd every whim , And own 'd at once her power supreme ; Her follies nursed in all their stages , For sake of liveries and wages ; In Stephen 's Chapel Footnote : 1Kb then in state too Set up her golden calf to pray to ; Proclaim 'd its power and right divine , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor heretics to burn us , Bade North Footnote : 1Kb prepare his fiery furnace ; Struck bargains with the Romish churches , Infallibility to purchase ; Set wide for Popery the door , Footnote : 1Kb Made friends with Babel 's scarlet whore , Till both the matrons join 'd in clan ; No sisters made a better span . " What wonder then , ere this was over , That she should make her children suffer ? She first without pretence or reason , Claim 'd right whate'er we had to seize on ; And with determin 'd resolution To put her claims in execution , Sent fire and sword , and call 'd it Lenity ; Starv 'd us , and christen 'd it Humanity . For she , her case grown desperater , Mistook the plainest things in nature ; Had lost all use of eyes or wits , Took slavery for the bill of rights ; Trembled at whigs and deem 'd them foes , And stopp 'd at loyalty her nose ; Styled her own children , brats and catiffs , And knew us not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplicating prayer , We begg 'd our lives and goods she 'd spare ; Not vainer vows with sillier call Elijah 's prophets raised to Baal ; A worshipp 'd stock of god or goddess Had better heard and understood us . So once Egyptians at the Nile Ador 'd their guardian crocodile , Who heard them first with kindest ear , And ate them to reward their prayer ; And could he talk , as kings can do , Had made as gracious speeches too . " Thus , spite of prayers , her schemes pursuing , She still went on to work our ruin ; Annull 'd our charters of releases , And tore our title-deeds in pieces ; Then sign 'd her warrants of ejection , And gallows rais 'd to stretch our necks on : And on these errands sent in rage Her bailiff , and her hangman , Gage ; And at his heels , like dogs to bait us , Dispatch 'd her Posse Comitatus . " No state e'er chose a fitter person To carry such a silly farce on . As heathen gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stood imaged forth in stones and stocks , And deified in barber 's blocks : So Gage Footnote : 1Kb was chose to represent Th ' omnipotence of Parliament . As antient heroes gain 'd by shifts , From gods , as poets tell , their gifts ; Our General , as his actions show , Gain 'd like assistance from below , By satan graced with full supplies From all his magazine of lies . Yet could his practice ne'er impart The wit to tell a lie with art . Those lies alone are formidable Where artful truth is mix 'd with fable . But Gage has bungled oft so vilely , No soul would credit lies so silly , Outwent all faith , and stretch 'd beyond Credulity 's extremest end : Whence plain it seems , though satan once O'erlook 'd with scorn each brainless dunce , And blundering brutes in Eden shunning , Chose out the serpent for his cunning ; Of late he is not half so nice , Nor picks out aids because they 're wise : For had he stood upon perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fared as hard , in this proceeding , As owls and asses did in Eden . " Yet fools are often dangerous enemies ; As meanest reptiles are most venomous : Nor e'er could Gage , by craft or prowess , Have done a whit more mischief to us ; Since he began th ' unnat'ral war , The work his masters sent him for . " And are there in this freeborn land Among ourselves a venal band ; A dastard race , who long have sold Their souls and consciences for gold ; Who wish to stab their country 's vitals , Could they enjoy surviving titles ; With pride behold our mischiefs brewing , Insult and triumph in our ruin ? Priests , who , if satan should sit down To make a bible of his own , Would gladly , for the sake of mitres , Turn his inspired and sacred writers ; Lawyers , who , should he wish to prove His claim to his old seat above , Would , if his cause he 'd give them fees in , Bring writs of Entry sur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And hope to put him in possession ; Merchants who , for his friendly aid Would make him partner in their trade , Hang out their signs in goodly show , Inscribed with , Beelzebub &; Co. ; And judges , who would list his pages , For proper liveries and wages ; And who as humbly cringe and bow To all his mortal servants now ? There are ; and shame , with pointing gestures , Marks out th ' Addressers and Protesters ; Whom following down the stream of fate , Contempts ineffable await ; And public infamy forlorn , Dread hate and everlasting scorn . " As thus he spake , our ' Squire M'Fingal Gave to his partisans a signal . Not quicker roll 'd the waves to land , When Moses waved his potent wand , Nor with more uproar , than the Tories Set up a general rout in chorus ; Laugh 'd , hiss 'd , hem 'd , murmur 'd , groan 'd and jeer 'd ; Honorius now could scarce be heard . Our Muse , amid th ' increasing roar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , in firm record To take in short hand every word , Footnote : 1Kb As ancient Muses wont ; to whom Old bards for depositions come ; Who must have writ them ; for how else Could they each speech verbatim tell ' s ? And though some readers of romances Are apt to strain their tortured fancies , And doubt ( when lovers all alone Their sad soliloquies do groan , Grieve many a page , with no one near ' em , And nought , but rocks and groves , to hear ' em ) What sprite infernal could have tattled , And told the authors all they prattled ; Whence some weak minds have made objection That what they scribbled must be fiction : ' T is false ; for while the lover spoke , The Muse was by with table-book , And least some blunder should ensue , Echo stood clerk , and kept the cue . And though the speech be n't worth a groat , It ca n't be call 'd the author 's fault ; But error merely of the prater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Which full excuse , my critic brothers , May help me out as well as others ; And ' t is design 'd , though here it lurk , To serve as Preface to this work . So let it be  --  for now our ' Squire No longer could contain his ire , And rising ' midst applauding Tories , Thus vented wrath upon Honorius . Quoth he , " ' T is wondrous what strange stuff Your Whigs-heads are compounded of ; Which force of logic can not pierce , Nor syllogistic carte and tierce , Nor weight of scripture or of reason Suffice to make the least impression . Not heeding what ye rais 'd contest on , Ye prate , and beg , or steal the question ; And when your boasted arguings fail , Strait leave all reas'ning off , to rail . " Have not our High-church Clergy Footnote : 1Kb made it Appear from Scriptures , which ye credit , That right divine from heaven was lent To kings , that is , the Parliament , Their subjects to oppress and teaze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they write , and pray , and preach , And torture all the parts of speech , About rebellion make a pother , From one end of the land to th ' other ? And yet gain 'd fewer proselyte Whigs , Than old St. Anth'ny ' mongst the pigs ; Footnote : 1Kb And changed not half so many vicious , As Austin when he preach 'd to fishes , Who throng 'd to hear , the legend tells , Were edified , and wagg 'd their tails : But scarce you 'd prove it , if you tried , That e'er one Whig was edified . Have ye not heard from Parson Walter Footnote : 1Kb Much dire presage of many a halter ? What warnings had ye of your duty , From our old rev'rend Sam . Auchmuty ; Footnote : 1Kb From priests of all degrees and metres , T ' our fag-end man , poor Parson Peters ? Footnote : 1Kb Have not our Cooper and our Seabury Sung hymns , like Barak and old Deborah ; Proved all intrigues to set you free Rebellion ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripture text , That used to wink at rebel sects , Coax 'd wayward ones to favor regents , And paraphrased them to obedience ; Proved every king , ev'n those confest Horns of the Apocalyptic beast , And sprouting from its noddles seven , Ordain 'd , as Bishops are , by heaven ; ( For reasons similar , as we 're told That Tophet was ordain 'd of old ) By this lay-ordination valid , Becomes all sanctified and hallow 'd , Takes patent out as heaven has sign 'd it , And starts up strait , the Lord 's Anointed ? As extreme unction , which can cleanse Each penitent from deadly sins ; Make them run glib , when oiled by priest , The heav'nly road , like wheels new greased ; Serve them , like shoe-ball , for defences , ' Gainst wear and tear of consciences : So king 's anointment clears betimes , Like fuller 's earth , all spots of crimes , For future knaveries gives commissions , Like Papists sinning under license . For heaven ordain 'd the origin , Divines declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such great good they both have done us , Kind mercy ' t was they came upon us ; For without sin and pain and folly , Man ne'er was blest , nor wise , nor holy : And we should thank the Lord ' t is so , As authors grave wrote long ago . Now heav'n its issues never brings Without the means , and these are kings ; And he who blames when they announce ills , Would counteract th ' eternal counsels . As when the Jews , a murm'ring race , By constant grumblings fell from grace , Heav'n taught them first to know their distance , By famine , slavery and Philistines ; When these could no repentance bring , In wrath it sent them last a king : So nineteen , ' t is believ 'd , in twenty Of modern kings for plagues are sent you ; Nor can your cavillers pretend But that they answer well their end . ' T is yours to yield to their command , As rods in Providence 's hand ; For when it means to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Your way is , hush 'd in peace , to bear it , And make necessity a merit . Hence sure perdition must await The man , who rises ' gainst the State , Who meets at once the damning sentence , Without one loophole for repentance ; Ev'n though he gain the Royal See , And rank among the Powers that be . For hell is theirs , the scripture shows , Whoe'er the Powers that be oppose ; And all those Powers ( I 'm clear that ' t is so ) Are damn 'd for ever , ex officio . " Thus far our Clergy : but ' t is true We lack 'd not earthly reas'ners too . Had I the Poet 's Footnote : 1Kb src= " /images/note.gif " border=0 brazen lungs , As soundboard to his hundred tongues , I could not half the scribblers muster , That swarm 'd round Rivington Footnote : 1Kb in cluster ; Assemblies , Councilmen , forsooth , Brush , Cowper , Wilkins , Chandler , Booth : Yet all their arguments and sapience You did not value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1Kb For your conviction strain his senses ; Scrawl every moment he could spare From cards and barbers and the fair ; Show , clear as sun in noonday heavens , You did not feel a single grievance ; Demonstrate all your opposition Sprung from the eggs Footnote : 1Kb of foul Sedition ; Swear he had seen the nest she laid in , And knew how long she had been sitting ; Could tell exact what strength of heat is Required to hatch her out Committees ; What shapes they take , and how much longer 's The time before they grow t ' a Congress ? He white-wash 'd Hutchinson , and varnish 'd Our Gage , who 'd got a little tarnish 'd ; Made them new masks , in time no doubt , For Hutchinson 's was quite worn out : Yet while he muddled all his head , You did not heed a word he said . " Did not our grave Judge Sewall Footnote : 1Kb hit The summit of newspaper wit ; Fill every leaf of every paper Of Mills &; Hicks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toil , In true sublime of scarecrow style , Write farces too ' gainst sons of freedom , All for your good , and none would read ' em ; Denounce damnation on their frenzy , Who died in Whig-impenitency ; Affirm that heav'n would lend us aid , As all our Tory writers said ; And calculate so well its kindness , He told the moment when it join 'd us ? " ' T was then belike , " Honorius cried , " When you the public fast defied , Refused to heaven to raise a prayer , Because you 'd no connections there ; And since with reverent hearts and faces , To Governors you 'd paid addresses , In them , who made you Tories , seeing You lived and moved and had your being , Your humble vows you would not breathe To powers , you 'd no acquaintance with . " As for your fasts , " replied our ' Squire , " What circumstance could fasts require ? We kept them not , but ' t was no crime , We held them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting , Pray , did you ever get by fasting , Or what the gain , that can arise From vows and offerings to the skies ? Will heaven reward with posts and fees , Or send us tea , Footnote : 1Kb as consignees , Give pensions , salaries , places , bribes , Or chuse us judges , clerks or scribes ? Has it commissions in its gift , Or cash to serve us at a lift ? Are acts of parliament there made , To carry on the placeman 's trade , Or has it pass 'd a single bill To let us plunder whom we will ? " And look our list of placemen all over ; Did heaven appoint our chief Judge Oliver , Footnote : 1Kb Fill that high bench with ignoramus , Or has it councils by mandamus ? Footnote : 1Kb Who made that wit of water-gruel A judge of admiralty , Sewall ? And were they not mere earthly struggles , That raised up Murray , say , and Ruggles ? Did heaven send down , our pains to medicine , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us That Marshfield blunderer , Nat . Ray Thomas ; Or had it any hand in serving A Loring , Pepperell , Browne or Irving ? " Yet we 've some saints , the very thing , To pit against the best you 'll bring ; For can the strongest fancy paint , Than Hutchinson , a greater saint ? Was there a parson used to pray , At times more regular , twice a day ; As folks exact have dinners got , Whether they 've appetites or not ? Was there a zealot more alarming ' Gainst public vice to hold forth sermon , Or fix 'd at church , whose inward motion Roll 'd up his eyes with more devotion ? What puritan could ever pray In godlier tone , than Treasurer Gray , Or at town-meetings speechifying , Could utter more melodious whine , And shut his eyes , and vent his moan , Like owl afflicted in the sun ; Who once sent home , his canting rival , Lord Dartmouth 's self , might outbedrivel . " Have you forgot , " Honorius cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2Kb defied , Affirm 'd he never wrote a line Your charter 'd rights to undermine , When his own letters then were by , Which proved his message all a lie ? How many promises he seal 'd To get th ' oppressive acts repeal 'd , Yet once arrived on England 's shore , Set on the Premier to pass more ? But these are no defects , we grant , In a right loyal Tory saint , Whose godlike virtues must with ease Atone for venial crimes , like these : Or ye perhaps in scripture spy A new commandment , " Thou shalt lie ; " If this be so ( as who can tell ? ) There 's no one sure ye keep so well . " Quoth he , " For lies and promise-breaking , " Ye need not be in such a taking : For lying is , we know and teach , The highest privilege of speech ; The universal Magna Charta , To which all human race is party , Whence children first , as David says , Lay claim to't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our generals have occasion for ; The only freedom of the press , Our politicians need in peace . Thank heaven , your shot have miss 'd their aim , For lying is no sin nor shame . " As men last wills may change again , Tho ' drawn , " In name of God , Amen ; " Be sure they must have clearly more O'er promises as great a power , Which , made in haste , with small inspection , So much the more will need correction ; And when they 've , careless , spoke or penn 'd ' em , Have right to look them o'er and mend ' em ; Revise their vows , or change the text , By way of codicil annex 'd ; Strike out a promise , that was base , And put a better in its place . " So Gage of late agreed , you know , To let the Boston people go ; Yet when he saw ' gainst troops that braved him , They were the only guards that saved him , Kept off that satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maul and mutton him ; He 'd too much wit , such leagues t ' observe , And shut them in again , to starve . " So Moses writes , when female Jews Made oaths and vows unfit for use , Their parents then might set them free From that conscientious tyranny : And shall men feel that spir'tual bondage For ever , when they grow beyond age ? Shall vows but bind the stout and strong , And let go women weak and young , As nets enclose the larger crew , And let the smaller fry creep through ? Besides , the Whigs have all been set on , The Tories to affright and threaten , Till Gage amidst his trembling fits , Has hardly kept him in his wits ; And though he speak with fraud and finesse , ' T is said beneath duress per minas . For we 're in peril of our souls From your vile feathers , tar and poles ; And vows extorted are not binding In law , and so not worth the minding . For we have in this hurly-burly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er in form , Our ship to lighten in the storm . Nor need we blush your Whigs before ; Had we no virtue , you 've no more . " Yet black with sins , would spoil a mitre , Rail ye at faults by ten tints whiter ? And , stuff 'd with choler atrabilious , Insult us here for peccadilloes ? While all your vices run so high That mercy scarce could find supply : And should you offer to repent , You 'd need more fasting days than Lent , More groans than haunted church-yard vallies , And more confessions than broad-alleys . Footnote : 1Kb I 'll show you all at fitter time , Th ' extent and greatness of your crime , And here demonstrate to your face , Your want of virtue , as of grace , Evinced from topics old and recent : But thus much must suffice at present .

Our hearts must in our bosoms freeze , At such heroic deeds as these . " " Vain , " said the ' Squire , " you 'll find to sneer At Gage 's first triumphant year ; For Providence , disposed to teaze us , Can use what instruments it pleases .

So , for the civil war you lament , Faith , you yourselves must take the blame i n't ; For had you then , as he intended , Given up your arms , it must have ended : Since that 's no war , each mortal knows , Where one side only gives the blows , Footnote : 1Kb And t' other bears them ; on reflection The most we call it is correction .

To fly was vain ; to fight was idle ; By foes encompass 'd in the middle , His hope , in stratagems , he found , And fell right craftily to ground ; Then crept to seek an hiding place , ' T was all he could , beneath a brace ; Where soon the conq'ring crew espied him , And where he lurk 'd , they caught and tied him .

M'Fingal , rising at the word , Drew forth his old militia-sword ; Thrice cried " King George , " as erst in distress , Knights of romance invoked a mistress ; And brandishing the blade in air , Struck terror through th ' opposing war . The Whigs , unsafe within the wind Of such commotion , shrunk behind . With whirling steel around address 'd , Fierce through their thickest throng he press 'd , ( Who roll 'd on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march ) And like a meteor rushing through , Struck on their Pole a vengeful blow .

Amazed he view 'd the shameful sight , And saw no refuge , but in flight : But age unwieldy check 'd his pace , Though fear had wing 'd his flying race ; For not a trifling prize at stake ; No less than great M'Fingal 's back . Footnote : 1Kb With legs and arms he work 'd his course , Like rider that outgoes his horse , And labor 'd hard to get away , as Old Satan Footnote : 1Kb struggling on through chaos ; Till looking back , he spied in rear The spade-arm 'd chief advanced too near : Then stopp 'd and seized a stone , that lay An ancient landmark near the way ; Nor shall we as old bards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Footnote : 1Kb But such a stone , as at a shift A modern might suffice to lift , Since men , to credit their enigmas , Are dwindled down to dwarfs and pigmies , And giants exiled with their cronies To Brobdignags and Patagonias .

Footnote : 1Kb Then upwards , all hands hoisting sail , They swung him , like a keg of ale , Till to the pinnacle in height He vaulted , like balloon or kite . As Socrates Footnote : 1Kb of old at first did To aid philosophy get hoisted , And found his thoughts flow strangely clear , Swung in a basket in mid air : Our culprit thus , in purer sky , With like advantage raised his eye , And looking forth in prospect wide , His Tory errors clearly spied , And from his elevated station , With bawling voice began addressing .

" This said , they lower 'd him down in state , Spread at all points , like falling cat ; But took a vote first on the question , That they 'd accept this full confession , And to their fellowship and favor , Restore him on his good behaviour .

With less profusion once was spread Oil on the Jewish monarch 's head , That down his beard and vestments ran , And cover 'd all his outward man . As when ( so Claudian Footnote : 1Kb sings ) the Gods And earth-born Giants fell at odds , The stout Enceladus in malice Tore mountains up to throw at Pallas ; And while he held them o'er his head , The river , from their fountains fed , Pour 'd down his back its copious tide , And wore its channels in his hide : So from the high-raised urn the torrents Spread down his side their various currents ; His flowing wig , as next the brim , First met and drank the sable stream ; Adown his visage stern and grave Roll 'd and adhered the viscid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuff capacious holds the flood ; From nose and chin 's remotest end , The tarry icicles descend ; Till all o'erspread , with colors gay , He glitter 'd to the western ray , Like sleet-bound trees in wintry skies , Or Lapland idol carved in ice . And now the feather-bag display 'd Is waved in triumph o'er his head , And clouds him o'er with feathers missive , And down , upon the tar , adhesive : Not Maia 's Footnote : 1Kb son , with wings for ears , Such plumage round his visage wears ; Nor Milton 's six-wing 'd Footnote : 1Kb angel gathers Such superfluity of feathers . Now all complete appears our ' Squire , Like Gorgon or Chimra dire ; Nor more could boast on Plato 's Footnote : 1Kb plan To rank among the race of man , Or prove his claim to human nature , As a two-legg 'd , unfeather 'd creature . Then on the fatal cart , in state They raised our grand Duumvirate .

Behind , the croud , in lengthen 'd row With proud procession , closed the show . And at fit periods every throat Combined in universal shout ; And hail 'd great Liberty in chorus , Or bawl 'd ' confusion to the Tories .

Thus ere Great-Britain 's force grew slack , She gain 'd that aid she did not lack ; But now in dread , imploring pity , All hear unmoved her dol'rous ditty ; Allegiance wand'ring turns astray , And Faith grows dim for lack of pay .

END OF VOLUME FIRST . VOL . II . Trumbull , John , 1750-1831 : THE PROGRESS OF DULNESS. from The poetical works ( 1820 ) PREFACE . " PRAY , what does the author mean ? " is the first question most readers will ask , and the last they are able to answer . Therefore in a few words I will explain the subject and design of the following Poem . The subject is the state of the times in regard to literature and religion . The author was prompted to write , by a hope that it might be of use to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those general errors , that hinder the advantages of education and the growth of piety . The subject is inexhaustible ; nor is my design yet completed . This first part describes the principal mistakes in one course of life , and exemplifies the following well known truths ;  --  that to the frequent scandal , as well of religion , as learning , a fellow , without any share of genius , or application to study , may pass with credit through life , receive the honours of a liberal education , and be admitted to the right hand of fellowship among ministers of the gospel ;  --  that except in one neighboring province , ignorance wanders unmolested at our colleges , examinations are dwindled to mere form and ceremony , and after four years dozing there , no one is ever refused the honors of a degree , on account of dulness and insufficiency ;  --  that the mere knowledge of ancient languages , of the abstruser parts of mathematics , and the dark researches of metaphysics , is of little advantage in any business or profession in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every place of public education , to take pains in teaching the elements of oratory , the grammar of the English tongue , and the elegancies of style and composition ;  --  that in numberless instances , sufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious from the sacred desk ;  --  that this tenderness to the undeserving tends to debase the dignity of the clergy , and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the ministry ;  --  and that the virulent controversies of the present day concerning religious , or in many cases , merely speculative opinions , savoring so highly of vanity and ostentation , and breathing a spirit so opposite to christian benevolence , have done more hurt to the cause of religion , than all the malice , the ridicule , and the folly of its enemies . New-Haven , August 1772 . PART I. OR THE ADVENTURES OF TOM BRAINLESS . " Our Tom has grown a sturdy boy ; His progress fills my heart with joy ; A steady soul , that yields to rule , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( I 'm sure he 's right , ) There 's not a lad in town so bright . He 'll cypher bravely , write and read , And say his catechism and creed , And scorns to hesitate or falter In Primer , Spelling-book or Psalter . Hard work indeed , he does not love it ; His genius is too much above it . Give him a good substantial teacher , I 'll lay he 'd make a special preacher . I 've loved good learning all my life ; We 'll send the lad to college , wife . " Thus sway 'd by fond and sightless passion . His parents hold a consultation ; If on their couch , or round their fire , I need not tell , nor you enquire . The point 's agreed ; the boy well pleased , From country cares and labor eased ; No more to rise by break of day To drive home cows , or deal out hay ; To work no more in snow or hail , And blow his fingers o'er the flail , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry heat , Serene , he bids the farm , good-bye , And quits the plough without a sigh . Propitious to their constant friend , The pow'rs of idleness attend . So to the priest in form he goes , Prepared to study and to doze . The parson , in his youth before , Had run the same dull progress o'er ; His sole concern to see with care His church and farm in good repair . His skill in tongues , that once he knew , Had bid him long , a last adieu ; Away his Latin rules had fled , And Greek had vanish 'd from his head . Then view our youth with grammar teazing , Untaught in meaning , sense or reason ; Of knowledge e'er he gain his fill , he Must diet long on husks of Lily , Footnote : 1Kb Drudge on for weary months in vain , By mem'ry 's strength , and dint of brain ; From thence to murd'ring Virgil 's verse , And construing Tully into farce , Or lab'ring with his grave preceptor , In Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The needed help of ready words ; At hand the Dictionary laid , Gives up its page in frequent aid ; Hard by , the Lexicon and Grammar , Those helps of mem'ry when they stammer ; The lesson 's short ; the priest contented ; His task to hear is sooner ended . He lets him mind his own concerns , Then tells his parents how he learns . Two years thus spent in gathering knowledge , The lad sets forth t ' unlade at college , While down his sire and priest attend him , To introduce and recommend him ; Or if detain 'd , a letter 's sent Of much apocryphal content , To set him forth , how dull soever , As very learn 'd and very clever ; A genius of the first emission , With burning love for erudition ; So studious he 'll outwatch the moon And think the planets set too soon . He had but little time to fit in ; Examination too must frighten . Depend upo n't he must do well , He knows much more than he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll beat his rivals in the race ; His father 's incomes are but small , He comes now , if he come at all . So said , so done , at college now He enters well , no matter how ; New scenes awhile his fancy please , But all must yield to love of ease . In the same round condemn 'd each day , To study , read , recite and pray ; To make his hours of business double  --  He ca n't endure th ' increasing trouble ; And finds at length , as times grow pressing , All plagues are easier than his lesson .

OR THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF DICK HAIRBRAIN . Footnote : 1Kb ' T was in a town remote , the place We leave the reader wise to guess , ( For readers wise can guess full well What authors never meant to tell , ) There dwelt secure a country clown , The wealthiest farmer of the town . Though rich by villany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gain 'd offices by constant seeking , ' Squire , captain , deputy and deacon ; Great was his power , his pride as arrant ; One only son his heir apparent . He thought the stripling 's parts were quick , And vow 'd to make a man of Dick ; Bless 'd the pert dunce , and praised his looks , And put him early to his books . More oaths than words Dick learn 'd to speak And studied knavery more than Greek ; Three years at school , as usual , spent , Then all equipp 'd to college went , And pleased in prospect , thus bestow 'd His meditations , as he rode . " All hail , unvex 'd with care and strife , The bliss of academic life ; Where kind repose protracts the span , While childhood ripens into man ; Where no hard parent 's dreaded rage Curbs the gay sports of youthful age : Where no vile fear the genius awes With grim severity of laws ; Where annual troops of bucks come down , The flower of every neighb'ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And each choice spirit finds his mate . " Far from those walls , from pleasure 's eye , Let care and grief and labour fly , The toil to gain the laurel prize , That dims the anxious student 's eyes , The pedant air of learned looks , And long fatigue of turning books . Let poor dull rogues , with weary pains , To college come to mend their brains , And drudge four years , with grave concern How they may wiser grow , and learn . Is wealth of indolence afraid , Or does wit need pedantic aid ? The man of wealth the world descries , Without the help of learning wise ; The magic powers of gold , with ease , Transform us to what shape we please , Give knowledge bright and courage brave , And sense , that nature never gave . But nought avails the hoarded treasure ; In spending only lies the pleasure . " There vice shall lavish all her charms , And rapture fold us in her arms , Riot shall court the frolic soul , And swearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast applause , And scorn the feeble tie of laws : Our midnight joys no rule shall bound , While games and dalliance revel round . Such pleasures youthful years can know , And schools there are , that such bestow . " Those seats how blest , for ease and sport , Where wealth and idleness resort , Footnote : 1Kb Where free from censure and from shame , They seek of learning , but the name , Their crimes of all degrees and sizes Atoned by golden sacrifices ; Where kind instructors fix their price , In just degrees , on every vice , And fierce in zeal ' gainst wicked courses , Demand repentance , of their purses ; Till sin , thus tax 'd , produces clear A copious income every year , And the fair schools , thus free from scruples , Thrive by the knavery of their pupils .

There , pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or what you please , Then sin secure , with firm reliance , And bid the ten commands defiance . " And yet , alas , these happiest schools Preserve a set of musty rules , And in their wisest progress show Perfection is not found below . Even there , indulged , in humble station , Learning resides by toleration ; No law forbids the youth to read ; For sense no tortures are decreed ; There study injures but the name , And meets no punishment but shame . " Thus reas'ning , Dick goes forth to find A college suited to his mind ; But bred in distant woods , the clown Brings all his country airs to town ; The odd address with awkward grace , That bows with all-averted face ; The half-heard compliments , whose note Is swallow 'd in the trembling throat ; The stiffen 'd gait , the drawling tone , By which his native place is known ; The blush , that looks , by vast degrees , Too much like modesty to please ; The proud displays of awkward dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right gay , though much belated , Whose fashion 's superannuated ; The watch , depending far in state , Whose iron chain might form a grate ; The silver buckle , dread to view , O'ershad'wing all the clumsy shoe ; The white-gloved hand , that tries to peep From ruffle , full five inches deep ; With fifty odd affairs beside , The foppishness of country pride . Poor Dick ! though first thy airs provoke Th ' obstreperous laugh and scornful joke , Doom 'd all the ridicule to stand , While each gay dunce shall lend a hand ; Yet let not scorn dismay thy hope To shine a witling and a fop . Blest impudence the prize shall gain , And bid thee sigh no more in vain . Thy varied dress shall quickly show At once the spendthrift and the beau . With pert address and noisy tongue , That scorns the fear of prating wrong , ' Mongst list'ning coxcombs shalt thou shine , And every voice shall echo thine . How blest the brainless fop , whose praise Is doom 'd to grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And fame is placed in folly 's reach , Impertinence all tastes can hit , And every rascal is a wit . The lowest dunce , without despairing , May learn the true sublime of swearing ; Learn the nice art of jests obscene , While ladies wonder what they mean ; The heroism of brazen lungs , The rhetoric of eternal tongues ; While whim usurps the name of spirit , And impudence takes place of merit , And every money 'd clown and dunce Commences gentleman at once . For now , by easy rules of trade , Mechanic gentlemen are made ! From handicrafts of fashion born ; Those very arts so much their scorn . To taylors half themselves they owe , Who make the clothes , that make the beau . Lo ! from the seats , where , fops to bless , Learn 'd artists fix the forms of dress , And sit in consultation grave , On folded skirt , or strait'ned sleeve , The coxcomb trips with sprightly haste , In all the flush of modern taste ; Oft turning , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful air ; Well pleased with eager eye runs o'er The laced suit glitt'ring gay before ; Footnote : 1Kb The ruffle , where from open 'd vest The rubied brooch adorns the breast ; The coat with length'ning waist behind , Whose short skirts dangle in the wind ; The modish hat , whose breadth contains The measure of its owner 's brains ; The stockings gay with various hues ; The little toe-encircling shoes ; The cane , on whose carv 'd top is shown An head , just emblem of his own ; While wrapp 'd in self , with lofty stride , His little heart elate with pride , He struts in all the joys of show , That taylors give , or beaux can know . And who for beauty need repine , That 's sold at every barber 's sign ; Nor lies in features or complexion , But curls disposed in meet direction , With strong pomatum 's grateful odour , And quantum sufficit of powder ? These charms can shed a sprightly grace , O'er the dull eye and clumsy face ; While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows impart , Give the gay piece its final touches , And lend those airs , would lure a dutchess . Thus shines the form , nor aught behind , The gifts that deck the coxcomb 's mind ; Then hear the daring muse disclose The sense and piety of beaux . To grace his speech , let France bestow A set of compliments for show . Land of politeness ! that affords The treasure of new-fangled words , And endless quantities disburses Of bows and compliments and curses ; The soft address , with airs so sweet , That cringes at the ladies ' feet ; The pert , vivacious , play-house style , That wakes the gay assembly 's smile ; Jests that his brother beaux may hit , And pass with young coquettes for wit , And prized by fops of true discerning , Outface the pedantry of learning . Yet learning too shall lend its aid , To fill the coxcomb 's spongy head , And studious oft he shall peruse The labours of the modern muse . From endless loads of novels gain Soft , simp'ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handy , From Rochester and Tristram Shandy . Footnote : 1Kb The blund'ring aid of weak reviews , That forge the fetters of the muse , Shall give him airs of criticising On faults of books , he ne'er set eyes on . The magazines shall teach the fashion , And common-place of conversation , And where his knowledge fails , afford The aid of many a sounding word . Then least religion he should need , Of pious Hume he 'll learn his creed , By strongest demonstration shown , Evince that nothing can be known ; Take arguments , unvex 'd by doubt , On Voltaire 's trust , or go without ; ' Gainst scripture rail in modern lore , As thousand fools have rail 'd before ; Or pleased a nicer art display T ' expound its doctrines all away , Suit it to modern tastes and fashions By various notes and emendations ; The rules the ten commands contain , With new provisos well explain ; Prove all religion was but fashion , Beneath the Jewish dispensation . A ceremonial law , deep hooded In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit For these free times of gospel light , This rake 's millenium , since the day When sabbaths first were done away ; Since pandar-conscience holds the door , And lewdness is a vice no more ; And shame , the worst of deadly fiends , On virtue , as its squire attends . Alike his poignant wit displays The darkness of the former days , When men the paths of duty sought , And own 'd what revelation taught ; Ere human reason grew so bright , Men could see all things by its light , And summon 'd scripture to appear , And stand before its bar severe , To clear its page from charge of fiction , And answer pleas of contradiction ; Ere miracles were held in scorn , Or Bolingbroke , or Hume were born . And now the fop , with great energy , Levels at priestcraft and the clergy , At holy cant and godly prayers , And bigot 's hypocritic airs ; Musters each vet'ran jest to aid , Calls piety the parson 's trade ; Cries out ' t is shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so priest-ridden ; Applauds free thought that scorns controul , And gen'rous nobleness of soul , That acts its pleasure good or evil , And fears nor deity , nor devil . These standing topics never fail To prompt our little wits to rail , With mimic droll'ry of grimace , And pleased impertinence of face , ' Gainst virtue arm their feeble forces , And sound the charge in peals of curses . Blest be his ashes ! under ground If any particles be found , Who friendly to the coxcomb race , First taught those arts of common-place , Those topics fine , on which the beau May all his little wits bestow , Secure the simple laugh to raise , And gain the dunce 's palm of praise . For where 's the theme that beaux could hit With least similitude of wit , Did not religion and the priest Supply materials for the jest ? The poor in purse , with metals vile For current coins , the world beguile ; The poor in brain , for genuine wit Pass off a viler counterfeit ; While various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those their ears ; The want of fancy , whim supplies , And native humour , mad caprice ; Loud noise for argument goes off , For mirth polite , the ribald 's scoff ; For sense , lewd droll'ries entertain us , And wit is mimick 'd by profaneness . Thus ' twixt the taylor and the player , And Hume , and Tristram , and Voltaire , Complete in modern trim array 'd , The clockwork gentleman is made ; As thousand fops ere Dick have shone , In airs , which Dick ere long shall own . But not immediate from the clown , He gains this zenith of renown ; Slow dawns the coxcomb 's op'ning ray ; Rome was not finish 'd in a day . Perfection is the work of time ; Gradual he mounts the height sublime ; First shines abroad with bolder grace , In suits of second-handed lace , And learns by rote , like studious players , The fop 's infinity of airs ; Till merit , to full ripeness grown , By constancy attains the crown . Now should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you might read At college next how Dick went on , And prated much and studied none ; Yet shone with fair , unborrow 'd ray , And steer 'd where nature led the way . What though each academic science Bade all his efforts bold defiance ! What though in algebra his station Was negative in each equation ; Though in astronomy survey 'd , His constant course was retrograde ; O'er Newton 's system though he sleeps And finds his wits in dark eclipse ! His talents proved of highest price At all the arts of cards and dice ; His genius turn 'd , with greatest skill , To whist , loo , cribbage and quadrille , And taught , to every rival 's shame , Each nice distinction of the game . As noon-day sun , the case is plain , Nature has nothing made in vain . The blind mole can not fly ; ' t is found His genius leads him under ground . The man that was not made to think , Was born to game , and swear , and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rule , and follow nature . Yet here the muse , of Dick , must tell He shone in active scenes as well ; The foremost place in riots held , In all the gifts of noise excell 'd , His tongue , the bell , whose rattling din would Summon the rake 's nocturnal synod ; Swore with a grace that seem 'd design 'd To emulate the infernal kind , Nor only make their realms his due , But learn , betimes , their language too ; And well expert in arts polite , Drank wine by quarts to mend his sight , For he that drinks till all things reel , Sees double , and that 's twice as well ; And ere its force confined his feet , Led out his mob to scour the street ; Made all authority his may-game , And strain 'd his little wits to plague ' em . Then , every crime atoned with ease , Pro meritis , Footnote : 1Kb received degrees ; And soon , as fortune chanced to fall , His father died and left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He sail 'd to visit foreign nations , Resolved , by toil unaw 'd , to import The follies of the British court ; But in his course o'erlook 'd whate'er Was learn 'd or valued , rich or rare . As fire electric draws together Each hair and straw and dust and feather , The travell 'd dunce collects betimes The levities of other climes ; And when long toil has given success , Returns his native land to bless , A patriot fop , that struts by rules , And Knight of all the shire of fools . The praise of other learning lost , To know the world is all his boast , By conduct teach our country widgeons , How coxcombs shine in other regions , Display his travell 'd airs and fashions , And scoff at college educations . Whoe'er at college points his sneer , Proves that himself learn 'd nothing there , And wisely makes his honest aim To pay the mutual debt of shame . Mean while our hero 's anxious care Was all employ 'd to please the fair ; With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lady 's feet ; Pleased , while he thus in form address 'd her , With his own gracefulness of gesture , And gaudy flattery , that displays A studied elegance of phrase . So gay at balls the coxcomb shone , He thought the female world his own . By beauty 's charms he ne'er was fired ; He flatter 'd where the world admired . Himself , so well he prized desert , Possest his own unrivall 'd heart ; Nor charms , nor chance , nor change could move The firm foundations of his love ; His heart , so constant and so wise , Pursued what sages old advise , Bade others seek for fame or pelf ; His only study was himself . Yet Dick allow 'd the fair , desert , Nor wholly scorn 'd them in his heart ; There was an end , as oft he said , For which alone the sex were made , Whereto , of nature 's rules observant , He strove to render them subservient ; And held the fair by inclination , Were form 'd exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her lodging in a female mind ; Quoted from Pope , in phrase so smart , That all the sex are ' rakes at heart , ' And praised Mahomet 's sense , who holds That women ne'er were born with souls . Thus blest , our hero saw his name Rank 'd in the foremost lists of fame . What though the learn 'd , the good , the wise , His light affected airs despise ! What though the fair of higher mind , With brighter thought and sense refined , Whose fancy rose on nobler wing , Scorn 'd the vain , gilt , gay , noisy thing ! Each light coquette spread forth her charms , And lured the hero to her arms . For beaux and light coquettes , by fate Were each design 'd the other 's mate , By instinct love , for each may find Its likeness in the other 's mind . Each gayer fop of modern days Allow 'd to Dick the foremost praise , Borrow 'd his style , his airs , grimace , And aped his modish form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes And warm ambition to be fops : But men of sense , ' t is fix 'd by fate , Are coxcombs but of second rate . The pert and lively dunce alone Can steer the course that Dick has shown ; The lively dunce alone can climb The summit , where he shines sublime . But ah ! how short the fairest name Stands on the slippery steep of fame ! The noblest heights we 're soonest giddy on ; The sun ne'er stays in his meridian ; The brightest stars must quickly set ; And Dick has deeply run in debt . Not all his oaths can duns dismay , Or deadly bailiffs fright away , Not all his compliments can bail , Or minuets dance him from the jail . Law not the least respect can give To the laced coat , or ruffled sleeve ; His splendid ornaments must fall , And all is lost , for these were all . What then remains ? in health 's decline , By lewdness , luxury and wine , Worn by disease , with purse too shallow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteor 's gaudy light is gone ; Lone age with hasty step comes on . How pale the palsied fop appears , Low shivering in the vale of years ; The ghost of all his former days , When folly lent the ear of praise , And beaux with pleased attention hung On accents of his chatt'ring tongue . Now all those days of pleasure o'er , That chatt'ring tongue must prate no more . From every place , that bless 'd his hopes , He 's elbow 'd out by younger fops . Each pleasing thought unknown , that cheers The sadness of declining years , In lonely age he sinks forlorn , Of all , and even himself , the scorn . The coxcomb 's course were gay and clever , Would health and money last for ever , Did conscience never break the charm , Nor fear of future worlds alarm . But oh , since youth and years decay , And life 's vain follies fleet away , Since age has no respect for beaux , And death the gaudy scene must close , Happy the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; That learning seeks , whose useful gain Repays the course of studious pain , Whose fame the thankful age shall raise , And future times repeat its praise ; Attains that heart-felt peace of mind , To all the will of heaven resign 'd , Which calms in youth , the blast of rage , Adds sweetest hope to sinking age , With valued use prolongs the breath , And gives a placid smile to death . END OF PART SECOND . PART III . OR THE ADVENTURES OF MISS HARRIET SIMPER . PREFACE TO PART THIRD . MY design in this poem is to show , that the foibles we discover in the fair sex arise principally from the neglect of their education , and the mistaken notions they imbibe in their early youth . This naturally introduced a description of these foibles , which I have endeavored to laugh at with good humour and to expose without malevolence . Had I only consulted my own taste , I would have preferred sense and spirit with a style more elevated and poetical , to a perpetual drollery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in the second part of this work , that it is not so agreeable to the bulk of my readers . I have endeavored to avoid unseasonable severity , and hope , in that point , I am pretty clear of censure ; especially as some of my good friends in these parts have lately made a discovery , that severity is not my talent , and there is nothing to be feared from the strokes of my satire ; a discovery that on this head hath given me no small consolation . In the following poem , my design is so apparent , that I am not much afraid of general misrepresentation ; and I hope there are no grave folks , who will think it trifling or unimportant . I expect however , from the treatment I have already received in regard to the former parts of this work , as well as some later and more fugitive productions . that my designs will by many be ignorantly or wilfully misunderstood . I shall rest satisfied with the consciousness that a desire to promote the interests of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these writings ; judging as I did , that unless I attempted something in this way , that might conduce to the service of mankind , I had spent much time in the studies of the Muses in vain . Polite literature hath within a few years made very considerable advances in America . Mankind in general seem sensible of the importance and advantages of learning . Female education hath been most neglected ; and I wish this small performance may have some tendency to encourage and promote it . The sprightliness of female genius , and the excellence of that sex in their proper walks of science , are by no means inferior to the accomplishments of the men . And although the course of their education ought to be different , and writing is not so peculiarly the business of the sex , yet I can not but hope hereafter to see the accomplishment of my prediction in their favor . Her daughters too this happy land shall grace With powers of genius , as with charms of face ; Blest with the softness of the female mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Rowe shall rise and wrest with daring pen , The pride of science from assuming men ; While each bright line a polish 'd beauty wears : For every Muse and every Grace are theirs . New-Haven , July 1773 . " Come hither , Harriet , pretty Miss , Come hither ; give your aunt a kiss . What , blushing ? fye , hold up your head , Full six years old and yet afraid ! With such a form , an air , a grace , You 're not ashamed to show your face ! Look like a lady  --  bold  --  my child ! Why ma'am , your Harriet will be spoil 'd . What pity ' t is , a girl so sprightly Should hang her head so unpolitely ? And sure there 's nothing worth a rush in That odd , unnatural trick of blushing ; It marks one ungenteelly bred , And shows there 's mischief in her head . I 've heard Dick Hairbrain prove from Paul , Eve never blush 'd before the fall . ' T is said indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise ; Perhaps it suited well enough With hoop and farthingale and ruff ; But this politer generation Holds ruffs and blushes out of fashion . " And what can mean that gown so odd ? You ought to dress her in the mode , To teach her how to make a figure ; Or she 'll be awkward when she 's bigger , And look as queer as Joan of Nokes , And never rig like other folks ; Her clothes will trail , all fashion lost , As if she hung them on a post , And sit as awkwardly as Eve 's First pea-green petticoat of leaves . " And what can mean your simple whim here To keep her poring on her primer ? ' T is quite enough for girls to know , If she can read a billet-doux , Or write a line you 'd understand Without a cypher of the hand . Why need she learn to write , or spell ? A pothook scrawl is just as well ; Might rank her with the better sort , For ' t is the reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd or wise ? Books only serve to spoil their eyes . The studious eye but faintly twinkles , And reading paves the way to wrinkles . In vain may learning fill the head full ; ' T is beauty that 's the one thing needful ; Beauty , our sex 's sole pretence , The best receipt for female sense , The charm that turns all words to witty , And makes the silliest speeches pretty . Ev'n folly borrows killing graces From ruby lips and roseate faces . Give airs and beauty to your daughter , And sense and wit will follow after . " Thus round the infant Miss in state The council of the ladies meet , And gay in modern style and fashion Prescribe their rules of education . The mother once herself a toast , Prays for her child the self-same post ; The father hates the toil and pother , And leaves his daughters to their mother ; From whom her faults , that never vary , May come by right hereditary , Follies be multiplied with quickness , And whims keep up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , The graces might be proud to wear , The charms those speaking eyes display , Where passion sits in ev'ry ray , Th ' expressive glance , the air refined , That sweet vivacity of mind , Be doom 'd for life to folly 's sway , By trifles lur 'd , to fops a prey ? Say , can ye think that forms so fine Were made for nothing but to shine , With lips of rose and cheeks of cherry , Outgo the works of statuary , And gain the prize of show , as victors O'er busts and effigies and pictures ? Can female sense no trophies raise , Are dress and beauty all their praise , And does no lover hope to find An angel in his charmer 's mind ? First from the dust our sex began , But woman was refined from man ; Received again , with softer air , The great Creator 's forming care . And shall it no attention claim Their beauteous infant souls to frame ? Shall half your precepts tend the while Fair nature 's lovely work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush , the modest grace , On follies fix their young desire , To trifles bid their souls aspire , Fill their gay heads with whims of fashion , And slight all other cultivation , Let every useless , barren weed Of foolish fancy run to seed , And make their minds the receptacle Of every thing that 's false and fickle ; Where gay caprice with wanton air , And vanity keep constant fair , Where ribbons , laces , patches , puffs , Caps , jewels , ruffles , tippets , muffs , With gaudy whims of vain parade , Croud each apartment of the head ; Where stands , display 'd with costly pains , The toyshop of coquettish brains , And high-crown 'd caps hang out the sign , And beaux as customers throng in ; Whence sense is banish 'd in disgrace , Where wisdom dares not show her face ; Where the light head and vacant brain Spoil all ideas they contain , As th ' air-pump kills in half a minute Each living thing you put within it ? It must be so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , And all their education done Is none at all , or worse than none ; Whence still proceed in maid or wife , The follies and the ills of life . Learning is call 'd our mental diet , That serves the hungry mind to quiet , That gives the genius fresh supplies , Till souls grow up to common size : But here , despising sense refined , Gay trifles feed the youthful mind . Chameleons thus , whose colours airy As often as coquettes can vary , Despise all dishes rich and rare , And diet wholly on the air ; Think fogs blest eating , nothing finer , And can on whirlwinds make a dinner ; And thronging all to feast together , Fare daintily in blust'ring weather . Here to the fair alone remain Long years of action spent in vain ; Perhaps she learns ( what can she less ? ) The arts of dancing and of dress . But dress and dancing are to women , Their education 's mint and cummin ; These lighter graces should be taught , And weightier matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown , The soul will fix on these alone . Then most the fineries of dress , Her thoughts , her wish and time possess ; She values only to be gay , And works to rig herself for play ; Weaves scores of caps with diff'rent spires , And all varieties of wires ; Gay ruffles varying just as flow 'd The tides and ebbings of the mode : Bright flow'rs , and topknots waving high , That float , like streamers in the sky ; Work 'd catgut handkerchiefs , whose flaws Display the neck , as well as gauze ; Or network aprons somewhat thinnish , That cost but six weeks time to finish , And yet so neat , as you must own You could not buy for half a crown . Perhaps in youth ( for country fashion Prescribed that mode of education , ) She wastes long months in still more tawdry , And useless labours of embroid'ry ; With toil weaves up for chairs together , Six bottoms , quite as good as leather ; A set of curtains tapestry-work , The figures frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly , With portraits wrought of Dick and Dolly ; A coat of arms , that mark 'd her house , Three owls rampant , the crest a goose ; Or shows in waxwork goodman Adam , And serpent gay , gallanting madam , A woful mimickry of Eden , With fruit , that needs not be forbidden ; All useless works , that fill for beauties Of time and sense their vast vacuities ; Of sense , which reading might bestow , And time , whose worth they never know . Now to some pop'lous city sent , She comes back prouder than she went ; Few months in vain parade she spares , Nor learns , but apes , politer airs ; So formal acts , with such a set air , That country manners far were better . This springs from want of just discerning , As pedantry from want of learning ; And proves this maxim true to sight , The half-genteel are least polite . Yet still that active spark , the mind Employment constantly will find , And when on trifles most ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works men show most sloth in , But labour hard at doing nothing , A trade , that needs no deep concern , Or long apprenticeship to learn , To which mankind at first apply As naturally as to cry , Till at the last their latest groan Proclaims their idleness is done . Good sense , like fruits , is rais 'd by toil ; But follies sprout in ev'ry soil , Nor culture , pains , nor planting need , As moss and mushrooms have no seed . Thus Harriet , rising on the stage , Learns all the arts , that please the age , And studies well , as fits her station , The trade and politics of fashion : A judge of modes in silks and satins , From tassels down to clogs and pattens ; A genius , that can calculate When modes of dress are out of date , Cast the nativity with ease Of gowns , and sacks and negligees , And tell , exact to half a minute , What 's out of fashion and what 's in it ; And scanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( So in nice points of sight , a flea Sees atoms better far than we ; ) A patriot too , she greatly labours , To spread her arts among her neighbours , Holds correspondences to learn What facts the female world concern , To gain authentic state-reports Of varied modes in distant courts , The present state and swift decays Of tuckers , handkerchiefs and stays , The colour 'd silk that beauty wraps , And all the rise and fall of caps . Then shines , a pattern to the fair , Of mien , address and modish air , Of every new , affected grace , That plays the eye , or decks the face , The artful smile , that beauty warms , And all th ' hypocrisy of charms . On sunday , see the haughty maid In all the glare of dress array 'd , Deck 'd in her most fantastic gown , Because a stranger 's come to town . Heedless at church she spends the day , For homelier folks may serve to pray , And for devotion those may go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at church must spend their care in Far other work , than pious hearing ; They 've beaux to conquer , bells to rival ; To make them serious were uncivil . For , like the preacher , they each Sunday Must do their whole week 's work in one day . As though they meant to take by blows Th ' opposing galleries of beaux , Footnote : 1Kb To church the female squadron move , All arm 'd with weapons used in love . Like colour 'd ensigns gay and fair , High caps rise floating in the air ; Bright silk its varied radiance flings , And streamers wave in kissing-strings ; Each bears th ' artill'ry of her charms , Like training bands at viewing arms . So once , in fear of Indian beating , Our grandsires bore their guns to meeting , Each man equipp 'd on Sunday morn , With psalm-book , shot and powder-horn ; And look 'd in form , as all must grant , Like th ' ancient , true church militant ; Or fierce , like modern deep divines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us turn the style and see Our belles assembled o'er their tea ; Where folly sweetens ev'ry theme , And scandal serves for sugar 'd cream . " And did you hear the news ? ( they cry ) The court wear caps full three feet high , Built gay with wire , and at the end o n't , Red tassels streaming like a pendant . Well sure , it must be vastly pretty ; ' T is all the fashion in the city . And were you at the ball last night ? Well , Chloe look 'd like any fright ; Her day is over for a toast ; She 'd now do best to act a ghost . You saw our Fanny ; envy must own She figures , since she came from Boston . Good company improves one 's air  --  I think the troops were station 'd there . Poor Coelia ventured to the place ; The small-pox quite has spoil 'd her face , A sad affair , we all confest : But providence knows what is best . Poor Dolly too , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew better ; A secret that ; you 'll not disclose it ; There 's not a person living knows it . Sylvia shone out , no peacock finer ; I wonder what the fops see in her . Perhaps ' t is true what Harry maintains , She mends on intimate acquaintance . " Hail British lands ! to whom belongs Unbounded privilege of tongues , Blest gift of freedom , prized as rare By all , but dearest to the fair ; From grandmothers of loud renown , Thro ' long succession handed down , Thence with affection kind and hearty , Bequeath 'd unlessen 'd to poster'ty ! And all ye powers of slander , hail , Who teach to censure and to rail ! By you , kind aids to prying eyes , Minutest faults the fair one spies , And specks in rival toasts can mind , Which no one else could ever find ; By shrewdest hints and doubtful guesses , Tears reputations all in pieces ; Points out what smiles to sin advance , Finds assignations in a glance ; And shews how rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wink . So priests Footnote : 1Kb drive poets to the lurch By fulminations of the church , Mark in our title-page our crimes , Find heresies in double rhymes , Charge tropes with damnable opinion , And prove a metaphor , Arminian , Peep for our doctrines , as at windows , And pick out creeds of inuendoes . And now the conversation sporting From scandal turns to trying fortune . Their future luck the fair foresee In dreams , in cards , but most in tea . Each finds of love some future trophy In settlings left of tea , or coffee ; There fate displays its book , she believes , And lovers swim in form of tea-leaves ; Where oblong stalks she takes for beaux , And squares of leaves for billet-doux ; Gay balls in parboil 'd fragments rise , And specks for kisses greet her eyes . So Roman augurs wont to pry In victim 's hearts for prophecy , Sought from the future world advices , By lights and lungs of sacrifices , And read with eyes more sharp than wizards ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what chief would be survivor , From aspects of an ox 's liver , And cast what luck would fall in fights , By trine and quartile of its lights . Yet that we fairly may proceed , We own that ladies sometimes read , And grieve , that reading is confin 'd To books that poison all the mind ; Novels and plays , ( where shines display 'd A world that nature never made , ) Which swell their hopes with airy fancies , And amorous follies of romances ; Inspire with dreams the witless maiden On flowery vales and fields Arcadian , And contsant hearts no chance can sever , And mortal loves , that last for ever . For while she reads romance , the fair one Fails not to think herself the heroine ; For every glance , or smile , or grace , She finds resemblance in her face , Expects the world to fall before her , And every fop she meets adore her . Thus Harriet reads , and reading really Believes herself a young Pamela , The high-wrought whim , the tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glass , with smiling grace , She views the wonders of her face ; There stands in admiration moveless , And hopes a Grandison , or Lovelace . Footnote : 1Kb Then shines she forth , and round her hovers The powder 'd swarm of bowing lovers ; By flames of love attracted thither , Fops , scholars , dunces , cits , together . No lamp exposed in nightly skies , E'er gather 'd such a swarm of flies ; Or flame in tube electric draws Such thronging multitudes of straws . ( For I shall still take similes From fire electric when I please . Footnote : 1Kb ) With vast confusion swells the sound , When all the coxcombs flutter round . What undulation wide of bows ! What gentle oaths and am'rous vows ! What double entendres all so smart ! What sighs hot-piping from the heart ! What jealous leers ! what angry brawls To gain the lady 's hand at balls ! What billet-doux , brimful of flame ! Acrostics lined with Harriet 's name ! What compliments , o'er-strain 'd with telling Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd with commonplaces On angels , goddesses and graces ! On fires of love what witty puns ! What similes of stars and suns ! What cringing , dancing , ogling , sighing , What languishing for love , and dying ! For lovers of all things that breathe Are most exposed to sudden death , And many a swain much famed in rhymes Hath died some hundred thousand times : Yet though love oft their breath may stifle , ' T is sung it hurts them but a trifle ; The swain revives by equal wonder , As snakes will join when cut asunder , And often murder 'd still survives ; No cat hath half so many lives . While round the fair , the coxcombs throng With oaths , cards , billet-doux , and song , She spread her charms and wish 'd to gain The heart of every simple swain ; To all with gay , alluring air , She hid in smiles the fatal snare , For sure that snare must fatal prove , Where falsehood wears the form of love ; Full oft with pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a pleasure most sincere From each erect , attentive ear ; For pride was her 's , that oft with ease Despised the man she wish 'd to please . She loved the chace , but scorn 'd the prey , And fish 'd for hearts to throw away ; Joy 'd at the tale of piercing darts , And tort'ring flames and pining hearts , And pleased perused the billet-doux , That said , " I die for love of you ; " Found conquest in each gallant 's sighs And blest the murders of her eyes . So doctors live but by the dead , And pray for plagues , as daily bread ; Thank providence for colds and fevers , And hold consumptions special favors ; And think diseases kindly made , As blest materials of their trade . ' T would weary all the pow'rs of verse Their amorous speeches to rehearse , Their compliments , whose vain parade Turns Venus to a kitchen-maid ; With high pretence of love and honor , They vent their folly all upon her , ( Ev'n as the scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath ; ) Tell her how wond'rous fair they deem her , How handsome all the world esteem her ; And while they flatter and adore , She contradicts to call for more . " And did they say I was so handsome ? My looks  --  I 'm sure no one can fancy ' em . ' T is true we 're all as we were framed , And none have right to be ashamed ; But as for beauty  --  all can tell I never fancied I look 'd well ; I were a fright , had I a grain less . You 're only joking , Mr. Brainless . " Yet beauty still maintain 'd her sway , And bade the proudest hearts obey ; Ev'n sense her glances could beguile , And vanquish 'd wisdom with a smile ; While merit bow 'd and found no arms , To oppose the conquests of her charms , Caught all those bashful fears , that place The mask of folly on the face , That awe , that robs our airs of ease , And blunders , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove The most forlorn of fools in love . The fair esteem 'd , admired , ' t is true , And praised  --  ' t is all coquettes can do . And when deserving lovers came , Believed her smiles and own 'd their flame , Her bosom thrill 'd , with joy affected T ' increase the list , she had rejected ; While pleased to see her arts prevail , To each she told the self-same tale . She wish 'd in truth they ne'er had seen her , And feign 'd what grief it oft had giv'n her , And sad , of tender-hearted make , Grieved they were ruin 'd for her sake . ' T was true , she own 'd on recollection , She 'd shown them proofs of kind affection : But they mistook her whole intent , For friendship was the thing she meant . She wonder 'd how their hearts could move ' em So strangely as to think she 'd love ' em ; She thought her purity above The low and sensual flames of love ; And yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loved them too . She pitied them , and as a friend She prized them more than all mankind , And begg 'd them not their hearts to vex , Or hang themselves , or break their necks , Told them ' t would make her life uneasy , If they should run forlorn , or crazy ; Objects of love she could not deem ' em ; But did most marv'lously esteem ' em . For ' t is esteem , coquettes dispense Tow'rd learning , genius , worth and sense , Sincere affection , truth refined , And all the merit of the mind . But love 's the passion they experience For gold , and dress , and gay appearance . For ah ! what magic charms and graces Are found in golden suits of laces ! What going forth of hearts and souls Tow'rd glare of gilded button-holes ! What lady 's heart can stand its ground ' Gainst hats with glittering edging bound ? While vests and shoes and hose conspire , And gloves and ruffles fan the fire , And broadcloths , cut by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And oh , what charms more potent shine , Drawn from the dark Peruvian mine ! What spells and talismans of Venus Are found in dollars , crowns and guineas ! In purse of gold , a single stiver Beats all the darts in Cupid 's quiver . What heart so constant , but must veer , When drawn by thousand pounds a year ! How many fair ones ev'ry day To houses fine have fall'n a prey , Been forced on stores of goods to fix , Or carried off in coach and six ! For Coelia , merit found no dart ; Five thousand sterling broke her heart , So witches , hunters say , confound ' em , For silver bullets only wound ' em . But now the time was come , our fair Should all the plagues of passion share , And after ev'ry heart she 'd won , By sad disaster lose her own . So true the ancient proverb sayeth , ' Edge-tools are dang'rous things to play with ; ' The fisher , ev'ry gudgeon hooking , May chance himself to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pain Will burn its fingers now and then ; And from the dutchess to the laundress , Coquettes are seldom salamanders . For lo ! Dick Hairbrain heaves in sight , From foreign climes returning bright ; He danced , he sung to admiration , He swore to gen'ral acceptation , In airs and dress so great his merit , He shone  --  no lady 's eyes could bear it . Poor Harriet saw ; her heart was stouter ; She gather 'd all her smiles about her ; Hoped by her eyes to gain the laurels , And charm him down , as snakes do squirrels . So prized his love and wish 'd to win it , That all her hopes were center 'd in it ; And took such pains his heart to move , Herself fell desp'rately in love ; Though great her skill in am'rous tricks , She could not hope to equal Dick 's ; Her fate she ventured on his trial , And lost her birthright of denial . And here her brightest hopes miscarry ; For Dick was too gallant to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ' em , But he , be sure , was all for freedom ; So , left in hopeless flames to burn , Gay Dick esteem 'd her in her turn . In love , a lady once given over Is never fated to recover , Doom 'd to indulge her troubled fancies , And feed her passion by romances ; And always amorous , always changing , From coxcomb still to coxcomb ranging , Finds in her heart a void , which still Succeeding beaux can never fill : As shadows vary o'er a glass , Each holds in turn the vacant place ; She doats upon her earliest pain , And following thousands loves in vain . Poor Harriet now hath had her day ; No more the beaux confess her sway ; New beauties push her from the stage ; She trembles at th ' approach of age , And starts to view the alter 'd face , That wrinkles at her in her glass : So Satan , in the monk 's tradition , Fear 'd , when he met his apparition . At length her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels ; And slighted where she shone before , A grace and goddess now no more , Despised by all , and doom 'd to meet Her lovers at her rival 's feet , She flies assemblies , shuns the ball , And cries out , vanity , on all ; Affects to scorn the tinsel-shows Of glittering belles and gaudy beaux ; Nor longer hopes to hide by dress The tracks of age upon her face . Now careless grown of airs polite , Her noonday nightcap meets the sight ; Her hair uncomb 'd collects together , With ornaments of many a feather ; Her stays for easiness thrown by , Her rumpled handkerchief awry , A careless figure half undress 'd , ( The reader 's wits may guess the rest ; ) All points of dress and neatness carried , As though she 'd been a twelvemonth married ; She spends her breath , as years prevail , At this sad wicked world to rail , To slander all her sex impromptu , And wonder what the times will come to . Tom Brainless , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rev'rend Pastor , And now resolved , to smooth his life , To seek the blessing of a wife . His brethren saw his amorous temper , And recommended fair Miss Simper , Who fond , they heard , of sacred truth , Had left her levities of youth , Grown fit for ministerial union , And grave , as Christian 's wife in Bunyan . On this he rigg 'd him in his best , And got his old grey wig new dress 'd , Fix 'd on his suit of sable stuffs , And brush 'd the powder from the cuffs , With black silk stockings , yet in being , The same he took his first degree in ; Procured a horse of breed from Europe , And learn 'd to mount him by the stirrup , And set forth fierce to court the maid ; His white-hair 'd Deacon went for aid ; And on the right , in solemn mode , The Reverend Mr. Brainless rode . Thus grave , the courtly pair advance , Like knight and squire in famed romance . The priest then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms address 'd her ; He 'd found , for reasons amply known , It was not good to be alone , And thought his duty led to trying The great command of multiplying ; So with submission , by her leave , He 'd come to look him out an Eve , And hoped , in pilgrimage of life , To find an helpmate in a wife , A wife discreet and fair withal , To make amends for Adam 's fall . In short , the bargain finish 'd soon , A reverend Doctor made them one . And now the joyful people rouze all To celebrate their priest 's espousal ; And first , by kind agreement set , In case their priest a wife could get , The parish vote him five pounds clear , T ' increase his salary every year . Then swift the tag-rag gentry come To welcome Madam Brainless home ; Wish their good Parson joy ; with pride In order round salute the bride ; At home , at visits and at meetings , To Madam all allow precedence ; Greet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix her pew .

Pleased with the vision of a deathless name , You seek perhaps a flowery road to fame ; Where distant far from ocean 's stormy roar , Wind the pure vales and smiles the tranquil shore , Where hills sublime in vernal sweetness rise , And opening prospects charm the wand'ring eyes , While the gay dawn , propitious on your way , Crimsons the east and lights the orient day . Yet vain the hope , that waits the promised bays , Though conscious merit claim the debt of praise ; Still sneering Folly wars with every art , Still ambush 'd Envy aims the secret dart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toil wins the field and hazard gains the prize . For dangers wait , and fears of unknown name , The long , the dreary pilgrimage of fame ; Each bard invades , each judging dunce reviews , And every critic wars with every Muse . As horror gloom 'd along the dark'ning path , When famed Ulysses Footnote : 1Kb trod the vales of death ; Terrific voices rose , and all around Dire forms sprang flaming from the rocking ground ; Fierce Cerberus lour 'd , and yawning o'er his way , Hell flash 'd the terrors of infernal day ; The scornful fiends opposed his bold career , And sung in shrieks the prelude of his fear . Thus at each trembling step , the Poet hears Dread groans and hisses murmur in his ears ; In every breeze a shaft malignant flies , Cerberean forms in every rival rise ; There yawning wide before his path extends Th ' infernal gulph , where Critics are the fiends ; From gloomy Styx pale conflagrations gleam , And dread oblivion rolls in Lethe 's stream . And see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cloud of Critics on your Muse descends ! From every side , with deadly force , shall steer The fierce Review , the censuring Gazetteer , Light Magazines , that pointless jests supply , And quick Gazettes , that coin the current lie .

As vultures , sailing through the darken 'd air , Whet their keen talons , and their beaks prepare , O'er warring armies wait th ' approaching fray , And sate their wishes on the future prey : Each cens'rer thus the tempting lure pursues , And hangs o'er battles of your Epic muse , The pamper 'd critic feeds on slaughter 'd names , And each new bard a welcome feast proclaims . Such men to charm , could Homer 's muse avail , Who read to cavil , and who write to rail ; When ardent genius pours the bold sublime , Carp at the style , or nibble at the rhyme ; Misstate your thoughts , misconstrue your design , And cite , as samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your admirer 's care ; Her faults alone the critics make their share . Where you succeed , beyond their sphere you 've flown , But where you fail , the realm is all their own .

Yet heed not these , but join the sons of song , And scorn the censures of the envious throng ; Prove to the world , in these new-dawning skies , What genius kindles and what arts arise ; What fav'ring Muses lent their willing aid , As gay through Pindus ' flowery paths you stray 'd ; While in your strains the purest morals flow 'd , Rules to the great , and lessons to the good .

Trumbull , John , 1750-1831 : TO A YOUNG LADY , Who requested the Writer to draw her Character . A FABLE . from The poetical works ( 1820 ) Sept. 1774 . In vain , fair Maid , you ask in vain , My pen should try th ' advent'rous strain , And following truth 's unalter 'd law , Attempt your character to draw . I own indeed , that generous mind That weeps the woes of human kind , That heart by friendship 's charms inspired , That soul with sprightly fancy fired , The air of life , the vivid eye , The flowing wit , the keen reply  --  To paint these beauties as they shine , Might ask a nobler pen than mine . Yet what sure strokes can draw the Fair , Who vary , like the fleeting air , Like willows bending to the force , Where'er the gales direct their course , Opposed to no misfortune 's power , And changing with the changing hour . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasing strain ; Anon disturb 'd , they know not why , The sad tear trembles in their eye : Led through vain life 's uncertain dance , The dupes of whim , the slaves of chance . From me , not famed for much goodnature , Expect not compliment , but satire ; To draw your picture quite unable , Instead of fact accept a Fable . One morn , in sop 's noisy time , When all things talk 'd , and talk 'd in rhyme , A cloud exhaled by vernal beams Rose curling o'er the glassy streams . The dawn her orient blushes spread , And tinged its lucid skirts with red , Wide waved its folds with glitt'ring dies , And gaily streak 'd the eastern skies ; Beneath , illumed with rising day , The sea 's broad mirror floating lay . Pleased , o'er the wave it hung in air , Survey 'd its glittering glories there , And fancied , dress 'd in gorgeous show , Itself the brightest thing below : For clouds could raise the vaunting strain , And not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , howe'er array 'd , That beauty , e'en in clouds , might fade , That nothing sure its charms could boast Above the loveliest earthly toast ; And so , like them , in early dawn Resolved its picture should be drawn , That when old age with length'ning day Should brush the vivid rose away , The world should from the portrait own Beyond all clouds how bright it shone . Hard by , a painter raised his stage , Far famed , the Copley Footnote : 1Kb of his age . So just a form his colours drew , Each eye the perfect semblance knew ; Yet still on every blooming face He pour 'd the pencil 's flowing grace ; Each critic praised the artist rare , Who drew so like , and yet so fair . To him , high floating in the sky Th ' elated Cloud advanced t ' apply . The painter soon his colours brought , The Cloud then sat , the artist wrought ; Survey 'd her form , with flatt'ring strictures , Just as when ladies sit for pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall try for you : But sure those strong and golden dies Dipp 'd in the radiance of the skies , Those folds of gay celestial dress , No mortal colours can express . Not spread triumphal o'er the plain , The rainbow boasts so fair a train , Nor e'en the morning sun so bright , Who robes his face in heav'nly light . To view that form of angel make , Again Ixion would mistake , Footnote : 1Kb And justly deem so fair a prize , The sovereign Mistress of the skies , " He said , and drew a mazy line , With crimson touch his pencils shine , The mingling colours sweetly fade , And justly temper light and shade . He look 'd ; the swelling Cloud on high With wider circuit spread the sky , Stretch 'd to the sun an ampler train , And pour 'd new glories on the main . As quick , effacing every ground , His pencil swept the canvas round , And o'er its field , with magic art , Call 'd forth new forms in every part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced with speed his early way ; Each colour takes a differing die , The orange glows , the purples fly . The artist views the alter 'd sight , And varies with the varying light ; In vain ! a sudden gust arose , New folds ascend , new shades disclose , And sailing on with swifter pace , The Cloud displays another face . In vain the painter , vex 'd at heart , Tried all the wonders of his art ; In vain he begg 'd , her form to grace , One moment she would keep her place : For , " changing thus with every gale , Now gay with light , with gloom now pale , Now high in air with gorgeous train , Now settling on the darken 'd main , With looks more various than the moon ; A French coquette were drawn as soon . " He spoke ; again the air was mild , The Cloud with opening radiance smiled ; With canvas new his art he tries , Anew he joins the glitt'ring dies ; Th ' admiring Cloud with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours half-complete adorn The splendor of the painted morn . When lo , the stormy winds arise , Deep gloom invests the changing skies ; The sounding tempest shakes the plain , And lifts in billowy surge the main . The Cloud 's gay dies in darkness fade , Its folds condense in thicker shade , And borne by rushing blasts , its form With lowering vapour joins the storm .

A collegiate exercise . from The poetical works ( 1820 ) June 1770 . A GOD pursues thee with immortal hate , By crimes provoked , that wake the wrath of fate ; In guiltless woe the hapless Orpheus died , And calls the powers t ' avenge his injured bride . Along the stream , with flying steps she strove To shun the fury of thy lawless love , Unhappy Fair ! nor on the fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prey . Her sister Dryades wail 'd the deadly wound , The lofty hills their melting cries resound ; Then wept the rocks of Rhodope , the towers Of high Pangus , and the Rhesian shores ; The mournful sounds the Attic lands convey , And Hebrus rolls in sadden 'd waves away . He , on his lyre , essay 'd with tuneful art To sooth the ceaseless anguish of his heart ; Thee , his fair bride , to lone distress a prey , Thee sung at rising , thee at falling day . Then sought the realms of death and Stygian Jove , Through blackening horrors of th ' infernal grove , Mid direful ghosts and powers of deep despair , Unknown to pity and unmoved by prayer . From Hell 's dark shores , to Orpheus ' melting song , On every side the gloomy nations throng ; Thin , airy shades , pale spectres lost to light , Like fancied forms , that glide athwart the night . As flitting birds , in summer 's checquer 'd shade , Dance on the boughs and flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night descends amain , And pours in storms along the wintry plain : Men , matrons , round the sweet musician press 'd , The spouseless maidens and the youths unblest , Snatch 'd from their parents ' eyes , or doom 'd to yield In war 's dire combats on the crimson field ; Whom the deep fens , that drain the moory ground , And black Cocytus ' reedy lake surround , Where baleful Styx her mournful margin laves , And deadly Lethe rolls th ' oblivious waves . Hell heard the song ; and fix 'd in deep amaze , On the sweet bard the snaky Furies gaze ; Grim Cerb'rus hung entranced ; and ceased to reel The giddy circle of Ixion 's wheel . These dangers ' scaped , he seeks the upper air ; Elate with joy , and follow 'd by the Fair ; Such law the fates imposed : but doom 'd to prove The sudden madness of ill-omen 'd love ; Could Fate relent , or melt at human woe , A venial crime , were venial aught below ! Light gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With wishes wild and vanquish 'd with desire , His fears forgot , he turn 'd ; his lovely bride , Given to his hope , with trembling glance espied . There end thy joys , and vanish 'd into air Thy fancied raptures and thy fruitless care ; Broke is the league , and thrice tremendous roars The warning thunder on th ' infernal shores . What rage , she cried , thus blasts our joys again , Pair 'd in sad fates and doom 'd to endless pain ! Hark ! the dread summons calls me back to woes ; My swimming eyes eternal slumbers close ; A last farewell ! the stygian horrors rise , And roll 'd in night my parting spirit flies ; Vain my weak arms , extended to restore The bridal hand , that must be thine no more . She said , and vanish 'd instant from his eye , Like melting smoke , that mingles with the sky . No kind embrace his deepening grief t ' allay , No farewell word , though much he wish 'd to say , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waft him to the adverse shore . Again divorced from all his soul must love , No tears could melt , nor songs the fates could move . Her , breathless , pale , to mansions of the grave , The bark bore floating on the stygian wave . In gelid caves with horrid glooms array 'd , Where cloud-topt hills project an awful shade , Along the margin of the desert shore , Where lonely Strymon 's rushing waters roar , Seven hapless months he wept his fatal love , His ravish 'd bride , and blamed relentless Jove . Stern tigers soften 'd at the tuneful sound , The thickets move , the forests dance around : So in some poplar 's shade , with soothing song Sad Philomela mourns her captive young , When some rude swain hath found th ' unfeather 'd Her nest despoil 'd and borne the prize away ; Through the long night she breathes her tuneful strain , prey , The slow , deep moan resounds , and echoes o'er the plain . Pleasure no more his soul estranged could move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alone he stray 'd where freezing Tanais flows Through drear wastes , wedded to perennial snows , Mourn 'd his lost bride , th ' infernal power 's deceit , And cursed the vain , illusive gifts of fate . When Bacchus ' orgies stain 'd the midnight skies , Their proffers scorn 'd , the Thracian matrons rise . Their hopeless rage the bleeding victim tore , His sever 'd limbs are scatter 'd on the shore , Rent from his breathless corse , swift Hebrus sweeps His gory visage to the opening deeps . Yet when cold death sate trembling on his tongue , With fainting soul , Eurydice , he sung ; Ah dearest , lost Eurydice ! he cries ; Eurydice , the plaintive shore replies .

Yet nought avail the virtues of the heart , The vengeful bolt no muse 's laurels ward ; From Britain 's rage , like death 's relentless dart , No worth can save us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see dire oppression roll , Fair Freedom buried in the whelming flood ; Nor charter 'd rights her tyrant course control , Tho ' seal 'd by kings and witness 'd in our blood .

But oh my friends , the arm of blood restrain , ( No rage intemp'rate aids the public weal ; ) Nor basely blend , too daring but in vain , Th ' assassin 's madness with the patriot 's zeal . Ours be the manly firmness of the sage , From shameless foes ungrateful wrongs to bear ; Alike removed from baseness and from rage , The flames of faction and the chills of fear . Repel the torrent of commercial Footnote : 1Kb gain , That buys our ruin at a price so rare , And while we scorn Britannia 's servile chain , Disdain the livery of her marts to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The curst idolatry of silks and lace , Bid our gay robes insult our country 's woe , And welcome slavery in the glare of dress ? No  --  the rich produce of our fertile soil Shall clothe in neat array the cheerful train , While heaven-born virtues bless the sacred toil , And gild the humble vestures of the plain . No foreign labor in the Asian field Shall weave her silks to deck the wanton age : But as in Rome , the furrow 'd vale shall yield The conq'ring hero and paternal sage . And ye , whose heaven in golden pomp to shine , And warmly press the dissipated round , Grace the ripe banquet with the charms of wine , And roll the thund'ring chariot o'er the ground ; For this , while guised in sycophantic smile , With heart regardless of your country 's pain , Your flatt'ring falshoods feed the ears of guile , And barter freedom for the dreams of gain !

In vain the arm of toil With gifts autumnal crowns the bearded plain , In vain glad summer warms the genial soil , And spring dissolves in softening showers in vain ; There savage power extends a dreary shade , And chill oppression , with her frost severe , Sheds a dire blast , that nips the rising blade , And robs th ' expecting labors of the year . So must we sink ? and at the stern command , That bears the terror of a tyrant 's word , Bend the weak knee and raise the suppliant hand ; The scorn 'd , dependant vassals of a lord ?

But not for this , by heaven and virtue led , From the mad rule of hierarchal pride , O'er pathless seas our injured fathers fled , And follow 'd freedom on th ' advent'rous tide ; Dared the wild horrors of the clime unknown , Th ' insidious savage , and the crimson plain , To us bequeath 'd the prize their woes had won , Nor deem 'd they suffer 'd , or they bled in vain . And think'st thou , North , Footnote : 1Kb the sons of such a race , Whose beams of glory bless 'd their purpled morn , Will shrink unnerved before a despot 's face , Nor meet thy louring insolence with scorn ? Look through the circuit of th ' extended shore , That checks the surges of th ' Atlantic deep ; What weak eye trembles at the frown of power , What torpid soul invites the bands of sleep ?

Now meet the Fathers Footnote : 1Kb of the western clime , Nor names more noble graced the rolls of fame , When Spartan firmness braved the wrecks of time , Or Latian virtue fann 'd th ' heroic flame . Not deeper thought th ' immortal sage inspired , On Solon 's lips when Grecian senates hung ; Nor manlier eloquence the bosom fired , When genius thunder 'd from th ' Athenian Footnote : 1Kb tongue .

Go , raise thy hand , and with its magic power Pencil with night the sun 's ascending ray , Bid the broad veil eclipse the noon-tide hour , And damps of Stygian darkness shroud the day ; Bid heaven 's dread thunder at thy voice expire , Or chain the angry vengeance of the waves ; Then hope thy breath can quench th ' immortal fire , And free souls pinion with the bonds of slaves . Thou canst not hope ! Attend the flight of days , View the bold deeds , that wait the dawning age , Where Time 's strong arm , that rules the mighty maze , Shifts the proud actors on this earthly stage .

Where the clear rivers pour their mazy tide , The smiling lawns in full luxuriance bloom ; The harvest wantons in its golden pride , The flowery garden breathes a glad perfume . Behold that coast , which seats of wealth surround , That haven , rich with many a flowing sail , Where friendly ships , from earth 's remotest bound , Float on the cheerly pinions of the gale ; There Boston smiles , no more the sport of scorn , And meanly prison 'd by thy fleets no more , And far as ocean 's billowy tides are borne , Lifts her dread ensigns of imperial power .

Through the vast series of descending years , That lose their currents in th ' eternal wave , Till heaven 's last trump shall rend th ' affrighted spheres , And ope each empire 's everlasting grave ; Propitious skies the joyous field shall crown , And robe our vallies in perpetual prime , And ages blest of undisturb 'd renown Arise in radiance o'er th ' imperial clime .

On her white cliffs , the pillars once of fame , Her melancholy Genius sits to wail , Drops the fond tear , and o'er her latest shame , Bids dark Oblivion draw th ' eternal veil .
