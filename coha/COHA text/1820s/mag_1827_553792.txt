txt ART . X.-Essays upon Popular Education , containing a particular E amination of the Schools of . illassachusetts , and an Outline of an Institution Jbr the Education of Teachers . By JAMES G. CARTER . 8vo. pp. 60 . Boston . 1826 . Bowles &amp; Dearborn . WE have lately offered some remarks on Popular Education ; and we are glad to meet with such an occasion as this pamphlet furnishes , for inviting the attention of our readers again to the subject . We have read these Essays with more than a feeling of interest and pleasure ; and we venture earnestly to recommend them to general perusal . They are judicious and able , full of sound and liberal views , and important suggestions . They contain much , in a brief space , and must be read for reflection , and not for entertainment . They will not answer for dreaming or dozing away a dull hour after dinner ; but for a man who sits upright , and is wide awake to the state and movement of things around him , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about and act upon . MrCarter is too much concerned for the interests , which he advocates , , and has a mind too much occupied with matters of reality and importance , to care much for our entertainment . From the very limits of his work , also , he has given us a pphlet of hints , which , as he seems to be well aware , might be easily swelled into volumes of discussions . Our own space , it is obvious , is yet more limited ; but we // can not let this number of our Journal go forth , without yielding the full measure of all the encouragement , which it is iii our power to give , to the plan that Mr Carter has laid before us . We say the plan , for it is to the projected Institution br the instruction of Teachers , an outline of which is given in the l2st Essay , that we shall principally direct our observations . All the previous Essays , indeed , are designed to prepare the way for the consideration of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reflection , which any man may employ on the subject of popular education , all the faults he laments , all the improvement he desires , will lead him to the same result . The course of argument , by which we ourselves have been led to this result , may he set forth in few words . In the first place , better schools are wanted . We mean , that tbe Free Schools , or what are usually balled , the Common , and in the country , District Schools , need to be made better , and more efficient organs of instruction and influence . Whoever does not believe this , will , of course , dismiss our argument as deficient in the first particular ; and we must dismiss him , which we would gladly do , to the pages of Mr Carter , or to his own reflections ; or we would rather , for the sake of a practical demonstration , send him into the midst of one of our Common Schools ; a place , we are sorry to say , where very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents or guardians , ever go . We would ask our easy and unsuspicious advocate of the present systems , to look about him , and to mark the restlessness , or reluctance , or stupidity , that pervades all these schools . He will find some pupils reading , what every tone of their voices tells him , they do but half understand ; some , poring over the pages of a grammar , or hunting out the parts of speech in a dictionary , a work altogether mechanical , of the principles of which they understand literally nothing , and of which Ehere are thirtyfive chances out of forty , that their master understands as little ; others , he will find studying geography , in such a way , that they comprehend it as vaguely as we do the geography of the moon , and care ahout it a great deal less , than some of us do about that luminary , who see in it volcanoes , and city walls , and the shadow of towers ; and others still , scowling over a perplexing sum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of the multiplication table . Let our inquirer meet with these children at home , and talk with them about their schools ; let him enter a little into their // minds , for they have minds , though our common systems of instruction seem scarcely to recognise them ; let him endeavor to ascertain what is the impulse , which carries these children daily to the schoolroom ; and he will find , that when the novelty is worn off , the new master , the new acquaintances and objects have grown old ; when the chance of being the best scholar , and the certificate of merit , and the fine present , are all out of the question ; when , in short , he divests this matter of all extraneous influences , and of all that is barely mechanical , he will find , we say , that the impulse , which carries these children to school , is necessity ; that it is ( we can scarcely qualify what we are going to say ) never the love of knowledge . How should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much to the same thing , nothing that they care to know . Let us he understood . They learn to read . Very well . They have taken bold of the great instrument of knowledge ; hut how is it applied ? Let any one look over the books , which they read and study , and he will find a full half , which they absolutely can not understand ; and the other half , their own countenances will tell him , they do not wish to understand . They learn to read ; and it is our boast , that of the whole mass of our population , it is rare to find an individual , who has not made this acquisition . But what evidence heyond this , we ask , does the mass of our population give , of having spent from three to eight years of life at school ? What do they know of grammar , or geography , or of arithmetic , excepting two or three simple rules , which would not at any time require more than a week 's practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their simplest elements , they confessedly know nothing ; and if they make no intellectual acquisition , beyond the art of reading , we believe it will as little be contended , that they accomplish anything of that better object of education , the forming of right mental habits , the culture of the mind for future acquisitions . We are not now accusing the people of gross ignorance ; though we apprehend , that their intelligence is overrated , and that some of our boasting on this point were better spared . The truth is , we forget that our language on this subject is only comparative . When we speak of our intelligent population , we mean , that it is more intelligent than that of Europe generally ; but we are apt to transfer this comparative sense of what we say , into an absolute estimate . Be it admitted , however , that the yeomanry of this country is distinguished for intelligence , and as much // distinguished as any one desires to maintain , still we say , that nothing of this intelligence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , at the generality of them , for there are , it is true , a few honorable exceptions . Our citizens , as they come into life , gain , indeed , some general acquaintance with the statc of the world , aud with the politics of their own country ; but this they gain , not from school hooks , but from newspapers . Of all that they actually know in the world , of all the habits of right reflection and conduct , by which they are guided in the pursuits of life , the schools , we say again , have furnished nothing . We have spoken now and formerly of the dulness of our schools . We consider this feature of indifference , which pervades the mass of them , as bearing strongly on the argument we are pursuing . It is certain , that children are not learning anything , or anything that can turn to much account for them , when this heavy lethargy of school dulness has settled upon them . Words may fall upon the ear , and even ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listless slave of his task , there will be none of those relations manifest , which constitute valuable knowledge . Nor is this listlessness inexcusable . Human nature will always be true to itself . When a book will not sell , it is shrewdly guessed , that it is not worth buying . When the people fall asleep , it is too likely that the preacher is dull . When that most formidable assembly , the Congress , is addressed , and you perceive that nine tenths of its members are each one talking with his neighbor , or writing his letters , or rattling his newspaper , you are apt to think , that it is a great hardship to the speaker , who is delivering himself of the fruits perhaps of a whole session of study ; till you find that his speech was pronounced , not for the benefit of the honorable gentle . *en around him , but for the benefit of his own reputation among his constituents ; that it was spoken not to be heard , but to be printed . And last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be electors , or themselves members of Congress , wear away the lingering hours in school , as if it were in a prison , and bend a deprecating or vacant eye upon the dull lesson , there is too much reason to suspect , that the lesson is not adapted to their comprehension , or certainly not to their benefit . But if there is no cause for wonder on one account , there is , at least , on another . It is truly a most extraordinary state of things . Man is , if anything , a learning animal , a creature , destined , as the very // end , or at least as the very process of his intellectual being , to improvement ; and yet there is no business in the world so proverbially dull , there is none among us half so reluctantly pursued , as the business of learning . We hope that our observations thus far have some tendency to produce the conviction , that something needs to be done for our Common Schools . We have dwelt longer upon these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our argument , hut to every hope of improvement in the prevailing system of education . And we proceed now to say , in the next place , that in order to have better schools , we must have better teachers . There are a few schools for children , which form exceptions to the foregoing representation ; and if we direct our attention to these schools , we shall discover , at once , the secret of their superiority . It is found in the superiority of the teachers . This is the sole cause ; a cause indispensable , and , where it is put in operation , sufficient , and always sufficient . Materials there are for good schools in every city , villabe , and neighborhood , throughout the country . But it is only where a man , not only of superior intelligence , hut of superior talent and tact in giving instruction , fixes himself , that such a school actually exists . And this is just what we might expect . It requires no deep reasoning to perceive , that it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor a legislative enactment , that makes a good school . Nor will good books do it , valuable as they are . Nor will just speculations on the subject , nor a correct judgment in the minds of a few , or even of the body of the community . All this will be to no purpose ; all that we can say , and think , and do , and give , will avail nothing , without good teachers . They will be but so many means , wasted for the want of application . how , then , shall this application be made ? Or , in other words , how shall well qualified teachers be obtained ? This brings us , in the third place , to consider the remedy , which Mr Carter proposes . It may be taken for granted , we suppose , that there is such a deficiency to be supplied . The especial and grand reason for the faults of our schools , is the want of proper qualifications in the teachers . if any one doubts this , let him inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , and he will find them with one voice , testifying to this deficiency . They accredit the applicants for the situation of instructers , in // most cases , not because they are satisfied with them , but because they can get no better . Now we expect to be reminded , that our colleges are full of young men , who are passing through the course of education , and many of whom will be engaged for a greater or less time in the business of instr*uction . But it is forgotten in this suggestion , that all this affords no help to the Common Schools . The graduates from our colleges , almost without exception , are employed in private schools ; and it is a sufficient evidence , we may remark in passing , of the low estimation into which the systems of free instruction have fallen , that all , or almost all , who are able to afford it , send their children to these schools ; and yet how common is it for our educated scholars , however learned and accomplished , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is at all adequate to their talents and acquisitions . Nor is this strange . To know is one thing ; to teach is another . The distinction is obvious enough ; and yet we agree with Mr Carter in thinking , that it has not often been practically made . ' When we are looking for a teacher , ' says he , we inquire how much he knows , not how much he can communicate ; as if the latter qualification were of no consequence to us . Now it seems to me , that parents and children , to say the least , are as much interested in the latter qualification of their instructer as in the former . Though a teacher can not communicate more knowledge than he possesses ; yet he may possess much , and still be able to impart but little . And the knowledge of Sir Isaac Newton could be of but trifling use to a school , while it was locked up safely in the head of a country schoolmaster . So far as the object of a school or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel as the opinion may seem , it does appear to me , that both parents and pupils are even more interested in the part of their teacher 's knowledge , which they will be likely to get , than in the part which they certainly can not get . One great object in the education of teachers , which it is so desirable on every account to attain , is , to establish an intelligible language of communication between the instructer and his pupil , and enable the former to open his head and his heart , and infuse into the other some of the thoughts and feelings , which lie hid there . Instructers and pupils do not understand each other . They do not speak the same language . They may use the same words ; // Jan. but this can hardly be called the same language , while they attach to them such very different meanings . We must either , by some magic or supernatural power , bring children at once to comprehend all our abstract and difficult terms ; or our teachers must unlearn themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of these alternatives is only difficult , while the other is impossible . The direct , careful preparation of instructers for the profession of teaching must surmount this difficulty ; and I doubt if there be any other way , in which it can be surmounted . When instructers understand their profession ; that is , in a word , when they understand the philosophy of the infant mind , what powers are earliest developed , and what studies are best adapted to their developernent ; then it will be time to lay out and subdivide their work into an energetic system of public instruction . Till this step towards a reform , which is preliminary in its very nature , be taken , every other measure must be adopted in the dark ; and , therefore , be liable to fail utterly of its intended result . Houses and funds and books are all , indeed , important ; but they are only the means of enabling the minds of the teachers to act upon the minds of the pupils . And they must , inevitably , fail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been prepared to act upon those of their pupils to the greatest advantage . If , then , the first step towards a reform in our system of popular education be the scientific preparation of teachers for the free 8chools ; our next inquiry becomes , How can we soonest and most perfectly achieve an object on every account so desirable ? The ready and obvious answer is , Establish an institution for the very purpose . To my mind , this seems to be the only measure , which will ensure to the public the attainment of the object . It will be called a new project . Be it so . The concession does not prove , that the project is a bad one , or a visionary , or an impracticable one . Our ancestors ventured to do what the world had never done before , in so perfect a manner , when they established the free schools . Let us also do what they have never so well done yet , and establish an institution for the exclusive purpose of preparing instructers for them . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the patronage of our state governments , we reserve for a separate topic ; it is in place here to speak of their intrinsic propriety . We must begin with saying , that most trite of all things , and yet least of all things understood and felt , that the office of a teacher is important . A thing that is trite , according to the etymology , is a thing worn out , and yet it became trite from its // obvious and unquestionable truth ; and we are sometimes tempted to think , that those great truths , which are of the most obvious and important character , are precisely the truths , which are least felt , and are worn out . What office under heaven can be more momentous , or more dignified , than that which takes charge of the immortal mind ? Who does not feel , that the great Fenelon , when he devoted the powers of his noble ana gifted mind to the education of the young duke of Burgundy , was adequately and worthily employed ? There is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say , it is that of the parent . The clergyman shall be allowed to magnify his office , ' and in a proper sense he can not magnify it too highly . But when he addresses the people , his precept , his direction , is general . He can take no such minute care and oversight of the mind and heart , as belong to the parent and teacher . We join these together , for the office of the teacher , so far as the intellect is concerned , is essentially parental . He is guiding minds , which must suffer or enjoy an unknown amount , throughout an unknown extent of time , from his influence ; and he , who takes upon himself such a responsibility , and yet feels no anxiety for his qualifications , is fit for nothing , but to sit in the magisterial chair , and hold a ferule in his hand ; and then , the subjects on which he operates ought to be literal stocks and stones . And now the question occurs , Is it too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible duty of instructing our youth , to devote a little time to acquiring the necessary qualifications ; a little time , we say , to this specific object ? If there is no profession nor pursuit in life , which does not demand a considerable time to be spent in preparation for it ; if a man can not be a weaver or a blacksmith , if he can not make wooden tubs , or manufacture cart ropes , without serving years of apprenticeship , shall he venture to mould the habits of the mind , and weave the fabric of intellect , and guide all the subtil machinery of the human soul , not only without an equal , but without any previous atten-tion ? This is the only service , ' says Mr Carter , in which we venture to employ young , and often , ignorant persons , without some previous instruction in their appropriate duties . We require experience in all those , whom we employ to perform the slightest mechanicnl labor for us . We would not buy a coat nor a hat of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticeship . // Nor would any one have the hardihood to offer to us the result of his first essay in manufacturing either of these articles . We do not even send an old shoe to be mended , except it he to a workman of whose skill we have had ample proof . Yet we commit our children to be educated to those , who know nothing , absolutely nothing , of the complicated and difficult duties assigned to them . Shall we trust the developement of the delicate bodies1 the susceptible hearts , and the tender minds of our little children to those who have no knowledge of their nature ? Can they , can these rude hands finish the workmanship of the Almighty ? No language can express the astonishment , which a moment 's reflection on this subject excites in me. ' p. 36 . The principle of a division of labor is well understood in the mechanic arts ; it applies with double force to the case before us . It is applied indeed to several departments of intellectual exertion . There are schools for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should there not be schools for teachers of youth ? There are special qualifications required for this profession , qualifications as peculiar and specific , as for any other of the learned professions . On this point Mr Carter shall again speak for us . After some remarks on the importance of gymnastic exercises in our schools , a branch of education , which we rejoice to see rising into notice , he proceeds ; The philosophy of the infant mind must be understood by the instructer , before much progress can be made in the science of education ; for a principal branch of the science consists in forming the mind . And the skill of the teacher in this department is chiefly to be seen in his judicious adaptation of means to the developement of the intellectual faculties . ' The human heart , the philosophy of its passions and its affections must be studied by those who expect to influence those passions and form those affections . This branch of the subject includes the government of children , especially in the earliest stages of their discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good judgment with which he arranges and presents to his pupils the motives that will soonest move them , and most permanently influence their actions . The mistaken or wicked principles of parents and instructers , in this department of education , have no doubt , perverted the dispositions of many hopeful children . If successful experience has been recorded , it should be brought to the assistence of those , who must otherwise act without experience . Lastly , the study of the philosophy of language would be es*ential to the scientific teacher . The term , language , is not here // understood to mean a class of words called Greek , or another class of words called Latin , or even that class of words which we call English . It means something more general , and something which can hardly be defined . It embraces all the means we use to excite in the minds of others the ideas , which we have already in our own minds . These , whatever they are , are included in the general definition of language . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possess a language by which we can produce precisely the idea in a pupil , which we have in our own mind , and which we wish to excite in his . And impatient and precipitate teachers quite ? often quarrel with their pupils , because they do not arrive at the same conclusions with themselves , when , if they could but look into their minds , they would find , that the ideas with which they begin to reason , or which enter into their processes of reasoning , are altogether different . ' pp. 51 , 52 . We can not close this part of our subject , without introducing another extract from the Essays , for the sake of adverting to what we consider to be a very happy feature in the proposed institution . It relates to the connexion in this school between those who are merely pupils , with only the general objects of education before them , and those who propose to become teachers of others . After the young candidate for an instructer , therefore , has acquired sufficient knowledge for directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to profess , he must then begin his labors under the scrutinizing eyes of one who will note his mistakes of government and faults of instruction , and correct them . The experienced and skilful professor of the science will observe how the mind of the young teacher acts upon that of the learner . He will see how far and how perfectly they understand each other , and which is at fault if they do not understand each other at all . If the more inexperienced teacher should attempt to force upon the mind of a child an idea or a process of reasoning , for which it was not in a proper state , he would be checked , at once , and told of his fault ; and thus , perhaps , the pupil would be spared a disgust for a particular study or an aversion to all study . As our earliest experience would in this manner be under the direction of those wiser than ourselves , it would the more easily be classed under general principles for our direction afterwards . ' p. 54 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must refer our readers to the pamphlet itself . We are happy to perceive , that Mr Carter has it in view to establish such a // seminary , even though he should be left to undertake it on his own private responsibility . But we trust that so good a cause will not be suffered to impose its whole burden on individual risk and effort . We do most respectfully , but most earnestly , commend it to the patronage of the Government of Massachusetts . We understand that the attention of the State oi New York is likely to be drawn to the same subject . And writing , as we do , for our patrons in every State in the Union , we beg leave , to propose this as a matter for general consideration . Our remarks will necessarily have as much application to one part of the country as another . It has always been the policy of free governments to foster education . This has been constantly proclaimed , as eminently the policy of our own . And something we have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are , and absolutely indispensable to the education of men for civil offices , and for the learned professions , have yet but an indirect influence upon the mass of our population . it is possible , we know , for the most learned and splendidly endowed universities to exist in the n7lidst of a people ignorant and degraded . We shall not be suspected of saying anything against colleges and universities . Let them be cherished , and watched over , ay , and searched into , and let the tone of education in them be raised to the highest point . But if it is laudable to do so much to elevate the standard of liberal scholarship , it would seem to commend itself to the feelings of a free people , as reasonable , that something should be done to raise the character of our common schools . An institution for the education of teachers , to be employed in these schools , would be emphatically the people 's institution . Such a seminary would be most consonant with the genius of our political condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free schools , and a most bountiful pationage . They l ) ut it in the power of a majority in the several townships to vote the appropriation of monies to any extent , and to enforce the collection of taxes thus assessed . And the majority is safely entrusted with its power , to give or withhold according to its pleasure , because it is impelled by the desire of having schools on the one hand , and on the other , held in check by the reluctance to tax itself . So that there seldom fails to be an appropriation in every township , though not an extravagant one . And yet , although these appropriations are not extravagant , they rise in the ag*re // gate to a great amount . The country is really at a vast expense of means for the support of schools , and it is at this expense by direction of the government , just as much as if it were paid at once out of the public treasury . It may , therefore , fairly be put to the common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these means , thus accumulated , to be wasted , or to fail of their frill and proper effect ? Shall we build school houses , and purchase books , and collect large sums of money , and stop here , and leave undone the very thing that is to give efficacy to all the rest ? Shall we rear a system of machinery , with great labor and care , without attention to the very power , by which it is to work with energy and . effect ? For we aver , and repeat , that the intelligence of the teachers is the power , the vital principle , the main spring in our school establishments . And this intelligence , moreover , can not be had without aid from the government . This is a very material point , and it may easily be made a clear one . The requisite intelligence , it is manifest , is yet to be created . It does not exist ; or it exists only in those , who can afford to be idle , or are more profitably employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How then can it be created ? How shall young men be induced to come forward and prepare Lhemselves for the business of teaching ? We answer , only by a helping hand being stretched out to them . They can not afford to be at the whole expense of the undertaking ; the compensation offered in our common schools will not warrant it . The teachers of these schools in general are , during a portion of the year , otherwise engaged . They can not leave their employments , lose their time , and pay all their expenses at the proposed Institution besides . They will do something ; but they can not do every thing . They have an ambition , many of them , to learn . Some of them , doubtless , are sensible of their incapacity . Some of them , if properly aided , will go to a seminary opened for their benefit . And when they return , they will show at once , in one winter or sumnier , the great advantages of such a training . Others will follow them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The character of the schools will be raised . The character of the community will as certainly be raised ; and the blessing of such an institution will be incalculable . It will be the blessing of many generations. * It is the duty , it is the especial province , and it is the glory of a // truly republican , which ought to be a truly parental government , to watch over the youth and children , committed to its charge . No one can fail to be struck with the declaration , concerning Lycurgus , that he resolved the u'hole business of legislation into the bringing up of youth . ' We are tempted to plead the rights of this portion of our population ; for rights they have , though in our republican wisdom or pride , we seem to imagine , that these belong only to all males over twentyone years of age . ' We confess , that we feel some pity for the little communities , that are gathered in our schools , whose parts are assigned them , often with as little consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory , shut up to buzz , and chafe , and wear away the appointed hours , hut whose restlessness and chafing turn to far less account . We can not but feel some sympathy with this inexpressible reluctance of many a child to go to school , and are but half indignant enough at the naughty truant . We suppose that he makes as fair a calculation as many of his seniors , and judges , that it is better to receive a chastisement at home in the evening , than to suffer torture all day at school . Do we overrate the evils , which are regularly and systematically inflicted on the mass of the rising generation ? We are not again going over the ground , to which this question would lead us . But we confidently appeal to all , who know anything about it . We are for ourselves satisfied , that where all extraneous matters of interest are left out of sight , where the simple question is between loving the school for its own sake , or not loving it , the entire majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen years of age , is decidedly averse to the discipline of learning . And we can not conceive of a more miserable system of mismanagement than that , which brings about such a result . We never saw one of these reluctant pupils , not the dullest of them , whose eye would not kindle , and whose whole countenance would not brighten with joy , if you would clearly present to him one new and intelligible idea . And it is because their reasoning nature is overlooked , and they are set to mumble over the unmeaning sounds of an unintelligible lesson , it is for this reason , that the very idea of learning with many has become odious , and every familiar word of the school room is habitually associated with everything dull and wearisome . We would not willingly be thought extravagant ; but we can not consent Lo be judged by those . whom our own // poor reflections have led to their first thoughts of this interesting subject . We are not fully satisfied , we confess , with the usual manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the improvement and happiness to which any community has attained . From the spirit of this age , and the advantages of this country combined , we are looking for better results , than have yet appeared . Mr Owen will not accomplish them for us , nor will any enthusiast , however much more generous and phil .. anthropic , or less vain and shortsighted . No schemer nor empiric will bring forward the great destiny which is before us , but it will be slowly and gradually wrought out , by principles already in operation . It will be wrought out by the consenting inquiries , and purposes , and endeavors of the whole people ; but the grand lever , which is to raise up the mighty mass of this community , is education . We forget not the power of a free press , so often denominated the palladium our liberties , we forget not our excellent form of government , we forget not the institutions of religion , but all these are to take their character from the intelligence of the people . The empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The schools hold , in embryo , the future communities of this land . The schools are the pillars of the republic . To these , let the strong arm of the government be stretched out . Over these , let the wisdom of our legislatures watch . Let not the needful scrutiny and support be withheld , lest their very foundations silently moulder away , and the fabric of empire sink in their ruins .
