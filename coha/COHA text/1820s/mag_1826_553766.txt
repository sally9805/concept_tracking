txt An ? . X.-i . Remarks , critical and historical , on an article in the Fortyseveuth . A ' *umber of the North american Review , relating to Count Pulaski ; addressed to the Readers of the North american Review . By the AUTHOR of the Sketches of the Life of Greene . ' Charleston , S. C. Svo. pp. 37. 2. a Reply to Judge Johnson 's Remarks on an article in the North american Review , relating to Count Pulaski . By PAUL BENTALOU ; Author of Pulaski Vindicated . ' Baltimore . Svo. pp. 41 . WE know of few authors more unfortunate than Judge Johnson , or whose case more sincerely deserves the commiseration of the friends of letters , and the patrons of literary enterprise . It is now about four years since be published his great work , entitled Sketches of the Life of General Greene , ' in two quarto volumes , and in a style of typograpby much above the common standard of American printing . For such an effort as this , at once to illustrate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , the author very naturally flattered himself , that he should meet with the applause of his countrymen . But from his own account , in his later writings , it would seem , that no man 's expectations were ever more sadly disappointed . His hopes , so fresh and strong at first , have been withered in the bud , and have shrunk away from the chilling breath of public disfavor . The gantlet of authorship was never before run with so much peril , nor terminated with such disastrous consequences . D'Israeli himself would be puzzled to find matter for a more copious chapter of miseries . The author complains of being attacked from all quarters ; newspapers , pamphlets , periodical journals , and formidable volumes , have teemed with censures upon his work , and this not // in one part of the country only , but in every pait . His facts have hee*vquesuoned , his style criticised , many of his statements denied , his way of writing history condemned , and his talents for suTh an undertakiub more than doubted . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprobation , these spontaneous striCtuies from all points of the compass , concurring to the same cud , would raise at least a slight shadow of suspicion in the mind of an author , that they might not he wholly without foundation . But not so with Judge Johnson . The possibility of an error on his part seems never to have entered his thoughts . He imagines the whole world to be his enemies , who have seized upon this opportunity , in violation of truth , honesty , and justice , to pour out upon him the vials of their critical indignation . In opinions , which differ from his own , he discovers plainly the hand of personal enmity ; ' whoever dares to express such opinions , manifests a sheer ignorance of revolutionary history ; ' he is charged with credulity , ignorance , or deliberate im1 ; he is guilty of putting forth paltry pretexts , ' and of saying things not worthy of the most common understanding ; ' he lends himself to an attempt to falsify history , and to extenuate or excuse crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot could be found to contend about , ' and which carry with them the most insulting imputations , both on the researches and the intellects of his readers ; ' he is a gasconader , ' utters calumnies , ' makes vain boasts and bold attempts at imposition , ' aims most insidious blows , ' and , in short , tells tales in which there can not he one word of truth . ' But we forbcar . Such are some oCthe choice expressions which the biographer of Greene finds it in his heart to apply to what he calls that vainest of the mortal race , ' the critics and reviewers , and to those officious sticklers for veracity in history , and meaning in lan6nage ; who have taken the trouble to read his work , and to remark upon its character . These are all enemies , sworn enemies , and seek for nothing but to indulge their malicious propensities . No ; v , if it were odr business to inquire , we should like to he informed , how one luckless author has contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is an extraordinary one . In our state of society , personal enmity against those of whom we have no personal knowledge , is by no means a common thing . When a man publish *s a book , he makes a demand on the public ; he calls on the people to purchase , read , and judge . It is hard , indeed , if readers can not have the liberty , after this tax upon // them , to exercise their understanding , and express their opinions freely , and this without the imputation of enmity to the author , or subjecting themselves to be branded with ilinatured epithets . The world will soon be weary of buying and reading at this rate . It must be remembered , that the reader , as well as the writer , is disposed to have his own opinion and maintain it ; and when an author , whether from a too great sensitiveness , or a jealousy natural to his temper , chooses to take offence at such a liberty , use harsh and taunting language , and persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other men declare to be erroneous , it can not be supposed , that he will gain many new friends , or strengthen the attachment of old ones , by such a proceeding . That our readers may go along with us the more easily , in the remarks about to be made , we shall first briefly state the case before us . When Judge Johnson published his Life of Greene , ' it was reviewed , as our evil stars would have it , in this Journal. * Not long afterward , certain distant and half audible m*urmurs indicated to us , that the author was less enraptured with our estimate of his literary claims , than our good nature might incline us to wish , and that he was now ; se backward in expressing his distrust of our critical sagacity , and even of our motives . Possessing , as xve do , the tender feelings of reviewers , this intelligence could not of coni se but give us a momentary uneasiness . But what could he done , except to let it pass , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *be disappointed and angry , when the world will not discover their merits , and when reviewers are so cold blooded , as to praise only what is good , and to expose faults ? Soon after this review , a pamphlet came before the world , purporting to be a vindication of Count Pulaski , from a censure niade by the author of the Life of Greene , ' against the military character of that celebrated Polish chief . That pamphlet we also read , and was struck with the honest zeal , and force of argument , with which a veteran friend of Pulaski defended his military fame , and rebutted the offensive charge . Another review grew out of this pamphlet , in which we took occasion to introduce a few particulars concerning the romantic life an ( l character of Pulaski , and to add such strictures as occurred to us , on that part of the Life of Greene , ' which related // to this subject. * Judge Johnson could restrain himself no longer . As for the Vindication of Pulaski , ' he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown it hy , well satisfied that any production xxith such a title must be beneath his notice . ' But when the review caine out , he relented . He then felt compelled , however reluctant , to come once more before the public ; ' and , as he has written elaborate Remarks ' on the pamphlet and review , there is just ground for presuming , that he conquered his antipathy so far as to read them both . We can hardly commend his wisdom in this course , feeling assured that his first argument of silent contempt would have been more successful . But it is not for us to teach an opponent the use of his best weapons . The title of the Remarks here mentioned , is that placed first at the head of this article . Then followed a Reply'to these Re . marks , by Colonel Bentalon , the author of the Vindication of Pulaski , ' written in a temperate and dignified tone , in which he reiterates what he had before stated , and confirms it by additional proofs . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be chiefly confined . A paragraph in the exordium of Judge Johnson 's performance , we beg leave to quote at large . That I should be assailed by the North American explicitly arid confidently long before it occurred . For I had reason to think , that there were individuals connected with that Review , whose eternal enmity I had incurred , from causes , which I have no reason to blush at . Still I entertained a hope , that there would have been found character enough in the conductors of that work , to repel any attempt to make it the instrument of private or party views . My experience satisfies me , that they only require some specious disguise , some mere pretext , for rather lending themselves voluntarily than otherwise to such attempts . ' p. 5 . Now what can be the author 's point in this paragraph , we are utterly at a loss to divine . There is no doubt deep meaning in it , particularly in the italics , which are his own , but it is quite too deep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court of the United States has reason to blush ' for his conduct on any occasion , and much less on so unimportant a one , as that of having an imaginary difference with the individuals // connected with a Review . ' Why should he blush ? Ah , indeed , why should he , unless at being found in such company , among the vainest of the mortal race ? ' We are sorry , moreover , to hear him talk so much about enemies , ' personal enmity , ' eternal enmity . ' From the language and tone of this pamphlet , one would be almost tempted to think , that he had not a friend upon earth . We do not believe his case is half so bad , as his apprehensions , or his xvarmth of feeling , would make it ; and we can assure him , that when he foretold so explicitly and confidently ' the assault of the North American Review , he had none but friends among those connected with that work . And further to remove his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter about Pulaski , which disturbed him so much , no two persons ever exchanged words with direct reference to that article , till it appeared from the press ; and we should be williub to pledge ourselves , for the application of the spirit of this remark in every other case , in which the author has been noticed in our work . If this is making him of less consequence in the eyes of the North American Reviewers , than he had supposed , we can not help it ; we state the simple fact . And justice to some individual , or individuals , to whom he pointedly alludes in the above paragraph , although unknown to us , renders such an explicit declaration necessary . The following paragraph is too remarkable to be passed over , whether considered in its meaninb , the beauty of its figures , the delicacy of its sentiments , or the peculiar felicity of its phraseology and style . It can not be denied , ' observes Judge Johnson , that there is something of a military air in the late combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at RP ? mond , under the signature of Hamilton ; from the centre at Baltimore , through this pamphlet Mr Bentalou 's Reply ' ; and from the left at Boston , under the banner of the Reviewer . One might be pardoned for suspecting that war on so extended a scale indicated talents , which had filled the highest military and civil stations , were it not for one obvious characteristic equally manifesting itself in every movement . They are the attack of the brigand or assassin ; they belong not to open warfare . They are the movements of the aspirant for a scalp or a purse , and not the noble darings of that towering genius , that would have given the finale to our revolution , with which most revolutions have concluded , to wit , military despotism and consequent usurpation ; justice administered // at the point of the bayonet , under the surveillance of avarice , and the guidance of the speculator on public distress and private misery . ' pp. 8 , 9 . We have quoted the whole paragraph , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , when he gets upon a favorite topic . The first sentence is the only part that requires our notice . In all the rest he at least forgets , or disre-. gards , one of the maxims of his own profession , that words should be used not merely as words , but to denote ideas and things ; in verbis non verba , sed res et ratio quvrenda est . But letting this pass , has there ever so extravagant a notion entered the brain of a mortal , since the hallucinations of the knight of La Manch*i , as that in which the author has a vision of the combined operations ' of half the continent in array against him ? In one respect there is a difference in the two cases . Don Quixote looked forward to adventures , and trusted to the potency of his own arm for raising antagonists , worthy of his dignity and prowess ; while our modern knight sees the phalanxes of his foes already marshalled in battle array , and gathering from distant regions to encounter his might , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with signatures , pampiets , and the banner of a reviewer . ' With as much truth as eloquence , did good old Robert Burton write , to prove the whole world insane ; the only difference exists in the different modes of showing madness ; it is our author 's foible to think himself the great object of notice , . nay , of the combined operations , ' and simultaneous attack ' of the centre and wings of the nation . But there is another symptom of the author 's singular obliquity of mind , not less extraordinary than this . He tries to persuade himself , that all the forces , in what he calls the centre and the left , have been drawn from a single point . In other words , he insinuates , that Colonel Bentalou 's first pamphlet in defence of Pulaski , our review of that pamphlet , and an article in the United States Magazine , which seems to annoy him a good deal , were all written by the same hand ! Listen to his remarks on this head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sufficient to satisfy me , beyond a doubt , of the quarter , from which the attack proceeded . It is impossible for any reader to be so blind , as not to perceive the common origin of this pamphlet , and of the review of the Life of Greene , published in the United States Magazine , tbr* January , 18523 ; not less impossible // IlOct. than for any one to be so dull , as not to discover the intimate fellowship between the author of this pamphlet and its reviewer . There are passages dispersed through the work , with a view to give it a semblance of genuineness , but the veil is so flimsy as only to excite a smile at the folly , that could suppose itself cunning enough to conceal the fraud . ' p. 6 . In another place , alluding to our review , he says , the name of a venerable old man , known to have been the companion and friend of Pulaski , is made use of to give an air of authenticity to the pamphlet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the author of the Life of Greene . ' Again , we are charged with crouching behind a mere man of straw , ' and cloaking oui's&amp;lves with the fair character of the . honest old Pole , ' ( who , by the way , is no Pole at all , but a French officer , that early espoused the American cause , ) and , lastly , with attempting to pass an honest man off as the writer of that pamphlet . ' What will the Judge say , now that Colonel Bentalon has come out with his Reply , and declared himself the author ? He has told us beforehand what he would say , and in the following words . Nor , if Mr Bentalon has really given the sanction of his name to it , would I be led to change my opinion on this point by anything , that could come from Mr Bentalon . ' Even the venerable and honest man , ' one of the earliest defenders of American liberty , an eyewitness of nearly all he relates , esteemed by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government to the present day , and under whose fair name we are accused of cloaking our sins of authorship , even this man is no longer to be believed , when his positive statements are not in accordance with the conjectures of Judge Johnson . When he arrives at this point , his honesty is at an end . Whether our author 's sagacity , in discovering that a singie , hand wrote all the pieces to which he alludes , or his consistency in speaking of Colonel Bentalou , be the more to be wondered at , we shall submit to the decision of others . Judge Johnson has scrutinized at some length our account of Pulaski in Poland , but as he has added nothing , which had nor already come tinder our observation while examining the subject , we shall not follow him through this part of his pamphlet . We stop only to notice one or two discrepances , into which he has fallen , by attempting to depart from our representation . We have always supposed Pulaski in Poland to have fought for liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // history , as it has come to our ears . But Jud*e Johnson sustains the singular paradox , of first denying the fact and then proving it to he true . He begins by affirming , that Pulaski was one of a band of intolerant persecutors ; ' that to represent such men as combating for liberty , is a farce ; nor less so to laud the republican virtues of an individual , whose life was devoted to the maintenance of a despotism , which chose to assume the title of the Polish Republic . ' But hear what he says three pages oawa*ds , in quoting from Castera , his favorite author . The confederates had elected for a general a noble Polonese , named Pulaski , an intrepid man , and so violent br liberty , that he did not hesitate to promote even by crimes , the most honorable of causes . ' Here , then , we have the astonishing phenomenon of an intolerant persecutor , ' without republican virtues , ' devoted to the maintenance of despotism , ' and yet violent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes ! ' What does our author mean ? Both of these descriptions can not be true . To which horn of the dilemma does he attach himself ? Which of these contradictory statements does he really believe ? On the j ) rinciples of the common law , we have a right to presume the latter ; judicia posteriora sunt in lege fortiora ; and thus he is on our side in spite of himself , and the ( lispute on this point is at an end . We delight not to show off such faults in a grave writer of history , but we must do our duty and proceed . One fact mentioned by us , as evincing the improbability that Pulaski was guilty of the gross neglect of duty in the battle of Germantown , ascribed to him by Judge Johnson , was , that he received his appointment to the command of the cavalry by the recommendation of Washington , who never afterwards expressed any public disapprobation of his conduct . Of this fact our author expresses a decided and formal disbelief . I find nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washin*ton on the subject . Nor do I believe , that it was on his recommendation , that congress first created Pulaski a general of cavalry . Washington never could have recommended a measure so unjust and disgusting to his own cavalry offeers. ' p. 36 . Thus far Judge Johnson . Now let us turn to the second volume of XVashington 's Official Letters , p. 157 . What do we find there ? Washington writes to the president of Congress , Having endeavored , at the solicitation of the Count de Pulaski , to think of some mode for employing him in our service // there is none occurs to me , liable to so few inconveniences and exceptions , as the giving him the command of the horse . This department is still without a head , as I have not , in the present deficiency of brigadiers with the army , thought it advisable to take one from the foot for that command . ' This gentleman , we are told , has been like us , engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those objects . He derives floin hence a title to our respect , that ought to operate in his favor , as far as the good of the service will permit . ' Such was the recommendation of General Washington ; and the consequence of it may be seen , in the Journals of Congress , for September 15th , 1777 , as follows . Resolved , that a cornmander of the horse be appointed , with the rank of a brigadier ; the ballots being taken , Count Pulaski was elected . ' These extracts , compared with Judge Johnson 's statements , require no comment . We can not help observing , nevertheless , how peculiarly ill timed are some of this writer 's charges against others , when considered as standing in the same pamphlet , and almost on the same page , that contains thc gross blunders here exposed . He makes it a light matter to talk of the deplorable ignorance , ' absolute effiontery , ' and false statements ' of his opponents , and to refer them without ceremony to their horubooks . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest insinuation , that he may have been in a mistake , or ventured a doubtful conjecture . To distrust his knowledge , or his judgment , is to forfeit all claims , not merely to his courtesy , but to his charity . Yet we here find him ignorant of the very elements of the history of the Revolution , which he has written two quarto volumes to illustrate , and in which he professes to have made many discoveries , and corrected many errors . A writer of revolutionary history not acquainted with Washington 's official letters As well might we talk of a scholar not acquainted with his alphabet . Let the author of the Life of Greene make a few more such exposures , and it will require no *IEdipus to solve the mystery of his great work havin* been so coldly received by the public . But it is time for us to recur to the main point of the controversy , originating in Judge Johnson 's account of the battle of Germantown . He ascribes the defeat on that occasion , mainly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culpable neglect // of duty . As this was the first hint that any historian had given of such a charge , it was natural that Colonel Bentalon , who was an officer in Pulaski 's leojon , was at his side when he received his mortal wound at the siege of Savannah , and with him when he breathed his last , should be eager to defend the hitherto unsullied military reputation of his friend and commander , and should appeal to the public in his behalf . Hence has grown up the controversy , in which we have found ourselves unwarily involved . In its various historical relations , the subject has some importance , and on this ground our readers will pardon us for entering into it a little in detail . Our author expresses great disapprobation of all previous accounts of the battle of Germantown , and , after a lapse of almost fifty years , imabines he has discovered the true key for unlocking every difficulty . It had eluded the search of former historians , and its hiding place was unknown even to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well may he exult in such a discovery at the present day , and cry out , like the enraptured philosopher of Syracuse , eureka , eureka . All the writers on the American war , ' says he , seem to have vied with each other in working up this battle to a scene of the most abject confusion . ' Observe , reader , abject confusion . ' Flow is light to be brought out of this darkness , and the events of the battle to he set in due order , and its fatal issue accounted for ? Why , in the simplest way possible . The author 's key will put all things right in the twinkling of an eye . You have only to take his word for it , that , during a forced march of the American army of sixteen miles , in the night , Count Pulaski , with a party of patrols , found leisure to go into a farmhouse , and betake himself quietly to sleep ; and that , while he was in this unmiliitary attitude , the enemy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb his slumbers , scampered away to the l3ritish army with the intelligence of the approach of the Americans . Hence the enemy was prepared for the onset , and hence the disasters of the day . Such is the magic of the author 's key , and such the substance of what he very justly calls his new views ' of the battle of Germantown . Let it not be said , that we treat this grave matter of a battle and a defeat , with too much levity . Pulaski , that miracle of valor and military enterprise , in Europe and America , reposing in the arms of Morpheus , in the midst of the heat , and haste , and excitement of a forced march to battle ! The fate of the // day depending on this incident ! J ? isnm teneatis 6 ? Saving the anecdote of Major Burnet 's cue , and General Greene 's curls , related by the author in his description of the battle , we do verily believe there is nothing recorded in sober history more nearly approaching the marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their consequences . But let us attend to Judge Johnson 's own language on the subject . The Americans are not a little at a loss to account for some events , merely because they write under the erroneous impression , that the surprise was complete . Yet the British assert , and on this point their assertion is not to be controverted , that their patrols had given them an hour 's notice of the approaching attack . It is not to be wondered at , that the Americans doubt this upon the supposition , that the British patrol could not have approached the American army , without being discovered by their own . But it is a melancholy fact , of which few were informed , that the celebrated Pulaski , who commanded the patrol , was found by General Washington himself asleep in a farmhouse . Policy only , and regard to the rank and misfortunes of the offender , could have induced the general to suppress the fact . Yet to this circumstance , most probably , we are to attribute the success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advance of the American column . ' Life of Greene , vol. i. p. 83 . A*ain , in his Remarks , ' speakin' of the loss of the battle , on the l ) art of the Anicricans , the author says , the leading cause , according to my views of the affair , and that in which all others bad their origin was the notice communicated to the British , a ' by their patrols , of the advance of the American army . ' Laybig down this axiom as a basis , he builds upon it his new theory of the battle of Germantown , tracing all the misfortunes of that luckless day to the untimely slumbers of Pulaski . Now to us this seems not only a gratuitous labor , but without foundation in fact or probability . Who has ever complained , that there was any such mighty difficulty in understanding the details of that battle ? Or who has called for any new theory to make the matter more plain , or the causes more evident , than they appear in Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The statement there made , harmonizes perfectly with the descriptions of other general officers , and individuals , who were in the engagement ; and why come forward at this day with n cxv views , ' apochryphal testimonies , and conjectural emendations ? The dispirited condition of the troops , who // had been for several weeks under incessant and hard service ; their fati* uc after a long march in the night ; the extreme fogginess of the morning , which prevented the plan of attack from being carried into methodical execution ; the delay of a division of the army at Chew 's house ; and the failure of ammunition in the heat of the battle ; these have been represented by other historians , as the remote and proximate causes of the retreat of t1rn American forces , at the moment when victory was declaring itself in their favor ; and these causes are so obvious , and so adequate to the effects , and have been so unanimously received as such , that we are justified in repeating it to be a gratuitous and unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , or weaken their influence by new discoveries and an imaginary theory . Before proceeding further to remark on the paragraph quoted above , we shall gratify our readers by inserting here a letter from Colonel Timothy Pickering , a name too well known in this country , during the last half century , to need any encomiums from us . Lie was present at the battle of Germantown , by the side of Washington , and , from his station , bad as good anopportunity of knowing the events of the day , as any other person . This letter is of great value as a historical document , and peculiarly interesting as a narrative of what took place , near the commander in chief , at the critical time of the action . Salem , . lugvst 23d , 1826 . SIR , Nearly fortynine years have elapsed since the battle of Geemantown ; of course you may well suppose , that many facts respecting it are beyond my power of recollection ; while a few are indelibly impressed on my memory . Without repeating all your questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not know at the time , nor do I recollect ever to have heard , that Pulaski was found asleep , until it was mentioned by Judge Johnson , in his " Life of General Greene . " Nor do I remember to have heard him censured for any neglect of duty , in the case referred to , the battle of Germantown . It was on the 15th of September , 1777 , as appears by the Journals of Congress , that Count Pulaski was appointed commander of the horse , with the rank of brigadier general . He must have brought with him from Poland the reputation of a good officer , of which vigilance , when on duty . is an essential characteristic ; or , a perfect // stranger as he was , he would not have received that honorable appointment . The distance the army had to march , from its encampment on the Skippack road to Germantown , is estimated to he about sixteen miles ; and , therefore , ( although 1 do not recollect it ) a very temporary halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an officer , or private , to have retired to indulge in sleep in a farmhouse . 2 . General Washington , in his letter to Congress of October the 5th , the day after the battle , says , " that the army marched about seven o'clock in the evening of the third ; and that General Sullivan 's advanced party attacked the enemy 's picket at Mount Airy , or Mr Allen 's house , ahout sunrise the next morning , which presently gave way ; and his main body , consisting of the right wing , following soon , engaged the light infantry and other troops encamped near the picket , which they forced from their ground . Leaving their baggage , they retreated a considerable distance , having previously thrown a party into Mr Chew 's house . " * The term here applied to these advanced corps of the enemy , that they were " forced from their ground , " shows that they were in arms , and resisted the assailants ; and the previous brush with the picket , a guard always posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's approach , roused " the light infantry and other troops , " who had time enough to take their arms and form for action . They retreated , of necessity , before the greatly superior force of the whole right wing of our army . But the " leaving of their baggage " authorizes the inference , that they had no knowledge of the march of the American army , until the firing in the engagement with the picket guard gave the alarm . If then these advanced corps of the enemy were not , in the strict sense of the word surprised , that is , " caught napping , " unprepared for action , much less could the main body , posted in the centre of Germantown , two miles farther off , have been surprised . This distance gave them ample time to prepare for action , in any manner which the attack of their enemy should require . 3 . Yon ask , " at what distance from Chew 's house the attack commenced U ' At that time I was a stranger in that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during my residence in Pennsylvania , I should estimate the distance of Mount Airy from Philadelphia to he eight miles , Chew 's // house seven miles , and the centre of Germantown six miles . And these I think are the distances , as I have occasionally heard them mentioned . 4 . You ask , " how long a pause was made at Chew 's house ; and what space of time probably intervened between the beginning of the action , and the general engagement at the head of the village ? " The pause at Chew 's house , in the manner I shall l ) resently mention , probably delayed the advance of the rear division of our army into action for half an hour . And taking the attack of the picket at Mount Airy , as the beginning of the actiQn , it was probably near half an hour before it became general as to the whole of Sullivan 's column ; and this general engagement must have commenced after he had passed Chew 's house ; for I saw not one dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying in the road near where I fell in with General Sullivan . I presume that , following close on the heels of the British battalion of light infantry and the fortieth regiment , which were retiring before him , Sullivan , with his column , bad passed Chew 's house , without annoyance from it . For it must have taken some time for Colonel Musgrave , who entered it with six companies of the fortieth regiment , to barricade and secure the doors , and the windows of the lower story , before he would be ready to fire from the chamber windows ; and it was from them that the firing I saw proceeded . In the march of the army , General Washington , following Sullivan 's column , kept in the road leading to and through Germantown to Philadelphia . When we had entered the northern part of the village , we he ' rd , in advance of us ( I was riding by the General 's side ) , a very heavy fire of musketry . General Sullivan 's divisions , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither was in sight . This fire , brisk and heavy , continuing , General Washington said to me ; " I am afraid General Sullivan is throwin* axvay his ammunition ; ride forward and tell him to preserve it . " I do not know what was the precise idea , which at that moment struck the mind of the General . I can only conjecture , that lie was apprehensive that Sullivan , after meeting the enemy in his front , kept up his brisk and incessant fire , when the haziness of the air , and its increased obscurity , from the burning of so much powder , prevented his troops having such a distinct view of the enemy , as would render their fire efficient . Be this as it may , the instant I received the General 's orders , I rode forward ; and in the road , three or four hundred // yards beyond Chew 's house , met Sullivan , and delivered to him the General 's orders . At this time I had never heard of Chew 's house ; and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first notice I received of it was from the whizzing of musket balls , across the road , before , behind , and above me , as I was returning , after delivering the orders to Sullivan . Instantly turning my eye to the right , I saw the blaze of the muskets , whose shot were still aimed at me , from the windows of a large stone house , standing back about a hundred yards from the road . This was Chew 's house . Passing on , I came to some of our artillery , who were firing very obliquely on the front of the house . 1 remarked to them , that in that position their fire would he unavailing , and that the only chance of their shot making any impression on the house , would be hy moving down and firing directly on its front. * Then immediately passing on , I rejoined General Washington , who , with General Knox and other officers , was in front of a stone house ( nearly all the houses in Germantown were of stone ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house stood . I found they were discussing , in Washington 's presence , this question ; Whether the whole of our troops then behind should immediately advance , regardless of the enemy in Chew 's house , or first summon them to surrender ? General Knox strenuously urged the sendiab of a summons . Among other things , he said , " it would he unmilitary to leave a castle in our rear . " I answered , " Doubtless that is a correct general maxim ; hut it does not apply in this case . We know the extent of this castle ( Chew 's house ) ; and to guard against the danger from the enemy 's sallying , and falling on the rear of our troops , a small regiment may he posted here to watch them ; and if they sally , such a regiment will take care of them . But , " I added , " to summon them to surrender will he useless . We are now in the midst of the battle and its issue is unknown .

I marked it with inverted commas , because I perfectly remembered the ideas I expressed , as the words used import ; and I am also sure , that there is no material change im* // Lieutenant Smith of Virginia , my assistant in the office of adju* tant general , volunteered his service to carry it . As he was advancing , a shot from the house gave him a wound of which he died. * Whatever delay , in the advance of the division in our rear , was occasioned by the pause at Chew 's house , I am satisfied that Sullivan 's column did not halt there at all , as mentioned by Judge Johnson . The column was certainly not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already noticed ; and it is alike certain , that it was then beyond Chew 's house . Nor were the enemy forming under cover of the house , or I must have seen them . When the orders were sent to our troops in the rear to advance , I do not know ; but it must have been subsequent to the sending of the flag ; and , I should think , twenty minutes , at least , after it was found that an enemy was in the house . The General did not pass it at all . I had remained near him until our troops were retreating ; when I rode off to the rio'ht to endeavor to stop and rally those I met retiring , in b companies and squads ; hut it was impracticable ; their ammunition , I suppose , had generally been expended . 5 .

The right column , under General Sullivan , which Washington accompanied , marched on the direct road to Germantown .

The columns being thus entirely separated , and at a distance from each other , no calculations of their commanders could have the language , as uttered by me at the instant . In writing it , I endeavored to recollect the very words I had used . ' * General Henry Lee , in his " Memoirs of the War in the Southern States , " mentions the zeal with which Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton ( Alexander Hamilton , then one of Washington 's aids de camp , and since so well known for the display of his eminent talents , in the service of his country ) urged the propriety of passing Chew 's house . This must have been while I was absent , carrying the General 's orders to Sullivan . I perfectly remember , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was in the General 's family , said to me , " While you were absent , I offered to carry the flag ; I bless my stars that it was not accepted . " ' VOL . XXI1I. - NO. 53. // insured their arriving at the same time at their respective points of attack . Judge Johnson , in his " Life of Greene , " has represented as " almost ludicrous " the " scene " exhibited by some writers , of the discussion near Chew 's house , in the presence of General Washington , in which it is hinted that opinions were " obtruded ; " and that even field officers may have expressed thetr opinions ; " but , " he adds , " General Washington was listening to the counsels of his own mind and of his general officers . " I know , however , that he did listen to the discussion ; and Lee , commanding a troop of horse , on that day on duty near the General 's person , accounts for his determination to send the summons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the General 's confidence , his opinion prevailed . " Fuitlier 1 must remark , that the general officers , whom the Judge supposes to have been present , and advising the commander in chief , were then in their proper places , with their divisions and brigades . Knox alone , of the general officers , was present . Commanding in the artillery department , and the field pieces being distributed among the brigades of the army , he was always at liberty , in time of action , to attend the commander in chief . Some two or three years since , I wrote to Judge Johns on , informing him of his mistakes in the matter noticed in this paragraph . Others of his details of this battle , which are inconsistent with the statements I have here given to you , must be incorrect . The truth is , that General Washington , not sanguine in his own opinions , and his diffidence being probably increased by a feeling sense of his high responsibility , as Commander in Chief , was ever disposed , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , in whose discernment and fidelity he placed a confidence ; and certainly his decisions were often influenced by their opinions . This is within my own knowledge . 1 am , &amp;c . T. PICKERING . ' In this letter we are presented with a lucid exposition of the difficulties of the battle , which Judge Johnson has conceived to be so inexplicable , in all former narratives , and which he has rendered still more perplexing , by his attempt to explain them . His new views ' happen to be all wrong , and wholly unnecessary to make out a consistent account of the principal incidents of the engagement . Two or three of his new positions shall now be examined . // 1 . Respecting the slumbers of Pulaski , which the Judge considers the prime cause of all the disasters of the day . In a case like this , it is difficult to prove a negative . No man living , it may be , can say that Pulaski did not sleep , while on the march frori Skip pack creek to Mount Airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constantly in his presence . All probability is certainly against it , even leaving the character of Pulaski out of the question . The conviction must be strong on the mind of every one , as it is Oil that of Colonel Pickering , that no officer , or private , could have found an opportunity to sleep . If there was any halt at all , it must have been very short , for Colonel Piekering does not recollect any ; and considerin* the distance marched and the time employed , it would hardly seem possible , that the army could have stopped on the way . To make his theory hang together , Judge Johnson assures us , that Pulaski must have retired early , ' thereby affording time for the British patrols to give due notice of the movement of the American forces . This is involving the matter in a still greater absurdity , for it is supposing the army to have halted near the beginning of its march , and rested there , while Pulaski was calmly reposing in a farmhouse ; whereas , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been after the men had become somewhat fatigued , and not long before the commencement of the action . Moreover , how does it happen , that no more than one officer near General Washington 's person , should have known the fact , and heard the General 's reprimand ? Where were Knox , and Pickering , and Hamilton , and Lee , whose duty on that day brought them in contact with the Commander in Chief ? Is it possible , that so gross a neglect on the part of an officer , a neglect in which originated the entire failure of the enterprise , should have been kept a secret from them ? Is it possible , that such a piece of intelligence should not have rung through the whole army in twelve hours ' time , and have flown on the wings of the wind to every corner of the continent ? Is it possible , that the officer , who , by sleep ! ng on his post , was the means of losing the battle of Germantown , should have been continued in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an important command ? Is it possible , that such a secret should have remained hidden from the whole world , till fortyfive years after the event , eluding the prying eye of the historinos and military critics of this battle ? Is it possible , that Washin *ton could have overlooked such a neglect of duty , and neither have mentioned // it in his public report , nor whispered it to any person , although his own reputation , and that of the army , were so intimately connected with it ? Are these things possible ? We say they are not . The conviction on our mind is irresistible , without any other testimony than the simple statement of the case . Nor do we believe , that any man , who fairly examines the subject in this light , will come to a different conclusion . And xxhen , in addition to this , we consider , that the great military fame of Pulaski was chiefly founded on the qualities here denied to him , vigilance and promptitude , that in the perilous scenes in Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading part , he never was surprised by his enemies , nor taken prisoner ; when we remember , that all Europe had resounded with the report of his valor , his achievements , and his extraordinary military talents ; we shall then have other arguments in his i*vor , that will weigh heavily with most minds . As a balance against the weight of these circumstances , md 6e Johnson cites the single authority of General Pinekucy , who was aid to the Commander in Chief . We have full confidence in the veracity , and respect for the high character , of that tried patriot and statesman . But on the present occasion we hesitate not to say , that we believe he was mistaken . The testimony of one man , in so remarkable a case , where there were many others as likely to know the fact as himself , and whose duty it was to report it , makes no impression on our judgment , when brought in competition with the multitude of impossibilities , which have just been enumerated . Nor have we ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor any explanation by him of the thousand difficulties , which embarrass his evidence . How he would have reconciled them we presume not to conjecture ; but as the case now stands , we doubt whether any person can examine the whole ground without being convinced , that General Pinckney 's impression was erroneous . Again , how does Judge Johnson dispose of the difficulty attending the silence of Washington , in a case of such moment , where his duty as Commander in Chief , justice to himself , to his officers , to the nation , imperiously demanded from him public exposure and censure ? In a most extraordinary way truly . He says , that policy only , and regard to the rank and misfortunes of the offender , could have induced the general to suppress the fact . ' We ask if so dark a stain can attach to the character of Washington , as that of screening from punishment and dis // grace an offender , ' who had been guilty of such gross neglect as is ascribed to Pulaski ? We trust not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this topic , and tells us , that Washton was often obliged to temporize , ' that it could seldom comport with his dignity to be the accuser of an officer , ' and that to him there would have been no pleasure in the task . ' Indeed , no pleasure in the task ! And is this the reason given by a judge , why the guilty should go unpunished ? General Washington sacrificing justice to policy , ' temporizing , ' neglecting to notice an offender , because it did not comport with his dignity , ' and because he had no pleasure in the task ! ' Ohe , jam satis ! In a postscript to his pamphlet , the author appeals to a declaration of Lafayette , in the following rather equivocal language . It General Pinckney 's testimony to support the fact related of Count Pulaski could need corroboration , it can be further proved , that General Lafayette , when lately in Columbia , declared it to he true of his own knowledge . ' Now it happens , that when Lafayette was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ever heard the report of Pulaski 's being asleep ; to which he instantly replied , No , never . ' Mr Barney , the p*esent representative in Congress from Baltimore , writes thus to Colonel Bentalon . I distinctly recollect , that when you asked General Lafayette if he ever had heard General Washington mention , that Count Pulaski had been found asleep at his post , previously to the battle of Germantown , or that the surprise was prevented by neglect of duty on his part , General Lafayette replied with warmth , " No , never ; " and proceeded to speak of Pulaski in the highest terms of praise . ' So much for the hearsay report of what Lafayette declared at Columbia . And , again , as to the fact having been true of his own knowledge , ' it unluckily turns out , that he was not present at the battle , but was then at Bethlehem , in consequence of the wound he had received in the batth* of Brandywine . But even taking the position to be settled , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more remote from each other , than this cause and the effects ascribed to it by Judge Johnson . Were the British patrols any more likely to see a sleeping , than a waking man ? Besides , are we to understand , that all Pulaski 's party were asleep as well as himself ? In short , look at the thing in what light you will , and the circumstance of Pulaski 's having been asleep or not . can have no connexion // whatever with the issue of the battle . We deny , moreover , that either he , or any of his men , or any of the American advanced parties , were seen by the British patrols , in time to communicate this intelligence , before the battle commenced . This will appear in what we have to say on the next topic . 2 . Judge Johnson accounts for some of the blunders , which he supposes historims to have committed in describing this battle , by considering them to have written under the erroneous impression that the surprise was complete . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present day can have access , from the unanimous records of history , and from the whole train of events during the battle , we undertake to affirm , that the surprise was complete ; in other words , that the British army , stationed across the village of Germantown , had no knowledge of the intended attack of the Americans , till the firing was heard when the engagement began at Mount Airy , two miles from the encampment of the main army . Gordon says , that the royal army was indeed completely surprised . ' * Andrews , a British writer , speaks of the suddenness of the attack , ' and of the first surprise . ' * In a work on the Revolution , ascribed to Captain Hall of the British army , who writes as if he were present in the battle , we have the following remarkable statement . Notwithstanding this enterprise was conducted with great secrecy by the enemy , yet we had strong reason to believe , that they were meditating some important design . A prisoner or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their advanced guard , and gave information of the rebel army being in full march towards us , afforded hints that might have been turned to great advantage , and if properly adverted to , possibly ended in the total destruction of the enemy . And when the firing began from the pickets , and advanced battalion of light infantry , whose camp the enemy not oidy penetrated but plundered , it even then gained but little credit at head quarters , where this commotion was supposed to arise , rather from a flying party of the enemy , than a serious attack . ' * Here the author takes the surprise for granted , and censures the commander of the royal army for his apathy , in not having anticipated it . Stedruan , another British writer , in alluding to * History of the American Revolution , Vol . II . p. 526. j Andrews ' history of the Late War , Vol . II . pp. 373. 375. * History of the Civil War in Am*rica , Vol.1. p. 321 . London , 1780. // the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay there , time was affirded to the rest of the British line to get under arms . ' * But why was it not already tinder arms , if knowledge of the advance of the Americans had been obtained nearly two hours before , as it must have been , according to Judge Johnson 's interpretation ? A stronger proof , indeed , of the complete surprise of the enemy , could hardly be furnished , than General Washington 's own letter , as quoted above by Colonel Pickering . The firing commenced with the enemy 's picket , which instantly retreated . This was evidently the first notice of the intended attack , received by the next division of the enemy , posted near the picket ; for although they had time to rally to arms , yet so sudden was their retreat , that their baggage was left behind , as stated by General Washington . This circumstance is inexplicable , upon the supposition that the British had a previous knowledge of the contemplated attack ; for it was a matter of course , in any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baggage would as certainly have been secured in the rear . Not only their baggage was thus neglected , but their tents were left standing . Colonel Bentalon testifies that lie saw them as he passed through the camp . We have before us a manuscript copy of a letter , written by General Smaliwood to the governor of Maryland , five days after the engagement , in which lie says , The retreat was prosecuted with little or no other loss , than the field of action , which , to our rep*oach , was abandoned in the midst of victory , after taking possession of the enemy 's encampment and baggage , with many pieces of artillery and military stores . If all these circumstances do not prove a surprise on the part of the enemy , we should despair of proving it by any force of argument , or combination of facts . The time between the beginning of the attack at Mount Airy , and the meeting of the two armies in Germantown , was abundantly su*cient for the British forces to get ready for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the head of the village . The mistake fallen into by Judge Johnson , in regard to the time at which the action began , is not a little extraordinary . He says it was about four o'clock in the morning . ' But Washington writes , in his official report , that the attack on the picket , at Mount Airy , was about sunrise , ' being two full hours later than the time specified by our author . At first we were puzzled to // account for this discrepancy , presuming no American historian would describe the battle of Germantown , without reading Washington 's official letter on the subject ; and even now we can explain it , only by recurring to the author 's new theory . He had laid it down as an axiom , that the British had an hour 's notice , ' by their patrols , of the approach of the American army . In Sir William Howe 's official report , it is stated that this discovery was made at three o'clock in the morning . ' To preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix the beginning of the battle at four o'clock , or one hour later , notwithstanding the plain declaration of Washington to the contrary . Sir William Howe says the action began soon after the break of day ; ' Stedman and Hall both use the same phrase , at the dawn of day . ' But this is a point upon which Washington could not be mistaken . We have already said enough to show the error of the British commander 's statement respecting the patrols . It was not likely he would report a surprise of his army to his own government . On what authority Judge Johnson writes , that the British assert that their patrols had given them an hour 's notice of the approaching attack , ' we know not . We have found no such assertion in any British author , nor seen any allusion to the patrols , except in Sir William Howe 's report , and in the Annual Register , ' which evidently copies that report . 3 . We come at last to the affair of Chew 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , and satisfactory account of this part of the battle , than has ever before appeared ; and , at the same time it establishes the opinion derived from all former historians , it contradicts , in almost every essential particular , Judge Johnson 's new views . ' On this branch of the subject , little needs to be added to the letter of Colonel Pickering , except to point out a few more of our author 's mistakes . In Lee 's Memoirs of the War vol. i. p. 29. , we are told , that the halt at Chew 's house was taken after some deliberation , as the writer well recollects , being that day in the suite of the Commander in Chief , with a troop of dragoons charged with duty near his person . Many junior officers , at the head of whom were Colonel Pickering and Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton , urged with zeal the propriety of passing the house . Brigadier Knox opposed the measure with earnestness , denouncing the idea of leaving an armed force in the rear . ' Judge Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ordered by Washington , ' // that it was but momentary , ' brief and involuntary , ' and of very brief duration . ' Our readers have seen , in Colonel Pickering 's letter , that the halt was ordered by Washington ; and , so far from being momentary , it continued for nearly half an hour , long enough for the British to form and maneuvre as they chose . These facts destroy the entire foundation of the new theory , for it is perfectly obvious , that this delay was the first and principal cause , if not the only one , of the retreat of Sullivan 's division , and thereby the rout of the whole army , by so contagious an example . Had the rear divisions of the army , which were stopped during the conference mentioned above , been brought up immediately to the support of Sullivan , there is every probability , that the action would have terminated very differently , althouah other causes might have led to a defeat . As things actually turned out , however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first and chief cause of the discomfiture . Judge Johnson writes with a singular misapprehension of the train of events , as they occurred at this stage of the action . lie says , It is true , that on reaching Chew 's house , Sullivan 's column was halted . ' Yet it appears from Colonel Pickering 's letter , that this is not true at all . Sullivan was several hundred yards in advance of the house , and actually engaged with the enemy , before it was known that any such obstacle existed . And what is still more remarkable , we do not find , that the author has anywhere mentioned the circumstance of the flag of truce , or the death of the brave and unfortunate Lieutenant Smith . Historical justice will hardly excuse such an omission . These incidents militate , to be sure , against the new theory , because they could not have occurred without something more than a brief and involuntary ' pause ; yet , we suppose , this would hardly be urged as an apology for passing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having already , as we fear , trespassed unreasonably on the patience of our readers , although several topics have been left untouched . What the author will think of our presumption in questioning his infallibility , or in taking it upon us to point out a few of his mistakes , we can not say ; for he sets himself up very high , quite above the sphere of the common order of writers , shrouding the beams of his countenance in most disastrous eclipse , ' frowning terror upon daring critics , and insisting that he is not to be looked at through the same puny optics , and judgcd by the same rules , as the multi VOL. xxiH. - No. 58. 56 // tudes , who are clambering up the sides of the mountain of fame , on whose summit lie has seated himself with much apparent cornposure . Unfortunately , we have but one set of optics , through which to view the moving l ) anorama of authors , and if he suffers a diminution by the giddy height to which he has lifted himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hinted , it is true , in a certain quarter , that the dignity of the Supreme Federal Court ' is likely to be jeoparded , by bringing down a judge from his lofty preeminence , and placing him on the stand of critical investigation , in company with the hackney tribe of scribblers , such as reviewers , poets , essayists , novelists , jinglers of rhyme , oration makers , and the like . The thing does not appear to us in the same light . If a learned judge condescends to write a book , and a great hook too , we hold it to he his duty , so far to imitate the virtues of Job , as to hear patiently the inflictions of merciless reviewers . What else are books written for , in these days , but to be reviewed ? Not surely to be read . If our author really thinks so , we beg he will forthwith consult his publisher , and see how the supply , in the case of his own work , has corresponded with the demand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect . We should be the last to speak lightly of dignities , though we do not believe in the divine right of kings , of bishops , or of judges . But the dignity we reverence is that of conduct and character . We consider true dignity to consist in a correct deportment , respect for others , and an upright discharge of duty , in whatever station a person may be placed by Providence . This is the whole amount of dignity . Hence it by no means follows , that he is the most dignified man , who sits in the highest . place , any more than he who writes the largest book , or makes the longest speech to the empty seats in Congress ball . in short , there is no connexion between true dignity and station . Particular systems of action are adapted to particular stations , and all that dignity demands is , that these systems be properly applied . He , who misapplies these , is undignified . So a judge may be very dignified , when clothed in his robes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features ; but let him dress himself in a cap and bells or act the harlequin in the halls of justice , and the dignity of the judge will be no longer seen . The crier of the court may sustain all suitable dignity , while sitting in the crier 's box , but place him on the bench , and he will be instantly transformed into another kind of personage . From these hints // we infer , that dignity is not confined to particular professions , nor classes of persons , not even to judges of the Supreme Court , although we are willing to confess , that when this body is convened , we know not a more imposing spectacle . Yet we maintain , that all dignity is not centered there , but much of it is to be found in other parts of the community ; and even we , humble reviewers as we are , have the vanity to believe , that we have our share of dignity to uphold . In this respect , presumptuous as it may seem , we assert the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a level with the writer of the Life of Greene , ' not by going up to the top of the hill where he sits , but by supposing him to have come down , for a short space , into the little valley where we dwell . Or , to speak more i la militaire , we meet him on the common ground of authors , a ground on which he has chosen to enter the lists , and where he has no right to look for any other than equals . Tbe dignity of the craft , and not of the Supreme Federal Court , ' is here to be regarded ; and if the author of the Life of Greene ' thinks that we , as a portion of the brotherhood , have not had this dignity sufficiently before our eyes , in what we bave said of his work , we have only to entreat , upon the principles of equal justice , that he will cast back half an eye over the wanderings of his own pen , and then judge whether our dignity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the severer contusions . There is a maxim in the books , lex a ? quitate gaudet . It may here he reduced to practice . We thought to subjoin a few observations on the general merits of the Life of Greene ' as a work of history , but perhaps an opinion sufficiently accurate can be formed , on this point , from what has already been said . One remarkable fault , however , and one which , in our view , renders the book of almost no value , as a work of reference , we shall here mention a second time ; we mean the total absence of authorities . The new description of the battle of Germantown , which we have seen to he so full of errors , is given without reference to a sin*ie authority in the work itself . There can be no greater defect than this in a history , in which many new facts are professedly brought out , and new opinions advanced . The chief value of a written history is in its trutb , and next , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this objection strongly , and the author 's reply is not less remarkable for its brevity , than its courteousness . He affirms , that the objection is not worthy of // the most common understanding , ' and that lie had done enough to state generally in his Introduction the ork*in of his materials . in this we differ from him toto cwlo . But the strongest thing of all is yet to come . Says this accommodating historian , who carries himself so suariter in modo and fortiter in re , any one , who had approached me in the attitude of a gentleman , might have satisfied his curiosity , or more l'udable feelings , hy a private inquiry . ' What an immense facility is here offered to the student All historical authority is hereafter to be settled , and all doubts cleared up , b ) r a private correspondence with the author , whether he live ten or ten thousand miles off , in the present or a past age . No more notes of reference are wanted , no more consulting of hooks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence with all the world , a living commentator , never to die , never to he weary of his great and varied vocation . No future Brodies or Lingards shall sharpen their pens , to assail the historical veracity of our author ; a private inquiry , provided it he made in the attitude of a gentleman , ' shall open the portals of knowledge , remove suspicion , and silence skepticism.
