Pettyfog . Dandicule . Pushwell . Main text Scene Pettyfog . Pettifog The plates removed , three full decanters stand , With rival wines , each from a foreign land ; And taper glasses wait at each right hand . Meanwhile , my friends , two fine accomplished beaus Alternate song with mutual fires propose . Dandicule . Dandicule Let Pettyfog decide ; for he has read , What lawyers , judges , and reporters said ; And all law 's winding labyrinths he knows ; When law have these ; when equity have those ; And when the frightened client will agree , To prop his cause by paying double fee . And still , to give our wits a keener edge , The victor bard shall win a forfeit pledge . Be mine this massy watch , and chain of gold , By Paxton made , and scarcely six months old ; With curious art contrived the time to tell , In silver sounds , from tinkling , tiny bell ; And still so true , that by it Cleanwatch found , The lazy earth too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen wit needs not a whetted edge , I meet the challenge , and accept the pledge . Be mine this quizzing glass , by Clelia worn , And from her breast by this rash right hand torn ; When late I strove , to snatch a forfeit kiss ; While she , with covering hands , still barred my bliss ' Till , struggling free , she fled , and left me this . Its power , to aid the curious gazer 's eye , And bring one 's nearest neighbour still more nigh ; With easy , graseful , astronomic stare , To lend a charm to e'en the fairest fair ; Its golden chasing , set around with pearl , And wrought with her own cypher 's turning curl ; Its massy chain , which , but the other day , An ample pawn for thirty guineas lay ; All these in this their mingling worth combine ; And make , at least , an answering pledge to thine . Dandicule . Dandicule Modern bards , like bards of old , Still confess the power of gold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it points the warrior 's arm . Still the senseless , and the sage , Men of every clime , and age , Blushing maids , and hoydens bold , Yield alike the palm to Gold . Pushwell . Pushwell Gold , ' t is true , was once the rage ; But , ' t was in a golden age . Brass is all the fashion now ; For ' twill shine on any brow . Brass will hide the silly red , O'er the conscious forehead spread ; Brass will every stain disguise . ' T is by brass that great men rise . And each dull , conceited ass Seeks , nor needs a better pass , Than a sturdy front of brass . Dandicule . Dandicule See , at Miser Griptight 's gate , How the coach-borne gentles wait . See , as you will see to-morrow , When you go yourself , to borrow , How they 'll bow , and fawn , and cringe ; ' Till on rusty creaking hinge , Opes again the iron chest , Where his hoarded treasures rest . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prize is in their power ; Then their proud , majestic gait , Fearless look , and brow elate ; And own , that honor , place , and fame , And all the homage , great ones claim , Like their vote , is bought , and sold With old Miser Griptight 's Gold . Pushwell . Pushwell Hear the brainless demagogue From a stump , or rotten log , On the next election day , Like another jackass , bray . See the gaping , idiot crowd , ( While the numskull , bawling loud , Up and down the gamut goes , Like a man with stopt-up nose , ) Thickly clustering , round him hang , Charmed by his nasal twang , As , ' t is said in days of yore , Wiser brutes did once before ; When with the trees they ran to admire The music of the Orphean Lyre . See him next , profoundly great , Seated at the helm of state ; Where his empty , brazen air , Goes for genius , thought , and care . Hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good , the wise . And own , that nothing can surpass The innate strength of native brass . Dandicule . Dandicule See the poor , industrious man , Who , though under fortune 's ban , Still preserves a stainless mind . See him , shunned of all his kind , Just , as though they feared to catch Want contagious , of the wretch . While the man of wealth and crime Hears their flattery 's cuckoo chime . Though his hand , unshrinking , tore The poor orphan 's little store . Though , to swell his useless heaps , Many a houseless widow weeps . See all this ; and you must own , That , to reach Distinction 's throne , Golden keys the path unbar ; That her easiest , swiftest car Up and down the world is rolled , On little truckle wheels of Gold . Pushwell . Pushwell See , how modest merit lies , All unmarked by common eyes ; Like the rich gem of the mine , Thrown before the stupid swine . See the mind , whose giant grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth , in vain ; While some fool , with shallow brain , Mount the car , and takes the rein . See all this , and then confess , That , in this age of brazenness , Worth itself , ere it can pass , Must be plated o'er with brass . Dandicule . Dandicule See Miss Dumbey , come from school ; Just a little simpering fool ; Who knows not what to say , or do ; Or , if the sky be red , or blue ; Yet , whose negroes and plantation , Stand in stead of animation . See the young men , making at her ; See them bowing ; hear them flatter ; Praise her eyes , her ears , her nose , Knuckles , fingers , thumbs , and toes . Sighing at each several feature . Oh ! the little , heavenly creature . See the little ninny caught . See her worthless husband bought . See all this , and own at once , That wits , and sages , fop , and dunce , Like market pigs are bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pushwell . Pushwell See Miss Brazen , who cant bear , Covered breasts , and shading hair . See her , with unshrinking glance , Staring round her in the dance ; Though , for comfort , and for ease , And to catch the cooling breeze , She has doffed her useless dress , Like poor Truth , to nakedness . See her favours proudly sported ; See her sought , caressed , and courted ; Just because she will , and can Stare down any mortal man . See all this , and learn , what bait Surest catches small and great . See all this ; and vanquished , own That ' t is brass , and brass alone . Dandicule . Dandicule Gold has made me what , I am . All the rest is but a flam . The same voters , who support me ; The same friends , who puff , and court me ; Do , what they had never done , Had I been a poor man 's son . But my good old father , knowing , How the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me clear , Forty thousand every year . And now , though my ideas flow As I confess , somewhat too slow , No one calls me dull , or heavy . Still I lead the brightest bevy ; Still am called through all the city , Easy , learned , and brave and witty , Which is just as good to me , As though it were reality . Cease then ; cease thy impious song . Own that thou wert in the wrong , Thus to brave a power divine . And , for penance at her shrine , Still with pious care attend , Some rich , strapping better half , Making thee a golden calf . Pushwell . Pushwell But for brass , what had I been ? And what a thousand other men ? Plain , honest fools , condemned to toil , And earn our living from the soil . But , thanks to my old mother 's care , I never earned a mouthful there . Warned by a strange , mysterious dream . She sought a certain western stream , Whose waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , who lave ; A brazen charm , from which Truth 's lance , And Shame 's keen arrows harmless glance . There , where mothers souse their billies , As the Greek one did Achilles , Mine soused me , all , but the heel ; The only place , where I can feel One lingering spot of diffidence ; And I have been at some expense , With brass heeled boots stout , firm , and stable , Still to be invulnerable . Cease then ; cease thy song to wage , ' Gainst the genius of the age . And oh ! thou brazen deity , Still propitious be to me . I ask thee not for worth , or sense . Grant me only impudence , Grant me that unfailing pass , A shame-proof mail of sturdy brass . Pettifog . Pettifog Enough ; enough . I know not which to praise . You sing as much alike , as two blue jays . And Phoebus ' self , were he to judge the strain , Would find e'en his discrimination vain . Let each take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pewter medal to the other . Back matter FINIS .
