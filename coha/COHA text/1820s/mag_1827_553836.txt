Edinburgh . 1825. 2. . dn Essay on the Circumstances which determine the Rate *f Wages and the Condition of the Laboring Class . By J. R. M'CULLOCH . Edinburgh . 1826 . MR rVI'CULLoCH seems to be at present one of the most active laborers in the vineyard of political economy ; and if the value of work be estimated by the quantity of it turned out in a given time , he must certainly be considered as belonging to the productive class . Beside the two treatises named above , he has published , within a few years , a formal essay on the rise and progress of his favorite science , and is now , we believe , preparing for the press a Dictionary of Political Economy and a new edition of the Wealth of Nations , ' with extensive comrnentaries by himself ; having in the mean time contributed largely to the weekly and quarterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . Mr M'Culloeh therefore // not only advises people to work , but sets them the example ; and affords a remarkable instance of that noble q* ) *o7rovia ' which he yet , somewhat inconsistently , and , as we think , erroneously , denies to be natural to man . It is also but just to him to add , as we shall have occasion to question some of hi* opinions , that his labors have been crowned in the mother country with a good degree of success . His name is often mentioned with approbation in the most respectable literary journals , and his opinion has been appealed to by the committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the state of Ireland , as a high authority on economical subjects . His writings are also not unknown on this side of the Atlantic . Some of them have been republished at New York , and we believe made the text book of a course of lectures delivered by one of the professors at the college in that city . Such being the estimation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought it our duty , as we have the misfortune to differ from him in some particulars , to submit the views we entertain upon these points to the consideration of our readers , who will decide in their wisdom upon the weight of our objections and the merits of the case . In doing this , however , we wish to be understood as entertaining a high respect for the talents and labors of Mr M'Cul* loch , although we are not satisfied with all the theories that appear in his works . He is evidently a person of intelligence , industry , and the best intentions ; and it is a proof of no inconsiderable talent to be able to attract the attention of the British public as much as be has done by dissertations on a subject , in itself rather abstract than popular . But while we ren ( ler full justice to his real merits , we are bound to add , that we do not recognise in his writings any distinct traces of original thought . As far as we are acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advancement of it , we can only regard him as an expounder of doctrines previously proposed by others . The basis of his work is the Wealth of Nations , ' which he often quotes verbatim for several pages in succession , and of which he borrows at other times the language and illustrations as well as the principles . He also adopts with little or no modification the theories of Malthus on popula-* tion and rent , of Say on production , and of Ricardo on profits* giving , as in the case of Smith , full credit to their respective authors , and employing at times to a considerable extent , their *roj* XXTh-NO. 5 ( 3. 1 5 // own words . We do not undertake to say , that he has added absolutely nothing of his own in the way of illustration or explanation of the opinions of his masters ; bu the n exv suggestions , which he offers , are not , as far as we have noticed them , of a kind to affect leading l ) rinciples , or to alter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His work must therefore be viewed , merely as an abridgment or summary of the doctrines now taught in what has sometimes been called the New School of Political Economy . He originally prepared it for publication in the Supplement of the Encyclop*dia Britannica , ' where the substance of it appeared under the title of Political Economy . It has since been reprinted separately and in its present enlarged form . The tract on Wages is little more than an extrc*ct from the principal work of such passages as relate to that subject . The Dictionary , and the new edition of Adam Smith , have not yet reached us . The discourse on the Rise and Pro*ress of the science is a fuller developement of the introductory chapter of the work before us , which may therefore be viewed as a complete exposition of the author 's opinions . The only merit , which can well belong to a compiler , is that of stating clearly and correctly the facts and principles which he undertakes to republish ; and to this Mr M'Culloch is , we think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective writers from whom he copies in the manner in which they were understood by them ; and recapitulates them in a correct and perspicuous style . If there be any fault in his manner , it is an occasional slight air of dogmatism , which is perhaps most remarkable in the passages that treat of doubtful points , where it is of course least becoming . But this error , if real , is not unnatural . When a writer has full confidence in the strength of his argument , he permits it to speak for itself ; and it is in general when he feels himself pressed , that he is tempted to eke out his logic by round assertions . There is in various parts of the work what appears to us great looseness of reasoning ; but for this Mr M'Culloch is not in general responsible , as he borrows for the most part the arguments and illustrations , as well as the doctrines of his masters . In the few instances in which he draws conclusions himself from the premises stated by them , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfactory . Berore we proceed to examine the reading principles of the system , we shall select one or two // passages of this latter class as specimens of the power of think .. ing that belongs to the author . It is a fundamental tenet in the doctrines of this new school , that the wages paid to a laborer are naturally the smallest sum which will enable him to support himself , and a family large enough to keep the supply of labor already in the market at the same point . If , as these gentlemen learnedly argue , he were to bring up more children than are necessary for this purpose , the number of laborers would increase , the market would be overstocked with labor , and the price of the article , that is , wages , would fall . If , on the contrary , he were to bring up fewer children , the number of laborers would diminish , the market for labor would be understocked , and wages would rise . Hence hy a perpetual oscillation between these two extremes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are just sufficient to support the laborer and his wife , and to bring into market another laborer and another laborer 's wife , to take in due time the places of the former . Such is the theory on this subject . We shall endeavor to show hereafter , that , although sanctioned by the high authoEity of Adam Smith , it is radically erroneous . But assuming it for the present as true , let us see how far it tallies with other parts of our author 's system . The above explanation of the rate of wages being admitted , the question of course arises , in what manner the laborer and his family are to be supported . They can receive as wages just as much as is necessary for their maintenance , and no more . But it will evidently make a great difference in their expenses , whether they live on turkey stuffed with truffles and Champaign wine , or on rice and molasses ; whether like the English peasantry they feed on beef , bread , and beer , or like the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions might cost them ten dollars a day , and in the last perhaps not as many cents . Which , therefore , of these , or any other possible modes of subsistence , is to regulate the rate of the laborer 's wages ? The answer of Mr M'Culloch is , that the mode in which the laboring classes live , is determined by the custom of the country . If it be the custom4 as in England , for them to live on bread , beef , and beer , each individual will naturally conform to it , and his employers will be obliged to give him wages enough to enable him to do so . If , on the contrary , the custom of the country authorize , as in Ireland , // buttermilk and potatoes , each individual will be obliged to follow it , and will not be able to obtain from his employer wages enough to procure anything better . Admitting this part of the theory to be also correct , it is evidently of great importance , as is justly argued by our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ; to eat bread and beef rather than potatoes , and to drink beer or xvine , or , we may add , cider , rather than water , since it is only by keeping up the custom of living well that wages can be kept up so high as to furnish the means of good livihg . If the standard of wages falls , it falls never to rise again , and the laborer 's comfort falls with it . The general exhortation , therefore , given by these philosophers to the industrious classes is , Live as well as you can ; eat , drink , and wear the best you can get ; you can not possibly receive more wages than will defray your expenses according to the mode of living , to which you are accustomed ; if you accustom yourselves to live well , your Xages will enable you to live well ; if you accustom yourselves to live meanly , you will get no more than the anmoi*nt required for living meanly ; therefore , once more , by all means live well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply of the honest laborer , who has generally sense enough to *rcfer a beef steak to a boiled potatoe , if he can get one as cheap as the other . But what follows ? We turn over a few pages , and our liberal philosopher of the new school sings another tune . XVe come now upon the old story of retrenchment and economy . Friendly societies are excellent things ; saving banks are still better ; therefore by all means lay aside a part of your wages , and put it into the saving banks , or the fund of the friendly society , that you may have a little hoard a galost old age and infirmity . ' This again sounds well , and agrees sufficiently with the wisdom of ages , and the dictates of p lain common sense . But how does it agree with what goes f efore , and with the wisdom of the new school ? Wages are always by necessity , according to this theory , just at the point , where they furnish the means of living according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economize a part of his wages , in order to put them into the saving bank , he can only do it by living below the customary standard . This may have its advantages , but bow will he contrive to live below the common standard and above it at the same time ? He can not both have his cake and eat it . If he spend his wages he can not // put them in the bank ; if he put them in the bank he can not live well , and will have no wages either to spend or spare . What consistency is there in advising him in the same breath , first to consume his wages , and then to hoard them ? But this latter counsel is not only inconsistent with the theory of these gentlemen , but on their principles can not possibly be executed . if the laborer economize he must fare worse ; and this advice being general , if the laborers in general conform to it , they all fare worse ; and the standard of living falls . Wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the laborer in consequence of his economy now receives only just enough to enable him to defray the expense of his reduced mode of living . How then can he accumulate or make deposits ? If his wages be high , he can by living meanly diminish them , but all his economy can do no more . It can not possibly put a dollar into his chest , or into that of the saving hank . If he have imprudently reduced himself from bread and beef to potatoes , in order to lay up some provision for his old age , he will obtain no reward for his foresight but the satisfaction of living on potatoes all the rest of his life , without securing the provision he wanted ; for no sooner has he brought himself and his wages down to the potatoe standard , than he loses the power of economizing at all , his earnings being now barely sufficient to support life . Economy , as well as charity , is therefore a word that has no place in this reformed vocabulary of moral science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hoard his wages , not only advise him to do precisely what they have just before advised him not to do , hut what they have also proved to him to their own satisfaction , that no man in his situation possibly can do . Such advice we consider both inconsistent and unreasonable . On the system of the new school , the whole class of laborers may be regarded figuratively as clinging to the sides of a rocky precipice , overhanging the bottomless gulf of starvation . Into this their children above a certain number , by the kind laws of an overruling Providence , regularly fall . The rest with their narents sustain themselves painfully upon two or three projecting ledges , of which the upper ones correspond with a bread and beef diet , and the lower with a potatoe one . If a laborer habitually occupy lread arid beef , and be accidentally pushed off , he alights on potatoes and avoids the gulf . If he habitually occupy potatoes , and meet with the same accident , // there is no salvation for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the doctrine of these gentlemen , and in consequence of it their first and very natural advice to the laborer to adhere firmly to bread and beef . With what appearance of consistency or humanity , then , can they afterwards turn round upon him , and exhort him to descend from bread and beef ( without which he can not possibly even attempt to economize ) , and take a per ; nanent post on potatoes ? If Mr M'Culloch can furnish us with a satisfactory reply to this query , we shall cheerfully give him credit for more ingenuity than he has exhibited in any passage of his works , with which we are acquninted . The liberal exhortation to live well and spend all his wages , ivhicli is addressed to the laborer by Mr M'Culloch in the first instance , is , as we have said , naturally dictated by his theory on the subject of wages . The system furnishes , however , an additional motive of a different kind for giving this advice ; and if we look a little more nearly into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not to reconcile , the inconsistency alluded to above . Mr M'Culloch exhorts the laborer to live well , evidently for the purpose of preventing him from marrying , and having carried this point , he then exhorts him to live poorly , and economize , in order to prevent him from becoming a burden upon the community , when disabled by old age or accident . Marriage and the poor laws are , as is well known , the two great bugbears of the new economical school . Our ancestors , simple souls , thought it a vastly fine thing to promote marriage ; but like the man in Molk*re who had reformed the position of the great vital organs , . N'ous avons change tout cela . Our readers are not so ignorant as to require to be told , that it is considered at present the great object of political economy to bring about a state of things , in which there shall be the fewest possible marriages , and to each marriage the fewest possible children . Since the publication of the work of Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are continually beset with the apprehension of being eaten out of house and home by a hungry population , which , as they say , is pressing hard everywhere against the limits of the means of subsistence . In vain you tell them that there is no appearance that the earth , or any part of it , is , or ever was , or will be overpeopled ; that if we *lance over the surface of cast a b the lobe , from Kamtschatka westerly till we come back again to // the other side of Behring 's straits , we find nothing but immense tracts of uncultivated land , with the exception of some half dozen small spots , which are precisely those where provisions are most abundant ; that the population of the earth is not greater than it was two or three thousand years ago , and will probably not he greater two or three thousand years hence than it is now . All this gives them no satisfaction , and they still insist , that the earth , and every part of it , always has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary result of the laws of Nature , encumbered with an excess of inhabitants ; and that every new marriage , and every birth occasioned by such marriage . has the effect of making had worse . Under the influence of these terrors , they are constantly exerting their eloquence to discourage people from marrying . To the higher classes they hold out the prospects of easier circumstances , greater consideration , and a more rapid pro6ress in the career of professional or political advancement , which they say , are among the advantages of celibacy . They quote with approbation the opinion of a gallant Scotch general , who in his youth abandoned hi* mistress to go to the wars and acquire military glory ; Ambition , I said , would soon cure me of love ; ' and they remember to forget to add the recantation in the same song ; Ah ! what had my youth with ambition to do ? Why left I Aminta ? why broke I my vow ? ' To the laboring classes , who have no pretensions to political advancement or military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more substantial diet . When the Hercules of humble life is to make his choice , they paint to him vice and poverty in the form of a young wife and a dish of potatoes , while virtue and success are depicted under the seducing image of celibacy , and a smoking beef steak properly garnished with bread and porter . Beware what you do , ' they say ; the moment is critical . If you marry young , you will inevitably have more children than you will be able to maintain , your *vages will not support you as you have been accustomed to live , and you will be compelled to drag out a miserable existence on poor potatoe diet ; while if you will consent to live single , you may revel all your life en beef and beer . ' Thus placed , like th' long eared animal , between his two bundles of // hay , our laborer , we will suppose , in a hungry moment de-* cides for celibacy , bids adieu to fair eyes and tempting looks* and fixes his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now comes the hardest part of the case . No sooner has the disinterested and liberal monitor carried this point , than the scene shifts at once . He flourishes his l ) en , more potent than the wand of the famous Dr Snatchaway , sometime court physician of the island of Barataria , and lo ! the pretty young wife disappears  --  the steak goes off in its own smokeand our prudent laborer , recovering from his day dreams , finds himself clinging as before to the fatal precipice , with a lonely potatoc before him , and the gulf of starvation yawning under his feet . After exercising every species of moral restraint and prudence-after sacrificing his future spouse to a mess of pot. * tage , and then the mess of pottage to the hopes of a provision for old age or accident , he sees himself fixed precisely in the worst l ) osition in which he could ever have been placed , without exercising any prudence at all-no provision for old ageno food for life but potatoes  --  and not even the satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well address him with the poet , Poor moralist ! and what art thou ? A solitary fly ! Thy joys no glittering female meets , Thou l*ast no hive of hoarded sweets* No painted pinmage to display ; On hasty wings thy youth is flown , Thy sun is set-thy spring is gone . ' Now we say , that to reduce a poor man to this situation , under pretence of teaching him how to better his condition , is not dealing fairly with him , and that Frolic while t is . Aiay , ' is the only philosophy consistent with the doctrines of the new school . We shall see hereafter that the whole theory is without foundation , and that an honest , industrious , and temperate laborer ( bating accidents , which may happen to great as well as small ) may always earn enough not only to support his family in a comfortable manner , but to lay aside a hoard against old age . But be that as it may , the strange inconsistency of advising a man to live single in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to economize out of his wages-which on this theory must necessarily force him to live meanly , without enabling him to lay up anything after all-is sufficiently obvious . Such // reasoning , we repeat , appears to us extremely loose , and we can not but notice it as a specimen of that defect in the work of Mr M'Culloch . A strong aversion to the poor laws is , as we have already intimated , another favorite tenet with the writers of this new economical school . A public provision for the disabled members of society has no other effect , they say , than to create the very wretchedness , which it afterwards imperfectly relieves , without in any way diminishing the amount which would otherwise exist . Private charity is less mischievous , because it operates less systematically and extensively , but in principle and as far as it goes it is no better . Therefore steel your heart , and shut your hands . Let the poor laws be repealed without delay , and let it be understood , that the supposed right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is wholly inadmissible . Such doctriiies , like the antimatrirnonial system which we have just been considerin are so completely abhorrent from all common notions and common feelingsfrom the text and spirit of Scripture  --  the traditions of the fathers , and the universal consent and practice of ' all nations and a * es , that we hardly know in what manner to treat them . One is tempted to think , that the writers who support these monstrous paradoxes can not be really serious , and that they are imposing upon the public a sort of melancholy humbug . At all events , their language addressed to a civilized and christian community carries its own refutation with it . When we are told , that we are no longer to perform the duties of charity , public and private , because of this or that discovery in political economy , we may well answer , without examining at all the value of the supposed new lights , that our own hearts ( to say nothing of Scripture ) furnish us with stronger evidence of the reality of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any metal ) hysical theory . If then the new system be at variance with our strongest natural sentiments , and the conduct they prescribe , it follows not that these sentiments are of injurious tendency , and this conduct immoral , but that the system is false , were it even impossible to detect the least logical flaw in the argument . This , however , is so far from being the case here , that the argument in support of this theory is as singularly flimsy , as the theory itself is unnatural and inhuman . But waving this point for the present , let us advert for a moment to the manner in which this view , of the operation of // the poor laws coincides with the urgent advice given to the laborer to invest a part of his wages in saving banks and friendly societies . If the new school system were true , the laborer , as we have seen , could not possibly follow this advice , and the consequences , if he could , would be directly ruinous to him by reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing the reverse , we could venture to inquire of Mr M'Culloch why the operatioii of friendly societies and saving banks should be a whit more favorable , than that of the poor laws ? Are they not all so many different modes of relieving the distressed out of a common fund provided for the purpose ? Are not friendly societies communities instituted for the express object of making public provision for the poor ? Is not the general community , of which we are all members , a great friendly society , established for the very same among other ends , and bound ( notwithstanding the contrary opinion of Mr Malthus , Mr M'Culloch , and the rest of the new lights ) , bound in duty to provide for its poor , as much as to defend the common territory from foreign violence , or to administer justice between man and man ? How then , we repeat , can the operation of things substantially the same be essentially different ? It may be said , that admitting the principles to be the same in both cases , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their results may on that account vary considerably . This no doubt is true ; but why are we to suppose without proof that all the variation will be in favor of the friendly societies and against the poor laws ? The latter , it is said , may be badly digested , or badly executed . What then ? Are all the friendly societies and saving banks perfect systems and perfeetly administered ? Mr M'Culloch himself assures us , on the contrary , that there are great defects , theoretical and practical , in the best of them . Is it probable , in fact , that every little knot of laborers , who may associate for such a purpose , will exercise more wisdom than the government of the country ? In general not , it may be answeredbut under corrupt political systems , like many of those that now exist in Europe , it may be safer for a few families , who know and can trust each other , to confide wholly in their own foresight , rather than place any dependence on a heartless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going *s far as the stoutest whig or radical in England ( and tlIe philos // ophers of the new school belong mostly to one or the other of these parties ) need to desire . Grant that the poor laws must be badly administered , because the government is corrupt and bad . What follows ? Not that we are to supersede the action of the government by establishing a thousand little i*peria rn perio to do its work , but that the government itself requires to be reformed . Instead of wasting labor , time , and money , in doing yourselves what you have already paid the government to do for you-if the machine be really incapable of going through its functions , set to work manfully and repair it where it needs alteration . When this shall have been done , the poor laws and every other part of the system will of course be properly executed . To attempt to remedy the evil by private associations is in no degree more reasonable , than it would be to pro* vide in the same manner for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Remark , too , the singularly heavy burdens , which these private associations impose upon the laboring classes . The latter have already contributed their share to the common fund of the state , out of which they have a right ( pace . Malthusii ) to be relieved in their distresses . They are now called upon to make a second contribution out of their moderate earnings ( which , on the principles of the new school , can never be more than just enough to support them ) for the same purpose . Their situation is therefore in this respect the same with that of the English Dissenters and Catholics , who pay tithes to the established Church , and maintain their own clergy besides . When the laborers depend , as the other hand , on the poor laws for relief in their distresses , they are in fact relieved , as they ought to be , by the rich . They pay , it is true , their proportion of the public taxes ; but these taxes fall principally upon the wealthier classes , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , contribute almost nothing to the fund that affords it . This is precisely as it should be ; while , on the other hand , the plan of taxing the poor exclusively for this purpose , as is done by the friendly societies , is unjust , and that of taxing them doubly , as is done by the union of the two systems , is doubly so . We make these remarks for the purpose of pointing out the glaring inconsistency between the opinions of Mr M'Culloch on the merits of the two systems . if his theory be true , the poor laws are no doubt mischievous , but on the same principles , friendly societies are equally and doubly so . For ourselves // we have no hostility to these societies , and no objectioo to see them introduced into the United States , although we believe them to be unnecessary under a good government and a jU ( liCiouS and well administered code of poor laws . According to our view of the general condition of the laboring classes , neither poor laws nor friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encoura or I-es * , ge popuiation ( C* ) iS wages . rrhe operation of both we consider fitvorable , and we believe that they may very properly and usefully come in aid of each other . On the theory of the new school , they both tend directly to reduce the wages and of course the comforts of the laborer , without producing in either case the least countervailing advantage . In order to be consistent , these writers should denounce both alike ; and we can not but notice the different manner in which they treat the two , as another specimen of a singularly loose way of reasoning , even admitting the premises on which they wish to proceed . The tone of apparent indifference , if not actual self satisfaction , with which these *entlemen announce their supposed dis-a coveries , which , if real , xvould be fatal to all the hopes and I ) rospects of society , and which shock , at first blush , every sentiment of natural humanity , is truly painful . We believe them to be perfectly sincere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provnub*ation of their theories as a service to the public . In decrying matrimony and charity they suppose themselves to be tearing off the mask from a pair of beautiful syrens , who would decoy us to our ruin . We respect their intentions , their characters , and their talents ; for it proves talent rather than the want of it to invent and sustain an ingealous paradox , however unsubstantial . We will even go further , and admit , without hesitation , our belief , that if such a entlenmen as Mr Malthus , Mr M'Culloch , Mr Brougham , and others , who hold these opinions , and who have shown themselves on many occasions the enlightened and generous benefactors of their country and the world , were called upon to act in the interest of the laboring classes , even in regard to these particular subjects , they would prove their hearts to be surer guides respecting them than their heads . With all this , or rather partly in consequence of this , we can not read without pain such a paragraph as the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge manifested upon this subject Wages and the Poor Laws in the House of Commons since 1796 , // has happily not been small , as may be seen by contrasting the late report of the committee on the poor laws , and the following sentiments of Mr Pitt in that year . Let us , " said he , " make relief in cases where there are a nuninber of children a matter of right and honor , instead of a tzrounl of opprobrium and contempt . This will make a large family a blessing and not a curse ; and this will draw a proper line of distinction between those who are able to provide for themselves by their labor , and those who , after having enriched their country with a number of children , have a claim upon its assistance . " * in Plain English , what is the amount of the first of the two J ) reeedin* paragraphs ? The House of Commons have happily discovered , since 1796 , that the poor , of whom there will be always more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there is no possibility of giving them any real aid , either by public or private charity . Now is this discovery , supposing it to be real , a happy one ? Is it a thing to thank God upon ? Is it not rather , as the poet Campbell says of the imaginary discoveries of the atheist , one which its author should weep to record ? " Would Mr Ricardo have thought it decent to say , that the House of Commons had happily discovered that the horrors of the slave trade were irremediable ,  --  that the late famine in ireland was beyond the reach of any human palliation ,  --  that the present distress of the British manufacturers is incurable except by death ? In these cases , as in the one in question , the discovery ( always supposing it real ) might have the effect of preventing a waste of labor upon injudicious projects of charity , and might thus far be a positive advantage ; but to call it happy would be thought something worse than mockery . How much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr Pitt , quoted as above by Mr Ricardo in terms of reprobation ! We can not agree with this illustrious statesman in believing , as lie appears to have done , that a family of children would naturally among the poorer classes , bring with it a necessity of recurring to the charity of the public ; but we heartily approve the tone of thought and feeling displayed in his remarks . We can not but repeat , that the continual opposition to the dictates of common sense and humanity , into which the partisans of the new economical school are led by their peculiar doctrines , is , in our // opinion , independently of any other objection , a conclusive refutation of the whole theory . It is time , however , to leave these preliminary points , and proceed to those which it is our present principal object to consider . We have dwelt longer on the preceding topics than we should otherwise have done , because , while they show the inaccuracy of the reasoning of these writers on their own suppositions , they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are intimately connected , and which we now propose to examine in the cursory manner which suits the compass of an article like this . The great problem in Political Economy , as is justly observed by Ricardo in the introduction to his work , is to discover the manner in which the wealth of a community naturally distributes itself among its members . And supposing the latter , economically viewed , to consist of the three great classes of landholders , capitalists , and laborers , ( a distinction , which , however , is rather formal than substantial , hut which may be assumed without occasioning error for the present purpose , ) the problem takes the more distinct shape of an inquiry into the amount of the shares , that respectively fall to each of these classes , out of the products resulting immediately from the labor of the last . The immense importance of this inquiry is sufficiently obvious ; for according to the different answers which may be given to it , the whole science of Political Economy , and with it that of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assume a different aspect . If the laborers , that is the mass of the people , can never , in any country , or by any possibility , enjoy any considerable portion of the fruits of their industry , but are condemned by the standing laws of nature to work incessantly for the profit of others , and can only reserve for themselves the scantiest pittance that will maintain them , and a part of their children ,  --  if this be in fact the case , why then we say that the laborers , that is , the mass of the people , are always and everywhere necessarily abject and wretched , and that it is idle to look for the cause of their degradation in political abuses or private vice . Such is the doctrine of the writers of the new school , who have thus denounced against their fellow men a doom more dreadful than the eldest primal curse , ' inflicted on us through our frail first parents in Paradise . In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , were the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face shall OTHERS eat bread , is the import of the modern philosophy , which thus cancels the beneficial clause of this great covenant , and leaves the onerous condition in full force . The sweat stands as before on the laborer 's brow , but the bread that was to be the fruit of it , is not to be found . O*y*sw&amp; , as Cicero says of a certain sum of money in one of his pleadings . It is taken from the mouth of the laborer and his children , and thrown to the wealthy or their dogs . No matter how industrious , temperate , and active may be the man himself ; no matter how just , mild , and powerful the government that protects him , it is so ordained by the fixed decrees of Providence , that , do what be can , work as hard as he may , he can never receive anything more than a bare subsistence for himself , and a limited number of children ; the rest , if he happen to have more , being foredoomed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the same fate , if they are touched by the slightest breath of mischance . Why , then , if all this be true , talk of political reform or *mprovement ? What means the name of Whig , which is claimed as an honor by most of these philosophers , if the mass of men , under all forms of government and modes of administration , , are equally bondmen , and Helots to a few favored taskmasters ? What matter is it whether the two classes are called capitalists and laborers , or tyrants and tyrants ' slaves ? All substantial melioration of the state of the people is on this supposition impossible ( the pretended palliative of moral restraint being , as we have seen above , a mere mockery ) , and a difference of names is not worth contending for . Such in fact appear to be the conclusions of these writers , and the only ditliculty is to understand why , with such opinions , they should attach themselves to a political party , whose professed object is the im* provement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , we suppose , on the contrary , that the laborer , by the regular operation of the principles that determine the distribution of wealth , receives a fair and equitable portion of his own products , or rather ( the terms being properly explained ) the whole , it will follow , that wherever the mass of the people are debased and wretched , it is owing either to accidental mis- fortune or their own fault , and that the evil is of a nature to admit of palliation to an indefinite extent , if not of complete remedy . The problem in question is therefore undoubtedly the most important and interesting , not only in political econo // my , but in the whole extent of the science of government1 and is one that must be solved in a satisfactory manner , before we can even enter upon the study of politics with a prospect of advantage . However general may be the prejudice at present ( among the few persons who examine these questions in the abstract ) in favor of the strange and desoiating paradoxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show within a short compass , and by arguments drawn from their own writings , the radical error of the system . The basis of it is the theory of Wages , which we have just been considering , and which supposes that the actual laborer can never receive anything more than the smallest pittance which will serve for his support . For a full refutation of this doctrine , we need not look beyond one of the first principles universally admitted by these and all other writers on political economy , as a law of the science . They all agree that no economical enterprise can be carried on , unless it be sufficiently productive to support all the persons engaged in it , replace all the capital invested , and afford in addition the average rate of profit . Any branch of labor , which does not give the returns necessary for this , is overdone , and the capital employed in it is gradually withdrawn and invested in others , until the equilibrium is restored . Such is the doctrine on this subject , which is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incontestably true . Now as the actual laborers are among the persons interested in all economical undertakings , it follows , of course , that they must be supported before a profit can accrue to any body , and it also follows , that they must receive their proportional share of the profit , whatever it may be , that remains , after all expenses and charges are deducted , to be divided among the interested parties . These , we say , are the natural consequences of the principle ; and it is therefore a curious question , how the writers of the new school have been able to deduce from the same premises conclusions diametrically opposite . The wonder ceases when we find that they treat the whole class of laborers as an exception from the general laws regulating the distribution of wealth , which they lay down as applicable to society at large . Noxv it is evidently making a very large allowance to suppose , that a hundred families out of every thousand are landholders or capitalists , the other nine hundred being laborers . But taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . which . when applied to practice* is , b // acknowledgment , false in nine cases for every one in which it *s true . If the system be correct , it is evident that the rule must be laid down the other way ; that the distribution of the products of labor must be represented as naturally unequal , and the cases of the landholders and capitalists ( who are supposed among themselves to share equally ) viewed as exc eptions . But waving this point , which is merely formal , let us examine the grou n ( ls upon which these writers establish their supposed exception a ainst the laborers . Unless this point can be rigorously prove ( l , the general rule applies to these as well as to all other persons , and they stand on precisely the same footing with the landholders and the capitalists . The doctrine in regard to this subject , which has since been developed and insisted on by subsequent writers , was state ( l originally by Adam Smith in his great work on the Wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that noble performance , btit , by a singular sort of fatality , it has of late attracted more attention and approbation than almost any other , and has been made the basis of a pretended reform in the science of Political Economy . Smith himself does not seem to have viewed the principle as a very important one , and at any rate has not sustained it with his usual care and success . We owe it , however , to his high and well deserved authority to consider in detail the arguinentS by which he defends his theory . These are contained in his chapter on the wages of labor. * Vie begins with stating that the natural wages of labor are its products , that before the land is appaopriated and capital accumulated , the whole amount of them belongs to the laboru. ; but that afterwards a great dedtsction takes place , because the landholder and the capitalist come jO for a share . these Ihets are substantially true ; but it does not follow from them by any means , that the laborer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of capital ; nor is it quite correct in form to represent the laborer as giving up a share of the products of his labor to the landholder and capitalist . The three persons bearing these clisracte*s are partners in a common enterprise ; and each receives a share of the products correspon ding with the amount ( Jf his interest in the joint concern . It the laborer , while lie employs the land -  --  - * X*TeIt1i of Nations , ii . I. ch. viii* 17 // and capital of others , were to retain himself the whole product of his work , it would be at the expense of the capitalist and landholder , who would in that case suffer a gross and palpable injustice . While the several interested parties divide fairly the profits of the common concern , each may be said with propricty , as was intimated above , to receive the whole product of his own labor ; nor would the expression be improper as respects the landholder and capitalist , since capital and land , ceonoinically viewed , are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance of all the wealth of nations . The condition of the laborer , instead of being made worse , is greatly improved by this state of things , because the productiveness of labor is much increased by the introduction of niachinery , and the accumulation of capital . lie receives , as before , the whole product of his labor , and this product is eTeater than it would have been had lie worked alone instead ol entering into partnership with the landholder and the capitalist . To say that a mere laborer is not so well off as lie would be , if he were at once landholder , laborer , and capitalist , is as much as to say , that if one man could cultivate the whole earth , and consume all its fruits , he would be as rich and as happy as the whole present human race put together . On this view of the subject , therefore , to which lie nevertheless attaches the principal importance , Dr Smith is evidently mistaken* His other arguments in proof of the same proposition are as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus reduced by the deduction of rent and the profits on capital , are determined by I lie contract made hetween the capitalist and the workmen ; and I/us contract is naturally always to the disadvantage of the latter . ' Why ? The masters , it seems , enjoy greater facilities for combination , and can hold out longer in the dispute about wa* ges with the laborers than the latter . A landholder , a farmer , a master manufacturer , or a merchant , though they did not employ a single workman , could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already ac1uired . Many workmen could not subsist a week ; few could subsist a month , and scarce one a year , without employment . In the long run the xvorkman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him , but the necessity is not so immediate . ' If this reasoning were found in any other work than the Wealth of Nations , ' we should take the liberty of calling it // extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts is evidently erroneous . In a stru*ole l ) etween the capitalist and his workmen , it is clear , that the latter have every advantage . If they can l ) arely contrive to subsist , whether on their previous savings , the bounty of friends and kindred , or chance jOb5 for the day , the xveek , or the month , during which the dispute lasts , they then start afresh with their whole capital ( that is their personal strength and skill ) unimpaired ; and pursue their course as prosperously as if nothing had happened . If the capitalist , on the contrary , suspend his operations for a single day , he is , according to the preselit modes of transacting business , ruined for life . It is he , in reality , who is placed where our new li* hts would fain station the laborer , on the brink of a precipice ; and the gulf of bankruptcy is open for ever under his feet . A ship , we will suppose , arrives from India with a rich cargo which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ) f money . Can the owner now come to his laborers , and tell them that he has just received as much money as he wishes to expend upon himself and his family for ten years to come ,  --  that for that length of time he can do without them ,  --  and that if they will not consent to take half their former *vages , he will discharge them all at once ? We all know the contrary . if he has received a hundred thousand dollars , he has probably notes due for two hundred thousand ; for such is about the usual proportion between the real and fictitious property of our capitalists . He must , then , before he has time to think of his workmen , hurry from bank to bank , pay a note here , renew another with large deductions of interest there , and procee ( l in this way until , by judiciously applying perhaps fifty out of his hundred thousand dollars , he finds himself for the moment tolerably secure . Now at least lie can come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in his iocket . Not at all . His ability to repeat the same operation ninety days hence ( lepends upon his continuing his usual enterprises upon the same , and if possible , an extended scale . He has still not a moment to lose . After flnishin6 with the banks , be must next repair to the wharf , superintend the equipment ot another vessel , ship for india every dollar of his last . fifty thousand that he can possibly spare from his personal expenses , and as maay more as be can contrive to borrow , in order to icceive as soon as may be another cargo ; and instead of being *at liberty to hold an independent language with his workmen . // 132 July , it is for his interest to double their wages , rather than lose their services for a single moment . We mention this state of things not as being absolutely necessary ( for we know that it is possible for a man to trade within his real capital ) , but as what our intelligent readers will recognise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lye think the case is pretty well made out against Smith ; but the real strength of the argument does not lie here . The avenge rate of wages , and of profits , doss not depend at all upon the advantages that may be gained by either party in the accidental disputes between particular workmen and particular capitalists . The regulating principle , as Smith himself affirms , is that of demand and supply , which fixes the avenge value of Jabor , as of every other article . The occasional variations from this standard , that occur in parlicutar coraracts , are like the oscillations of a pendulum , which twist always settle after a short time in its proper perpendicular direction . The wages of labor are determined for the time being by a comparison of die whole amount of labor in the market with the whole amount of the capital applicable to the purchase of it ; and this being the case , it is obvious that competition and combination can have no efFect in raP or depressing the average price . This is also the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pnrortion which the whole cafr Sal bean to the whole amount of the laboring population . " The second position taken by Smith , in defence of the proposition we are considering , is therefore even less tenable if possible , than the former ; and it is really singular , that it should have been satisfactory to his owiC dgment . After giving these reasons for his opinion , that the wages of labor are necessarily the smallest sum upon which the laborer can possibly subsist , Dr Smith proceeds to remark , that wages regularly rise when a community is advancing in wealth , and fall when it is declining . This is natural enough ; and it would seem to be ejually natural , that when a community is in this respect in a stationary state , wages would be stationary also . But this we are told is not the case . The hands would naturally multiply beyond the empleyment . There would be a constant scarcity of employment , and the laborera would be obliged to bid against one mother inordertoget it . *Emay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country the wages of labor had ever been more than sufficient to maintain the laborer , and to enable him to bring up a family , the competition of the laborers and the interests of the masters would soon reduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity . ' Here at least we have the appearance of an argument , although it is not to our minds a convincing one . If it be true , that the laborers naturally multiply in the long run , as Dr Smith has it , beyond the demand or a r , it certainly follows , that the market tim this article will be constantly overstocked , and the price of it regularly depressed below its natural level . Such , as Smith asserts , is in fact the case ; but lie enters into no developement of die proposition , and brings nothing at all in proof of it , excepting a few loose observations on the sitnadon of China . He does not , in truth , appear to attach much importance to the observation , but seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject as lying in the remarks we have considered above , respecting the effect of competition , and the deductions mude from the gross products of labor by the landholder and the capitalist . The authority of Smith can therefore hardly be alleged with propriety , in favor of the doctrine that population naturally multiplies beyond the supply of employment , which he seems to have thrown out without much reflection as a sort of oUter dictum . The remark has since been taken up , illustrated , and as some think demonstrat&amp;l by subsequent writers ; and now forms the basis of the science of Political Economy , as understood and taught in the new schooL Our readers will recopise in it the germ of the theory of Malthus on population , which it will therefore be necessary for us to examine , in order to ascertain the real principles that regulate the rate of wages . The doctrine of Mr M'Culloch resolves itself into the same proposition , which we last quoted from Smith . He begins by statmg , as above , that the rate of wages must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole amount of the laboring population . He then very naturally concludes , that if capital increase in proportion to population , wapes will rise , and the reverse ; and after making some inquiries into the principles , that determine , respectively , the increase of capital and that of population , he finally la**s it down , on the authority of Malthus , as a fundamental law ot nature , that population has a constant tendency to increase beyond the increase of capital , // that is , in the last result , of the means of subsistence . Mr M'Culloch is himself so fully satisfied of the truth of this principle , that he adopts it from the work of Maithus without even thinking it necessary to copy the reasoniug in support of it . It is therefore needless to consider the particular form , in which the theory appears in his hook ; and in the few observations that we shall make upon it , we shall view it as presented by its author . Mr Maithus is in fact the only person who has yet entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the pnhlication of his work , it had been hinted at by various writers ( as for example Dr Smith , in the passage quoted above ) , hut they were generally not aware of its importance ( if true ) to the welfare of the world , and gave it but a small share of attention . Subsequent writers , who have adopted the theory of Malthus , have also in general , like Mr M'Culloch , depended wholly upon his reasoning in sul ) port of it , so that his book still remains the only manual of this new faith . It may appear presumptuous to think of replying in a few pages to an essay which occupies two thick octavos ; but in this , as in other cases , the essential points lie within a small compass , and we shall now attempt to indicate them in a brief , but we hope satisfactory manner . TI te work of Malthus was originally prepared as an answer 10 the visionary scheme of absolute perfectibility , which obtained a temporary vogue at the close of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other writers , undertook to maintain that all the evil we suffer is the effect of bad government , and that if the public affairs could once be properly conducted , vice and misery in all their fearful forms , including disease and death among the number , would disappear entirely , and that we should flourish forever in immortal youth , upon the face of the earth , without of course having any occasion to wish or hope for a better state hereafter . This extravagant system , which has lately been revived by Mr Owen , hardly re ( luires a serious answer . If it did , there would be no difficulty in producing a hundred different ones , metaphysical and physical , each stronger than the rest , and all decisive . Among the number of these possible answers is the one , which appears to have formed the groundwork of the theory of Malthus , namely , that if disease and death , or , in his phraseology , vice and misery did not mow down one after another the generations // of men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overpeopled , and its inhabitants in want of the means of subsistence . This obvious fact furnishes a complete refutation of the system of absolute perfectibility , and although the partisans of that doctrine have made some awkward attempts to evade its force , they have failed entirely , as may well be su ) osed , of refuting it . This principle , we say , appears to have been the germ of the theory of Ilalthus , but as brought out by him it wears a different and far less satisfactory form . After showing that J ) opulation , if not checked by disease and death , would overpeople the earth , and produce a general famine , he goes further , and affirms that population , checked as it is by disease and ( leath , actually does overpeople the earth and produce a general famine . These two propositions , which Mr Malthus strangely enough appears throughout his v*ork to confound with each other , and to consider as in a manner identical , are obviously quite distinct , and very nearly contradictory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposing it to be true , is at first sight paradoxical and contrary to common sense and feeling . Beibre it can be granted , it must therefore be rigorously proved . The single argument advanced by Malthus in sul ) l ) ort of it , when divested of the mathematical arb in which he has chosen to dress it up , is the following . Population has a tendency or capacity to increase very rapidly ; the means of subsistence have a tendency or capacity to increase very slowly ; therefore population actually outruns the means of subsistence , and by its excess produces everywhere ( listress and famine . Noxv we are bold to say , that for an ar6ument which has obtained a pretty extensive currency among enlightened men , this is as questionable a piece of logic as can well be found in the annals of sophistry . The form of the argument is in fact completely vicious , and if the leading propositions were both proved , the conclusion that is drawn from them would not be a whit the more probable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rapidly , and the means of subsistence a capacity to increase only very slowly . Now it does not require all the syllogistic science of the Stagyrite to see , that from possible premises nothing can be inferred but a possible conclusion . If it be possible for population to increase more rapidly than food , why then it is of course possible that men may be reduced to a state of famine* If we wish to know ' // whether they actually are or are not reduced to this state , we must inquire how fast they actually have increascd , or are in* creasing , in proportion to the supply of food , and not how fast they possibly may or might . In the argument of Malthus a possible deficiency of food is made to produce an actual famine . A community in which the inhabitants do not increase at all . and are even diminishing in number , is supposed to be starved by the possibility of doubling its population , under other ciicuinstances , once in twentyfive years . This is very much as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six , and servants in proportion , upon the j ) proceeds of a prize , that he may poss&gt; bly draw in the next lottery ; or that John entertained a select company of friends at dinner last Tuesday upon some larks . that he may possibly catch when the sky shall fall . Such reasoning reminds one of the middle science of the schoolmen , and would perhaps be better treated in the manner of Martinus Scriblerus than by fair and serious argument . the only conclusion that really follows from the famoes comparison of ratios , which forms the basis of the theory of Malthus , is , as we have observed above , that a deficiency of food is physically possible ; a thing well known to all , arid o* no practical importance . It is true that this writer , whose reasoning is throughout extremely wanting in precision , often . shifts his ground , and instead of his first assertion , that popula* tion has a physical capacity to increase very rapidly , substitutes the entirely different one , that population actually does increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food . This new principle , if true , xx ould doubtless establish his conclusion ; but so far is it from being prox ed that Mr Malthus has hardly laid it down for the first time , xx hen lie again xvithdraws it or qualifies it in such a way that it he ids to nothing . After stating in h is first chapter , that populatioa when unchecked , goes en doubling itself every txventyh. * x ( a 1 s , and fu ther in the same paragraph , that papulation con ' / it be supplied with food , xvould go on with unexhianste I vi*oi , lie declares five or six pa*es later , that j ) OpUlatLOn doi . * not pi oceed with unexhausted vigor , but that want of food is never the immediate check to its increase , except in the rare case of actual famine , and that the real immediate checks are ( hiseases or vices resulting from scarcity , and various other causes , morel and physical , entirely independent qft/w Supply of food . lie thins contradicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and afterwards proceeds to illustrate , by an infinity of examples drawn from a general survey of the different parts of the globe , the nature of these moral and physical checks to the increase of population , and the manner and extent of their action . Having in this way proved to his own complete satisIhetion , and that of the reader , that population is nowhere checked by the want of food , and that it still does not increase in general with any great rapi ( lity , and having thus completely reluted his own leading propositions , he very coolly and quietly without the least cttempt to explain the contradiction , returns again to these propositions at the close of his first volume , repeats that population proceeds with unexhausted vigor , when not checked by want of food , and draws his a , reeable conclusion of the necessary existence of a permanent and universal famine . The real source of the erroneous reasoning of this writer , if probed to the bottom , would perhaps be found to lie in a disposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are subject , as indirect results of scarcity . If this were granted , it would follow , that there are no checks to the in. * crease of population , except the consequences ( lirect and indirect of this cause , and the conclusions of Malthus would in fact be true . This l ) osition is , however , quite untenable , and Mi Malthus , who is perfectly honest through the whole of his work , is occasionally led by the course of his reflections to feel that it is so , and in such cases readily admits for the moment , as in the passage above quoted , that there are various moral and physical checks to the increase of population , wholly indepe'n* dent of the supply of food . After candidly making these con* cessions he soon , however , appears to forget them , and returns to a course of argument which 5H**O5C5 the opposite opinion* But whatever may have been the source of his mistake , it appears that the ori9ual premises which are employed in his argument , and which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he occasionally substitutes ibr them , and which if proved , would establish his conclusions mc not only not proved , but are amply refuted by himself his conclusions are , therefore , wholly groundless , and the e of course , no reason for supposing , as is done by Mr M'C nlloch and the other writers of the new school , upon the n*houitv of his sxstem , that the laboring classes naturally multiply m all c , Oiiatries beyond di means of subsistence We might , lien , with perfect *afctv VOL. xxv. - *o , 56* I // rest the case here ; but as the principle we are considering is of *r1'eat moment , the most niiportant , as xve have said before . in the whole compass of political science , it may be agreeable to our readers to see it estahiished in a positive as well as in a negative way . L1avin* ( lemoostlated the error of the doctrine , which assumes , in substance , that the increase of population has a natural tendency to produce a scarcity of the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall now proceed to show the truth of the directly opposite principle , namely that the increase cjf population has a natural tendency to produce a corn ) eretire abundance of the means of subsistence at the tune and place oJ its occurrence . If this can he made out , it will follow that the theory of the new school is not merely erroneous , but directly the reverse of the truth , and that its partisans have mistaken for a source of evil what is in fhct a real and permanent principle of national good . In order to ascertain with precision the effect of an increase of population upon the supply of the means of subsistence , le* us snl ) l ) ose it to take place in a territory with which we are familiar , as for example the District of Columbia . The ten miles square comprehended within this district are capable of producing only a limited quantity of provisions , while the population is capable of increasing to an indefinite extent . Let us suppose for argtonent 's sake , that the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all its products are completely forestalled , that the last grain of corn , which can possibly be raised lro'n the last inch of ground hy the utmost stretch of agricultural science , is regularly grown , baked , and eaten by the actual population , and that thc iiicrease is nevertheless proceeding with the same untiring mnrcli as before . A new lamdy ) resents itself ; what untie tli *se circumstances , will be the cen-* duet of the person chargee with procuring the supplies ? Will he feel in his conscie*'ce that he has come to the nreat banjtiet of nature xx itl out nAitation ? that there is no place reserved for him , md th t he must necessarily starve ? Will lie , out oh compi ( 1St uce to W althus , abstain from the use of imported gum o ' flour , and ( lie of inanition , rather than consume a bushel of whe , that was not grown within the District ? We are bAd to say , that , without so much as dreaming of any of the ai*nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *plx put on I is hat and xvi lb acioss the street to the next leer merchant to order a barrel of flotir , which , , as the products // ol the District are by the supposition forestalled , must ol course have been imported . But what in this ( on the new system ) soinexvhat critical and alarming emergency is the det ) ortlnent of the flour merchant ? An attempt is here made to induce him to aid and abet on open violation of the stanomo laws that regulate the distribution of wealth . Will he not see through it , and resist it with a manly firmness ? Will he not exact from the applicant for flour a sight of his iavitation to the banquet of nature ? Upon his failure to produce it , will he not untold to him the ( loctrille of the two ratios , convince him of the necessary disproportion between the numbe of empty stomachs and that of the loaves that are to fill them , and exuort him to starve with resignation and cheerfulness for the honor of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , would be the course which we should natually expect , at least upon the system of the new school but in point of Ibet nothing of all this happens . The flour merchant , or his shopman , welcomes our supernumerary with perfect civility , takes his orders , delivers him the barrel of flour , receives his money , books the transaction , wishes him a good mornmn* , and turns away quietly to serve the next customer . But how long could this syste n he pursued ? Would not a frequent repetition of similar applications exhaust at last tile worthy merchant 's patience or his flour ? Suppose , for instance , a new famiiy to present itself under the above mentioned circumstances every ( lay for a year in succession ( giving an annual increase of about two thousand inhabitants for the District , which w e presume is pretty near the truth ) , would they all obtain their supplies as readily as the first ? Would not the exasperated dealer in grain , wont out and baited in this way with ceaseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bit between his teeth , and resolutely refuse to part with another barrel for love or money ? This might be reasonably expected on the theory Ol the new school ; but here again the rcasOual ) lO expectations of these gentlemen are completely disappointed . The arrival of each new custom*r , instead of irritating the flour merchant , seems by some extraordinary accident to sweeten his humor , and give him a finer flow of spirits . He smiles upon each still more graciously than on the preceding one , and as the number increases , his very countenance and person seem to expand with it . He *atteu* on the flour which he sells to others* more than on what . // he ate before himself . his brow , which was hitherto some* what cloudy and contracted from a lurking doubt , whether he should be able to sustain himself at the stand which he had chosen , grows smooth and glossy ; and the little man bust1e* about among his people with the gaiety of a cricket . Strange as it may seem , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual drain , increases like the contents of the widow 's cruise in Scripture at every deduction . His warehouse itself enlarges ; a neat dwellingbouse rises by the side of it , and his little patch of a backyard dilates into a decent garden , with a stable at the bottom . Untaught in political economy , and bewitched with the sparkling eyes of some one of his pretty young neighbors , the man marries . Here again his doom would appear to be sealed ; but by the effect of his singular good fortune , and the constant affluence of new customers , he contrives to weather even this last and fatal rock . His family increases ; but as his profits increase still faster , he keeps his head above water , and even comes at last to be regarded as a thrifty man . His wife and daughters give balls , and sport their merinos , his son ( too probably ) a t*ndem ; and the father , if he be not ruined by the extravagance of his children , emerges at last into public notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank director , and . finally closes his useful career by filling successively the responsible offices of Common Council man , Alderman , and Mayor of the city of Washington . To state the same facts in fewer words , the supply of grain in the District increases in exact proportion to the increased demand , created by an increase of population ; and we submit it to our intelligent readers to decide , whether a barrel of flour would ever be wanting there as long as there was a five dollar bill ( or whatever the market price may be ) to offer for it , although the whole territory were as thickly covered with dwelling houses as the sides of Broadway , or the Ward of Cheap in London . What is true of the District of Columbia is einjually so of the ten sqnare miles adjoining it , and so on to the Pacific Ocean . While the process we have described is going on in the District , a similar one , we will suppose , is proceeding at Baltirflore , at Philadelphia , at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of this line of great markets Mong our coast produced , as it ought to have done *n the *heory of Malthus , a scarcity of provisions , or of anything else ? // Do we hear that any citizen of any of these flourishing capitals has been compelled to request his neighbor , as a great lavor , to sell him a barrel of flour at a famine price ? The smallest merchant 's clerk in Broadway , or State street , would smile at such a fancy , which has yet bewildered the brains of all the European professors of Political Economy . XVe all know that the increase of population on the seaboard , instead of producing any scarcity , has not only covered that part of the country *xit1-i abundance , but exercised the most beneficial influence on the welfare of the whole interior . The growth of New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore , has scattered wealth and plenty through the Genesee country , and made the wilderness beyond the Ohio and Mississippi to blossom like a rose . It dug the CLINTON CANAL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would drain the interminable marshes , that form the interior of New Holland , and convert the last acre of them into a wheat field , before a bushel of grain would be wanted in the United States by any citizen , who had the money to pay for it at a fair market price . These considerations are completely decisive against the theory cf the new school , which supposes that it is the effect of an increased population to produce an actual deficiency in the supply of provisions . They are not , however , quite sufficient for the purpose we have in view , which , as the reader will recollect , is to establish the proposition that an increase of population , instead of creating a scarcity , produces , on the contrary , a comparative abundance of the means of subsistence , at the time and place of its occurrence . We have already shown , that the supply of provisions under these circumstances is just as ample as it was before , and that it increases in exact proportion to the increased demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of provisions is affected by the same causes . Although there may be no deficiency in the quaitity of provisions , if their real value rise in consequence of an * We have little doubt that the state of New York will sooner or later do Mr Clinton the justice and itself the honor of conferring his name on the magnificent work for which we are all so much indebted to him . No individual , perhaps , ever rendered a greater service of an economical kind to any country , than he has done to ours by effecting this canal , which , considered merely in its political results , as a new bond of union between the different sections of the republic , would place its author in the first rank of public bcncfhctor*. // 142 July* increase of population , the result will be equivalent to a virtual scarcity . If , on the contrary , as we shall endeavor to show , their real value fall , the result produced is a comparative abundance . The extraordinary cheapness of grain in the province of Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned by Malthus as a curious fact ) , is a pregnant indication of the nature of the conclusion , at which we shall probably arrive . It is our object , however , at present to establish the point in a theoretical way . The price of provisions , like that of everything else , is determined by the cost of production , or the amount of labor necessary to bring them into market , and varies , of course , with the fertility of the soil upon which the supplies are raised , and the distance from which they are brought . The dearest that are required to furnish the market necessarily regulate the value of the whole . Where the population is scanty , and the state of society rude and unimproved , the price of the provisions consumed by a community depends wholly upon the quality of the soil they occupy . They are unable to profit by the superior fertility of any other , because they have nothing to bive in exchange for its products . Although grain were ten times as cheap in Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway is a favorite country with Mr Maithus . He considers the inhabitants as affording an honorable example of the practice of moral restraint , inasmuch as they seldom marry till the a e of forty or fifty . Upon visiting the country he was much struck with the comfortable appearance of everything ; and remarked particularly , that the farmers ' boys had better calves to their legs , than any that he had seen elsewhere . It appears , however , that with all their prudence , the Norwegians do not succeed in supplying themselves regularly with a sufficiency of the ordinary kind of food , being frequently reduced , as Mr Malthus himself informs us , to mix their flour with sawdust . This was their condition when the writer of this article saw theIn in the year 1809 . Holland , on the contrary , is looked upon by Mr Maithus with an evil eye , the inhabitants being universally addicted to marriage . He says that it has been called the gr we of Germany . We have bad opportunity ( in our personal capacity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years in different parts of it , can say with great truth that the people could not wear a healthier appearance if they inhabited the garden of Eden . We were not led to examine particularly the lower extremities of the farmers ' boys , but we have often observed with singular satisfaction the ruddy countenances of the young Dutch girls , who are all as fresh and blooming as the roses and Jules in their own flower gardens of Neordwyck and 1-Inarlem . Mr // would nevertheless be compelled to live upon their own , and even at times to suffer from scarcity , because they have no products which they can offer to the Poles in exchange for iheirs . But wherever an increase of population takes place , bringing with it , as it always does , a division of labor and a rapid progress in the arts of life , the price of provisions is regulated by the cost at which they can be raised on the best soil , anywhere under cultivation , with the addition of the charge of transportation to the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a manufacturing country , the inhabitants would then have the means of supplying themselves with grain from Poland ; and its price in their market would be the lowest at which it could be raised in the latter country , increased by the charge of transportation . Supposing this , on so bulky an article , to amount to one hundred per cent , still if the foreign grain be ten times as cheap as that of domestic growth , the price of the article would fall four hundred per cent , in consequence of the increase of population . A quantity of grain which could be raised in Norway for ten dollars and in Poland for one , the price being doubled by the charge of carriage , would now sell for two . It would therefore still be five times as cheap as the same quantity raised at home . Maithus affirms that the number of marriages is about twice as great in proportion to the population in holland as it is in Norway . He adds that the proportional mortality is also about double , and appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the greater number of deaths . As the great mortality in all countries takes place among children , and as the number of children increases of course in exact proportion to the number of marriages , it is necessary that the mortality should also increase in the same propor*ior1 ; and it seems more correct to reverse the order of cause and effect assumed by Malthus , and attribute the greater mortality to the greater number of marriages . If the mortality increase only in the same proportion with the number of marriages , it follows that all other circumstances are equal , and that in the present case the grave of German*ij is precisely as healthy as the pattern country of Norway . This writer adduces some documents , which appear to prove that the actual number of births in the latter is about one quarter more than that of the deaths ; and that there is of course a considerable annual increase , it is , however , highly improbable , that statements which make the number of births to a marriage greater in Norway than in Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country being more frequent , are naturally earlier , and of course more instead of less fruitful . If the mortality and the number of marriages be both twice as great in Holland as in Norway , it is probable that the formea country is increasing in ponulation much faster than the latter . // LJuIy , A considerable part of the grain consumed in England is raised in soils that afford only ten or twelve bushels an acre , and this of course determines the price of all the rest . Now there are many soils in our country , that afford by the acre forty , fifty , and sixty bushels . In the latter case there would be an advantage of five hundred per cent to the British public in consuming our grain instead of their own , and deducting from this the charge of transportation at one hundred per cent , there would still be a net profit of four times the value of the article . This profit on the price of provisions would be the result of the increase of population , that has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land now under tillage . The same considerations explain the cheapness of provisions in Holland , a country where , if raised on the spot , they would cost their weight in gold , and into which they could not be imported were it not for the density of the population , and the high state of improvement at which it has arrived . These circumstances have fixed the price of grain on one of the most sterile parts of the earth , at the lowest rate at which it can be raised in the most productive , increased by a small charge for transportation by water . In general , therefore , the effect of an increase of population is to reduce the price of provisions wherever the soil is so much inferior in fertility to the best soils anywhere under cultivation , as to admit of the importation of grain from the latter . This reduction might be , as we have seen in the cases of Holland and England , a very considerable one ; and as the average quantity of the different soils under cultivation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to that of the best , it follows that as a general rule , the effect of an in** crease of population is to reduce the price of provisions at the time and place of its occurrence . TIns reasoning supposes a perfect freedom of the trade in grain . If a nation chooses to limit its consumption to the quantity of grain , that can be raised on a limited territory abroad or at home , its opulation will be limited of course to the number of persons , which this territory will nourish ; and when it has reached this point , if emigration be also prohibited , provisions will be sold at a famine price . But such artificial restraints have no connexion with the prin-* ciples , which naturally regulate the distribution of wealth . The only exception to the rule jast stated is that of communities , which occupy soils of the very first quality . Grain // being with them already at a minimum price , can not , of course , be made cheaper ; and if it become necessary , on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , the price of foreign grain , although raised also on soils of the first quality , would still be higher than that of domestic , by the amount of the expense of importing it . At this price the supply would be ample . But even in a case of this kind , the whole expense of living would still be less than it was before . The mere article of necessary food forms only a part , though a considerable one , of this expense in civilized communities . Clothing , furniture , and various articles of comfort or luxury , compose another portion not less important . Now the price of this whole class of articles is much diminished by the increase of population , and the consequent advance of manufactures and commerce ; so that were the price of necessary food even to rise considerably ( as it would in the particular case now supposed ) by the effect of these circumstances , an equal quantity of labor would still produce a more abundant supply of the usual wants of life . Hence the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a general principle , it reduces the price of necessary food , and in the few cases where this does not happen , it still reduces the total expense of living . These principles are , we trust , sufficiently clear not to stand in need of any further illustration . If they did , it would be easy to corroborate them by one or two considerations of a very familiar , and at the same time very satisfactory kind , to which we shall now briefly allude . 1 . If living were not at least as cheap in a thickly peopled territory , as it is elsewhere , it would be impossible for a dense population to exist anywhere as a permanent condition of society . If the necessary expenses of life , as compared with the reward of labor , were greater in the District of Columbia , than they are in the neighboring country , the products of an equal amount of labor would of course be less , and the profit upon it would fall below the ordinary rate . In that case capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District , and invested somewhere else , until the equality was restored . The least tendency to an increasing density of population , if it were accompanied by an increase in the expense of living , would be counteracted by a stronger principle , acting in an opposite direction , and could never in fact be realized . Thus every city // on the globe affords , by the mere fact of its existence , a demonstration that the real cost of living in a dense population is at least as small as it is elsewhere . Mr Malthus denies entirely , that emigration could have any effect of this kind , and in his chapter on the subject enlarges on the dangers and hardships , that attend the settlement of new colonies in distant countries . But such considerations are foreign to the question , because the settlement of new colonies is not tbe sort of emigration , which would equalize , if necessary , the expenses of living in different places . If grain were dearer in the District of Columbia , than it is in the neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to relieve themselves by emigration , to embark for New Holland or Spitzbergen . They would quietly remove to the next county , and all would be well . As this does not happen , we are certain that the evil does not exist , for which , if it did , so simple a process would afford a perfect remedy . 2 . But this argument may be pushed farther , and it may be shown , that the permanent existence of a dense population upon any spot of the earth 's surface shows not only , as we have seen , that the means of subsistence are at least as plenty there as elsewhere , but that they must necessarily be much more so . It is known that the annual mortality is much greater , and the chance of life much smaller in proportion to the density of population . In London , for example , the annual proportion of deaths to the whole number of the inhabitants , is as one to twenty , while in England in the average it is only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so great , but it is always considerable . It is necessary , therefore , to the permanent existence of a dense population on a given territory , not only that there should be no emigration from it , as there necessarily would be if living were unusually dear , but that there should be a constant immigration into it , equivalent to this difference of mortality ; and this could not happen unless living were unusually cheap . There must be , for example , an annual immigration into London , equal to the number of native inhabitants of the city that annually reach a mature age , supposing the population of that city to increase only as fast as that of the kingdom in general . What cause then attracts this never ebbing flood of emigrants towards London , and every other thickly peopled spot on the globe ? Do they encounter the inconveniences and ex // penses of a change of residence , for the mere satisfaction of diminishing their chance of life , without any countervailing advantage ? Evidently not . If a thickly peopled territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be because the reward of labor is greater than it is elsexvhere . It is calculated that the population of Great Britain is about twelve millions , the number of annual births three millions , and of persons annually arriving at maturity one million five hundred thousand . On the same supposition the population of London being about twelve hundred thousand , the number of annual births would be three hundred thousand ; but the mortality being double , the number of persons arriving at maturity would be only half as great in proportion , or seventyfive thousand . Hence an immigration to this amount of persons of mature a0e , or a proportionally larger one composed of persons of various ages , would be necessary to maintain the population at its actual height ; and as it is known to be increasing much faster than that of any other part of England , the annual immigration may be rated at one hundred thousand persons of mature age , or about one fifteenth part of the whole number of persons annually coming to maturity in the country . This immense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , proves sufficiently the extent of the attractive force existing at the metropolis , which can be no other than the more abundant reward of labor , or , in other words , a more copious supply of the means of subsistence. * * If we suppose two exactly equal masses of population , and that the reward of labor in one is twice as great as in the other , it will require an emigration of half the latter into the territory of the former to restore the equilibrium . Thus if the two masses be each composed of four thousand persons , and the quantity of grain to be distributed among them , as a reward for an equal amount of labor , be in one four thousand bushels , and in the other two thousand , each person will receive one bushel in the former and half a bushel in the latter ; but if half the population , or two thousand persons , emigrate from the latter to the former , there will then be two thousand bushels to be divided among two thousand persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortality be also double in the former , the influx from the other will exactly counterbalance it , and leave the reward of labor the same . If the former be smaller , it will require of course a smaller emigration from the other to establish an equilibrium . If the population of London be one twelfth of that of Great Britain , and the reward of labor twice as great as it is on an average throughout the island , an annual emigration of one twenty fourth part of the laborers // 148 July , We have thus , satisfactorily we hope , though briefly1 attempted to establish the proposition that an increase of population produces a comparative abundance of the means of subsistence , at the time and place of its occurrence . it follows of course , that the class of laborers have no tendency to multiply beyond the demand for labor ; since their inultiplication , to xvhatever extent it may go , increases instead of diminishing the demand for labor and its reward . The grounds , on which the writers of the new school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the general rules , that regulate the distribution of wealth , of course fail entirely , and with them the unnatural and antisocial doctrines , which they have pietended to establish upon this foundation . The natural rate of wages is not the smallest pittance , that will serve to support life , but is a variable quantity determined by the productiveness of labor for the time being . Its amount is greater or less in different countries , and parts of the same country , according to the state of civilization and industry ; and with particular individuals according to their personal habits . Where the state of society is such , that the people are generally industrious and temperate , an individual is able to produce in the course of the year more than he has occasion to consume . The excess of his products over his consumption constitutes his profits , and the average rate of profits is the mean of this excess in the different branches of industry . The profits thus obtained will be variously employed according to the temper and taste of the possessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fund formed by such accumulation is what we call capital . It is realized in the shape of houses and furniture , machinery of all kinds , and any other objects of convenience or luxury . The exchangeable value of all these articles is determined by the productiveness of labor for the time being , and in making the exchange the capitalist and the laborer enter the market on a footing of perfect equality . In general they are partners , jointly interested in a common enterprise , of which they share the expenses and the profits , and in which each may therefore be said , with propriety , to receive the whole of his own products . would be sufficient . The loose calculations given in the text make the actual amount equal to one fifteenth , and the conclusion would be that the reward of labor in London is more than twice as great as it is in the country , by the difference between one twentyfourth and one Bflccnth. // It is pleasing to observe the effect of these principles in dis sipating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present us as a correct picture of the condition of the laboring classes , that is , the mass of mankind , and restoring every thing at once to its proper place and shape . The gulf of starvation , which was yawning but now under the feet of this large and meritorious portion of society , closes forever without the necessity of a previous propitiatory offering of their children to the Moloch , who alone would have presided over a creation , such as these philosophers would make of the world we inhabit . The steep and rocky precipice , upon which we left them clinging painfully for life , spreads itself out into a fair and open country , the narrow stations that afforded them a difficult and scanty footing expanded into comfortable dwellings , surrounded with trim gardens , fruitful orchards , and snug outhouses , the whole neatly fenced , and in good order . The tenant is not condemned to renounce his natural feelings , and pass his life in cheerless celibacy , nor does he find his material comforts reduced by an early marriage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , therefore , whom our economical enchanters had conjured away , now reappears , but no longer brings with her the fatal dish of potatoes , which before deprived her of half her attractions . The smoking steak , with its garniture of bread and beer , no longer deceptive and unsubstantial visions , assumes a tangible form and a permanent position on the table . A troop of healthy children flourish like olive plants around and upon them ; and the whole scene exhibits a charming picture of simple but real happiness . Such is the condition of the laboring class , that is , the mass of the people , wherever the state of civilization is such , that the mass of the people are generally industrious and temperate . The more deserving part of them , that is , those who are somewhat more active , industrious , and provident than the rest , realize a regular profit from their labor , and grailually accumulate a moderate capital . We have all read the history of the Forty Thieves , in which the uttering of the magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid rock . The cheerful sounds of profits and accumulated capital produce an effect less marvellous , but far more pleasant on the laborer 's condition . A troop of minor comforts and humble luxuries gather round him and his family at the very mention of the names ,  --  the decent holiday apparel , the Sunday 's board // crowned with rural dainties , education for his children , and a gradual improvement of his own circumstances ; until , after beginning as a common workman , he finishes , perhaps , as a justice of the peace ; holds his own court of a week day ; sits on Sunday with a proud satisfaction , only chastened by the reverence due to the place , under the pastoral instructions of his son , proclaiming the word of life from the pulpit ; beholds his daughters forming well assorted marriages with the neighboring youth ; and finds himself at last the patriarch of a numerous group of children , grandchildren , and family connexions , which rise up around him , calling and making him blessed . The condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched , by the necessary operation of the standing laws of nature ; but depends on the agency of two principal circumstances ; the state of civilization , and in each particular case the character of the individual . Accordingly as the habits of the individual rise above or fall below the standard of morals established around him , he will be either prosperous or unhappy , as compared with his neighbors and countrymen . Thus far everything depends upon himself ; but no personal superiority over those about him will place him on a level with men , whose characters are formed upon a higher model . A respectable Hottentot is a being quite inferior to a common European or American . Much , therefore , depends upon the circumstances under which the individual character is formed , and in this particular a man can do but little for himself . If he have enjoyed the benefit of a social position favorable to happiness and virtue , he should regard and be grateful for it as a blessing of Providence . But though the individual can in general do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which his character is formed , the standard may itself be elevated by the efforts of powerful minds , whose talents and advantages enable them to exercise an extensive influence over the opinions and fortunes of others . By diffusing the knowledge of truth , by correcting errors , and reforming their practical results , by laboring to improve the great institutions of religion and government , which rule with imperial and almost unbounded sway the characters of men , by perfecting the modes of educa*. lion , and finally by holding up the high example of a pure , disinterested , and honorable life , they may very much meliorate the circumstances under which the individual characters of their // countrymen are formed , and bequeath a permanent legacy of virtue and happiness to future generations . The philosophy of the new economical school teaches us , that such expectations are idle and visionary ; and that no improvements in religion , education , or government can effect any favorable change in the condition of the mass of mankind , who , according to them , are everywhere condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abject wretchedness . Without going quite so far as the illustrious Roman orator , who declared that he would rather be in the wrong with Plato than in the right with Epicurus , we can not but feel a strong satisfaction in finding what we think good grounds for rejecting this gloomy , though at present popular system ; and shall be happy , if we have been able to communicate to the minds of our readers the convictions of our own . It is time , however , to bring these remarks to a close . Although we have extended them to the full limits of a long article , it has not been in our power to do more than indicate , very briefly and rapidly , the leading errors of the system we have been considering , and the more correct principles which we have ventured to propose in their place . We must leave it to the intelligence of our readers to follow out these principles into their conclusions . They will be found to modify more or less , in almost all its parts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England ; and to give it a more agreeable and satisfactory aspect than it wears at present . In treating at times with levity , and occasionally with some degree of harshness , the prevailing doctrines , we have no intention , as we have already declared , of attacking the motives or depreciating the characters of their adherents . We believe the system to be not only erroneous , but in a high degree antisocial , and of course immoral ; but the experience of the world has shown , that opinions of this description may be held and promulgated by very good and able men . Mr M'Culloch , whose work is immediately before us , has personally but little to answer for as respects the merits of the system , as he belongs in substance to the class of commentators and compilers . Mr Malthus is the chief authority with this whole school , which was also sustained in the British Parliament and in his writings by the late Mr Ricardo , and to which Mr Brougham has given his personal sanction , and probably that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // most intelligent and philanthropic men of the age , and their imposing names would almost necessarily give a temporary currency to any opinion . The unsettled state of the public mind in England , upon all the main points of moral and political philosophy , and the questionable character of the theories most generally received respecting them , are also among the causes that have contributed to favor the circulation of these repulsive paradoxes . Society reposes , one might almost say , cx vi termini , upon the basis of the social instincts and affections , and no system of moral science could ever gain a complete ascendancy in any civilized community , that did not acknowledge their reality and importance . Wherever , therefore , the public opinion on these subjects was completely formed , no theory of any branch of political philosophy , which , like the one in question , should proscribe the social affections , and declare them to be merely pernicious illusions , would have any chance of success . But the nations of Europe have been so much distracted , for centuries past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them immediately connected with the state of public opinion on the leading principles of morals , and in turn producing a reaction upon it , that this most important branch of science has never yet acquired among them a consistent and settled shape . The doctrines now most popular , especially in England , are by a strange kind of fatality , those which fairly invert the social pyramid , and place it upright upon its apex , by founding society precisely on the antisocial principle , improperly called self love . Such opinions* however improbable in themselves , tend , if once admitted , to facilitate the adoption of any theory that depreciates the value of the social affections . We may reasonably expect , that the current notions on these subjects will in time give place to others of a sounder and loftier cast , but we rather doubt whether we ought to look for such a reformation to the mother country ; where all the literary and philosophical pursuits , that rise at all above the level of the business and amusement of daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrepitude . It is in this our young and flourishing republic , if we are not too much deceived by our own partialities , and what we think the signs of the times , that we shall behold , and that at no very distant period , a restoration of the true social philosophy , and shall see , perhaps for the first time in the history of man , the great science of morals assume a fixed and // stable form . Our political institutions favor in every way the developernent of the best and noblest sentiments , and our prosperous national position , prospective and present , naturally leads us to regard the destiny and fortunes of man on the bright side . Whenever this reform or anything like it shall happen , the antisocial paradoxes we have now been considering will fall of themselves , is worthless appendages of exploded and degrading heresies . We observe , already , the stirrings of a spirit , which seems to prognosticate this new order of things . The strains of pure and sweet poetry , that rise upon the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the unaffected freshness of nature on every side ; the copious vein of elegant literature , far more precious than our new found mines of gold , that has been opened in our native mountains , under the shade of our antique forests , and is now wrought with such brilliant success the recent awakening of the patriotic fervor of 76 , which has burst upon the nation in a glorious flood of eloquence unmmgled , for the first time , with the bitterness of party spirit , and unsurpassed , whether for the elevation of the matter , or the classical perfection of the form , by the hibhest efforts of any age or country ; these , we say , are the splendid signs of the times , that forebode the era of a sounder and more generous moral philosophy , than the heartless system that now prevails iu England .
