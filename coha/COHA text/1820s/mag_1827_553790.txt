Hilliard , Gray , Little , &amp; Wilkins . 826. 2. sIn Oration pronounced at New Haven , before the Society of Phi Beta Kappa , September 12 , 1826 . On some of the Considerations , which should influence an Epic or a Tragic Writer , in the Choice of an Era . By JAMES A. HILLHOUSE . NewHaven . A. H. Maltby &amp; Co. 1826 . SIR WILLIAM JONES has remarked , while referring to the beauty of some of the oriental manuscripts , that he could almost find it in his heart , to regret the invention of the art of printing . We do not carry the passion for calligraphy to this extent ; nor would we carry any passion to the extent of leading us to regret the art of printing . As there is , however , a bright and a dark side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils , which are incident to the growth and diffusion of great improvements . Simply to suppose that we are positive gainers , by all the difference between the refined arts of modern life and the ruder processes of antiquity , is to fall into great error . Every discovery and every invention , which effects a great change in human pursuits , although in the long run it may be most highly beneficial , not only must be qualified by some evil consequences directly incident to it , huE by the loss of some advantages of the previously existing arrangement , which are displaced and destroyed by the innovation . // This reflection is more important to be made , by way of explaining the otherwise seemingly inexplicable fact , that after all the brilliant improvements , inventions , and discoveries of the modern world , the general impression left on the mind , after forming an acquaintance with the moral and social character and condition of men , in the civilized states of antiquity and of the modern world , certainly is , that there is no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern literature there is by no means that contrast , which prevails between manuscript circulation and the circulation by the press ; and , in a word , that in the possession of means and instruments , seemingly so much more powerful , various , and numerous , the grand and final effect on human character is by no means so much greater , than that of the ancient means and instruments of improvement , as might have been expected . In saying this , we design by no means to disturb the old controversy , on the comparatii*e merit of the ancients and moderns ; nor to wake from their long rest the shades of Tassoni , Perrault , or Wotton . We are willing to grant that , in the result of a general induction , improvements of most brilliant character , and in vast numbers , have been made by the moderns over the ancients ; but in the last and great effect of all improvements , the formation of character , we confess our doubts whether modern history presents a larger average of mature , elevated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we wish at present to make of this remark , is to say , that among those favorable circumstances , which , to a certain degree , compensated for the deficiencies of the ancieut arts and improvements , was the superior activity of the social principle . The modern arts , resulting in a division of labor , have broken up the combinations of men , which were formerly necessary , and sent each to his cell , to work out by himself , and with the co-operation of his new found enginery , those effects , which , in an earlier stage of society , were produced by processes more dependent on social union . This applies , if to nothing else , most certainly to the effect of the art of printing on literature . Where no mode of publication existed , but the tedious one of manuscript transcription , the reading of prose works , and the recitation or chanting of poetical works , to assembled multitudes , on triumphant occasions , on festal days , in the temples , and at the games , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . The historian and the poet , who would make their productIons known , were obliged to go // with them to the resorts of their countrymen . As secondary , but at the same time highly stimulating and efficient consequences , were the animation resulting from the numbers of a living audience ; the added graces of elocution in the reading and declamation ; the instrumental accompaniment of the lyrical chant ; perhaps the rival exhibition of contemporary authors , drawn together for the same object ; and at all events , the cheering and kindling sympathy of the allied arts , of the liberal sports , ana of the gorgeous pageantry of the festivals or the games . Herodotus read a portion of his History in the assembly at Athens , and at the Olympic games . It would not be difficult , we suppose , to make this sound very ridiculous , by an ill applied reference to modern analogy . We will even own , that if Hume had undertaken to go thron 0h his History at a Westminster meeting , in New Palace Yard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five volumes , upon the turf at the Long Island races , it might in either case , without any disparagement to these honored names , be rather a tedious affair to the assembled multitudes . But we apprehend , that when the father of history rehearsed his Muses to the Athenian people ; and when Pindar sung his Olympian lyrics , in the temple of Jupiter at Elis , it was an exhibition as auspicious to the general power and effect of literature on the improvement of a people , as that of a pile of nicely bound volumes in the window of a bookseller 's shop , to be taken home and carefully conned in private . If we go farther back into antiquity , to the period of the epic muse , and allow ourselves to consider the iliad and Odyssey as the growth of an age , which knew no tablets but the hearts and memories of a delighted audience , catching and treasuring the strains of the wandering minstrel ; and then compare these poems , even as productions of art , with the best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel more strongly the truth of the proposition with which we started . For be it also remembered , that under a dispensation of printed literature , we can with less confidence argue from a distinguished writer to an enlightened community . We frequently behold the phenomenon of what is called a man in advance of his age ; ' as well we may . For where a man is enabled , as all are to a certain degree enabled , to form and to improve himself , without that action and reaction of society anciently so essential , he may , in the exercise of strong powers in a happy direction , leave his // contemporaries in the rear . But in antiquity , the author was formed much more by the audience . That , which is written to be recited , declaimed , and chanted , implies a community prepared to relish and appreciate it . A minstrel poetry , especially , can not rise far above the level of the taste and intelligence of the age ; and we think it quite fair to argue , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixth canto of the Iliad formed the entertainment of some hero 's festal hoard , or the interlude of the games at some public celehration , though it were a l ) eriod more remote than the return of the lleraclid* , the siege of Troy , ay , or the expedition of the Argonauts , was no savage period . The conception of the scene of Hector and Andromache is one of civilized life ; it is the conception of an age of sentiment , exclusively as that is claimed for the modern world and the romantic nations . Every institution , in modern times , which has the effect of adding to the advantages peculiar to the art of printing , those which belonged to the ancient forms of litcrature , promises the beneficial result of a double agency in promoting the improveinent of society . It may even be necessary to aim at such a combination , by way of corrective of those evils , which our new and all powerful arts have introduced . It is precisely these objects , which we think may be attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well educated and intelligent persons , collected under the sanction and within the precincts of respectable establishments for education , addressed on literary topics by men of science and letters , under circumstances likely to produce a great effort to excel , is no faint image of the assemblies of the ancient world , before which the great productions of cultivated minds were exhibited . It is true , these assemblies are with us occasional ; anciently , they were essential ; here they are a relaxation ; to the elder world they were an important part of the organization of social life . Everything , however , which is done to give dignity and interest to these assemblies , has a favorable operation and tendency of the kind alluded to . Science is wooed from her cell . She casts off her monkish stole , and relaxes from her stern and melancholy aspect . The cheerful countenances of an intelligent assembly , the welcome note of applause , the animation of the living voice , the communication of thought , feeling , and sentiment from breast to breast , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , make these occasions a source of high gratifica // tion , and ultimately must make them the means of essential and wide spread benefit . No pains should be spared , to add to their interest and importance , by the selection of those , who are able aud willing to render them attractive . The public taste of our community runs decidedly , but by no means too strongly , in favor of holidays of all kinds , and especially those of a literary character . Respectable as some of them are already , they are likely to become more so , by the honorable rivalry of sister institutions , by the improved character of the audiences usually assembled , and by the consequently strengthened demand for talent to entertain and satisfy a fastidious assembly . It is now several years , since on occasion of the public appearance of the lamented Buckminster , on the anniversary of the society of Phi Beta Kappa at Cambridge , the public attention and curiosity were excited and gratified to a degree , which has left a permanent and not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted for almost the only literary effort of one of the most accomplished of our scholars and one of the most elegant of our writers . His performance on the occasion alluded to , will ever remain a jewel in our literature . It is matter of serious regret , that the combination of certain exercises of a totally different character , we mean the prize declamations , with the performances of the society , should have been allowed to take place . The audience , collected for a different object , is thus preoccupied and wearied out ; and what might in itself be the most rational and agreeable of our purely literary festivals , is made tedious and fatiguing . Believing these to be the feelings of the public , we hope the encroachment here alluded to will be abated . For the reasons to which we have already referred , we think the public gratitude is due to the eminent jurist , to whom we owe the first of the performances named at the head of this article . We regard him as deserving well of our republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of his example to this literary celebration ; as he has especially so deserved of it , by his well conceived , well digested , and well written Discourse . Most of the readers of this Journal are already acquainted with it , and it scarcely needs our aid , either by way of analyzing or extracting , to make it known to the literary public , in proportion to its merits . It is indeed a highly finished sketch of a most extensive subject , presenting nothing less than a discriminating , comprehensive , and accurate revicw of the present state of // science and letters , particularly in this country , by way of mark* ing the characteristics and peculiarities of the age and of its cultivation . It is a report from a strong , highly cultivated , and richly stored mind , not of some single professional study , not of some favorite branch of individual pursuit , but of the whole broad domain of intellectual culture , as presenting itself to a mind competent and resolved to go along with the age . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts of this performance , as one of its merits is the ready transition from one member to another of a long series of interesting topics , treated in due proportion to their relative importance , all with spirit , and many with felicity and power . Were we to make an indication , by way of specimen , we should say , that the remarks on female education , on classical learning , and on the deceased patriarchs of America , were among those , to which the reader might first turn back , to prolong and repeat the gratification of the perusal . Nor should it be overlooked , what a beneficial impulse has been thus communicated to education among the female sex . If christianity may be said to have given a permanent elevation to woman , as an intellectual and moral being , it is as true , that the present age , above all others , htts given play to her genius , and taught us to reverence its influence . It was the fashion of other times to treat the literary acquirements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stigmatize them as inconsistent with those domestic affections and virtues , which constitute the charm of society . We had abundant homilies read upon their amiable weaknesses and sentimental delicacy , upon their timid gentleness and submissive dependence ; as if to taste the fruit if knowledge were a deadly sin , and ignorance were the sole guardian of innocence . Their whole lives were " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought , " and concealment of intellectual power was often resorted to , to escape the dangerous imputation of masculine strength . In the higher walks of life , the satirist was not without color for the suggestion , that it was " A youth of folly , an old age of cards ; " and that elsewhere , " most women had no character at all , " beyond that of purity and devotion to their families . Admirable as are these qualities , it seemed an abuse of the gifts of Providence to deny to mothers the power of instructing their children , to wives the privilege of sharing the intellectual pursuits of their husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fireside circle , to youth and beauty the charm of refined sense , to age and infirmity the consolation of studies , // which elevate the soul and gladden the listless hours of despondency . These things have in a great measure passed away . The prejudices , which dishonored the sex , have yielded to the influence of truth . By slow but sure advances education has extended itself through all ranks of female society . There is no longer any dread , lest the culture of science should foster that musculine boldness or restless independence , which alarms by its sallies , or wounds by its inconsistencies . We have seen that here , as every where else , knowledge is favorable to human virtue and human happiness ; that the refinement of literature adds lustre to the devotion of piety ; that true learning , like true taste , is modest and unostentatious ; that grace of manners receives a higher polish from the discipline of the schools ; that cultivated genius sheds a cheering light over domestic duties , and its very sparkles , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its purity . There is not a rank of female society however high , which does not now pay homage to literature , or that would not blush even at the suspicion of that ignorance , which a half century ago was neither uncommon nor discreditable . There is not a parent , whose pride way not glow at the thought , that his daughter 's happiness is in a great measure within her own command , whether she keeps the cool sequestered vale of life , or visits the busy walks of fashion . A new path is thus opened for female exertion , to alleviate the pressure of misfortune , without any supposed sacrifice of dignity or modesty . Man no longer aspires to an exclusive dominion in authorship . He has rivals or allies in almost every department of knowledge ; and they are to be found among those , whose elegance of manners and blamelessness of life command his respect , as much as their talents excite his admiration . Who is there , that does not contemplate with enthusiasm the precious fragments of Elizabeth Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety of Hannah More , the persuasive sense of Mrs Barbauld , the elegant memoirs of her accomplished niece , the bewitching fictions of Madame D ' Arblay , the vivid , picturesque , and terrific imagery of Mrs Radcliffe , the glowing poetry of Mrs Hemans , the matchless wit , the inexhaustible conversations , the fine character painting , the practical instructions of Miss Edgeworth , the great KNOWN , standing in her own department by the side of the great UNKNOWN ? ' pp. 15-18 . We were more especially gratified by the remarks on classical literature , as being made at a seasonable moment , and as an authority not open to suspicion . To the testimony of professedly academical men , those whose habits are formed to the // study of the ancients , and still more those whose reputation and interest are connected with that study , it is always easy to object a selfish bias . It is not easy to make such an objection , with much plausibility , against the authority of Mr Justice Story7 a man , who , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a different kind of learning ; and whose prepossessions must of necessity be such as are formed in the busy practice of the most practical of professions . The testimony of such a man possesses all the weight which is due to mere authority of any kind , and which , though no reverencers of mere authority , we think ought to be regarded , in the present case , as a counterpoise to the weight of authorities , which have lately been busily accumulated in the opposite scale . The truth , however , here , as in most other controversies , is in the golden mean , where it is placed in fact by the discriminating observations of Mr Justice Story . To deny all importance and all value to the study of classical literature , is a bigotry just as ridiculous , as to make that study the sole business of education . Most of the argumentation at present current on this head is aimed at particular abuses ; at the extravagances , of individuals ; or at the excess of that which is good in moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right place . The most illogical conlusion , moreover , prevails , of the different objects to be attained , by the study of the ancient languages . This study may bepursued by the man of taste , for the literature of which they are the depository ; by the historian , not merely in order to be sure of the sense of historical authorities , but in order to get at what is sometimes the only clew to be had , to the affinity of nations ; by the philosopher of the mind , in order to survey the ol ) erations of the human intellect to the greatest advantage in the structure of the most perfect systems of expressing thought ; by the members of the different professions , in order to master that portion of the literature of their professions , which is contained in these languages ; and what is still different from all the rest , this study may be pursued at school and at college , as the study which is found , upon the whole , to furnish the most eligible basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written and heard said of late , on the topic of the languages , resolves itself into showing that the reasons which recommend the study to one class of men do not apply to others . In reference to the last* mentioned use of the dead languages , namely , that of being a convenient basis for educa // tion , the argument against them has the advantage of confining itself to pointing out the objections to this study . We have not perceived any attempt to name any other study or system of studies , which , generally introduced into our schools and colleges as the occupation of that part of the time spent on the languages , would serve a better purpose . One thing we will say , from some experience and some observation , that the chemistry , the aiineralogy , the geology , the geography , the history , the ethics of children eight years old are not worth a groat ; and that the study of the languages , on judicious principles , is well calculated to exercise and train every power of their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other performance , which is named at the head of this article , the Oration of Mr Hilihouse , at New Haven . Its subject is stated to he some of the considerations , which should influence an epic or tragic writer , in the choice of an era . ' The high reputation of Mr Hillhouse as a poet , naturally awakens a curiosity to hear him discourse of the secrets of the art . We would learn , if possible , the process by which a gifted genius is conscious of aiming to exercise its peculiar mastery over the minds and hearts of men . The present performance consists of a description and comparison of what are styled the Classic , Romantic , and Scripture eras , in reference to their adaptation for the purposes of poetry ; and especially of epic and dramatic poetry . The plan accordingly affords scope for a number of fine observations on the influence of society and manners on the efforts of genius . Mr Hillhouse has entered , to a considerable extent , into the comparison of the Classic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not suggested , by the Schlegels and Madame de Stahl . In separating the Scripture era from the Romantic , and making a third school out of the materials which it l ) resents , Mr Hillhouse has proposed a new distinction , which it may not be ea* to bring into systematic connexion with the other two . We understand the genius of the Romantic poetry to be the peculiar character of the North , united with the spirituality of revealed religion ; and in his delineation of the second school , or that of Romantic poetry , Mr Hillhouse resorts to the influence of the true religion as the source of some of the best of its qualities . Whether there is , in fact , any such thing as the distinction set up by the continental critics , and not yet well rooted in England and America , of a Classic and Romantic school , is with us a matter of doubt . fin ' ? // whether the existing phenomena of the poetical world afford materials for still a third ( listinction ; whether there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , a school of poetry , which is neither Classic nor Romantic , may much more strongly admit of question . To deal fairly , however , by Mr Hillhouse , we will quote the passage , in which he makes this distinction . The source last alluded to , is separate and distinct ,  --  of loftier character and more sublime associations . It is the blended history and poetry of a peculiar people . It celebrates , not the actions of fabulous heroes , not the extermination of imaginary monsters , not the exploits of the barbarous nobility of a bloody age ; it treasures not the responses of lying oracles , nor the predictions of Flamens and Augurs ; it is the sacred and eternal witness of the faith of patriarchs , of the truth of prophets , of the valor of godlike kings ; of the existence , agency , and purposes of invisible spirits ; of the power , providence , and immutable character of God ; it is strewed with flowers of paradise , it wafts to our souls the breath of heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its mighty influence on the character of man , and on the spirit of poetry , has been alluded to . At the unconsuming fire of the Hebrew Scriptures , it is acknowledc , red that the greatest masters have kindled their sublimity , arid from the tender legacy of our Savior , snatched their finest traits of disinterestedness and love . ' pp. 19 , 20 . If it he meant merely here to speak , as a matter of fact , of the sacred history as a separate field , in which to fix the action of an epical or a dramatic composition , the question is indeed narrowed ; and it is then obvious to remark , that a poem or a sacred subject may be , accordingly as it is treated , a Classic or a Romantic poem . Thus we suppose , for we profess not to be very deep in this chapter , that the Athalie of Racine is a Classic , and the Messiah of Klopstock a Romantic poem . The Bruto Secondo of Alfieri must certainly be Classic , although it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in rece di donne , interlocutore e attore , fra molti altissimi personagera ii popolo . Shakspeare 's Julius C*sar presents us the same subject on the same scene , the same high personages , and if not the same people , unquestionably a set of worthy citizens , possessing a much nearer resemblance , than the popolo of Alfieri , to the Roman plebs . But , nevertheless , we take Shakspeare 's Julius Ca*sar to he a Romantic tragedy ; for if this be also Classic , then indeed that term is one of most ample comprehension . // Not , however , to enlarge on this , the question , whether the Scriptures and Scripture history afford favorable materials for poetry , is a very fair question ; and is treated by Mr Ilillhouse with spirit and taste , and in a highly glowing manner . Mr Hillhouse evidently feels , as he expresses , a strong prepossession in hvor of this source of poetical associations ; and the success of his own efforts on Scripture subjects accounts for and justifies the preference . lie discusses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , which was so positively decided in the negative hy Dr Johnson , regarding the aptness of sacred themes for the purposes of ' poetry . In the following judicious reflection , however , he has suggested to us a principle , in which is probably contained the whole practical philosophy of the subject . But whatever be the intrinsic merits of any era , there is a consideration , which may he paramount to them all . Subject to fortunate or sinister impressions , long before we can estimate their power , the mind sometimes receives early an unalterable bias . The strength of a second nature thus incorporated with our moral faculties , their successful exertion can only be in concert with it . Let no friendly adviser , no presuming critic , no external influence overrule an emphatic whisper from within . That inward monitor only knows the harp , which will respond to the poet 's touch . Wherever it directs him-whether to the classic lyre , or the shell of heroes , or the wizard harp of fairyland , or the blood stirring string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet or an angel , let him snatch that-from that or none , will he draw sounds of power . ' p. *27 . There have been four epic l ) Oets in the world , generally considered as standing alone in a circle , to which no other has a full right to he introduced . We doubt if any inference can he drawn from the consideration of the subjects of their various poems , which authorizes the preference of any one era or region over others , as adapted to poetry . The materials of the Iliad are drawn from the heroic age of Greece , and , according to the general opinion , from that age , as contemplated by one , who lived not long after its close . The action of the Fneid is placed in a period somewhat similar , or rather in one which the poet has chosen to assimilate to the heroic age of Greece ; for , in reality , Italy , at the time when the action of the IEneid is supposed to have taken place , no more resembled Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aztecs resembled the Vandals . In either case , a state of partial civilization is the only point of resemblance . Virgil , however , by a simple flourish of the wand , set down all Greece , men and gods , the manners of Troy and Olympus , among tl ) e Rutulians and the Etruscans . It would be hard to tell , what period furnished Dante with his materials . If any period or any region , it must be considered as Italy in the middle ages ; for it is into the characters of his contemporaries , that most of the soul of his poetry is breathed . The Paradise Lost is built on materials , which purport to be drawn from Scripture history ; but how little in it of what is most astonishing , beautiful , or pathetic , is to be traced to any other source than the poet 's own invention ! It is where he wanders widest from his directory , that his flu ght is most admired ; and there is at least one eminent pessage , the account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invention manifestly embarrasses , and had well nigh proved too much for the poet . We feel almost inclined to say , that the choice of the subject and the theatre of the action , are of no consequence to the epic or the dramatic poet ; that is , of the first rate excellence . It may be worth while , if a man thinks seriously of writing such a poem ( to name one to which Mr Ilillhouse alludes ) as Samor , or Leonidas , or Madoc , or the Araucana , or the Henriade , to cast about him for a subject ; to choose the right school , and obey all its laws . But the poet of epic genius is a school to himself , and critical disquisition on eras and countries , as far as such poets are concerned , is rather a subsequent description of the facts relative to their productions , than a direction , which a subsequent kindred genius can need , or will follow . There is one school , however , to which even genius may be exhorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has wrought its greatest wonders . It is that school , in which Classic , and Romantic , and Hebrew are alike unknown ; where ancient and modern cease to stand in contrast ; the school of Nature . To the conceptions of this school belong the child of Hector , terrified at his father 's plume ; and the father setting his helmet 10 the ground , not so much that he may pray to the Divinity with his head uncovered , as to relieve his infant 's terrors . In the fourth book of the IEneid , Virgil bursts away from the shackles of a cold imitation , is natural , and is beautiful . And what is it but nature , the human passions and affections , which , infused by Dante and by Milton into the breasts of // angels and demons , enable us to symp'ithize with beings in themselves too far above us or beneath us , for the uses of poetry . In this school , Shakspeare is most uniformly the master . He paints men ; historically they are often most remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about as much like the inhabitants of EnAand before the Romans , as they are like the Greeks or the Trojans . But it is no matter what he calls them . The historic names of Kent and Gloster may be grouped with Gonerils and Regans ; the dynasty of Bruto with those of York and Lancaster . So too with his dramas in the region of ancient history . He sets before us men , and calls them Romans . In manners and tone , they are not Romans ; but they are something better , they are men . Alien , on the other band , introduces us to a circle of exceedingly senatorial and stately characters , who are dressed in a toga , swear by the immortal gods , and are Romans every inch of them , but are not men . it is acting , stage effect ; not life and reality . And yet we hold of Alfieri , that he is the most gifted of those , to whom the true poetical inspiration has not been given . He added to talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty ; and it ought to be some title to consideration with an American critic , that he dedicated a tragedy to Washington . But we have wandered farther than we designed from the immediate business before us . We owe to Mr Hillhouse acknowledgments like those , which we have already rendered to Mr Justice Story . He deserves the thanks of the community for a performance of great beauty , spirit , and taste ; and for having done so much to add celebrity to the literary anniversary on which it was delivered . Besides a great deal of good sense , ingenious remark , and elegant learning in this discourse , there is , as might have been expected from Mr Hilihouse , not a little genuine poetry .
