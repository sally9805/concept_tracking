Covers , Edges and Spine Main text THE FRONTIER HOUSE . BY THE AUTHOR OF NORTHWOOD . ' I SHALL return before dark , ' said Edward Abbot to his young wife , as he kissed their boy , and laid it in her arms . There is no danger , Rebecca . ' But my dream of those frightful savages , Edward , ' said she . Oh ! that should not frighten you , ' he replied . Remember you had been hearing Indian stories all the evening , and the wise man says , " a dream cometh through the multitude of business , " which our good Mr Walker explains as meaning whatever most engrosses our thoughts , particularly just before we fall asleep . There have not been any traces of the savages discovered this season , and I should be sorry to raise an alarm in the town merely on account of a dream . ' But you know , Edward , they are a secret , as well as terrible enemy , ' said Mrs Abbot , and raised her mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when tears seem ready to start , and yet are checked by the fear of giving pain to the one the heart loves , that a fond husband finds it so difficult to withstand . I will not go to the garrison to day , ' said he , laying down his hat . But you promised your father , and he expects you on important business , ' said Mrs Abbot . You must go . I know my fears are childish , but they shall not make me wicked . I am too apt to think my security depends entirely on your presence . I forget the One mighty to save can defend me , and that trust in Him is a shield to the Christian . You had better go . ' Not without you , ' said her husband , who now began to feel the fears she was endeavouring to shake off . Come , prepare our little Edward and we will go down together . If there has been any alarm we will not return to night . ' Rebecca paused a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtilties of the ancient schoolmen are not so perplexing , so difficult of explanation , so contradictory , as are often the feelings and wishes of the human heart . Scarce five minutes had elapsed since Rebecca would have thought permission to accompany her husband would have obviated every inconvenience , and been attended with no danger . But other considerations now arose . Edward had been summoned to attend a public meeting on affairs of the town . Should she go with him it might excite notice , for the ladies of those days seldom visited , and should inquiries be made she could hardly satisfy them without alluding to her fears , and then her dream must be told to justify her fears , and there was no telling where or when the excitement would stop . And moreover her husband might incur reproof from the elders for listening to his wife 's fears and dreams , and thus raising agitations among the people . All these things might occur because the wife of Edward Abbot could not stay alone one afternoon . I will have more fortitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a fool of you , though I appear like one myself . I will not go . It is nearly a mile , and you have no time to spare to carry the babe , or wait for me , and I ought not to go  --  so do not let me hinder you another moment . ' It was in vain Edward urged her to accompany him . The more she saw his generous anxiety on her account , the more she labored to suppress her fears , till finally she persuaded him , and herself too , that she felt no uneasiness at all from the prospect of passing three hours alone , and Edward departed . How much interest is given to the ruins of a temple , castle , or fortification , by having a story of suffering , a legend of love or tale of heroism connected with the memory of the crumbling fabrics ! Even a rugged mountain or narrow lake , if associated with the history of human feelings and passions , becomes more attractive to the cultivated mind than the resorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild and beautiful places of our own land are nearly destitute . Improvement does not pause in its career to preserve a relic of the olden times , and industry labors to convert everything into a source of immediate profit . This course of proceeding is doubtless most convenient , but it may be questioned whether it be the most patriotic . The love of country is a species of pride , compounded of lofty and sacred recollections of the worth and achievements of our ancestors , and that vanity which is fostered by knowing the importance which other nations attach to our history and traditions . Probably Scott 's Lady of the-Lake ' imparts more national pride to a Scotsman than he would feel in contemplating a rail road from Edinburgh to London . This pride , created by the productions of genius , is perfectly compatible with our republican habits and institutions . Indeed , nothing would more contribute to deepen , to perpetuate the love of liberty and our country , than well told legends of our ancestors . Their piety , ardor , sufferings , constancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty , tender , or romantic , and yet differing materially in character from the adventures of European romance . Our fictions , if well narrated , would now excite more intense interest than the feats of knights or the fortunes of princes , because the deeds of American daring were performed by men either to defend or perpetuate principles , rights , and possessions , which the enlightened and liberal of every country feel to be most interesting and important , and compared with which , the wild deeds of chivalry and the exploits of the crusaders appear disgusting or preposterous , criminal or trivial . This little sketch , however , does not pretend to be even a sample of what may be wished , and , indeed , expected from the gifted spirits of our land . It is only the record of conjugal and maternal love , the same in all ages and in every nation . The house of Edward Abbot stood on the western bank of the Merrimack , nearly a mile from the present village of Concord , then called Rumford . Edward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the garrisons or fortified houses , and he had thus obtained the reputation of remarkable courage , of which he was quite as proud as a dashing blade of these polished days would be in accepting a challenge to a duel . His wife , too , participated in his triumph , and the wish to spare him mortification was a powerful motive to inspire her with resolution to overcome her own fears and allow him to depart , when , from the presentiment she felt that danger was nigh , she would , by the superstition of the times , have been justified in detaining , or at least , accompanying him . But she saw him depart without tears , watched him from the small window till he entered the forest , and then betook herself to her household concerns . Yet she could not forbear going frequently to the door , and sometimes she would go forth and gaze all around their little domain , and then watch the progress of the sun , with an expression of countenance that , to an observer , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . Everything abroad was in perfect quietness . There was scarce a breath of air perceptible , and the waters of the Merrimack flowed without a ripple . The calm July sky looked a deeper and more heavenly blue , seen as it was by Rebecca from a spot circumscribed by tall trees , now clothed with such a fulness of foliage as made the forest look dark and almost impenetrable . Close around the house were planted corn and vegetables , and a field of wheat , in front of the dwelling , stretched in unbroken green to the river 's brink . There was not a sound to be heard save the chirping of a robin , that had built her nest on a chestnut which stood close to the southeast corner of the house , the only tree suffered to grow within the inclosure of Edward . The young birds were fully fledged , and , under the guidance of the parents , were about quitting their nest . Rebecca watched their movements , the old birds now encouraging , now seeming to chide their timid offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slight as the circumstance was , it touched Rebecca with a sense of her loneliness . Even the birds have left me , ' said she to herself , and pressing her boy closer to her bosom , she burst into tears . Rebecca might well be excused these tears and feelings , for though a wife and mother , she was hardly seventeen . And then Rebecca possessed an advantage that , in the eyes of young gentlemen , cancels all feminine weaknesses  --  she was very beautiful . A lady now displaying similar charms would , for her face , be entitled to the epithets of divine , angelic , Grecian , Madonna , while the gracefulness of her figure would be well understood by all , travelled or untravelled , if just compared with the Venus de Medicis . But the primitive language of our excellent ancestors conveyed the idea of beauty without all this waste of words . They simply and briefly called Rebecca an exceeding comely young woman . ' Yet Rebecca felt no pride on this account , nor ever dreamed of gaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then but little of what we call social intercourse , meaning balls , parties , &c.; among the people , but there was deep , and fervent , and faithful domestic affection . The former has greatly improved since the period of which I am writing , but , if we credit the bard , and believe that Corruption shakes , when Peril could not part The Love , whose deadliest foe is human art ! ' we must not imagine every advantage is reserved for our own times . Rebecca watched the sun till it had sunk behind the western hills , and then she watched its beams on the clouds till the last faint tints had departed , and , fixing her eyes steadfastly on that part of the forest from which she expected to see her husband emerge , she sat at the door , with her child in her arms , watching in vain for his appearance . The room into which she occasionally glanced , looked so gloomy and desolate she could not endure to enter it . Indeed , as the evening waxed later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange figures , and faces with gleaming eyes , such as she had beheld in her dream , moving around the dusky apartment . Ashamed of these fears , and knowing her husband , when he came , would chide her for thus exposing herself and her child to the evening dews , she breathed a prayer to Him who stilled the tempest , and entered the house . Her first care , after placing her infant in his cradle , was to light a candle , and then , more reassured , she took her Bible . The Bible was the talisman of our ancestors . It guarded them from evil , and guided them to good . Its pages were a direction in every difficulty , and its promises a resource in every trial . Rebecca read , and prayed alternately , mingling the idea of Edward , his safety , and return with every thought and wish , but still he came not . She had no means of ascertaining the lapse of time , except by the length of candle consumed or the stars , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past midnight . Again and again she went forth and examined with searching glance around , but nothing could she see except the dark forest , in the distance , and , close around her dwelling , the black stumps that stood like sentinels on guard , while nothing was heard save the soft murmur of the water , and at times , a low rustling as the breeze stirred the leaves of the chestnut tree . At length , as she stood at the corner of her house , beneath the shade of that tree , looking earnestly towards the woods , she thought she perceived something emerge from their shadow . If she did , it vanished instantly . She kept her eyes fixed on the spot . A bright starlight enabled her to discern objects quite distinctly , even at a distance , especially when her faculties were roused and stimulated both by hope and fear . After some time she again , and plainly , saw a human figure . It rose from the ground , looked and pointed towards her house , and then again disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window , and probably had attracted the notice of the savages , whom , she could no longer doubt , were approaching . They had , as she fancied , waylaid and murdered her husband . They were coming to capture , perhaps murder , her and her child . What should she do ? She never thought of attempting to escape without her babe ; but in what direction should she fly , when , perhaps , the Indians surrounded the house ? There was one moment of terrible agony , when the mangled form of her husband seemed before her , and she heard , in idea , the shrieks of her babe beneath savage tortures , till her breath failed , and reason seemed deserting her . But she made a strong effort to recall her wandering senses , and then , with her eyes and clasped hands raised to heaven , she took her resolution . With a noiseless step she entered her dwelling , extinguished the light , took her infant in her arms , and again stole softly forth , creeping along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whence she had first seen the object that alarmed her . Here she stood perfectly still . Her infant lay on her bosom in profound sleep , as quiet and seemingly as breathless as though his spirit had already departed . She did not wait long before the same figure again rose , looked around , and then sank down as before . The moment it disappeared Rebecca passed swift and softly as a shadow over the space that separated the house from the chestnut tree . This tree was an uncommonly large one , and there was a separation of the trunk into two branches , about three feet from the ground , where Rebecca thought it possible she might be concealed . She gained it , and placed herself in a position which allowed her to watch the door of her dwelling . All was silent for a long time  --  more than an hour , as she thought , and she began to doubt the reality of what she had seen , imagining she had been deceived and taken a stump for a human figure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her situation was extremely uncomfortable , when suddenly a savage crept by her between the house and tree . As another and another followed , it was with difficulty she suppressed her screams . But she did suppress them , and the only sign she gave of fear was to press her infant closer to her bosom . They reached the door and a sound of surprise at finding it open , was uttered by the first savage , and replied to by the second , in the Indian language . After a short consultation they entered , and Rebecca soon saw a light gleam , and supposed they had kindled it to search for her . Her pulse beat wildly ; yet still she hoped to escape . It was not probable that they would search a tree so near the house ; they would rather suppose she had fled to a distance . Presently a crackling noise was heard in the house , the light flashed from the door and window , the Indians raised their wild yell as they rushed out , and danced around with frantic gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , the only sign she gave of fear was , as she unloosed the handkerchief from her neck and threw it over her child 's face to screen his eyes from the glare of light that might awaken him , to press him closer and closer to her heart . The house was unfinished ; there was no plastering to delay , for a moment , the progress of the fire , which had been kindled in the centre of the apartment , and fed by all the combustibles the savages could find in the dwelling . The flame streamed upwards , and soon caught the rafters and boards , and it seemed scarce five minutes from the time Rebecca first saw the light till the blaze burst through the roof . The atmosphere , rarified by the heat around the burning building , suddenly expanded , and the colder and more dense air rushing in , it seemed as if the wind had violently arisen , and it drove the thick smoke , and showered the burning cinders directly on the chestnut tree . Rebecca felt the scorching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of respiration . She grew dizzy , yet , still , the only movement she made was to turn her child a little in her arms that he might be more effectually shielded from the smoke and cinders . At that moment one of the savages approached , in the wild movements of his war dance , close to the tree . An eddy of wind swept away the smoke ; the light fell full on the pale face of Rebecca ; her eyes , as if by the power of fascination , were rivetted on the Indian ; his fiery glance was raised towards her , and their gaze met . The savage gave a start , and the note of his war song was shriller as he intently regarded his victim . Suddenly he turned away . Rebecca murmured a prayer and resigned herself to death as she heard them all send forth a prolonged whoop . My boy ! my husband ! we shall meet , we shall all meet in heaven ! ' she cried . But why did not the savages approach ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bright glare , and she saw the three Indians flying , with the speed of frighted deer , to the covert of the wood . She did not pause to consider what had caused their flight ; but obeying that instinct which bids us shun the present danger , she sprang from the tree and rushed towards the river . She recollected a spot where the bank projected , beneath which , during the summer months , the bed of the river was nearly dry ; there she should , at least , be secure from the fire . And there she sheltered herself . Her feet were immersed in water , and she stood in a stooping posture to screen herself from observation should the savages return to seek her . But her infant slumbered peacefully . None of her fears or dangers disturbed his repose , and when the morning light allowed her to gaze on his sweet face , tears of joy and thankfulness flowed fast down her cheeks , that she had been enabled thus to shield that dear , innocent one from the savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of people approaching , and soon recognised the voices of her friends from the garrison . Rebecca and her child were conveyed to the village , which her husband , she found , had left about sunset on the preceding evening . Nothing was known , or could be discovered of his fate ; the inhabitants had been alarmed by the light from the burning building , and as soon as the morning was sufficiently advanced to allow them to penetrate the forest , they hastened to discover the cause of the fire . Grief for the loss of her husband , combined with the terrors she had suffered , threw Rebecca into a violent fever , and her life was despaired of ; but just as the disorder seemed approaching a fatal termination , Edward Abbot arrived at Rumford . He was surprised , while walking homeward , by four Indians , one of whom seized his rifle , while another struck him such a blow on the head with his tomahawk , as totally to deprive him , for several hours , of all recollection . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree , his hands bound and an Indian guarding him . All efforts to escape he found would be in vain , and he silently submitted to his fate . About day the three savages joined the one who guarded him , and , conversing hastily a few moments , they began a hurried march . Edward perceived one of the Indians examining him often and attentively . At length , on the fourth day , as the savage was alone with the prisoner , he , by signs , questioned Edward concerning the house where he used to reside . Edward made , on the white birch with a coal taken from their fire , a drawing of his little plantation and house , including , of course , the chestnut tree . The Indian surveyed it in silence , and Edward thought no more of the matter . Early the next morning Edward was awakened by the same Indian , who motioned him to rise , and follow him . The rest of the party were not in sight . Edward obeyed , and followed him two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borders of the Merrimack . The Indian then pointed in the direction of Concord , and instantly disappeared in the woods . It is , perhaps , unnecessary to add that Edward 's presence operated much more favorably on Rebecca than had all the remedies prescribed by the good Doctor Carter , and she soon recovered . The conduct of the Indian excited great curiosity , and made much talk in the village , but , for a long time , the mystery baffled all conjecture . After many months an Indian who could speak English , explained the secret . It seemed that several years before Rebecca was married , an Indian , with his wife and child , came into the house of her father , and asked for food . The old people were absent , and a hired man , acting as many do when clothed in a little brief authority , ' ordered them from the house . Rebecca , then a playful , laughing girl , interposed and prevented them from being thus inhospitably treated . She brought forth the best food the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed it ; and to that act of charity , so gracefully performed , she was indebfed for her own , and her child 's life , and her husband 's liberty .
