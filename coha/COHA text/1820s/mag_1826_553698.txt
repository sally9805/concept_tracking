txt ART . VII. - Report of the Committee of Foreign Relations , of the lb use of Representatives of the United States , to which were referred the . Memorials of certain . Merchants , preying Relief for Losses sustained by French Spoliations. 1824 . THE claim of the citizens of the United States for French spoliations , is one of immense amount . Studious to avoid exaggeration , and to reduce our statements even within the severest truth , we rated , in an article in our last number , the whole amount of American claims for foreign spoliations of all kinds , at twenty millions of dollars . Our readers will probably think we greatly erred on the side of noderation , when it is recollected , that Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry , in 1799 , stated the claim for French spoliations alone // at fifteen millions , and that it has been sometimes computed , that , under the French imperial decrees , over fifty millions of American property wore confiscated . If these estimates be thought extravagant , our own will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , we gave a very brief sketch of one portion of the French claims . rhose claims may very suitably be divided into two general classes , those arising out of spoliations and other sources , prior to the Louisiana Convention in 1803 ; and those subsequent to that period , growing out of the outrages exercised upon our commerce , under the renowned imperial decrees . The state and prospects of these two sorts of claims are entirely dissimilar , and they will therefore require to be separately treated . The few remarks which we made , in the article above mentioned , were confined to the claims of the first class , being such whose obligation is alleged by the claimants , to have devolved upon their own country , in consequence of a voluntary renunciation of them by the government of the United States , on behalf of its citizens , in consideration of certain renunciations made by the government of France , of political claims upon the United States . Having in our foriner remarks , for the sake of brevity , treated this claim as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were , and those that were not , provided for by the Louisiana Convention , we shall now , for the sake of clearness , consider each class separately ; a course of proceeding dictated by the very different ground , on which the two classes have been made to stand , by the measures pursued for their recovery . We shall now consider the claims , which were excluded from the Louisiana Convention ; and briefly relate the history of the manner , in which they arose , were prosecuted , and renounced . By the treaty of commerce and amity , concluded between the United States and France , in 1778 , the principle of free ships free goods was solemnly recognised in the twentythird article , and an undisturbed liberty of trading to the enemies of either party , was respectively stipnlated to each other by the United States and France . In violation of this article of the treaty , then in force , on the ninth of May 1793 , the French National Convention passed // a decree , * declaring enemy 's goods on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private armed vessels of France , to bring into port neutral vessels laden with provisions , and bound to an enemy 's port . On the appearance of this decree , Mr G. Morris , then our minister at Paris , remonstrated against it , and so far prevailed , that the National Convention , on the twentythird of the same month , declared , that the vessels of the United States are not comprised in the regulations of the decree of the ninth of May . ' In communicating this gratifying declaration to Mr Morris , the French minister for foreign affairs , le Brun , observed , You will there find a new confirmation of the principles , from which the French people will never depart , with regard to their good friends and allies , the United States of America . ' This letter of le Brun 's was dated May 26th ; and on the 28th of May , the ( leclaration communicated in it was revoked by the National Convention ! Such was the levity of that atrocious assemblage . The truth was , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable American ship , the Laurens , bribed the leaders of the Convention to rescind , on the twentyeighth , the declaration which they had made on the twentythird , and which the minister of foreign affairs had communicated to Mr Morris , on the 26th of May . So little disguise was necessary in these affairs , that the owners of the privateer boasted beforehand , that the declaration of May 23d would be rescinded . Mr Morris again remonstrated and with success . On the first of July the Convention revoked their last order , and again liberated the commerce of the United States , from the operation of the original decree of May 9th ; and this revocation was declared to be made , in conformity with the provisions of the treaty of 1778 . M. Desforgues , who had succeeded le Brun , as minister for foreign affairs , in communicating this revocation to Mr Morris , observes , I am very happy in being able to give you this new proof of the paternal sentiments of the French people for their allies , and of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ** ' * , the treaties subsisting between the two republics . ' In twentyseven days this last decree was repealed . We would here // notice an oversight of the Committee , who made the report of April , 1802 . They state , that the decree of ' May 9th , after having been several times repealed and reenacted , was finally repealed on the 27th of July following . ' Far otherwise . The decree of May 9th , after having been twice revoked , was finally restored , in its application to American vessels , July 27th , in permanent violation of the twentythird article of the treaty of 1778 . The only relaxation made , was the exemption from capture of American vessels , bound with provisions to an enemy 's ports . In the course of the years 1793 and 1794 , a new source of injury arose , in a long and distressing embargo at Bordeaux . A list of one hundred and three American vessels detained under this embargo , to the incalculable detriment of the property embarked in them , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1795 . As the claims for indemnity , for losses sustained by this embargo , formed a portion of those provided for by the Louisiana Convention , no further account of them would be here in place . The number of American vessels seized and sent into France , under the decree of May 9th , 1793 , or detained by the embargo , or in other ways , was so great , that Mr Monroe , who succeeded Mr Morris , was led to constitute Mr Skipwith a general agent , for collecting and presenting them to himself and the French government . In the performance of this duty , an amount of injury and outrage inflicted by France , on our commercial interests , was disclosed , which can now scarcely be credited . Mr Skipwith drew up a report , bearing date October , 1794 , and addressed to Mr Monroe . After observing , that he has not as yet received from the consuls all the documents , necessary for presenting a full view of these injuries and outrages , he adds , fiom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the information I have collected from the captains present , I can assure you there are near three hundred sail of American vessels , now in the ports of France , all of whom have suffered , or are suffering , more or less delay and difficulties , of which the examples annexed will afford you a general view . ' Mr Skipwith then proceeds to enumerate and classify the modes and forms of the oppressive treatment , imposed upon the Americans , and names first , // The capture indiscriminately of our vessels at sea , by the vessels of war of the republic . ' A copy of this report , accompanied with documents illustrative of its statements , was laid before the French government , and prc.duced a joint decree of the committees of public safety , finance , commerce , and supplies , dated November 15th , 1794 . This decree* revived and declared in force that ofJuly27th , 1793 , above mentioned ; it declared , that the principle of free ships free goods ' should not be recognised in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recognised . It provided for the compensation of losses sustained by neutral vessels , in consequence of the embargo at Bordeaux , and for the payment of supplies furnished by Americans to St Domingo . The satisfaction yiel&amp;ed under these two last heads was partial , inadequate , and attended with great delay , while the provisions of the decree perpetuated some of the most serious violations of the treaty of 1778 . This being the subject of contin4ded and persevering complaints , made on behalf of our merchants , on the 4th of January , 1795 , the committee of public safety repealed those parts of the decree of November preceding , which violated the treaty of alliance . The leaders in France , at this time , appear to have felt a wish to conciliate America , and such were the advices from our minister there , that General Washlngton , in his message to Congress , February 28th , 1795 , t makes the following statement . Our minister near the French republic has urged compensation for the injuries , which our commerce has sustained from captures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agents of that republic with our citizens , and for the embargo at Bordeaux . He has also pressed an allowance for the money voted by Congress , for relieving the inhabitants of St Domingo . It affords me the highest pleasure to inform Congress , that perfect harmony reigns between the two republics ; and that those claims are in a train of being discu8sed with candor , and of being amicably adjusted . ' In fact , as we have observed , the republic , at this time , seems to have been disposed to act with justice . Mr Skipwith // was incessantly employed in prosecuting the various classes of claims , and large sums of money were actually paid , partly in specie , and partly in assignats , to our shipmasters and merchants. * Had the sums of money , thus appropriated , been promptly applied to a liquidation of each case of injury as it accrued , it is not impossible that they might have covered no small portion of what was due . The cruel delays , the subsequent destruction of perishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid depreciation of paper , produced the unfortunate result of a large provision made by the French , with very little benefit to the claimants . The friendly disposition of the French government invariably fluctuated , with their political prospects . The success of Bonaparte in Italy , raised the crest of the conquering republic , and in the course of the year 1796 , the old causes of complaint were revived , and new ones added . On the 2d of July , 1796 , the favorable decree of January , 1795 , was repealed by a n*.w decree of the following purport , that all neutral or allied powers shall without delay be notified , that the flag of the French republic will treat neutral vessels , either as to confiscation , as to searches , or captures , in the same manner as they shall suffer the English to treat them . ' Under color of this decree , the most wide spread devastation was let loose unon our commerce . The subordinate agents of the Directory were forward to emulate the example of the government at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Hugues and Lebas , special agents of the Directory to the Windward Islands , made a decree , that all vessels loaded with contraband articles , were liable to seizure and condemnation , without making any discrimination in favor of those which might be bound to neutral , and even to French ports . The manner in which this and other similar decrees were enforced , was , if possible , more oppressive , than the decrees themselves . All legal forms were disregarded , and the mode of proceeding was reduced to the exercise of brute force . One example may suffice . The Patty sailed from Ncw London on the 31st July , 1795 , ( of course before the decree last mentioned was made in the The document marked D , State Papers , lIt , 6 , will sufficiently illustrats. iitijs remark . // West Indies , to say nothing of being known in America , ) bound to St Barts . On the 2d of September , the vessel was captured by a French cruiser , and carried into Guadaloupe . The captain was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist thrust into the captain 's face , were , I have confiscated your vessel and cargo , you - rascal . ' Three days after , the captain inquired of Victor Liugues when his vessel and cargo would be tried and the answer was , they bad already been tried , and the captain might go about his business . The captain afterwards received a certificate of his trial and condemnation ; but in many cases even this poor favor was insultingly refused ; and our unfortunate ship masters , ignorant of the language , without friends , beset by the harpies of office , stripped even to their clothes , and often l ) personally assaulted , were left to beg their way to some neutral island , before they could even make their protest . These crying insults seemed to grow into a sort of pastime , with the petty tyrants of the day . On the 27th of November , the same year , another decree was passed by a new set of commissioners to the Windward Islands , which ought to be quoted entire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels and privateers , are anthorised to stop and bring into the J ) orts cf the colony , American vessels bound to English ports , or coming from the said ports. * *rfhe vessels , which are already taken , or shall be hereafter shall remain in the ports of the colony , till it shall be otherwise ordered . At the Cape , the 7th Frii*aire , in the fifth year of the French republic , one and indivisible . ' Signed on the record of the proc*s verbal ; Leblane , president ; Santhonax , Raimond , commissioners ; Pascal , secretary general. ** This most extraordinary violence was not confined to the petty tribunal , from which the decree in question was issued . Captures were made by the French privateers , in Europe , on the ground that all American vessels coming from , or bound to England , were good prize , and the French consul at Cadiz avowed his determination to condemn them , . ppealing to the decree of the Directory of July 2d , 1796 , for his warrant . // On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugues and Lehas authorised the capture of all neutral vessels , destined to any of the Windward or Leeward Islands , in America , which had been delivered up to the English , and occupied or defended by emigrants , viz ; Martinique , St Lucie , Tobago , Demarara , I3erhice , and Essequibo , for the wind*vard isles ; and Port an Prince , St Marc , L'Archaye , and Jewmie , for the leeward . All vessels sailin to and from any of the islands , are , with their cargoes , declared good prize by this decree , as well as all vessels , which shall have cleared out under the vague denomination of the West Irtdies. ** On the 2d of March , 1797 , the Directory issued a decree , prefaced by a laborious preamble , in which almost all the previous oppressive regulations were reenacted , nd new and exceedingly injurious ones added , especially that notorious one relative to the Role d ' Equipage , which swept so much of the remnant of our commerce from the seas . This decree formally declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conformity with the provisions of Jay 's treaty with England ; in other words , that , in some of its most characteristic features , it should be annulled . The manner in which this , as well as all the other decrees , was enforced , added much to its severity . It was not merely applied from the date of its publication , but a retrospective action was given to it , against American ships , which had previously , on any other pretence , or no pretence , been sent into France . The number of vessels captured , under this last decree , was very great . Between August , 1796 , and June , 1797 , according to a list prepared for the Philadelphia Gazette , and probably not containing all the cases , three hundred and eight American vessels suffered under the illegal decrees of the French ; the greater part of them after that of March 2d was issued . Not content with the comprehensive terms of the decrees , the French officers and agents subjected the captains and seamen to personal violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , testimony that would condemn their vessels . Mr Rufus King , then , as now , our minister to London , in a letter bearing date April 19th , 1797 , mentions the case of Captain Martin , of the Cincinnatus of // Baltimore , who was taken on board the French cruiser that had captured his ship , and tortured for more than three hours , ' to induce him to make such declarations , concerning his ship and cargo , as would procure their condemnation . Captain Martin 's thumbs , ' adds Mr King , which I exarnined , bear the marks of the screws , and the scars will go with h*ri to his grave . ' In the decrees , of which we have now enumerated the chief , and in captures , seizures , and spoliations , committed by the French cruisers on American vessels indiscriminately , without the authority even of these decrees , such as it was , originate the claims we are now considering . They formed , of course , a standing subject of reclamation and of complaint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Morris , and Mr Monroe ; and they were to have been pressed by General Pinckney , had he been received by that government as Mr Monroe 's successor . On the failure of his separate embassy , a commission of three envoys , Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry , was sent to France ; hut , as is well known , this commission was not received by the Directory . The subject of the claims of our citizens on France , of every description , was particularly treated in their instructions ; ud after an enumeration of these claims , in their general nature and quality , it is observed in the instructions as follows ; Although the reparation for losses sustained by citizens of the United States , in consequence of irregular or ille*al captures or condemnations , or forcible seizures or detentions , is of very high importance , and is to be pressed with the greatest earnestness , vet it is not to be insisted upon as an indispensable condition of the proposed treaty . You are not , however , to renounce these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assumed by the United States , as a loan to the French Government . ' This last clause referred to a proposal , already made by France to our government , and repeated in one of the unofficial communications of the emissaries of Talleyrand with our envoys , that the United States should assume this debt as a loan to France. * During their residence in France , though not received by the Directory in an official character , our envoys addressed // a most able memorial to the French minister , in which they divide the American claims into two classes . The first consists of such , as are uncontroverred by the French Government , and are substantially those provided for by the Louisiana Convention . After enumerating the varieties of claims in this class , our envoys add , that they pass to complaints still more important for their amount , more interesting for their nature , and more serious in their consequences , ' viz. the spoliations wider the v* rious decrees of the French Government , issued in violation of the treaty of 1778 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particular notice that , under the head of claims uncontroverted by France , are those for captures under the decree of i ay 9 , 1793 . In a conversation between Talleyrand and our envoys , detailed in the journal of the latter , * the French minister endeavored to induce our envoys to assume the claims of our citizens , as a loan to France , remarking that they had claims on the I*rench Government for property taken from American citizens . Some of those claims are probably just . ' In the ne*otiation of Talleyrand with Mr Gerry , after the departure of the other ministers , a negotiation which may be called official , the French minister thus expressed himself . With respect to the claims of American citizens on the French republic , if the latter sun ld not be able to pay them when adjusted , and the United States would assume and pay them , France would reimburse the amount thereof ; t and , in this proposal , Mr Gerry expresses the opinion , that rralley* rand was sincere . The manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of another , the following year , are too familiar to be dwelt upon . The instructions to the second commission , consistin of i'fessrs Murray , Ellsworth , and Davie , have not been made public . They form a part of the papers , whose communication was asked by the Senate and House , at the close of the first Session of the eighteenth Congress , and then delayed on account of their voluminousness . As the state of things , with respect to the claims , was not at all changed , since the instructions of JXIessrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry were drawn up , it is highly probable * State Papers , IV . 89 . VOL . XXII. - NO. 50. // that the same instructions were given to Messrs Murray , Davie , and Ellsworth ; that they were directed to press the claim as of high importance , by no means to renounce it , but not to make it a sine qua non condition of the treaty to be negotiated . The new American Commission found a new government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Convention of 1800 . The second article of that Convention is in the following terms ; The Ministers Plenipotentiary of the two parties , not being able to agree , at present , respecting the treaty of alliance of 1778 , and the treaty of amity and commerce , of the same date , and the Convention of November , 1788 , nor upon the indemnities mutually due or claimed ; the parties will negotiate further on these subjects , at a convenient time , and until they may have agreed upon these points , the said treaties and Convention shall have no operation . ' The fifth article provides for a liquidation of dehts hetxveen the two countries , as if no misunderstandng had happened ; but this provision was not to extend to indemnities claimed for captures and confiscations . The Convention was sent to the United States , and ratified in the Senate , with the exception of the second article , which provided for further negotiation on the indemnities mutually claimed or due . In this form the Convention was returned to France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , as to the motives of the American senate in expunging the second article . As Mr Murray 's correspondence has not been officially communicated , his statements to the French Government , on this subject , are not certainly known . He is understood , however , to have accounted for the expunging of the second article , from the wish of the Senate to preclude any future standing subject of contention between the two governments , such as a reserved negotiation of this kind would be . The French Government are supposed to have stated , that a simple omission of the article , unaccoml ) ani ed by a mutual renunciation , would operate to ibeir prejudice . The claims of France on America rested on the provisions of the treaty of 1778 , and the Consular Convention of 1788 . These treaties ceasing to exist , France // would lose all claim on America ; whereas the American claims having a basis , not only in the treaty , but in the law of nations , would still lie against Fiance . To avoid this disadvantageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alternative ; either to omit the second article , accompanying the omission with a mutual renunciation , or to abandon the Convention entirely , and to leave the treaty of 1778 in force . Our minister accepted the former part of the alternative , and the treaty was ratified by Bonaparte , as First Consul , omitting the second article , with a note attached , declaring that this omission was considered by the parties , as a mutual renunciation of their claims . The Convention came hack to the United States with this conditional ratification , and on the 19th of December , 1801 , the Senate resolved , that they considered the same Convention as fully ratified . ' With respect to the claims of France on America , which are brought forward as an offset to the claims of America on France , a full idea of them can not be obtained , without perusing , in the State Papers , the correspondence between the several Ministers of the French Republic in America , with our government here ; the Reports made by the American Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary with General Piackney , and the memoir addressed by Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry to Talleyrand . The two gravest matters in controversy , however , can be specified in a word , the guaranty of the French possessions in the West Indies , and of aid to be r*endered France by America in defensive wars ; stipulated by the treaty of 1778 , and the privileges claimed by France for her consuls , under the Consular Convention of 1788 . By the guaranty , America was unquestionably bound to France , to an extent indefinite and uncertain , but calculated to be very onerous . The extent of this obligation may be partly estimated , from that clause in the instructions of our government to Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry , which authorised them to propose to the French Government , in time of war , an annual subsidy of two hundred thousand dollars , in lieu of a specific fulfilment of the guaranty . Considering this as the voluntary offer of our government , and also bearing in mind the odious nature of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , it is easy to infer that this treaty of 1778 , was regarded as a very heavy burden by our statesmen . The editor of the editioa of the Laws of the United States , whose exact acquaintance with our political history is apparent throughout the work , in a note subjoined to the Convention of 1803 , after sketching the history of our relations with France , adds , by that Convention , ( of 1801 , ) among other things , the United States were exonerated from the weighty responsibility imposed , by the treaty of alliance of 1778 , of a guarantee of the French possessions in America . Such , therefore , was the mutual renunciation , on the part of the United States and France . The latter renounced her claim upon the United States , for the fulfilment of the stipulations of the treaty of alliance , and for indemnity for injuries alleged to be sustained by France , from the failure of the United States of America to fulfil those stipulations , and also from the alleged inexecution of the Consular Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her citizens , for spoliations and injuries , under various decrees of the French Government , issued in violation of the treaty of 1778 , and of the law of nations . We shall now pursue briefly the history of the manner in which the citizens of the United States , whose claims were renounced by their own government , in consideration of a great national and political object , have sought relief and indemnity . The year after this Convention was ratified , viz , in 1802 , sundry citizens and claimants , whose tights were affected by it , applied to Congress for relief . Their memorials were referred to a committee , who made an elaborate report , consisting chiefly of an enumeration of the violent and illegal decrees of the French ; of the measures adopted by our government to procure or enforce redress ; and of the negotiation of the Convention of 1800 . After going through this historical detail , the report of the committee closes with the following paragraph ,  - -  It appears , that the exclusion of the second article of the Convention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens of the United States of America , for spoliations and depredations upon their commerce , so far as the government might // otherwise have been instrumental in obtaining such indemnities . Upon the whole view of the case , the committee submit it to the House to determine , whether the government of the United States be , in any respect , bound to indemnify the memorialists ; and whether there be any ground for discrimination between the cases of losses sustained before the Acts of 28th of May , 1798 , the 7th of July , 1798 , and the 9th of July , 1798 , and cases of losses sustained after those periods. * The acts of Congress here alluded to , are those authorising the capture of French vessels of war hovering on our coasts , and repealing the treaty of alliance of 1778 . Their bearing on this question will presently be the subject of a few remarks . It will be perceived , from the paragraph we have cited from the report of the committee , and which is the only por* tion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred , that the fact of the renunciation of these claims , by our government , is admitted . The Lommittee add the qualification , so far as the government might have been instrumental in obtaining such indemnities . ' But there is nothing , that we can perceive , in the facts of the case , to authorise this qualification . The renunciation is unlimited and unconditional . Our government renounced not only its own right to prosecute the claims , hut the right of the citizens to prosecute them , on their own account . This report of the committee came before the House , was several times discussed , but never acted upon finally . Efforts were made to procure a resolution , providing for the indemnification of the claimants , and it is understood that the divisions of the House , on this question , were in a considerable degree in accordance with the grand political division of the parties . This was the unavoidable result of the state of political controversy in the nation . The late administration had gone out of power , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . The claimants , in their declaration , were obliged to set forth and urge the aggressions of France , and this course of proceeding connected itself too directly with the general questions between the parties , not to produce a strong prejudice against the claim . In the year 1807 , the question was again brought forward by memorials from sundry claimants . These memorials // were referred to a committee of the House , whose brief report was decidedly in favorof the claimants . After referring to the report of the committee of 1802 , the committee in 1807 proceed ; From a mature consideration of the subject , and from the best judgment your committee have been able to form on the case , they are of opinion , that this government , by expunging the second article of our Convention with France , of the 30th of September , 1800 , became bound to indemnify the memorialists for those Just claims , which they otherwise would rightfully have had on the government of France , for the spoliations committed on their commerce , by the illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that power , in violation of the laws of nations , and breach of treaties then existing between the nations , which claims they were , by the rejection of the said article of the Convention , forever barred from preferming to the government of France for eompensation. * Your committee beg leave to decline giving an opinion on the precise time , when those claims ought to be commenced , or on the period for captures , after which the memorialists would not have been entitled to compensation from France , and of course can not be entitled to indemnity from the United States . ' No relief to the claimants resulted from this report . The subject was revived in 1818 , and as the act , by which the claimants were deprived of whatever remedy they could have had of the French government , was performed with the concurrence of the Senate , in the exercise of the treaty mnaking power , memorials from Portstnouth , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Charleston , were addressed to the Senate of the United States , and by them referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made . In 1822 an application was made by a few merchants of Baltimore , who addressed their memorial to the House of Representatives , in which body it was referred to the committee of foreign affairs . They reported against the claim , partly on general grounds , and partly on circumstances peculiar to the application in question . Here it is possible all prosecution of the claims would have ceased , but for two considerations , calculated to stimulate the hopes , and to heighten the sense of wrong of the claimants . One of these considerations respected the denouement of the great tragedy of the French Revolution . It had always been // objected to these claims , that in renouncing them , the government of the United States renounced nothing of value . That the claim was worth nothing , because France would not have paid it ; because , after a long and earnest negotiation , all that our commissioners could procure was a consent , on the part of the French , to negotiate further . While Bonaparte or his dynasty subsisted , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible . But an astonishing revolution had occurred ; his throne was prostrated ; and the ancient dynasty was restored , by the combined powers of Europe , under a pledge compulsory , if not voluntary , to pay the debts of Fiance . Under this circumstance , claims of old and forgotten obligation revived , as from the dead . The losses of English travellers , in the most lawless periods of the Revolution , the losses sustained by payments in assignats , the nameless and numberless encroachments on property , which signalised that stormy and perplexed crisis in Europe , were all now sternly forced into the account to be liquidated . They had been liquidated and paid . Our citizens alone could not cone , and thrust the sickle into this waving yellow harvest of indemnity ; their claim had been renounced by their own government . Farther , the government of the United States very properly seized this moment to bring forward the claims for losses , under the continental system of Napoleon . These claims were , and still are , pressed upon France . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the old system of plunder and spoliation can not comne in ; their government has renounced their claim . To strengthen the feelings which this contrast excited , the Florida treaty had just been negotiated . The claimants for French spoliations had already seen themselves shut out from the provisions of the Louisiana treaty . They had seen a class of claims , certainly not so binding on the national honor to assert , provided for out of the purchase money of that western world . This postponement of their rights was now repeated upon them . By the Florida treaty , an indemnity was provided for claims , many of them as old as theirs , and few more pressing , and which had as long been prosecuted without hope , and against hope . These facts produced no little sensation throughout the country , among those interested ; and about fifty memorials , // in the Session of 182*3 , 4 , were presented to the Senate of the United States . A step was thereupon taken by this body , which is certainly preliminary to a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings . A call was unanimously made on the President , for all the official papers bearing upon the case . Pending the result of this call , a few memorials were prematurely presented to the House of Representatives , and by them referred to the committee of foreign relations . Considering the train in which things were placed , this was an unfortunate occurrence for the claimants , and doubtless had its origin only in inadvertence . An unfavorable report was made by the committee of foreign relations ; but the decision upon it gave way to a resolution for a call , similar to that which had already been made by the Senate . The lateness of the period at which these calls were made , and the great quantity of papers embraced in it , led to a report of the then Secretary of State , in the month of May , 1824 , that the communication of the papers asked for , must be delayed till the following Session . The following Session , that of the presidential canvas , passed off without a renewal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue the subject , as they shall think expedicat . It is not impossible , that such new lights will be thrown upon the subject , by the communication of the papers alluded to , before these remarks are published , as to destroy the little interest they might otherwise possess . Inasmuch , however , as a great mass of documents may possibly come before Congress , we have thought that an analysis of the claim , such as we have now given , would , in any event , not be without its value . We now proceed to examine a few of the arguments , by which these claims have been resisted , by three out of five of the committees to which they have been referred . The first , and perhaps the most formidable , is , that the United States , after negotiating with France , among other things , on indemnity for these claims , as long as negotiation was of any avail , but entirely without success , resorted to war as the remedy . When such a proposition is advanced , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of war , and the captures made by our armed ships as acts of war . This , however , can only be admitted in popular language . Strictly speaking , a state of war did not exist . // No declaration of war , the only instrument by which a state of war can be formally constituted , was made , either by the United States *r France . No authority to make reprisals was given to our citizens , a mode by which a state of war is sometimes indirectly brought on . This is a circumstance of great moment in this argument , because it was by reprisals , that the suffering merchants might have had the opportunity of indemnifying themselves . No captures of merchant vessels were made by our armed ships , and none were authorised to be made . What then was done ? Authority was given to capture the armed vessels of France , that might be hovering on our coast , that had committed , or were likely to commit , violations on our commerce ; and to recapture our vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the French , not even these measures were retaliated . They lad probably never intended to drive us to Ivar ; and at this moment the Directory felt weak . They embargoed our ships , but issued no orders for acts of hostility , either on our armed or unarmed vessels . After a few months they went further , and ordered such intimations to be given to Mr Murray , our minister in Holland , as led to the despatch of the second commission , Messrs Murray , Ellsworth , and Davie , by whom a convention , not a treaty , was negotiated . The mode , in which the affair was prosecuted , shows that peace was considered as not interrupted ; the treaty of alliance of 1778 was recognised as still in existence ; the French national vessels captured were restored , and those which we had destroyed , or otherwise disposed of , were paid for . It is true the treaty of 1778 had been formally repealed , or declared not to exist , by an act of Congress . But most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that treaty , but of the law of nations . The act of Congress could effect nothing against claims already existing , and this is by far the greater part of those in question . Besides , it may well be a question , how far Congress can , by a direct act of legislative power , annul a treaty so as to affect obligations arising under it . At all events , the negotiations recognised no such effect in this act of Congress ; they regarded the treaties , both of // proceeds on the ground , that though misunderstandings had arisen , a state of peace had never ceased to exist . The other chief argument against the claim is , that , though the government renounced it , they renounced it only to the extent in which indemnity could have been obtained from France ; and as any indemnity was hopeless , at the time the treaty was made , our government did no injury to our citizens by this renunciation . This argument appears to us abundantly objectionable , both in principle and in fact . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has a right to take the property of the citizen , simply because it takes but a small amount . The value of these claims , at that moment , might have been small ; but they were still the property of the citizen . The indemnity due was a chose in action , of which the assignable value might be differently estimated by different persons , and rated high by none ; still , however , the claimants had a right to it themselves ; and if the government , for political objects , chose to divest them of this right , it is bound to make them a recompense . To this it may be rejoined ,  --  granted , but this recompense must be measured by the value of the thing sacrificed ; that value was null ; therefore the recompense must be nominal . This course of argument , however , is still more objectionable than the preceding . The value of a claim on the government of a civilised country , a permanent debtor , not exposed to the fluctuations of private fortunes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper the next , and if now administered by an unjust military power , may soon be administered by rulers professing to be actuated by justice ; the value of a claim on such a government is not to be estimated at its zero , because at some particular moment it happens to be worth nothing . The claim in question must be estimated according to the probability that France , in the long run , will pay its just debts . If the government of our country , therefore , sacrifices the claims of its citizens , without any compromise with them as to their indemnity , it assumes , in honor and justice , the whole debt . This is peculiarly true , when it is considered that the value of the claim depends almost wholly on the government itself . If the government shows a disposition to abandon it , and to // tolerate its nonpayment by the foreign government , the value of the claim will , by this policy , sink to nothing . But will it be honorable , when this is done , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all indemnity from our citizens , and say , it is true we sacrificed your claims , but they were worth nothing to you , and we owe you no recompense ? Might not the claimants justly reply ; it is true , at that moment our claim was worth little , but it was you who sunk its value . Had you thought proper to engraft it on the everduring youth of the republic ; had you told the French First Consul . Pint you would never renounce it , the rather as it was incurred under circumstances intima'ely affecti* the American honor ; that though you co* hi not now enforce it against his colossal power , you would lay it up in your archives , to be reproduced when the arm of America should grow strong enon h , to be listed up with effect against the injustice of Europe , and still better , till France , the metropolitan region of civilisation , should again be governed by the principles of national justice ; had you held this language , our claim would not have been worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tell us it is nothing worth ; what is it but to act over on a large national scale , that detestable villany of our bankrupt monied corporations , who buy up at a discount their own worthless rags ? But we deny that the argument in question is sound in fact . We deny that the claim was worthless . Had it not been renounced , it would have stood on the same footing as the claims of our citizens against France , for losses sustained under the continental system of Napoleon , and the decrees enforcing it . Are they worthless ? Is that claim good for nothing , which our government , by the instrn nentality of Mr Gallatin , and other able negotiators , has declared to be founded in justice , and one which it is incumbent on France to pay ? Is the property of our citizens , after the government of the country has formally taken the protection of it into its own hands , not worth anything ? For ourselves , we should be sorry to say , that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of a government , like that of France , is worth nothing . But when our government has taken it up , and has instructed its ministers to assert its justice , then to say that it is worth nothing , is to say that our govern // ment either can not , or will not , procure its citizens justice* For ourselws , we believe that it both can and will , and we have no doubt the course it is pursuing will ultimately sueceed* The French ministry have professed a illingness to examine the claim , and to settle an account with this country . They have indeed endeavored to clog the subject , by connectiag it with absurd p*'etCnsions to privileges at New Orleans . But they have not shut their ears totally against it ; it must , it will he recovered . But for the renunciation by the Convention of 1801 , the claims in question would have formed a part of the 6eneral claim against France ; for no one will say , that the present government of the country is not hound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . The claim is against France ; and France is as nuich accountable for the acts of her rulers from 1793 to 1800 , as from 1805 to 1814. claim was valuable , considered as a part of one large claim , a portion of which was actually , in two years , provided for . Up to 1800 , no discrimination had been ( lrawrl between the different grounds , on which our citizens laid claim to indemnity . The merchant , whose property had been seized under an illegal decree of the National Convention , of the Directory , or of the special agents for the Windward Islas , was considered to have as 0ood a claim on France , and to the aid of his own government in enforcing it , as the citizen whose vessel had been embargoed at Bordeaux , or who had made a contract with the French government for supplies , for which payment was withheld . The only difference in the cases was one strongly in favor of the former claim . The American citizen , who voluntarily makes a contract with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to war to protect him . But the citizen , who , lawfully pursuing his commerce on the high seas , is , in violation of the faith of treaties , and of the law of nations , arrested by the cruisers of a foreign power , actin6 under decrees as offensive to our national honor , as they are oppressive to private rights , is entitled to the national protection ; his claim is strongest , by all the obligation which the government of the country has , to vindicate its honor and the inviolability of its flag . Accordingly , Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry , after recapitulating the claims of a private nature , pass to those fot // spoliations , as of far greater importance . And yet by the Convention of 1800 , the claims for spoliations were renounced , and the private claims reserved ; and , by the Louisiana Convention , provision was made for the payment of the latter . Now , could not the claimants for spoliations reasonably insist , that while the private claims were so valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of our government was concerned as much as that of France , should never be abandoned , nor sacrificed without an equivalent ? Was it not reasonable , that if France had been brought to pay one part , she would sooner or later pay the other ? And do we ascribe a becoming language to our government , when we represent it as Saying to the claimants for spoliations , We have insisted , that the private debts of the French Government to our citizens shall be paid , but for the losses sustained under decrees affecting our national rights and sovereignty , we can and will do nothing for you . ' Again , let us consider the case of the Spanish claims . Who , in 1800 , would have thought of preferring the Spanish claim to the French ? Supposing their foundation in justice to be equally good , which no one will controvert , who would not have sooner expected justice from France than Spain ; or rather , considering the relations of the two countries with each other , who would have expected any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spain would imitate the example ? But yet , in the course of events , the Spanish claim has proved good ; our government kept a protecting hand upon it , and in the end has succeeded in negotiating a treaty , by which it secured not only an ample indemnity to the claimants , but a great national object , second only in importance to the acquisition of Louisiana . With what reason then can it be urged , that a claim on France was worthless , when one on Spain has been liquidated almost at par ? It will be replied , perhaps , that the claim on Spain was always good , because there were vast Spanish possessions on our southern and south*western boundary ; all Florida and Louisiana ; out of which we might , in the last resort , take our indemnity , if we could get it in no other way ; while France had no possession on which we could lay our hand . This , however , is arguing only from the position of things at the moment , without taking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It needs not be said , that to the eye of the statesman , no important political step would ever be conteniplated , on the assun ) ption that France had no territory in our vicinity . The monuments of French power and enterprise which encircle us , as with a belt , from Nova Scotia to New Orleans , would present themselves to his mind , and warn him that what had been might again be ; while the shifting spectacle of every part of the world would confirm the truth , that nothing is more familiar in the political system , than a change of sovereignty in colonial possessions . How , in fact , can a suggestion now be plausibly made , that this claim was worthless , because France had no adjacent territories , which we could appropriate to ourselves , when it is considered that the very day after the Convention of 1800 was signed , France actually became possessed of territory on the American continent , more than equal to the whole of the United States , and that she was ready to cede this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us ? No one can believe , that if the claim for spoliations had not been renounced , it would not , as well as the claim for private dqbts on France , have been compromised at the time of the Louisiana purchase . And it is equally apparcut , that this immense , and , to the United States , all important territory , would have been abundantly valuable enough to furnish the means of the compromise . Farther , that it can with no justice be said the claim was worthless , may be argued from the estimation in which it was held by our government , and by the French Government . Our government instructed its ministers not to renounce it ; and these ministers estimated it at fifteen millions . The French offset this claim against all their claims on this country . It is necessary only to cast an eye over the correspondence of the French ministers to this country , to see that they regarded their claims as very important , and yet they offset them against the claim of our citizens for spoliations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed to propose to France a st4sidy of two hundred thousand dollars , in acquittal of one p*art of the obligations , which the treaty of alliance of t778 imposed upon us . It is a fact , that may assist us to estimate the value of the claim , that the two governments agreed to offset it against all the French claims // on us , one single article of which , viz. the fulfilment of a part of the stipulations of the treaty of alliance , was estimated by our government , as worth a subsidy of two hundred thousand dollars per annum . This being the estimate of the paying party , it may well be supposed that France , the receiving party , would have estimated it much higher . The truth is , if it be allowed that the claims mutually offsetting each other were of equal value , the claim of our citizens , so far from being worthless , was of immense importance . It would have been impossible to negotiate a Convention with France , on the basis of the old treaty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1778 , that the old treaty could not have been enforced strictly , without dragging us into a war with England ; nor could that treaty have been left in the situation in which it was placed by the acts of Congress of 1798 , without bringing on a real war with Napoleon . A war with Napoleon , at that time , would have been , in human probability , most injurious to this country . It would have yoked us in a disastrous alliance with England , would have prevented our acquisition of Louisiana , and probably thrown it into the possession of the British . Now , there seems no possible way in which the claims of the French , to the permanent enjoyment of the advantages of the treaty of 1778 , could have been compromised , but by this pecuniary arrangement . The French agreed to accept a renunciation of a claim on them , estimated at fifteen rnillions . Our government , wisely as we think , chose to purchase at this rate a fair and honorable settlement of our difficulties with France , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of our own rulers , and the violence and injustice of those of France , our relations had become in the highest degree embarassed . How then can it be said , that the claim , whose renunciation was the basis of so happy a compromise , was of no value ? It was of all the value , that peace with France was to the country . It may be intimated , that our government would not have renounced it , had it been a valuable claim ; to which we reply , that , however valuable , they would be still authorised to renounce it for an equivalent ; which we have just shown they obtained . Moreover , we all know , not only that the government of our country esteemed the claim valuable , but // the value they placed upon it is known from the instructions to our envoys . It is true , it may justly he argued , that , if the claims were valuable , the government would not have renounced it , without designing to make compensation to the claimants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , without such intention ; for in one of the amendments to the Constitution , which form the conditions , on which a large portion of the people of these United States accepted that instrument , it is provided , that private property shall not be taken for public use , without compensation . ' It is our firm belief , that the government of our country intended to make compensation . Motions to that effect were very early brought into Congress ; they were supported by as large a number of its members , as could have been expected before the question had been agitated , and the claims urged . Meantime the Louisiana treaty came on , and there is much reason to think , that it was the intention of Mr Jefferson , to make the acquisition of that region the means of indemnifying our citizens , whose property had been renounced . No provision to this effect could have been introduced into the Louisiana Convention , because , as between France and us , the claim had ceased to exist . But Chancellor Livingston , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioners under it , Messrs Mc Clure , Mercer , and Barnet , that such part of the private claims on France , as the twenty millions of francs appropriated should fail to cover , must be paid by the United States . In like manner , we have no doubt , our government expected , that recompense should be made by the nation to those claimants for spoliations , whose just demands on the French Government had been renounced for the public service . The low price at - which Louisiana was bought , would have well enabled our government to raise a fund out of it for such a purpose . The purchase money was but seven and a half cents an acre , estimating the quantity of land acquired at two hundred million acres , * which is a low estimate , and the price of the land at fifteen millions of dollars . // The whole of Louisiana cost but three times as much , as was paid to qaict the various Mississippi Land Company claimants , or to purchase Florida . And what , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money that was paid for it , we need only dd , that the poor negroes of St Domingo , to quiet the claims of the ancient proprietors , have paid thirty millions of dollars for the French part of that island , twice as much as the purchase money of Louisiana . It is , however , wrong to attempt , by a comparison of dollars and cents , to estimate the value of Louisiana to the Union ; its acquisition is among the most important incidents in the history of the world ; the silent peaceful extension , to half a continent , of the hiessin b5 of republican liberty . Nor does it admit a doubt , that our government , in making this purchase so low , designed that it should form a fund for the indemnification of those of its citizens , whose claims on France had in the general settlement been renounced . It would not be ( lifficult to point out , in the history of our l ) olitics , both foreign and domestic , the causes which have hitherto prevented this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimants , but we regard this as a superfluous task . We also pass over many minor considerations , that have been or may be urged against any measures for granting this relief , such as the length of time that has elapsed , the large amount of the claim , the doubtful justice of parts of it . If we have succeeded in showing that it is in the main founded in justice ; that the claimants could rightfully have demanded payment of France , and that our government renounced this claim for them , we have established our point . If we have.made it farther apparent , that at the time of renunciation it was understood to be a claim of great value , and was an offset against important claims of France on America ; if we have shown that its recovery from France was not so desperate , as to make its estimated value null ; if we have made it clear , that but for this renunciation , the claim would now have stood on the footing of those , which the government is actively prosecuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we conceive , a fair right on the part of the claimants to indemnity from their own government . Meantime we have no distrust of the national councils . It is likely , that when the papers , which have been promised // from the Department of State , shall be communicated , the subject will be fairly and adequately discussed , and that some compromise , satisfactory to the claimants , and not onerous to the country , will take place .
