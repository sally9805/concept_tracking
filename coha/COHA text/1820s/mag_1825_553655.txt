C* Calhoun , Secretary of War , under the command of STEPHEN H. LONG , U. S. T. E. Compiled from the *Motes of Major Long , Messrs Say , Keating , and Coihoun ; by WILLIAM H. KEATING , A. M &amp;c , Geologist and Historiographer to the Expedition . 2 vols. 8vo . Carey &amp; Lea , Philadelphia , 1824 . To every citizen , who rejoices in the growth  --  and prosperity of his country , the recent enterprising expeditions into our frontier territories afford matter both of congratulation and regret ; of congratulation , that so much has been done with means so small and encouragement so feeble ; and of regret , that the national legislature has regarded them with so cold an indifference , and helped them forward with so parsimonious and reluctant a hand . It is mortifying in the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , pursuing an expanded and magnanimous policy , are sending its bands of explorers to every region of the earth , to the heart of central Africa , to India , to the numerous groups of Islands *n the Pacific , to South America , to the poles themselves , and even to the borders of our own United States , and thereby extending its name , its power , and its influence to every nation of the globe , and opening channels for an intercourse that will contribute in an unlimited degree to increase its riches and its strength ; it is mortifying , we say , to witness these great acts of enterprise and spirit in a foreign country , and then come down to the pitiful contrast exhibited by the doings of our own government ; that department of it , we mean , which holds the efficient means of enterprise in its power . Three fifths of our wide possessions are to this day a complete terra incognita , of which we know little more than we do of the geographical and political features of Monomotapa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress did on one occasion , it must be acknowledged , by some unaccountable impulse of generosity , vote a grant of money to fit out an expedition to the Rocky Mountains . But what was the result ? The liberal object itself was nearly def*ated , by withholding the necessary funds for the support of // the expedition , at the very time when , after conquering many difficulties , it had reached the point , which promised future success , and when the persons engaged in it had become qualified , by a well earned experience , to accomplish the purposes of the undertaking in a manner as perfect and satisfactory , as could possibly be desired . That men , whose ardor was sufficient to sustain them in opposing every obstacle , and whose intelligence was such as to render them capable of thoroughly investigating every object , that came within their observation , should be permitted to enter upon such an enterprise without the instruments necessary for their researches , and equipments essential to their comfort , or that they should be obliged to travel against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their tour , and this for the sake of saving a few hundred dollars to the nation , was of all attempts at economy the most ill judged , narrow , and preposterous . Such a spirit is unquestionably at war with the best interests of the country . The treasury of these states , instead of swallowing up , like the thirsty sand , all that is poured into it , should resemble the ocean , which , though the recipient of ten thousand rivers , receives them only to expand a vaster surface , whence their substance may again be withdrawn , and returned in fertilizing shbwers over the land . rrhe work , to which we are now called , is another evidence of the zeal and industry of the valuable officer , who , accompanied by some of the same distinguished naturalists , heretofore performed the expedition to the Rocky Mountains , with so much credit to the persons employed , and advantage to the cause of science . Although the present journey was through a country , neither so entirely unexplored , nor so intrinsically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the former occasion , enough has been accomplished to entitle them to much commendation , and impart general interest to the narrative of their labors . When we consider , that they were ordered to perform this journey within eight months , and required not to delay through a winter while on their route , we may well be surprised at the extent and number of their observations . This will be made the more obvious by presenting , in connexion with a few extracts from these volumes , a general outline of what has been accomplished , by the expedition . A sketch of the geography of the country passed over , is // fully and ably drawn by Major Long , in the form of a Report to the Department of War . rihe regions between the Alleganies and the Ohio river , and between that river and Lake Michigan , and also the territory northwest of the Great Lakes , which was the more immediate theatre of their observations , are all minutely described . An interesting account is also given of the river St Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select the following observations on the communication between Lake Superior and Lake Winnepeek . The hydrography of this region is as yet very defective , and although it may be traversed in a thousand directions , must forever remain so , if the shape , magnitude , and position of innumerable lakes embosoming myriads of islands , and the courses , sinuosities , arid declivities of countless channels by which they are united , are deemed essential as rudiments of that science . The country is literally a wilderness of lakes , islands , and peninsulas ; a mazy waste , so inhospitable and irreclaimable , as to mock the art and enterprize of man , and bid defiance to his industry . The water route most frequented between the Lake of the Woods and Lake Winnepeek , is denominated Winnepeek river , which enters the lake last mentioned in latitule 50* 36 ' 30 " , and has an extent of about one hundred and seventy miles . It is composed of a series of deep and broad basins rising one above another , and serving as the channel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one basin to another in tumultuous cataracts of the most romantic character . Of these water falls , there are no less than thirty-one in the route above mentioned , which interrupt the passage of canoes , and at all of which are carrying places . The aggregate descent of water in Winnepeek river may be estimated at four hundred and ten feet , which may be considered as the elevation of the Lake of the Woods above Lake Winnepeek . The route by Covert and Sturgeon Dam rivers is probably the most direct , ( the lower portion of which is the same with that above mentioned , ) but the obstructions are said to be more numerous and formidable , especially in a lo* stage of water . Besides these there are numerous other devialions from the main route , some of which have been traversed , l ) ut the number that remains to be explored is doubtless far greater . At the distance of about sixty miles below the Lake of the XVoods , Winnepeek river receives a large tributary from the north , called English river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal , and nearly as large as the latter above their // junction . Its head waters interlock with those of Albany river , which empties into James ' Bay , and is the principal channel of intercourse between Lake Winnepeek and the trading establishments on that river . The Lake of the Woods is about seventy-five miles long , and of irregular widths , from ten to thirty-five or forty miles . Compared with other lakes , it deserves a high rank on the scale of beauty . The scenery is wild and romantic in a high degree , its shores being faced with precipices and crowned with hills and knobs of variable heights , clad with a dense foliage of shrubbery and evergreens . Its surface is beautifully studded with countless islands of various sizes and forms , disclosing between them the continued sheet of its wide-spreading waters , the extent of which enlarges upon the vision as the traveller advances upon the lake , till the main land is shut out from the view by the islands that multiply around him . The 49th parallel of north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve miles from its southerly extremity . The region bordering upon the waters above described , is one of the most dreary imaginable . Its climate is rigorous , its surface exceedingly rugged and broken , and its products so limited and meagre , that it seems never to have been claimed as a residence either by man or beast . A solitary moose , caraboo , or bear , is occasionally to be found ; and a half-starved family of savages sometimes fix a temporary residence upon some of the water-courses , and subsist miserably upon fish , but it seems as if comfort and competency were denied to both . ' Vol. ii . pp. 231-233 . Above the Lake of the Woods , Rainy river becomes the channel of communication , and extends one hundred miles to the lake of the same name . It has an average breadth of about three hundred yards , is deep and gentle , and has no obstructions to its navigation , within forty-eight miles of its mouth ; at this distance are situated the rapids of Rainy river , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about ten feet . About ten miles further up is another inconsiderable rapid , with a fall of about three feet . At the outlet of Rainy Lake is a rapid of about five feet descent , and two miles and a half below are the Falls of Rainy river , down which the torrent pours with terrific grandeur through an aggregate descent of twenty-five feet in the distance of but a few yards . At this place are situated an establishment of the Hudson 's Bay Company on the north side of the river , and one belonging to the American Fur Company on the south . Twenty miles below the falls is the entrance of a considerable tributary from the southwest called the Grand Fork , which affords a channel of communication between the principal // and Little Winnepeek Lake of the Mississippi , navigable in wet seasons . It receives several other streams of less note . Between the Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake there is another water *oute which is sometimes travelled ; it is delineated on the map as the back route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the country in a military point of view , Major Long remarks as follows . In this view it is proper to comprehend not only the extreme northerly frontier of the United States , but to consider it in connexion with the boundary which nature seems to have fixed as the western limit of our population , viz , the Great American Desert . From what has been stated in relation to the country surrounding Lake Superior and extending north-westwardly to Lake Winnepeek , it may be inferred that we shall always remain secure from the inroads of any hostile force in that direction . Indeed the nature of the country is such , as affords a more formidable barrier to the invasions of an enemy , than any cordon of posts that art could devise . This barrier is intercepted by a space of considerable extent , including the valley of Red river , and extending westward to the Great Desert , through which there are two considerable passes , the one by the way of the Red and St Peter rivers , and the other by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north might gain access to the heart of the western country . But when we consider that the policy of the Hudson 's Bay Company , in whom is vested the right of soil to all that part of the British possessions drained by the tributaries of Hudson 's Bay , is opposed to the colonization of their territory , their interest prompting them to foster the fur trade , the products of which must diminish in proportion to the increase of population , we have very little to apprehend from the attack of a powerful enemy in that quarter . Added to this the utter impracticability of transporting by ordinary means heavy ordiiauce , and other munitions of war , up Nelson 's river , or by any other route to the valley of Red river , must for a long time to come place an enterprize of this nature beyond the reach of any hostile power . Accordingly , under present prospects , no hostilities are to be apprehended in that part of our frontier , except such as may be inflicted through the medium of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sterile dreary waste , three or four hundred miles in width , stretching along the eastern verge of the Rocky Mountains , from Red river of the south to Athahasca in the north , a distance of more than fourteen hundred miles , may be added as a continuation of the line of our natural defence . Thus a portion of our frontier , embracing an // extent of nearly two thousand miles , is so well fortified by nature as to require no artificial structures but such as are appropriate in Indian warfare . No regular military works will of course be required on that extent of frontier , except such as may be required to protect the American fur trade , and counteract the hostile purposes of the Indians . ' Vol. ii . pp. 241-243 . The geological observations made by the expedition are mostly new , and very interesting . In beginning their journey they took the opportunity to examine the geology of the state of Pennsylvania west of the Susquehanna , in which region they were the first to remark the existence of primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Wheeling and Zanesville . The appearance of the limestone , in the space between Lake Michigan an the Mississippi , led to an attempt to refer these formations to analogous European formations , and though these observations are diffidently offered , they are very interesting . The writer of the expedition has not ventured to decide authoritatively , on a question of so much difficulty , but he has stated his views and motives at large , and shown in what manner the rocks resemble or differ from those observed by Conybeare , Friesleber , Buckland and others . In this part of the route no appearance of lead mines was found . In relation to the geology of St Anthony , much light has been added to that afforded by Mr Schoolcraft , who had not attempted to show how these rocks were connected with similar ones observed else*vhere . We believe , moreover . that Mr Keating is the first person , who has described from actual observation the nature of the rock on the St Peter ; this he has done in the case of the sandstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the primitive rocks above Patterson 's falls , and near the Lac Qui Pane . The first rock , which was afterwards seen in situ , was the limestone of Red river , and this , together with the primitive rocks subsequently mentioned , is carefully noted . Superpositions have been traced and described as far as possible , as in the case of the Allegany mountains , of the rocks at Wheeling and Zanesville , on the Wassemos , or west of it , at Fort St Anthony , and the falls , and in various places on Lake Snperior . That superpositions were not seen from Lake Winnepeek to Lake Superior is accounted for , by stating that it is doubted whether there is a reeular stratification and alternation // of rocks , but it is rather held to be an immense , confused , and irregular crystallization , giving rise to many distinct rocks passing into one another . Along the north shore of bake Superior , traversed by this expedition , no masses of native copper were observed , on the surface of the alluvial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scenery of the country , which is always nearly and peculiarly connected with its geological characters , deservedly attracted the notice of the expedition , and the descriptions given of it are frequently picturesque and beautiful , deriving a great degree of interest from the peculiar wildness of the country , and the general absence of all animated beings , except the observers themselves . It was at our evening*s encarnpment , * says Mr Keating , that the splendid scenery of the Winnepeek first displayed itself to our view , realizing all that the mind could have fancied of wild and sublime beauty , and far surpassing any that we had ever seen . The characters , which we admire in the scenery of the Winnepeek , are the immense volume of waters , the extreme rapidity of the current , the great variety of form which the cascades and falls present , and the incomparable wildness of the rocky scenery which produces these falls , and which contrasts by its gloom , immoveable and unchangeable features , with the bright , dazzling effect of the silvery sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a broken and foaming cataract . It is in the effect of the rocky bed of the Winnepeek , that its numerous falls surpass all other which we have seen ; the cataract of Niagara , which far exceeds them in volume , is uniform and monotonous in comparison ; the horizontal ledges of secondary rocks of the latter are so far inferior in picturesque effect to the dark water-worn granite and sienite of the former , as the height of the bluffs at Niagara exceeds that of the rocky banks of the Winnepeek . The falls on this river have another advantage , which is , that the whole country has a picturesque appearance , which prepares the mind , and keeps it in a proper disposition to appreciate the splendor of its cataracts , while the country around Niagara is flat , uniform , and uninteresting. * The place of our encampment was characterized by one of those peculiar effects of water , which , once seen , leave an indelible impression upon the mind . After having passed over numerous rocks , which form diversified cascades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the water is suddenly received into a // basin enclosed by high rocks , where it is forced to sojourn awhile , by the small size of the aperture through which it issues ; here the waters present the characters of a troubled ocean , whose waves rise high and beat against the adjoining shores , and against the few rocky islands which are seun in the midst of this basin ; it is to this character that the spot owes the name which it receives from the natives , " the fall of the moving waters . " They may be called the lower falls of Winnepeek river . We reached them in time to watch thc beautiful effect of the setting sun , whose beams reflected by the stream imparted to it the appearance of a sea on fire . This was soon replaced by the moon , which cast a more placid light upon the waves , and heightened the charm of the scenery by the melancholy mantle which it spread over it . One of the most imposing characters of these falls is the tremendous noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their size , is thought to exceed that of Niagara , Montmorency , Schaffhausen , St Anthony , the Cohoes , or other falls which any of our party have ever seen . A scarcity of vegetation covers these rocks and contributes to the picturesque effect of the spot . Instead of the heavy forests which formerly sheltered Niagara , we have here a spare growth of aspen , birch , spruce , and other evergreens , whose size , generally small , adds to the wild and barren appearance of the rocks . The night which we spent near these falls , was one of the most interesting in the expedition ; our tents were pitched so that we had a view of the splendid effect arising from the play of the moonbeams upon the surface of this ocean-like basin , and our eyes were constantly bent upon it until the noise of the cataract lulled us to sleep . ' Vol. ii . pp. 90-92 . One important service , rendered by Major Long and his party during the present expedition , is deserving of particular notice . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to show that some authors , who have enjoyed an unmerited degree of confidence and reputation , are unworthy of such respect ; not only because they have very frequently depended exclusively on others for the circumstances they relate , but because they have not hesitated to fill up a large part of their outline from imagination alone . This especially applies to La Hontan , or the monk Guedeville , who assumed this name ; and to his humble but ungrateful copyist and garbler , Carver . To be convinced that those , who have been our guides in any research , are unqualified for the office they propose to discharge , may be VOL. xxm .. - 48. 24 // disagreeable , but it is an important step towards correcting our errors , and the attainment of truth . Mr Schoolcraft , who is advantageously known by his travels , and observations on the lead mines of Missouri , has also been corrected in some particulars by the researches of the present expedition . With this we are the more satisfied , as the standing and merited respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any accidently erroneous statement made by him . in relation to the Falls of St Anthony , the narrative of Mr Schooleraft contains an undeserved censure on the statement of that gallant and praiseworthy officer , Pike , who first correctly reported their height . The latter explorer stated , that the perpendicular height was sixteen and a half feet . Mr Schoolcraft magnifies it to forty feet . Major Long and Mr Colhoun by different measurements ascertained , that the height was between fifteen and sixteen feet . We do not think it necessary to specify the other topics , on which they differ entirely from Mr School .. craft , of whose labors they always speak favorably , and no doubt thought kindly . Corrections of this nature should not give offence to any one , since it is impossible for travellers in all cases to avoid misconception , even where their opportunities for observation have been excellent . Among the most interesting researches , contained in these vohimes , are those relating to the aboriginal inhabitants of the countries adjoining our frontiers . in collecting information on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very praiseworthy diligence , and their exertions have been rewarded by a large amount of valuable acquisi. tions . So much misrepresentation has existed in relation to these tribes , and so many falsehoods and exaggerations have been published concerning them , that every authentic observation of their social condition and polity , is of the highest value to the philanthropist and philosopher . A very interesting account is given , in the second volume , of a white man , by the name of Tanner , who was taken whei* a child by the Indians , and lived with them till he was advanced in life . This accOunt is too long for an extract , and we recommend it particularly to our readers . At Piqua , on the Great Miami , about seventy miles west of Columbus , the capital of Ohio , the expedition delayed a short time to examine several of those singular Indian works , which , // usually constructed of earth alone , have resisted the influence of time during many ages , subsequent not only to the extinction of the race by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have grown from the acorn on their *summits , have perished and disappeared through the natural agency of extreme old age and decay . Who reared these works ,  --  for what purpose , or by what means ? are questions to which we can reply with nothing better than conjectures , and these in all probability as wide of the truth , as the present time is distant from the era when the mounds themselves were constructed . We have no dates , no tradition to aid us , and our best researches bring us only to the conclusion that they exist , and that powerful and numerous nations have ceased to be . Although these monuments are so simply constructed , they would most probably outlast every other work of human art , since they are secured against the injuries of the seasons by the herbage and trees , which are always found clothing them ; but they are now sinking speedily under the hands of civilized men , and must soon be no more . The plough has for many years passed destructively over a great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarred , and a few years only will roll away , before the remaining Indians will become finally extinct , and no trace be left of their existence , or of their ancient greatness . The melancholy interest , inspired by such considerations , awakens many an unavailing regret relative to the Aborigines , who still continue to linger on the outskirts of the white settlements , apparently incapable of perceiving the advantage of living by the products of their industry , and nurtured in habits which are an effectual barrier to improvement . They are exposed to the artifices of the most depraved of their white neighbors , are taught to debase themselves rather than to itfll ) rove their condition , and must eventually cease to exist as a people , in the midst of every opportunity to become numerous , refined , and powerful . It is considered by the writers of this expedition very erroneous , to attribute to all the Indian nations a common character , or to suppose them all alike . It is true that the condition in which they live is sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions as remarkable and important as those to be found in their languages , arising from their division into nations . which , for all // that is known to the contrary , may be descended from different original stocks . Those , which are evidently descended from a common parentage , necessarily present the greatest resemblances , as the Potowatamies , Sauks , Ottowas , and Chippewas , who are all derived from the Algonquin race , while the t ) acotas , springing from a different stock , are very different from the rest , both in manners and language. - The Indians of Algonquin descent speak dialects of the same tongue , have a family badge , or totem , as they call it , and do not worship thunder ; and it is believed these tribes are not free from the taint of cannibalism . In all these particulars the manners of the Dacotas exhibit essential differences . To the distinctions , which are dependent on national causes , supersti ions , or traditions , may be added others which spring from local and adventitious circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where bisons are found in abundance , make use of skin lodges , are fond of horses , and obtain them whenever it is possible . The Chippewas , who live in a country of lakes where the birch tree is very common , have ingeniously resorted to the bark of that tree for the material of which to construct their lodges and canoes . That this is not a national , but a local usage , is shown by the fact , that the Killistenos , who are of Algonquin descent , live in a buffalo country , and imitate the Dacotas in the particulars above mentioned , while in respect of language , totems , and superstitions , they evince their connexion with the Chippewas . We have incidentally mentioned , that some of these Indians have a disposition to cannibalism. , which has sometimes been considered a shocking imputation on the savage character ; nevertheless , the evidence collected by this expedition , added to what is found in other works , would seem to establish the fact on very strong grounds . It is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent disrepute . Under any circumstances , it is important to be fully assured of the existence of such a trait in the character of these tribes , if it actually exists , however repugnant it may be to our feelings . It seems highly probable , that if the savages of this country had been represented according to their actual condition , and not from the extravagant fancy or misconceptions of travellers , they might at this time have been much further advanced in civilization . That they possess many excellent qualities , and a capacity for improvement , // is not to be doubted ; but while they continue to be treated with oppression and injustice , and are taught by repeated experience to regard white men as fraudulent and corrupt , it can scarcely be expected from them , however much it may be desired , that they will arrive at a high elevation either in morals or civil lmprovemen ? s . The Narrative of the expedition appears to have been carefully composed , and is more uniform than that of the former expedition , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborated ; it is a little too ambitious , abounding in occasional superfluous epithets . These are the faults of one , who has not written much for publication , and may easily be pardoned . A more serious objection to the style , is a too frequent use of technical terms in geology and mineralogy , even in the midst of descriptions , where no allusions to these subjects ought to have been introduced . On the whole , however , Mr Keating has accomplished his task , as historiographer to the expedition , with much good judgment , and with the full measure of industry , which a work of so varied a character required , and he deserves the praise not less of successful authorship , than of skill in his favorite science . The Appendix contains a treatise extending to one hundred and fifty pages , on various objects of natural history observed in the expedition , by Mr Thomas Say , of the merits of which we do not pretend to speak , being fully coi*vinced that no better pledge of its value can be desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
