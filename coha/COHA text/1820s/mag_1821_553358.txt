txt Ant XVI. - Tke . , *dministration of the Criminal Code iw England and the spirit of the English government , by Al . *ottu , Counsellor of the Royal Court of Paris , and Scretary-G*neral to the Royal Society of Prisons , and to the Special CQuncil of the Prisons of Paris . Translated for the pamphleteer . London . 1820 . WE have suffered this pamphlet to lie by us a long time , in consequence of an intimation that an edition of it was about to appear in this town , under the direction of two eminent members of the profession ; and we were desirous of recoinmending it to our readers as an . American publication . This design seems now to have been relinquished , and we are unwilling to abstain longer from noticing a work , which recom* mends itself , as well ' by the peculiar circumstances which produced it , as by its intrinsic value . M. Cotto , as he tells us in his preface , was sent by the French government to England in 1819 , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its juries * and it appears from the spirit displayed throughout the work , and the zeal and ability with which the commission was executed , that a more fit man could not have been selected . He judged very rightly , that in order to obtain a correct notion of the English trial by jury , it was necessary previously to familiarize himself with the general nature of the English constitution ; and accordingly , a very large , and to us the most interesting portion of the pamphlet , is devoted to the author 's remarks on the peculiar character of the government of Great Britain , and its influence on the manners of the people . M. Cottu , as mny be supposed , was furnished with letters of introduction to some of the most distinguished members of the English bar ; and if it is gratifying to observe the candor , ingenuousness , and ardor for truth , with which the errand was undertaken , it is no less so to remark the courtesy , hospitality* and willingness to communicate , which appear on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must rejoice . to see these two rival kingdoms approaching each other with such dispositions ; throwing aside the feelings of jealousy and rancour , which for centuries have filled Europe with blood , and brought misery upon each other ; and mutually inclined to re*iprocate those offices of kindness and good fellowship , which // can not fail to be productive of happines* to themselves and of benefit to mankind . It reminds us of the best days of Greece and Rome , when the most illustrious citizens of rival republics were delegated , for the purpose of observing and bringing away whatever was excellent in the characters and institutions of their neighbors , for the improvement of their own country . We can not but indulge the hope , that this visit is the prelude to a general and liberal intercourse between these distinguished nations . This grateful reception , united with his national enthusiasm , and the novelty of all he saw and heard , served to raise the admiration of M. Cottu for the government and people of England to a very high , we had amost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his encomiums on the British constitution , and on the manly , vigorous , and humane character of the British nation ; we still think that , in the transports of his admiration , he has overlooked some of the faults , and misrepresented some of the features of both . It is not at all surprising that one born and educated in a country like France , in which civil liberty is unknown ; who had read of republics where the people had a voice in the government , and where the magistrates were amenable to the laws , but who had felt only the galling weight of military law , should be lost in wonder and admiration on the first view of that beautiful system of civil polity which the English have erected for themselves . Like the artless inhabitant of some newly discovered country , who , acquainted only with simple nature , is shown for the first time a stately edifice , he is unable to discriminate between its beauties and defects , but gives vent to unrestrained expressions of surprise and delight . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the favorable view he is disposed to take of England and its government . We think it highly honorable to him that he has been able so far to divest himself of his national prejudice as to err on that side ; but viewing the object of his adoration from the station of republicanism , we confess it presents to us an aspect somewhat different from that in which he has drawn it , and we feel ourselves bound to correct some of the mistakes into which he has fallen . We oughtin justice , however , to remark , that the lively interest he feels in the object of his mission , while it leads to the inaccuracies we have alluded to , displays itself in a very ready perception of many of the nice peculiarities of English // 1821.1 Cottu on English Law . jurisprudence , which he has explained with great precision , without that technical jargon , which professional writers find it so difficult to shake offi Indeed , for those who are desirous of obtaining a general acquaintance with the English constitution , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of a lawyer 's library , we do not know a more valuaide treatise . In proof of the remark we have just made , we quote his definition of the term Benefit of Clergy , ' a great bughear to all learners in the law . Benefit of clergy , ' says he , is an absolute exemption from the punishment of death which the clergy appropriated to themselves in the time of their own power , and of the profound ignorance of the people . As , however , they did not venture to arrogate such a privilege , solely on the score of their being an ecclesiastical body , they continued to establish it upon the plea of the necessity of securing every protection to the sciences ; and as there were few at this time except themselves , who possessed the slightest knowledge of letters , there were of course few others who could profit by this privilege ; not that it required any extraordinary erudition to be admitted to the enjoyment of it , for to be able to read was sufficient ; but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the clergy , there were only a few who attained the first degree of civilization ; at such a period , therefore , this benefit appeared so exclusively in favor of the clergy , that from them it derived the name which it has p reserved until the present day . In later times so n*uch has information been diffused , that insensibly all ranks have been enabled to plead this privilege in their favor ; and the punishment of death would have been by this means almost erased from the penal code of England . in order , therefore , to reestablish it , certain statutes have been framed by which particular crimes are debarred from this benefit of clergy , and it is only by virtue of these statutes that sentence of death is passed at this day. * We have here , in the compass of a few lines , a clear explanation of what takes up a chapter of as many pages in Blackstone , and is at last left in obscurity . Indeed , we see throughout M. Cottu 's book , an illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention is awakened , and who are constantly on the look-out for novelty , frequently discover or place in new points of light , peculiarities in the manners and institutions of the countries they visit , which have escaped the observation , or been negligently passed over by the natives themselves . // We shall not trouble our readers with M. Cottu 's minutia description of the forms of criminal proceedings , in the Eng-. lish courts , which , though they differ in some respects from our own , yet in all essential particulars so nearly resemble them , that the repetition would be useless . We think the following account , no less just than eloquent , of the effect of local attachment , for which the English are remarkable , can not be uninteresting . Thus , ' the says , C the manners of the nation so far from being in opposition to the laws , are on the contrary in unison with the very spirit of them , and in all families the spirit of inequality of property , and of the succession of the eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held inviolately sacred . This law , and the manners which accommodate themselves to it , are fruitful in great results . The most important of them all , is that of attaching every family not merely to its property but likewise to the county in which the property may be situated , and this attachmnent often becomes so lively , nay I may say so religious a sentiment , that there are many estates which have belonged to the same family ever since the time of the conquest . A man naturally takes a pleasure in improving and embellishing a spot which heknows will descend to is most distant posterity . Hence there is no rural scenery that wears so seducing an aspect as that of England , covered as it is with parks which exhibit the ablest cub tivation , and are animated by the sports and frolics of the multitude of domestic animals which find a safe asylum within their boundaries . Every gentle man is as particular in the care of his garden as of his house , and would be ashamed that a stranger should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of the master is always equally vigilant , because in fact the master never grows old . When age begins to make him indifferent to the pleastires of the world , when wealth offers its seductions to him iii vain , and when he no longer attaches importance to any thing excepting what is connected with eternity , his place is filled up by his eldest son , whose youth binds him more closely to the things of this life , and who , sure of the next possession of the family property , watches over it with a care which becomes proportionably more active as his father draws more rapidly to the end of his career . It is not however merely to the order of succession that we ought to attribute the custom , so common among the English , of passing the greatest part of the year upon their estates , for in the province of France , where the same order of succession was formerly observed , the owners of landed property were exactly as much in the contrary habit of shutting themselves up in cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This cub // torn in the English , therefore , is the result of all their municipal institutions , which , as I shall show , confer on the principal persons in every county , not only the almost entire government of that county , but also the levying , distribution , and employment of a great part of the taxes , the administration of justice , and the maintenance *f public order . ' The following fact , stated by the author in his chapter on juries , serves to confirm the truth of the foregoing remarks , and to show how admirably adapted the English government and manners are to the perpetuation of liberty , by turning the ambition of individuals to the use of the state ,  --  by making the path of duty the surest road to power . In order to give an idea of the importance which is attached to the duties of the grand jury , and the scrupulous punctuality with which they are fulfilled , I must state that , at the last Gloucester assizes , which were delayed eight days by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son of the duke of Beaufort , and one of the first noblemen in England , was appointedforeman of the grand jury , and although he was at that time on the point of setting out to join the duke of Wellington in Belgium , and had made every preparation for departing on the day when it was presumed the assizes would be at an end , he yet put off his journey , and even ran the risk of losing the object of it altogether ,  --  . which was to be present at the grand reviews ,  --  rather than let any other person have the honor of acting as foreman or chief of the grand jury in his absence . ' We are far from wishing that our own country may see the day , when the post of foreman of the grand jtlry shall be an object of contest between powerful individuals , with a view to the success of their own ambitious projects ; much less do we desire to anticipate the period , when the growth of corruption and vice shall have raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now has in England . We can not , however , forbear to notice the indifference which prevails among us with regard to the duty of serving on juries , and the reluctance with which those who are best qualified for the task are brought to the performance of it . No symptom can be more alarming in a republic , than that apathy which suffers those duties to the public which are laborious and unprofitable to fall upon the ignorant and the worthless . Foreign invasion and open revolt are comparatively trifling evils-they are seen  --  the danger Is apparent , and the remedy certain ; but // that selfish spirit which leads the citizen to prefer his ease or his gains to the public service , is the secret enemy , whose progress is unperceived until the moment of destruction approaches . It were well also if our grand juries would more generally bear in mind , that the duty of deliberating on , riminal informations is not the only one which devolves on them . The condition of prisons and their inhabitants , the state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisances , the ad-. ministration of the laws respecting paupers , and many other subjects which are connected with the furtherance of justice and the public convenience , come within the scope of their powers , and seem in England to be brought under the closest inspection . This subject leads to another , intimately connected with it , the mode of conducting criminal trials in England ; and we present our readers with the following curious contrast between a French and English court , which we beg leave to recommend to the attentive consideration of our own bench and bar . In England , ' says M. Cottu , we do not hear the counsel for the prosecutor describing the criminal as a monster , who ought to be rooted from the earth , or comparing him with all the most enormous villains that have ever astonished the world by their crimes . Neither do we see the counsel for the prisoner offering a thousand absurd suppositions to the jury upon the manner in which the crime has been committed , lying to his own conscience , endeavouring to pers*ade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments from heaven , if they venture to do their duty . No one is allowed to alter the light of the evidence by showing it through the prism of his own opinion or fancy ; it appears to the jury in all its purity , and simply as it was manifested in the course of the examinations . It remains with them alone to judge of it , without the help of any other influence . The judge then recapitulates the facts to the jury , without endeavoring to relieve their dryness by reflections more or less lofty or more or less suited to the subject . Sometimes , when the case requires it , he makes remarks upon the depositions testimony which he has heard , but in general he confines himself to exhibiting the substance of them to the jury in its simple nudity , and rests the effect of his statements , not upon the ornamental languao*e in which he invests them , but on the importance of the facts which they contain , and on which the life or liberty of a fellow-citizen en s. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we see the cruel and unbending spirit of our ancient criminal courts exhibited in all their terrific energy . The prisoner is yet uncondemned , but already he is treated as if he were convicted of the crime imputed to him . Every insulting epithet is lavished upon him , and I have seen him sometimes addressed in terms of the most indecent contempt . The advocate for the prisoner maintains the innocence of his client . This defence presents an abuse no less dangerous and revolting . We see young lawyers who are to be admired for the mildness and simplicity of their manners , the purity and uprightness of their principles , endeavoring , in defence of crimes which are but too evident to overshadow the most incontestable proofs with doubt , to support suppositions which are utterly destitute of probability , to establish maxims subversive of all social and moral order , to inspire groundless uneasiness in the minds of the jurors , and to take false credit to themselves for the honor of saying a villain from the punishment which he richly deserves . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies , the advocate answers him again , each party gives way to violence , and the court becomes an actual stage , where the passions exhibit themselves without restraint , where enthusiasm is carried even to delirium , and the head of the delinquent is contended for with a fury which revolts the spectators and makes strau*ers shudder . The president delivers a summary of the whole affair . This summary ought to be an impartial exposition of the charges against the prisoner and the grounds of his defence : but is this the case ? No ! so far from it that we must acknowledge it is oftener only a repetition of all the arguments against him . The misrepresentations of his advocate sometimes render this proceeding on the part of the president unfortunately necessary ; but very often the resentment which has been excited in his mind during the course of the debate has an involuntary effect upon it , and doubtless influences him to dwell with much more force upon the facts which favor the prosecution , than upon those which favor the prisonerIt will be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English courts of law , that they are far from a*rding the same dramatic interest which ours present . With them no part is assigned to the accused ; his hat hung upon a peg would supply his place to the spectators nearly as well , for he is so placed as to turn his back upon them , and no interest is awakened in them either by the sight of him , the development of the evidence against him , his defence of himrelf , or the efforts ot the judge Pi elicit the truth . There is no contention between the accuser and the accused , and the latter has the appearance of a man who // leaves almost with indifference a matter on which his life is to depend to be settled between his own counsel and the prosecutors ; his voice falters not as p roof after proof accumulates against him , no paleness steals over his visage , no damps hang upon his brow , no appalling silence reigns between the interval of the discovery of his crime and his own confession of it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revenge , and every other violent emotion to which our debates give birth . In England all is calm and cold , the lawyers , the jury , the judge , the public , and even the prisoner himself , who seems scarcely to be sensible of the peril in which he stands , or of the strength of the case which is made out against him . ' This contrast is truJy a striking one , and as M. Cottu very candidly confesses , highly discreditable to his countrymen . It should be one of the first steps of the French government to bring about a reform in this essential particular . Much may undoubtedly be done by care and strictness on the part of judges , to repress that excitement of the feelings , which when uncurbed is utterly at variance with the spirit of the trial by jury , and will finally prove fatal to it . It would be surprising if this difficulty did not occur in a nation unused as the French are to this species of trial , and all whose feelings and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it will not be impossible to introduce a sufficient degree of calmness into the proceedings to be consistent with the decorum necessary in a court of law , we have no hopes of seeing the French courts brought into that state of quiet and order which belongs to those of England . This would be to change the physical constitutions of the natives ,  --  to metamorphose a Frenchman into an Englishman . In France , every thing is dramatic ,  --  ' *-effect is the object of every motion . In England every thing partakes of that calm , cool , imperturbable character , which M. Cottu gives of their courts of justice . If an English barrister should so far forget himself in his zeal for his client , as to give way to any uncommon exhibition of feeling , he would soon be arrested by the frowns of the judge to remind him that he was wandering from the point . If he turned to the jury , he would see a dozen , calm , unmoved , tranquil faces , utterly unconscious that this flourish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , while the audience generally would very likely be wondering what sudden frenzy had seized the unfortunate gentleman . A French court is the reverse of all this ; an advocate who should adopt the moderate , argumen-* // tative manner of an English practitioner , would be reminded by the yawns and impatience of his hearers , that however forcible his reasoning , he was not in the way to gain his point . Every thing about him on the contrary tends to stimulate his ardor ; not an impassioned expression or a vehement gesture , but is met by a corresponding shrug or grimace on the part of the jury . The audience shew by exclamations , sighs and murmurs the various emotions by which they are agitated , and the unfortunate culprit , who in the moment of conviction gives way to an involuntary burst of anguish , instead of being taken by the arm , as in England , and let quietly out of court to make way for another , is answered by the bystanders with all the sympathy d'une aimable sensibilit*i . A French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be like Bond street , or the theatre of the Porte St Martin like Astley 's . The French must rest satisfied if guilt is punished , and innocence protected , without imitating that impenetrable coldness of manner under which the English hide the warmest and the noblest principles . We have already said so much on the subject of courts , that did we not think the following description of a court-room at the assizes would be new to many of our readers , we should think an apology necessary for inserting it . It follows from all the details into which I have entered , that English courts of justice wear an aspect of mildness and impartiality , which ours , it must be confessed , are far from presenting to the eyes of a stranger . In England every thing breathes good . ness and indulgence ; the judge seems like a father in the midst of his family , called upon to judge one of his children . His countenance has nothing terrific in it . His desk , according to an ancient custom , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers . The sherifl likewise , and other persons connected with the court , each wear a bouquet . The judge himself , with a condescension which is really surprising , suffers the space allotted to him to be intruded upon by a crowd of spectators , and in this manner he may often be seen surrounded by the prettiest women in the county , the wives , sisters , or daughters of the grand jury , who , coming to the balls and public entertainments which are given at the assizes , likewise make it a point of duty , or a pleas . ure to attend the court . They appear in the most elegant morning dresses , and a singular contrast is afforded by the venerable head of the judge , covered as it is with a large *vig , elevated // 852 Oet* above so many youthful female heads , adorned with all of beauty that nature can give , and of attraction that art can add . ' This seems hardly credible to those of us who have beea used to the stern simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from the crowd , either by dress or public deference , that they have need of all the adventitious aid of forms to support the dignity necessary to their station . M. Cottu has been led in this description to discover a sentimental allusion , where his friends the English would hardly have thought of looking for it , in the flowers which are spread before the court . If he had cast his eye at the lower end of the hail , and the gentry who occupy it , and had then observed how often these emblematical nosegays were raised to the face , he might have conjectured , that however fanciful this custom may have been in its origin , it has been kept up from much more homely considerations . The author 's remarks on the civil proceedings of the English courts are loose and inaccurate . We instance his definition of copyholds and courts of record , and his general asserlion that all demands of a plaintiff are resolved into a question of damages . This subject , however , was not comprised in his commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on questions , which the most learned English lawyers have hardly made intelligible . He does injustice , however , where he had better means of correct information . He says of the punishment ofpeinefrrte et dure , that this dreadful monument of the barbarity of ancient times , even yet is not formally abolished . The statute of 12 Geo. iii , c. 20 , by restoring the common law punishment for standing mute , effectually repealed this barbarous law , and the reason of its not having been named in the act probably was the unwillingness of the legislature to recal so odious a subject . XVith respect to elections and the qualifications of voters and members of parliament , M. Cottu seems to have adopted hastily the information he obtained en passant without always taking the pains to satisfy himself of its correctness . His praise on these points , as on every other , is unqualified . He is a great admirer of rotten boroughs , because they return into parliament men of the most opposite views , ' as if that could be done in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , because none but the rich can be returned , and that strengthens the aristocracy ; a favorite object with // M. Cottu . We confess we do not look upon the rotten boroughs as the worst feature in the system . The tenure by which these seats are held is known , the price is fixed , there is no room for that general corruption which is seen in the great boroughs . We complain that counties and boroughs are not fairly represented ; that the voice of the people , that portion of them we mean which is entitled to a voice , is not heard . In the counties the business of election is done by a few great landholders , in the boroughs by the dregs of the populace . Where did M. Cottu learn , that in Liverpool to constitute an elector it is only necessary that the individual 's name should not be on the list of paupers to whom parochial relief is granted ? ' So far is this from being true , that in this city containing a population of 120,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if M. Cottu 's statement were correct , it must exceed seven times that number . This borough was erected when Liverpool was an inconsiderable town , and the right of voting was restricted to those who then exercised certain trades in the city , and could be transmitted only to the sons of freemen and those who served an apprenticeship of seven years with them . This number , as the place increased , bore a very small proportion to the whole population . No new comer can acquire it , and neither non-residence nor want of property can deprive an individual of this right , who has once become entitled to it in either of the ways just mentioned ; so that this privilege in this great borough is in the hands of a small number of tradesmen , many of them of the lowest order . With regard to the right of election in counties , he says , it belongs to every one who possesses forty shillings of revenue in free/told , ' and of course , ' continues M. Cottu , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist in the appointment of members of parliament . ' We agree with him entirely in the fact , but to the inference we can not subscribe . Every one , in the least acquainted with the nature of landed property in England , and with the legal definition of a freehold , knows , that a freeholder in the midland counties of forty shillings a year is as rare as a sphinx . The land is parcelled out among great proprietors who lease to the farmers for long terms , and it is extremely rare to see a farmer who is the owner of his land ; indeed the name originally denoted that he was not . A lease of a thousand years gives no right to a vote , and we think we are correct in sayin // that several of the largest counties in England , ( to say nothing of Scotland ) do not furnish more than a few hundred electors of knights of the shire . M. Cottu is not satisfied with the praise bestowed on the distribution of the elective franchise . He is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seems to be initiated into the English doctrine , that broken beads are essential to the freedom of the state , as will appear from the following account of a scene which took place at Westminster during the late general election . Captain Maxwell , one of the most distinguished officers of the British navy , offered himself at the last general election as candidate for Westminster . He was supptwted by the ministers and their adherents , and bad in consequence to contend with the opposition party , as well as with the populace , which , I know not why , is in London always attached to that side of the question ; whilst in other towns , as for instance at Liverpool , it follows the ministerial banners . The captain had therefore to expect a lively resistance on the hustings . Every people has its peculiar mode of testifying discontent . In France this is done by hootings and hisses , in England by hootings and mud . Mud is even thrown at the king himself when he goes to parliament to make communications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a disposition to throw mud at the captain , but the weather having been remarkably dry , no supply of it was at hand ; the hustings , however , being constructed in a market place , the ground about them was strewed with the refuse of vegetables , &amp;c . For want of mud the people availed themselves of this mixture ; and a stone which was found in it unfortunately falling into the hands of a malcontent more adroit than his fellows , he directed it against captain Maxwell 's eye . This was undoubtedly a misfortune to him , and at the same time an offence in the man , which deserves punishment ; but are we on such an account to condemn a law which fills the county for more than a month with a species of delicious joy , and inspires the humblest citizen with an idea that he composes a part of the public authority , and has his share of influence in the government ? Is it to be supposed that the captain , indignant at such excesses , and disgusted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hustings weeping over his country , and mourning to see it delivered up to confusion and licentiousness ? O*n the contrary , he reappeared the following day , his eye covered with a bandage , on the same spot where he had been so grossly assailed , and harangued the people who had everwhelmed him with outrages . He began by obser* // ing , that he was accustomed to missiles different from that which he had the day before received , and seized the occasion of alludirig to the battles in which he had been engaged . He was listened to for some time with applause . He afterwards added , that , as an Englishman , he was well pleased to see the people repel those whom they suspected of so1iciting their suifrages only with the design of betraying their rights an d liberties ; that in consequence , they had done rightly in opposing his election whilst they attributed to him an intention of this kind ; but their error consisted in having too easily yielded to the unfavorable impressions which his enemies had given of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only their happiness in view , and that they would no where find a more strenuous asserter of their privileges . At this point his success terminated , and the clamour recommenced . Re was not however , daunted ; and he declared that having the honor to be supported by so great a number of friends , he would perish on the hustings , rather than abandon his election . In fact he remained there until a sort of madman , intoxicated by noise and liquor , struck him with such violence on the head , whilst in the act of returning home , as to cause a fever that confined him to his bed for seven or eight days . ' On this extraordinary relation M. Cottu makes the following remarks : The stone thrown at captain Maxwell was considered ( in France ) as the signal of general revolution ; and unless the elective system which had furnished an occasion for so dreadful an outrage were altered , or entirely abolished , it was deemed certain a ngland would become the scene of terrible calamities . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ; and how different a spectacle do these elections thus decried , present to the meditation of a stranger ! They exhibit a people intoxicated with joy at the exercise of its liberty , using it tumultuously because it is the essence of all popular acts to be marked by clamor and agitation . ' Now , though we have never viewed this and similar occurrences in that alarming light which it seems to have presented to the French nation , we do think it deeply humiliating and disgraceful . We think it derogatory to an officer of the distinguished merit of sir Murray Maxwell , to be obliged to come forward and expose himself to the most degrading insults to serve the purposes of administration . We think it reflects great discredit on the English people , that citizens , in the ex-* ercise of their nohlest and dearest right should be guilty of // LOct. excesses that would disgrace savages . We profess too great an admiration of the English constitution to be readily convinced that missiles and mud are necessary ingredient* in its composition . So far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disposed to set it down to the opposite account . True liberty , such as the English nation has a right to enjoy , does not display itself in ebullitions like these . The electors in a true republic would have no temptation to indulge in such insults . The candidate would scornt* submit to them . An English election , instead of that tran-. quil , dignified scene we witness in our own country , presents nothing hut riot and misrule . The opening of the poll is the signal for the prostration of legal restraint , and the commenceinent of the reign of anarchy . The contest frequently lasts several days , and during this time the unfortunate borough is given over to the mob . The shops are all closed-.  - -  busjness is at a stand ,  --  parties attached to the different candidates are parading the streets with their distinguishing badges , and frequently meeting , when desperate battles are sure to ensue . Is this the privilege of election as provided hy the constitution of Great Britain ? Is this the generous , open , majestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is it the mad raving of a populace which has broken its bonds and is taking advantage of this period of licentious indulgence to heap with abuse those superiors , whom it does not hope again , to approach till another seven years shall have elapsed ? We ought in justice to remark , that this description applies almost exclusively to the election of burgesses . In the counties , the scene is far different , and for the reason we have mentioned . The number of the electors for knights is small . They are freeholders ; and generally men of fortune and consequence , who are above brihery themselves and not to he moved by a lawless mob . The danger here arises from collusion among the candidates , and a compromise of parties between the great proprietors . The monopoly of landed property , and the consequent smallness of the number of freeholders in proportion to the whole population , and their remoteness from each other and from the scene of election , encourage this abuse , which is carried to so great a degree , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in this manner , with scarcely the formality of an election . In the county of York , which comprises *3,698 , JS7 statute acres , and contains a population of // nearly a million , the number of freeholders is not more than twenty thousand . As there is but one place of election in each of the three ridings , it rarely happens that more than a third part of the votes of the county are tendered . The contest between Mr Wilberforce , lord Milton , and Mr Lascelles , in 1807 , which ended in the election of the two former , brought out the whole force of the county , at an expense to the three parties , it is said , of half a million sterling . Yet this is the most independent county in the kingdom . Of Devonshire , a county containing three hundred and forty-three thousand souls , an eminent writer on this subject says , the two most opulent gentlemen in the county have only to perform the ceremony of an election , and they are invested with the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own persons . ' We think it must he apparent from these facts that the right of election is confined to too small a number . Not that we are friends to universal suffrage ; we disapprove of it under any form of government . In Great Britain we consider it impracticable . It were to be wished , however , that many substantial farmers in England , who are excluded because they are not freeholders , might be admitted to the right of voting . An act extending the privilege to copyholders , and to leaseholders paying a certain annual rent , would have this effect . As to the boroughs , it is desirable that the qualifition of electors should be made uniform throughout the kingdom-as for example , that every householder paying a certain rent should have a vote . They would still have the rotten boroughs , for which we see no other remedy than to restrict the right of sending members to towns of a certain population ; and as often as any borough fell below the standard , the right should ipso facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large to be entitled to it , as was proposed by Mr Pitt in 1785 . M. Cottu , in his chapter on the influence of the English government upon the manners of the people , gives us his opinion of the value of their privileges in the same style of extravagant panegyric . We extract the following remarkable passage . They love much to travel . Alas ! happiness is not made for man . They find in their families , and in their institutions , all the felicity that human beings can hope to attain on earth . As citizens , nothing can give them offence ; the yoke of government never weighs heavily on them . They have not to fear either the // vexations of power , or the contempt of high birth . Every thing by which they are surrounded inspires them with a value for themselves and their professions ; but this unalterable repose , which no griefs disturb , but such as are inseparable from human nature ; this repose which seems written on their serene and dignified countenances , becomes at last intolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them to ramble upon earth . They depart ; they precipitate themselves into all the dissipations of a foreign land ; they yield for a short time to measures which they despise , and partake of the treacherous pleasures connected with them ; but they preserve their hearts immaculate , and after having drank deep of the cup of delight return home to their pure and innocent pleasures , and endeavor to support the insipidity , which acts as a drawback upon the enjoyment of them . ' Should any one hear this description without previous intimation of the application of it , would he presume it to be intended for a nation of modern Europe ? Would he not rather suppose that it was a glowing picture of some imaginary island of the blest ? ' What would be his surprise on discovering that this superhuman paradise was no other than the land of rotten boroughs and contested elections , of Manchester mobs and Cato street conspiracies , of press-gangs and yeomanry cavalry ? How would he wonder to hear that this nation paid fifty-six millions a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he reconcile this unalterable repose ' with the presence of a Hunt , a Cobbet , a Wooler , and a Hone , and thirteen hundred capital convictions by the year ? We do not bring out these unpleasant circumstances with a view to magnify them , or to*make them the occasion of boasting or reproach . We are too sensible of the value of English liberty , and the obligations of the civilized world to that nation for her noble exertions , to wish to undervalue her efforts or her character . But we feel obliged to call to our own minds and those of our countrymen a few facts to temper the extatic praise that M. Cottu gives way to , and to remind them that if we do not enjoy all the glory , we at least escape some of the plagues of that distinguished people . It is truly surprising , notwithstanding the strict scrutiny to which the English constitution has been exposed in all its parts during the last century , that the nature of - it should be so little understood at the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and enemies . On the one hand it is held up as the perfect model of a free governrnent , the ne plus ultra of political wisdom . On the other it is denounced as an absurd compound of despotism and anarchy , of feudal tyranny and democratic license . The king , if one party is to be believed , is the beneficent parent of his people , who has not the power to do wrong , and whose every step is marked by acts of mercy and condescension . If the opposite party is correct , he is to be regarded as a pageant of royalty , upheld at the expense of the people to serve the purposes of contending factions . We are told at one moment of the imposing character of the house of lords ; - con sisting of mdi .. viduals venerable for their rank or merit ; - of dignified prelates , renowned warriors , and profound statesmen ; we are then assailed on the other side by denunciations against this assemblage of haughty churchmen , degenerate nobles , and stupid princes of the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm defenders of the rights of the people ; the pure representatives of virtuous constituents ; another looks upon it as a sink of venality and corruption . The malcontent party would fain convince us , that the penal code of England is a system of barbarous inflictions without a motive or an object ; while their opponents extol its harshness as the severity of mercy . The boisterous character of their public meetings is thought by some to represent the last stage of moral degradation ; while on the contrary , those are not wanting , who regard these commotions as the thunder and the tempest , which purify and regenerate the atmosphere of liberty . For ourselves , we profess that we think the English frame of government better adapted to its object than any of which the world has yet had full experience . We now consider our own constitutions as out of the question ; whatever may be our opinion of them , and however encouraging may be the promise they hold forth , we do not consider them as yet sufficiently tried , to be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . But while we place this famous scheme of polity far before any other of ancient or modern times , we still think it comes Yery much short of perfection . At the same time that we see in its provisions a great deal to admire , we discover in its deficiencies not a little to deplore . We would not ask Great Britain to renounce monarchy , but we could wish that the influence of the crown were less power // ful and direct . We admire the construction of parliament , in the mutual dependence of the two houses on each other , and the manly freedom of their proceedings . We should be bet-. ter satisfied if the doors of the upper house were never opened but to those who had earned the distinction by public services , and if the floor of the lower were less often the arena of contending candidates for place . We respect and esteem that love of order and reverence for religion which has established and upheld a national form of worship , which protects with pious care the temples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proudest nobles of the land . We sincerely regret that this sacred order should be supported by a tax so odious and unequal as that of tithes . Much more do we lament that a slight deviation from the national creed should exclude a very large portion of the people , who contribute their full share of the burden , not only from the honors and emoluments of the church , but from the excrcise and enjoyment of some of the dearest and most valuable rights and privileges of citizens . We are far from underrating the law regulating the descent of lauded property , which , while it upholds the consequence and independence of the nobility by perpetuating that superiority of fortune which is essential to the proper influence of the aristocratic branch , has the happy effect of reducing the younger members of great families to a level with the people , by raising a mutual dependence between them for service and sup-. port . It is a cause of painful reflection , however , that this happy provision should be accompanied with some remains of feudal oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be allowed on all hands , are a foul blot on the English code . Little can be said for the glorious birth-. right of Englishmen , while the property in that which Providence has made common , the untamed tenants of the forest and the air , is restricted to the fortunate possessors of one hundred pounds a year . No man , who is not possessed of property to this amount , can kill any species of game , even on his own grounds , and so revolting are these laws to the dictates of nature and reason , that in order to enforce them , the most barbarous means are necessarily resorted to on the part of the owners of game , and by a succession of statutes the punishment has been rendered more and more severe , until the killing of a hare or a partridge is little loss penal than murder . // 1821 ( 2ottu 0Th ? ng*isk Law . Even the trial by jury  --  the boast of Englishmen  --  the palladium of liberty , comes short of its object , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks , that of a provoked and resentful minister . The existence of ex officio informations , which M. Cottu professes himself unable to reconcile with the genius of the English laws , we pronounce without hesitation to be utterly repugnant to it . The power to arraign an individual on any charge at the pleasure of the attorney-general without the intervention of a grand jury , which is denied to every other prosecutor , is reserved to the most dangerous and powerful of all prosecutors , the government . An administration with this engine in its hands , and with profligacy enough to employ it , need not regret the absence of the star chamber and high commission . It is no apology that this measure of prosecution is not often resorted to ; it is sufficient that it exists , to alarm every Englishman who loves his liberty . The late attempts to bring this mode of proceeding into use have been met with so much spirit by the petty juries , that no very dangerous consequences from it are at present to be apprehended ; but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will be the most powerful instrument of its destruction . With all these humih-* ating badges of ancient servitude about them , it becomes the . English to talk modestly of their prerogatives . Let them remember that their present happy condition has not always been the pride of their nation . It is not two hundred years since England began to emerge from feudal darkness . In that time she has done much , but she must not forget that much remains to be done . The commons , who now carry themselves so proudly , have within a century and a half thought it a privilege to address their sovereign on the bended knees of their hearts . ' The bench , which now appears the merciful advo. * cate of the accused , has within half that time descended to expressions of wanton cruelty or vindictive malice , which an Englishman of the present day shudders to recall . The discussions in parliament , which are now spread daily before the public , have within sixty years been communicated under the pretty title of debates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , it is greatly to be regretted that it should stop short of the highest degree of excellence in government , to which humanity can reach . We can not bt4t hope that much may yet b* done , and we sincerely wish suc // cess to all endeavors for the advancement of the happiness of Britain . At present , however , those nations , who admire and are desirous to imitate her , should be reminded , that in trans* planting her invaluable constitution , many exerescencies are to be pruned , and many distortions to be corrected . M. Cottu in the closing chapters points out to his countrymen some of the difficulties which present themselves in the adoption of the English municipal regulations . ' These difficulties , he observes , arise not only from the prejudices which have survived the changes legally effected in the ancient con .. stitution of the kingdom , but still more from those which have been *produced by the revolution . ' A nation like France , which has plunged from the severest despotism to the wildest democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression , can hardly be in a condition to adopt and carry into operation a code the most complicated that human ingenuity has ever framed . To make way for its admission , a thousand prejudices are to be eradicated ; the people are to be prepared by education to know the value and importance of self government ; and in order to produce this effect it is necessary that they should learn to estimate themselves , and to obey the law , and perform the duties of citizens for the sake of themselves and their children , and not because they are bidden . iVL . Cottu seems to have discovered what is little understood in these days oF paper constitutions and bills of rights ; that it is freemen who make the government , and not the government that makes freemen ; that the only foundation of rational liberty is a general diffusion of knowledge , and of religious and moral principle . He recommends as the first and indispensable measure the establishment of an aristocracy , and to this end he advises the restoration of the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no doubt of the correctness of this course . Every thing in that country tends to the extreme of democracy . The blind devotion to rank and titles , which prevailed there before the revolution , has given place to the opposite spirit . The doctrine of perfect equality is still as strong , though not as fashionable , as it was thirty years since ; every distinction between citizen and citizen is looked upon with jealousy . For a republican form of government France is entirely unprepared , and a monarchy in such a state , without some intermediate barrier against the encroachments of the people , must be despotic , if it can exist // at all . To build up this aristocracy , to lay aside gradually the military police , to establish the liberty of the press , to accus* torn the people to govern and to be governed by each other , to substitute the ambition of civil distinction for that of milita* ry glory , to rear sound principles of morals in the place of superstition on the one hand , and infidelity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if indeed it do not prove to be impracticable . In the mean time this ill fated country must be content to reap the bitter fruits of past errors , hap.
