txt ART . XXII. -i . A new American Atlas , containing Jlijaps of the several States of the . JV'orth American Union , pro* jected and drawn on a uniform Scale , from Documents found in the Public Offices of the United States and State Gove*nments , and other original and authentic Information . By HENRY S. TANNER . Philadelphia , 1823. 2 . A General Atlas , containing distinct Maps of all the known Countries in the World ; constructed from the latest Authorities . Published by FIELDING LucAs , JUN . Baltimore , 1823 . No branch of study has been gaining ground more rapidly and successfully among us , durin.g the last few years , than that of geography . Till recently our books and maps were few in number , and exceedingly defective in their execution . Morse 's first editions were faulty in the extreme , comprising a mass of materials , historical , topographical , statistical , and political , thrown together without method , selected with very little discrimination , and often with a looseness quite as likely to deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . From sources like these , our schools , and the community at large , were compelled to draw much the larger portion of their geographical knowledge . We mean this censure to apply , however , only to the earlier editions ; the work has undergone gradual changes , and every one for the better . In its present dress , as arranged after the // 1824 . Tanner 's *Itlas. method of Pinkerton , we esteem Morse 's Geography a valuable work , and we trust its present , and its future merits and usefulness , will be the means of wearing out some of the wrong impressions , which it has formerly contributed to fix in the minds , not only of our own countrymen , but of foreigners . The general accuracy of the last edition encourages the anticipation of such a result . In correct atlases and maps we have been scarcely less deficient , than in good books of geography . In this respect , however , a very favorable change has taken place within a few years . With a laudable and generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions for new surveys , and appointed skilful topographers to carry their resolutions into effect , and collect materials for a minute delineation of the features of the country . In some instances , very elegant and valuable maps have been constructed from these surveys , drawn on a large scale , and adapted to practical purposes . In the beauty of execution , and , we believe we may say with confidence , in the accuracy of construction , we have seen nothing in their way superior to the atlases of Mr Tanner , and Mr Lucas . They do equal credit to the skill of the artists , and to the enterprise , industry , taste , and geographical knowledge of the authors and publishers . Each of these works has an object essentially distinct from that of the other , and each supplies a vacancy , which no other separate series of maps within our knowledge could supply so well . Mr Tanner 's Atlas is confined almost exclusively to delineations of the American continent . It is commenced with a map of the World , of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finish to his general plan , and show the relations in which America stands to the other quarters of the globe . These are in themselves large and well delineated maps , and sufficiently minute for common purposes . In his Geographical Memoir , prefixed to his Atlas , Mr Tanner explains his object in the following words . The end proposed to be effected , by the publication of the Ame .. rican Atlas , was to exhibit to the citizens of the United States a complete geographical view of their own country , disencumbered of that minute detail on the geography of the eastern hemisphere , which is usually introduced into our atlases , to the eiclnsion of // matter more immediately interesting to those for whom they are intended . The mischievous tendency of this course is to enhance the price of such works to an extent entirely disproportioned to the limited increase of utility , which such unnecessary detail confers . Influenced by these considerations , I determined in the outset to introduce into my Atlas such maps only , relating to the Old Continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geography , as connected with the object of this work . For this purpose , maps of the World , Europe , Asia , and Africa , were prepared from the most approved European authorities ; to which were added such alterations and improvements , as the late discoveries and unparalleled events in Europe rendered necessary , especially with regard to the boundaries as fixed by the Congress of Vienna , and the more recent changes , which some of those boundaries have undergone . ' The author 's Map of South America we presume is the best , which has been published in this country , yet , the affairs of that immense portion of our continent are daily becoming so important , we think it would have been better , if he had enlarged his design , projected his map from a larger scale , and spread it over a greater number of sheets . We believe the sale would have in the end more than remunerated him for the increased labor and expense of such an undertaking . But in its present form his map is remarkably full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rank . He acknowledges himself chiefly indebted to La Cruz , Arrowsmith , Pazo , and the Reports of the United States ' Commissioners , Bland , Rodney , and Poinsett . We prespme La Cruz 's great map , as brought down to the year 1817 , corrected and published by Faden in London , is in many respects the most valuable map e'ttant of the South American Continent , if we mistake not , this map was chiefly relied on by the American Commissioners in drawing up their Reports . Mr Tanner acquaints us at large with the authorities on which he depended for his maps of North America , and of the United States , and remarks with discrimination on the merits and defects of each . In tracing the northern boundary ef the United States , he has avoided the error , which occurs in almost all our recent maps of North America . He runs the line from the meridian of the Lake of the Woods , on the forty ninth parallel of latitude , till its meets the Rocky Nountains , // and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Ocean is left undefined , as it has never been settled by treaty between Great Britain and the United States . Commonly in our maps this line is carried through from the Lake of the Woods to the Ocean . In speaking of the deserved estimation in which Vancouver 's charts are held , Mr Tanner remarks , The Ukase of the Emperor of Russia of September 4th , 1821 , declares , that " All trade , whale fishing , fishing in general , and every branch of business in the ports and bays , and in general along the whole northwest coast of America , from Behrings Straits to the fifty first degree of north latitude , as also , along the Aleutian Islands , and on the east coast of Siberia , are permitted to Russian subjects only . Every foreign vessel is consequently prohibited , not only from landing on any of the coasts or islands specified in the foregoing section , but also from approaching them within a less distance than one hundred Italian miles . Whoever shall violate this prohibition is liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be perceived , that the territory over which the emperor of Russia claims sovereignty , embraces a considerable portion of the discoveries of Cook , Vancouver , and Quadra , and is in fact a denial of the United States to any part of that territory beyond the latitude of fifty one degrees north . Whether the title of the United States to " the countries situated between the fifty first and sixtieth degrees of north latitude , *** be well or ill founded , is a question , the discussion of which is foreign to the purpose of this Memoir . The document under consideration was consulted , simply with a view to show the extent of the extravagant claims set up by Alexander ; for this purpose the limits are indicated on my map by the characters usually employed to represent boundary lines that exist only in the imagination , and such as are not admitted by all the parties concerned . ' Geographical Memoir , p. 3 . Speaking further on this subject , Mr Tanner adds , The northern boundary of the United States I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners , appointed under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent . The continuation of that line was drawn in strict conformity to the British treaty of 1818 , which specifies that " a line drawn from the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods due north or south , as the See Report of the Committee of the House of Representatives of the Uniteti States on this subject , made disring the session of 1820-1S21. // 386 April , ease may be , until the said line shall intersect the forty ninth parallel of north latitude , and from the point of such intersection due west along and with the said parallel , shall be the line of demarkation between the territories of the United States and those of his Britannic Majesty , and that the said line shall form the northern boundary of the territories of the United States , and the southern boundary of the territories of his Britannic Majesty , from the Lake of the Woods to the Stony Mountains . " I have inserted the above with the view of exposing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Ocean . In this particular , all our most approved maps are false . There is no passage in the treaty of London , the only authentic document on the subject , which affords the slightest ground for supposing that its extension west of the Oregon Mountains was contemplated by either party ; on the contrary , it was agreed by the third article of that treaty , that " the right of either party to the country westward of the Stony Mountains " should remain open for future * Memoir , p. 8 . We have quoted thus largely , because at some future time this may become a subject of importance , and because the author's- commendable caution on this point is no slight proof of his diligence and accuracy in others of less moment . In his list of authorities he enumerates all the good maps and gazetteers , which have been published of the different states . Several manuscript maps were also consulted by him , and he exhibits abundant evidence of having obtained many original particulars in the topography of the new states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by which he has been enabled to correct some important errors , that had crept into the works of his predecessors . In short , we are convinced by his Memoir , and by such inspection of his Atlas as our opportunity has allowed us to make , that he is strictly accurate in the following statement of his labors , and the sources of his information . That I have availed myself , ' says he , of nearly all the recent and valuable additions to our stock of geographical knowledge , on the two continents of North and South America , particularly the former , will , I trust , be admitted by all who shall have directed their attention to the ample and original matter contained in the work . In the construction of the maps I have endeavored , as far as my feeble capacity would permit , to select from the immense mass of materials collected for the purpose such only , as were founded // upon actual surveys and astronomical observations ; and , in the absence of these , the relations of travellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of confidence , were resorted to . Information regarding the United States generally , I have sedulously endeavored to collect from every possible source , and the multitude of publications on subjects connected with it have been freely used . ' p. 17 . The only instance discovered by us , in which the author has deviated from his rule of relying on the best authority , is in the map of Africa . We there find inserted a new river and city , on the authority of Captain Riley , which in this matter is about as good , we suppose , as the fabulous narrative of Robert Adams , or the fictitious travels of Damberger , or the romance of Gaudentio di Lucca . Not that we are wholly skeptical in regard to the honesty aud general accuracy of Captain Riley , in things which came under his own observation , although even here some allowance must be made for a warm imagination and a predominant love of the marvellous . But this story of a great river , and a city called Wassanab south of the Niger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab , whom he had many reasons to distrust and despise , and to whose idle tales he ought not to have listened for a moment . New insertions , on such authority , are not likely to stamp a map with much value , and their tendency is injurious by leading to the suspicion , that the author 's judgment and discrimination may have failed him in other instances not so obvious . It is a merit in Mr Tanner 's Atlas , that the maps of the states , and others in which the plan could be conveniently followed , are exhibited on a unjform scale . This arrangement is peculiarly well fitted for communicating correct irapressions to learners , and is always to be preferred where it can be introduced . On the whole , as an . lmerican . *tias , we believe Mr Tanner 's work to hold a rank far above any other , which has been published . The authentic documents to which he had access , the abundance of his materials , the apparent fidelity , with which they are compiled , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are executed , all these afford ample proofs of the high character of the Work , of its usefulness as a means of extending the geogra* // phical knowledge of our own country , and of its claims to public patronage . Mr Lucas 's Cabinet Atlas is intended to occupy another sphere ; it contains a series of maps embracing the whole surface of the globe , constructed in a form and brought into a compass suitable for constant reference and use . The work is introduced by a plate representing the comparative heights of the principal mountains , and also another exhibiting the comparative lengths and magnitudes of the chief rivers of the world , which latter was devised and drawn by Mr Lucas . In addition to these plates the Atlas contains ninety eight maps . To give greater completeness and value to his work , the author has inserted , by way of introduction , seven ancient maps , which embrace the Roman Empire , Greece , Palestine , Egypt , and the expeditions of Alexander , and exhibit the topography of the whole ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to answer the general ends of historical reference . Modern Europe is delineated on nineteen maps , one being assigned to each of the principal countries . Asia has seven maps , and Africa five , reckoning in this number distinct maps of the Madeira , the Canary , and the Cape de Verd Islands . Some of these were drawn by Mr Lucas , but generally they are copied from the most approved European maps , with such additions and changes as late events have rendered necessary . Of North America , including Canada , the United States , and Mexico , there are thirty one maps . All of these , except two or three , were drawn by Mr Lucas , and many of them , especially those of the new states and the territories , manifest much research and diligence in procuring materials , as well as judgment in selecting and using them . Distinct maps are given of Indiana , Illinois , Missouri , Arkansa Territory , and of the Northwest and Michigan Territories , and apparently with so much detail as to designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division , with which it can be important to be made acquainted in the present stage of advancement itt those districts of the Union . One excellent result of our system of public surveys is , that it affords the means of ohfaming an exact delineation of the natural features of the // country , leaving to future topographers no other task than that of filling up the outlines thus accurately and permanently established . For this reason the maps of the new states , taken from the government surveys , are for the most part much moPe faithful , than those of the old states , where the surveys have been irregular , performed at different times , and for various purposes . We have seldom seen so good a set of maps of the West Indies , as those in Mr Lucas 's work . They are twenty in number , and mostly drawn by himself from the best published authorities , and from the charts and information afforded by practical seamen . To each of the large islands a map is devoted , containing the names of places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small islands , rocks , and shoals on the coasts , thus communicating knowledge equally valuable to the general inquirer and the navigator . The author would seem to have bestowed more than usual care on this part of his work . Six maps of South America close the series , five of which , namely , Colombia , Brazil , the United Provinces , Peru , and Chili , were drawn by the author . These are finely executed , and present a more full view of the present topographical state of those countries , we believe , than is anywhere else to he found within the same compass . The author relied mainly on the authority of Faden 's last edition of La Cruz , and to a higher he could not have trusted . For later changes he has examined the most authentic maps and documents . In every respect this Atlas answers the object for which it was intended ; it is an excellent compend of maps for practical purposes , being sufficiently copious and minute for all the ordinary inquiries in geography and history . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of his time to the work , and his well known ability as a geographer and skilful draftsman would be enough to insure its accuracy , were this less evident than it is from internal testimony . As far as his work relates to America , both North and South , and to the West Indies , it is particularly valuable ; and if we were to select a single atlas , in which our purpose would be to obtain the greatest amount of matter within the smallest space , presented in a commodious form , and at a compara // tively moderate expense , we should not hesitate to choose this in preference to any we have seen . It has another commendable trait also , which ought not to be slightly passed over ; we mean the uncommon beauty and elegance of the mechanical execution . This characteristic prevails in all Mr Lucas 's maps , and is not more creditable to his zeal for his favorite science , than to his taste and love of the arts . He is sparing of his mountains , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none exist , for the sake of filling up a vacant space . Indeed , for neat .. ness in the drawing , for the finished execution of the artist , and the exquisite beauty of coloring , no maps have come under our eye , either from abroad or among those published in this country , which can claim precedence to several specimens contained in Mr Lucas 's Atlas . We have cheerfully embraced an opportunity to say as much as we have done , in expressing our opinion of the works before us , considering them honorable to the country , and among the strong marks of our literary and scientific advancement ; they are trophies of American enterprise , which it becomes a discerning public to regard with favor , and reward with substantial patronage ; and we hope the authors will be encouraged to pursue the labors , which they have thus far prosecuted with so much credit to themselves , and so much benefit to the community .                   @ @
