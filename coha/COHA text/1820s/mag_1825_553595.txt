To which is prefixed an Historical and Statistical Account of the City ; with a Plan of the City , View of the Water Works , and other Engravings . pp. 238 . Carey &amp; Lea . Philadelphia . 1824 . IT was a remark of one of the wisest and best men , whom the world has seen , that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness , between duty and advantage , between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy , and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity . ' By the writer of a brief history of Philadelphia , this remark of Washington is quoted , as being fully illustrated in the rise and growth of that city . And , indeed , there are many associations connected with the origin of Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropist and the patriotic citizen of the United States . Its foundation was laid in peace and concord . Our ancestors in general , however gently we may touch their motives and temper , merit little for their wisdom and discretion , in their conduct with the Indians . They were too prone to look on the wild man as an inferior being , and to set themselves up as lords over his rights and property , without remembering that they were intruders on his soil , or condescending to meet him even in the land of his fathers on equal and amicable terms . To the reproach of many of our progenitors , whose virtues in other respects speak volLimes in their praise , the sword was too often made by them the charter of their rights , and the instrument of gaining ascendancy over the natives . But the memorable interview of William Penn with the Indians , on the bank of the Delaware , exhibited a different scene ; the even scales of justice , and the mild persuasion of christian love , were the powerful engines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage to confide in the sincerity of the white man ; and the first page in the annals of Philadelphia is one of the brightest in the history of mankind , recording an event not more to the credit of the wise and benevolent legislator , through whose agency it happened , than honorable to humanity itself . It was here also , that religious toleration was made the basis of a government at its beginning , and religious freedom established at a time , when the yoke of bigotry and superstition was bowing to the dust the necks of almost // all the inhabitants of civilised Europe . In later times it was here , that the first Congress of the colonies assembled , and the articles of confederation and union were agreed upon ; and it was here that American Independence was first declared . This city was moreover the residence of Franklin , Rittenhouse , Rush , and of other men , who contributed to achieve our nation 's liberties , an d who deserve a nation 's gratitude . At the beginning of the year 1681 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tract of ground upon which PhiLidelphia now stands was covered with forests ; and wild men and savdge beasts had a pretty equal title to it . Tradition has preserved the anecdote , that in the year 1678 , a ship called the Shields of Stockton , the first that had ever ventured to sail so high up the river approached so close to the shore in tacking as to run her bowsprit among the trees which then lined the bank , and the passengers on board , who were bound for Burlington , remarked upon it as an advantageous site for a town . Little could they foresee the city that was to be erected upon that spot , or the contrast between its growth and that of the still humble village for which they were destined . The love of religious liberty led to the foundation of Philadelphia . William Penn had fixed his thoughts upon America as a land of refuge and freedom , many years previous to his acquisition of Pennsylvania . It was not , however , until August 1682 , that this venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave of England . They were accompanied with favorable winds , and on the twentyfourth of October the proprietary landed at New-* castle , amid the acclamations of the Dutch and Swedish settlers . From this place he proceeded to Upland , ( now called Chester , ) and shortly afterwards concluded that famous treaty with the natives , which they promised should endure " as long as the trees should grow , or the waters hold their course ; " a promise , which was faithfully kept during the whole period of the proprietary government . ' Previously to the arrival of the proprietor , some of the cmi. grants , who had preceded him , provided for themselves temporary accommodations on the site of the city , in bark huts , which the natives taught them to erect , or in caves dug in the high bank that overhung the Delaware . In one of these rude caves was born the first native Philadelphian. * The first house erected in Philadel .. * John Key , who reached the patriarchal age of eightyfive , and died at Kennet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in a cave , afterwards known by the name of Pennypot , on the Bank near Race street . Proud relates of him , that when near eighty , he walked from Kennet to the city , a distance of thirty miles , in one day . The natives of these dwellings of primitive simplicity , seem to have approached the primitive longevity ; for Edward Drinker , who was also born hi a cave , survived until the declaration of independence . // phia was a low wooden building , on the east side of Front street , in what was called Budd 's Row , a little to the north of the creek or inlet now occupied by Dock street , and which originally flowed as far to the north and west as Chesnut and Third streets . The owner kept a tavern there , called The Blue Anchor , ' for many years . One of the first brick buildings erected in Philadelphia , was a house , which till very recently stood on the north side of Chesnut street , opposite Carpenter*s Court . In Letitia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied as his town residence , and which was erected within a few years after his arrival . Upwards of eighty houses , of different sizes , were erected during the first year ; and the foundation being now laid , the proprietor addressed a letter of general information and description respecting the country , to the " Society of Free Traders , " the following passage of which conveys his thoughts and wishes in regard to the infant city . " Philadelphia , the expectation of those that are concerned in this province , is at last laid out , to the great content of those here that are any ways interested therein . rrhe situation is a neck of land , and lieth between two navigable rivers , Delaware and Sculkil ; whereby it hath two fronts upon the water each a mile ; and two from river to river . Delaware is a glorious river ; but the Sculkil , being an hundred miles boatable above the falls , and its course north east , towards the fountain of Susquahanna , ( that tends to the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is like to be a great part of the settlement of this age . I say little of the town itself because a platform will be shewn you by my agent ; in which those who are purchasers of me will find their names and interests . But this I will say for the good providence of God , that of all the many places I have seen in th' world , I remember not one better seated ; so that it seems to me to have been appointed for a town , whether we regard the rivers or the conveniency of the coves , docks , springs , the loftiness and soundness of the land , and the air , held by the people of these parts to be very good . It is advanced within less than a year to about four score houses and cottages , such as they are ; where merchants and handicrafts are following their vocations as fast as they can ; while the countrymen are close at their farms . Some of them got a little winter corn in the ground last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are preparing for their winter corn . They reaped their barley this year in the month called May ; the wheat in the month following ; so that there is time in these parts for another crop of divers things before the winter season . We are daily in hopes of shipping to add to our number ; for blessed be God , here is both room and accommodation for them . The stories of our necessity being either the // fear of our friends , or the scarecrows of our enemies . For the greatest hardship we have suffered hath been salt meat ; which by towi in winter , and fish in summer , together with some poultry , lamb , mutton , veal , and plenty of venison , the best part of the year hath been made very passable . I bless God , I am fully satisfied with the country , and entertainment I got in it . For I find that particular content which has always attended me , where God in his providence hath made it my place and service to reside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the number of houses , began to increase with great rapidity . On the 12th of January , 1683 , the first general assembly of representatives convened at Philadelphia ; and on the second day of the succeeding March , the first grand jury for the city was summoned . It is remarkable , that the first conviction , in a place of so much simplicity , was for counterfeiting the silver coin , an offence most generally the offspring of an advanced stage of society , and for the execution of which neither the materials nor che requisite privacy would seem likely to have been found. * Another trial was of one Margaret Mattson , indicted for witchcraft . The jury , with characteristic simplicity , found her " guilty of having the common fame of being a witch , but not guilty in manner and form as she stands indicted . " The governor and his council presided as judges on this occasion ; and it was not until the end of the succeeding year , that persons were appointed to act in the judicial capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having been instituted on defective principles , and not well adapted to advance the prosperity of the city , or secure the liberty of the citizens . Several changes were introduced from time to time* but it was not till 1796 , that the present system was established . The mere enumeration of the public institutions of this city , established and supported for the diffusion of education , the relief of distress , the improvement of the human condition , the advancement of philosophy and literature , and similar purposes , will probably surprise even most of those in whose vicinity philanthropy has been so actively at work . In this labor of usefulness , it is right to say , that the members of the society of * have had their full share . A large proportion of the charities and comforts of Philadelphia has been derived from the unwearied philanthropy of this excellent sect , who have imparted something of their own love of solid usefulness , and their unostentatious benevolence , to the general character of the city . It is a subject of frequent reThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less remarkatile . He was sentenced to pay a fine of forty pounds towards the building of - a court house ! In the country from which the judges had just come , he . would have been hung . So much wem* their ideas already purified. // proach against the " Friends , " that they are averse , or at least indifferent to the cultivation of human learning . How unfounded the aspersion is , at least as respects the Quakers of Philadelphia , will be seen in the account of their literary establishments in the following pages . Probably at least one half even of the best informed inhabitants of Philadelphia are ignorant that there are not less than fifteen public schools established by this society in different parts of the city-that in the principal institution are taught the Latin , Greek and Hebrew languages , the mathematical sciences and natural philosophy , the public lectures are delivered in it on botany , mineralogy , &amp;c. that it possesses an observatory , containing the most valuable astronomical instruments , a cabinet of minerals , and an extensive library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Philadelphians , to learn that a public library founded by the friends , has existed for many years in the central part of the city , containing several thousand volumes , and open without any charge once a week to all respectable applicants . These institutions , and the silence and modesty with which their operations are conducted , are characteristic of Philadelphia . ' pp. 10 , 11 . To the following short notice of the commerce of the city , several valuable tables are attached , exhibiting the state of commerce in Philadelphia as compared with that of Baltimore , New York , . and Boston . For a considerable period after the peace of 1783 , Philadelphia stood at the head of the commercial cities of the Union . The profitable carrying trade , and the great demand in Europe for bread stuffs , consequent upon the wars , which arose out of the French Revolution , caused great activity in commerce , and greatly enriched this city . The superior advantages of New York , however , arising from her proximity to the ocean , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed her at a great distance beyond the other ports of the United States . After the peace of 1813 , the commerce of Philadelphia declined to a very low ebb , in common with that of Boston , Baltimore , and other cities . The new state of things produced by a general peace had closed many profitable avenues ; new channels were to be found ; large profits were no longer to be expected ; and it required some time for mercantile habits to adapt themselves to the change . Within the last four years , however , commerce and trade have again revived ; a steady though gradual improvement is taking place , and Philadelphia is evidently resuming her former elevated rank in commerce . ' pp. 21,32 . The American Philosophical Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences , are thus described . The first was founded in 1743 , principally by the exertions of *r Franklin . Th iTh* anethor institution for the same objects , // was formed , calied " The American Society for promoting useful Knowledge ; " and these two Societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The American Philosophical Society held at Philadelphia for promoting useful Knowledge. ** About the year 1785 , the society erected , for their accommodation , a large and commodious building , on a part of the State House square , granted to them by the legislature of Pennsylvania . The library of the Society consists of about 6000 volumes , of which a scientific catalogue has been recently printed , and is exceedingly valuable . The collection of the Transactions of foreign Academies is undo*btedly the most complete in this country . The society have also a collection of objects of natural history , consisting principally of minerals and fossil remains . The meetings of the society are held on the first and third Fridays of every month , from October to May , both inclusive ; and on the third Friday of the other four months . On the other Friday evenings , the rooms are opened for the purpose of reading and conversation , and strangers are introduced . The society have published seven volumes of Transactions in quarto , and have an eighth now in the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main object of this institution is the cultivation of the exact sciences . It was thought important , however , to extend its views to history , moral science , and general literature ; and a branch of the society , under the name of a standing committee , was formed for this purpose in 1815 . This committee has been actively and suctessfully engaged in the collection of historical documents , principally those relatin* to the United States . They published , in 1819 , a separate volume of transactions , in * The presidents of the society have bee , Benjamin Franklin , David Rittenheuse , Thomas Jefferson , Caspar Wistar , and Robert Patterson . The officers of the society are elected annually , except twelve counsellors , who are elected for three years , one third of whom vacate their seats annually . ' pp. 99 , 100 . The Academy of Natural Sciences , was formed in 1812 , and incorporated in 1817 . Without pretension or public encourageinent , it has added largely to the stock of science , and gradually acquired a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a president , two vice presidents , a corresponding secretary , a recording secretary , a treasurer , a librarian , four curators , and three auditors . Each member pays an initiation fee of ten dollars , and a quarterly contribution of three dollars . The library contains about 5000 volumes , among which is the most valuable and extensive collection of works on natural history is the United States . A very large and valuable herbarium , and // collections of shells , fossils , mineral and geological specimens , birds , quadropeds , &amp;c. compose the cabinet . A great number of the most valuable of the works in this collection , have been bestowed by its munificent benefhctor , William Maclure. in 1817 , the Academy commenced the periodical publication of some of the valuable l ) aPe ) 5 read before it . Under the unassuming title of " The Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences , " three volumes have appeared , the contents of which are honorable to the scientific men of Philadelphia . ' pp. 100 , 101 . The little volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fund of information respecting the present state of Philadelphia , its municipal regulations , topography , commerce , manufactures , religious institutions , charitable and humane societies , literature , education , conrts of judicature , navigation , and innumerable other particulars . The design of the work is good , and although in some of its departments it is exceedingly well executed , in others it is defective . We instance manufactures as a very important subject , which is touched upon but slightly . There is a minute description of the celebrated Water Works on the Schuylkill , which may well be considered the pride of the city , as they might justly be of any city in the world . An extraordinary rhapsody is introduced into the first part of the volume , which makes an odd impression in contrast with the modest historical sketch that precedes it , and harmonises but awkwardly with the sober character of the work . The plan of this publication is worthy of being imitated in all our cities . The information thus communicated would be highly beneficial ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of improvement , and show every citizen what has been done , and what still remains for future achievement .
