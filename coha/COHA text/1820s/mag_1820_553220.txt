txt Aur . V.-Reeolleclwns uj t7urrunaTna some of his Gotemporaries . By Oharles Phdlips , Esq . 8vo. pp. 840 . New York , C. Wiley &amp; Co. 1818 . W* Americans have a right to criticise Mr. Curran , for perhaps no one man has done so much injury to the taste of our country . This however is something of a compliment , for although we are not convinced that our national taste has ever yet reached the very summit of perfection , still we trust that it is not so tatally ( lepra*ed , as to be seduced and led astray by that which has neither beauty nor merit to recommend it . It was said by some one , that the commnjn people are the best judges of eloquence : ' and we recollect having seen the remark quoted by one of the editors of Curran 's Speeches , for the purpose no doubt of warning all evil-minded critics , that the merit of his o*tory had already been passed upon . If it be so , it is only left for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin by denying the truth of the above remark . Mere buffoonery ivill excite the laughter of a popular assembly ; mere rant and declamation will frequently call forth their applauses . And if it be true that every oration is eloquent , which has found a rabble silly enough to give it their approbation , then has the world , all along , been under a gross mistake lii supposing that eloquence is one of the fine arts , and the profession of the orator is but a degree above that of the jugg#r or the mountebank . Maintaining , therefore , that there is no impropriety in discussing , or , if need be , of ( lenying the merits of a speech ; even though in so doing , we should contradict the decision of an Irish w any other mob ; we are now willing to make some concessions on the other side . Eloquence , like government , is designed for the people , and ought to be fitted to them . // And as we should have little opinion of the constitution which , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a fair trial command the afl'ectioiis of the great body of the people ; so we should think that style of oratory , to say the least of it , very useless , which could produce no effect , hut upon a few minds , which had been formed by peculiar studies . But this no more proves that the people are the best judges of eloquence , than it proves that they are the best politicians . We protest against the merits of a speech being estimated by the number of tiinnes the orator is interrupted by *ipplause , or by the round an ( l unqualified opinion which ignorant men may pronounce of its excellence . But then we have rio doubt that the real effect which the orator produces upon a common audience , his permanent success in accomplishing his objects , may be considered the true measure of his eloquence , though it is riot always a safe one ; since his success is frequently assisted or retarded by circumstances foreign to the merit of his address . When we speak of his success , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , not to excite noise and laughter , but to produce conviction on a given subject , or to inculcate particular opinions , or to impel his hearers to a particular course of conduct . And when this is the case , we assert that the style of address best suited to his purpose is precisely that which correct tte would most approve . If then , what is meant , by calling the common people the best judges of eloquence , he merely that real eloquence will never fail of coin manding their admiration : nay , if more he meant , that nothing will produce so strong and deep an effect upon any assembly as good sense and correct taste , then we not only assent to the proposition , hut we are ready to maintain its truth . Indeed how can it he otherwise ? Criticism , hy which the canons of taste are collected , must regard the operation of part icular qualities in the . works of art , on those faculties #nd passions , which nature has bestowed upon all men in common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ob* servations to the operations of such qualities upon minds , which have been refined by art , until nature has lost its influence with them ; then the criticism itself is unsound , and its deductions not to be regarded . It is true , perhaps , that the pub ! ic taste may become so perverted , the public mind so contaminated and debased , as to have lost its capacity of // relishing real beauty or sublimity when offered it . But this at worst can only happen when public morals shall have reached their lowest point of degradation ; and when this happens , it will be of little use to inquire which is the best style of eloquence ; as the bar , the popular assembly , and the senate will before that time have ceased to be the theatres of free discussion . But still the memory of our readers may suggest instances in which it may seem that equal , or even deeper effect , has been produced by false taste , than could have been l ) roducefl by real eloquence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without oar being driven to such a conclusion . There may be a great deal of cloqueoce mixed up with what is talse and meretricious , a great deal of vigour and strength with what is coarse and vulgar , a great deal that is wild and beauticul with what is forced , unnatural , and conceited . Now the mob are not very discriminating ; when they admire . or condemn , it is for the whole . They are however upon ordinary occasions more disposed to approbation , Ihan to censure ; and where there is any thing really calculated to produce effect , they will not resist its operation , because it is accomanied with what is 5u1 ) erfluou$ or tawdry . But it is not so with men of a certain degree of refinement . rrhleir palate is too nice not to discover the mixture , and they are perhaps too often disposed rather to reject the whole , than to swallow the bad for the sake of tWe good . We do not say that this is correct ; but that this fastidiousness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an be no doubt . Thus it is certain that very great and important effect is produced by field preachers9 whom the majority of the educated would call vulgar and illiterate . But the truth is , such men generally pos* sess some of the most important requisites of real eloquence ; and with all their coarseness they exhibit a rigour of ' cmiception , a strength of language , andan earnestness of manner , which wiser men would do well to acquire . But will any one pretend that the same rigour and strength would be less powerful if it were likewise graceful ; or that  --  the same earnestness would not be at least equally attractive , if it wer6 accompanied with purity of language and correctness of thought ? There is another fact worthy of.attention . Men of edocalion generally form for themselves an ideal standard of excellence , // by which they are very a*t to measure the merits of a particular performance . But it is not so with the mass ; these latter , when they listen to a speech , are glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords them amusement or excitenient , they seldom think of making comparisons , or of entering into an inquiry , whether the occasion did not allow the speaker to produce an effect of a different or a higher kind . But although satisfied , for the time , with what has hut little merit , and perhaps many positive faults , it does not follow that they would not have been more deeply and 1 ) ermanently* affected with such a performance , as would likewise have commanded the approbation of men of more intellectual refinement . We might find illustration of the truth of these remarks , every time we atten* the theatre . If in the beginning of a piece , a second rate performer appears , whatever may be his affectation , however unnatural his measured enunciation , and imperfect his conception of his part , yet if he possess a fine voice , a handsome figure , and a tolerable degree of spirit arid animation in his bad acting , the majority of the audience will applaud and appear as they really are , perfectly satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home warm in their approbation of what they had seen . But let another actor of genius and of more taste appear . and the late favourite sinks into neglect ; he struts and rants almost unnoticed ; and by the deep silence which at one moment fills the house , and the enthusiasm with which , at the next , the applauses are poured forth , it may he seen how much deeper and more real is the interest now felt . But how happens it then , especially since the common people are more disposed to applaud than to condemi* , that we so often hear orations and sermons , which are thought good by men of education , but to the merits of which other men are totally blind ? We answer , that it must he owing to some fault , generally it is true to some negative fault , in the style or structure of the piece . Dulncss , for instance , is what a mixed audience will never tolerate ; and it is almost the only sin which an orator may not sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oration may be rather dull and jejune , yet if it contain sensible and sound thought , and be besides critically correct , men of refinement will often vouchsafe it their approbation . But they would not pretend that there was eloquence in the piece ; nor ought they to b* // surprised , that men , to whom mental exertion is not habitual , do not find a recompense for dulness of manner , in mere correctness of thought . But besides this , a style may not only be correct , but highly polished ; and yet be but poorly fitted for oratory . An oration , for instance , written in the manner of Dugald Stewart , would , even if listened to , produce no effect upon a mixed audience . This is not because his style wants ornament ; nor because itis used in treating of profound subjects . We frequently hear arguments at the bar upon subjects fully as perplexed , founded on the most hidden principles of human nature or of civil society , composed too in a style of chaste and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every part of the audience . But it is , that such a style , as that just mentioned , admirable as it is in its place , is really defective , when considered in reference to the purposes of the orator . It wants fulness ; it does not give the connecting links in the chain of thought , as they ought to he given in a spoken address ; it leaves too much to be supplied by the hearer . In the hands of the orator , therefore , it would be an obscure style , without implying an obscurity in his own mind . It should be recollected too , that there ought to be a diffem*ence in the structure , is well as in the style , of a piece which is intended to be spoken , and one which is intended only for the eye of the reader . It is owing to a forgetfulness of this difference , that many very sensible written orations fail of producing*auy important effect . A very great j ) ortion of those performances which we hear fr 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subje ? t , and sits down to vrite whatever he thinks important , of , *about , or connected with that subject ; the consequence is , that if his hearers follow him in his course of thought , they discover no definite point to which his remarks were directed , and the discourse is only remembered by one or two more striking observations , which are left fioatin* in the mind , and of course are soon lost . But when a man starts for the purpose of proving particular truths , or of producing particular impressions , he will naturally give a close texture and an unity to his discourse . His hearers , if he make himself intelligible , will discover a direction and an object in what he says ; and although he should deal out no gaudy sentences to he remembered by themselves , yet the impression produced by the whole will remain , and with it much of the general course of thougbt bywbich that impression was produced . // We believe , then , that in every instance , where good sense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure may be accounted for without supposing that the people require false declamation . Real eloquence-such as men of taste may admire. - is never disregarded but*under the most extra*ordinary circumstances ; and nothing else is ever certain of producing a real and permanent effect . If a man 's ambition is to be satisfied with the momentary applauses of the vulgar , applause which any good rope- dancer might rob him of , why let him collect a few sounding epithets , and as much unnatural imagery as he can , and spout forth a little frothy water on a gaudy day , and remain silent all the rest of the year . ' But let him not expect that even the multitude will cede to him the influence or the permanent reputation of an orator . We have no wish to proscribe ornament or to recommend a cold style of address . All th' ardour which a man naturally imbibes from his subject , all the ornament which sets easily and gracefully about him , is correct , and it is useful . And we confess that we should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this part of the country ; and that we think the style . of such of our public speakers , as are above the use of false ornament , is not unfrequently too cold and phlegmatic . But we have no wish to see even this changed for that artificial swell and frothy declamation , which is fashionable in some other sections of the country , We have spent more time in these remarks , than we should have done , did we not know , though their truth may not be denied in words , how often they are *disregarded in practice , even by men of just pretensions to taste . And that it is but too common for such men , in appearing before the people , to do it with an internal conviction , that they must adopt a style , which upon other occasions they would be ashamed of . Coming then to Mr. Curran , we do not believe that he will furnish any contradiction of what we have said as to the superiority , in point of mere utility , of good eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him which no man of any purity of taste can approve , yet there is enough of such as all must admire , to account for any effect which his eloquence may have produced . He was a highly popular orator during his whole career at the bar , and his speeches are still read , and his manner imitated . In his defence of Mr. Rowan , which appears to have been his greatest // effort , the enthusiasm of the audience was so wrought up , that he was interrupted in the midst of his address by a burst of applause ; and when he concluded was again salutcd in the same mar.ner . Not content with this , the crowd , when he left the court , insisted , according to Mr. Phillips , upon dragging him home in triumph . Yet Mr. Rowan was found guilty , and most severely punished ; justly for aught we cats tell , at this distance of time and place ; but from merely reading the publication t*w which he was indicted , we are not without our ( loubts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success which , upon the facts as given us , might have been expected from the highest efforts of forensic eloquence . We do not urge this as evidence against Mr. Curran . For we are aware that the iiianner of selecfing juries in Ireland puts it in the power of the government , if so inclined , to select their own men , and that his greatest efl*rts were made in times of the highest party exasperation , whilst most of them were connected *vitli what were then the subjects of party c utention . Leaving then an inquiry , which we have no means of settling , as to the real effect which his speeches actually produced , let us proceed to an examination of the speeches themselves . The greatest positive fault which Mr. Curran can be charged with is his bad taste . This however in its consequences frequently extends beyond his style . After reading one of his speeches , we do not always feel satisfied with our recollection of the course of the argument , and our minds are more disposed to dwell upon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions to which it was the object of the whole to lead . This however is not owing to a want of method or of connexion , although until we lately read his speeches with more attention than we had before done , this was our opinion . But it is owing , in part , to that want of simplicity , by which the reader , of course it would be so with the hearer , is often interrupted in his pursuit of the argument ; but principally to that ambition *of display by which the orator is led to bestow too much time and labour upon what should he but incidental and auxiliary topics , provided they furnish him with good subjects for declamation . Not but that these topics have generally a fair and natural connexion with the subject ; but they are so thrust forward , that what should be objects of more attention are but little regarded // and soon forgotten . He does not miss the real questions in his case , for he had a mind capable of comprehending the whole of a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main points ; but he is not careful to keep the view of his hearer directed to them . The different parts of his speech are not absolutely disconnected , but they are not so closely rivetted together as to make it impossible not to see and feel their connexion and mutual dependence . This it is true is ' not always the case . His speech on behalf of Weldon , l ) ublished by Mr. Phillips for the first time , is not obnoxious to these charges . It exhibits less genius than those in defence of Rowan and of Finerty , but as a forensic argument it is superior to any thing of Mr. Curran we have ever seen .. Before we proceed any further in our remarks , we thipk it proper to state , that the volumes of Curran 's speeches , which have been given the public , were not collected by himself or under his direction . Indeed we are told by Mr. Phillips that he offered ? 500 to have the publication suppressed . It is very probable therefore , that the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be en made ; and that other speeches might have been found , as creditable to his powers of close and connected reasoning , as the one in defence of Weldon . At the same time the speeches , which are given us , appear to he fully , and as far as we can judge , very accurately reported . It is some proof that they are not otherwise , that they were collected many years before the death of Mr. turran , and we never heard of any complaint from him or any of his numerous admirers , until the publication of Mr. Phillips ' book . We have no doubt that they afford us an accurate idea of his peculiarities both of style and thought . Indeed some of them , especially those in the cases of RQwan and Finerty , have evident marks of having been corrected by the author himself . It would be very natural , after reading one of Curran 's speeches , to say that it appeared to have been more an object with him to make a fine harrangue , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furnished us with something more than internal evidence of this fact . We extract the following account of Mr. Curran S mode of prepar* ation for a trial . // certainly not without some foundation , but one to which he always gave a most indignant denial . However his notions of industry were vet*y ludicrous . An hour to him was a day to another man ; and in his natural capabilities his idleness found a powerful auxiliary . A single glance made him master of the subject ; and though imagination could not supply him facts , still it very often became a successful substitute for authorities . He told me once in serious refutation of what he called the professional calumnies on this subject , that he was quite as laborious as it was necessary for any Nisi Prius advocate to be : " For , " said he with the utmost simplicity , " I always perused my brief carefully when I was concerned for the plaintitl and it was not necessary to do it for the defendant , because you know I could pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 283 . This passage should be considered in connexion with and other . It would not be quite fair to judge him by those casual efl'iisions which he flung off in the moment of hurry or of carelessness ; but the passages which I shall quote he was accustomed to call his de bene esses , highly finished for the purposes of effect , and prepared to be dove-tailed into the less elaborate compositions . At the same time , it would be doing Mr. Curran a gross injustice to assert that he never rose high except from previous reflection . The fact is otherwise . He seldom produced a more powerful impression , or blazed into a more cloudless meridian , than when he was inflamed or exasperated by the opposition of the moment . Of this the reprisal upon Lord Clare , as above quoted , is a prominent instance . It is a very foolish , but a very favourite opinion of some , that the merit of a speech is much diminished by the circumstance of its p reparation . But it appears to me just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spur of the occasion , replete with intuitive learning , and fortified by inspired authorities , as any of those sublime orations to ' which mankind have decreed the palm of eloquence. ' pp. 145 , 146 . We perfectly agree with Mr. Phillips in this last remark , but we do not think the kind of preparation chosen by his master , is the very besL this whole plan of ' dove-tailing ' appears to us to be founded in mistaken policy . It must cost so much labour and care to construct fine passages by themselves , and then to introduce them in such a manner that they shall not appear out of place ; that it would probably be both an easier and a safer way to understand the subject *elI , // 71 Ctsrran 's Orator ! , . and then to trust for fine passages to the animation which that and the incidents of the occasion may inspire . Mr. Phillips speaks of the exquisite euphony of Curran 's sentences . ' In our opinion the undue importance which he obviously attaches to the shape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults . There is nothing in the whole compass of English literature equal to the harmony of Chatham 's periods . But this characteristic of Chat . ham 's style strikes us very differently from what it does in Curran 's . In Chatham it is never purchased by the sacrifice of purity , strength , or perspicuity . It consists in the best arrangement of the most appropriate and elegant language . Curran certainly has a great many fine and nervous expressions , but he makes the harmony or rather the balancing of his periods depend as often upon the number , as upon the selection of his words . Abruptness seems to have been the error he most dreaded , and he is determined to avoid it , whatever may be the post . For this purpose he resorts to a *-redundancy of epithets , he misapplies words , or makes new ones for the occasion , and involves his sentences , so as to obscure his meaning . He introduces superfluous thoughts which serve only to bewilder ; and sometimes uses words which convey no meaning whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea is exhausted . His sensitiveness upon this point manifests itself even in what are intended for his boldest and most passionate appeals . He would have been mortified , to use one of his own expressions , if ' he had Aot writhed with grace and groaned in melody . ' But the most dangerous fault of Mr. Curran , the most dangerous to his admirers , is his love of unnatural ornament . He had an imagination of wonderful vigor and fertility ; but he is not content with the materials which nature furnished for its exercise . He seems never to have suspected that there was such a thing as simple beauty . In nearly all of what lie intended for his finest passages , there is something overwrought and extravagant ; something , which when compared with the subject to . which it was intended to be applied , would appear revolting or ludicrous . Perhaps however , as we have made so many charges against Mr. Curran , it is time for us to produce some extracts to bear us out in our opinions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Phillips has set down among his ' de bene esses , ' and one which // most of his admirers would count among his most beautiful passages . a * spetik not now of the public proclamation of informers , with promise of secrecy and ot ' extravagant reward ; I speak not of the fate of those horrid wretches who have so often been transferred from the table to the dock , and from the dock to the pitlory ; I speak of what your own eyes have seen day after day , during the course of this commission , from the box where you are now sitting , the number of horrid miscreants , who avowed upon their oaths , that they had come from the very seat of government , from the castle , where they had been worked upon by the fear of death and the hopes of compensation , to give evidence against their fellows ; that the mild and wholesome councils of this government are holden over these catacombs of living death , where the wretch that is buried a man , lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is then dug up a witness . Is this fancy , or is it fact ? Have you not seen him after his resurrection from that tomb , after having been dug out of the region of death and corruption , make his appearance upon the table , the living image of life and of death , and the supreme arbiter of both ? Have you not marked when he entered how the stormy wave of the multitude retired at his approach ? Have you not marked how the human heart bowed to the supremacy of his power , in the undissembled homage of deferential horror ? How his glance like the lightning of heaven , seemed to rive the body of the accused , and mark it for the grave , while his voice warned the devoted wretch of woe and death ; a death which no innocence can eseape , no art elude , no antidote prevent . There was an antidote , a juror 's oath , but even that adamantine chain , that bound the integrity of man to the throne of eternal justice , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informer 's mouth ; conscience swings from her mooring , and the appalled and aifrighted juror consults his own safety in the surrender of his victim . Et quz sibi quisque timebat , Unius in miseri exitium conversa tulere . ' Speeches , * vol. i. pp. 225 , 226 . We are informed by the editor of Curran 's speeches , that this passage may be set in comparison with Milton 's description of Sin and Death . And indeed if it were applied to a merely imaginary monster , and miot to a poor witness standing // harmlessly within a few feet of the orator , some parts of it would he extremely fine : for instance , the stormy wave of the multitude retiring at his approach , ' - ' his g1*ace , as it were , riving the body of the accused , whilst his voice denounces woe and death , ' &amp;c . We shall not admit even thus much of the antidote , juror 's oath , adamantine chain , binding the integrity of man to the throne of eternal justice ; ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And we would call upon any lover of this sort of style , to point out the idea * hich he collects from being told , that horrid miscreants ' are brought from the castle , where they had been worked upon by the fear of *death and the hopes of compensation , to give evidence against their fellows , that the mild and wholesome councils of this government are holden over these catacombs of living death , where the wretch that is buried a man , lies till his hcart has time to fester and dissolve , and is then dug up a witness . Is this fancy , or is it fact , ' or is it verbiage ? Mr. Phillips , accustomed as he is to this kind of oratory , appears to have been puzzled by this sentence , and has altered the punctuation , by placing a semicolon after the words , give evidence against their fellows . ' But this , at best , is substituting no meaning at all , for a very ridiculous one . Mr. Curran 's ambition constantly to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to crowd together a number of discordant and bi'oken metaphors ; and at another to dwell upon a figure until it loses all its original vigor and beauty . The following passage is taken from the exordinin of a mere law argument , addressed to the Court of Exchequer . The suitableness of the style of his addresses to the occasion , or to the audience , seems never to have been a subject of much regard with Mr. Curran . I observe , too , the dead silence into which the public is frowned by authority , for the sad occasion . No man dares to mutter ; no newspaper dares to whisper that suzh a question is afloat . It seems an inquiry among the tombs , or rather in the shades be . yond them . Ibant sola sub noete per umbram . I am glad it is so ; I am glad of this factitious dumbness ; for if murmurs dared to become audible , my voice would be too feeble to drown them ; but when all is hushed , when nature sleeps , Cum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weakest voice is heard , the shepherd 's whistle shoots across the listening darkness of the intereninable heath , and gives notice that the wolf is upon his walk , and the same gloom and stillness that tempt the monster to come abroad , facilitate the communication of the warning to beware . Yes , through that silence the voice shall be heard ; yes , through that silence the shepherd shalt be put upon his guard ; yes , through that silence , the felon savage shall be chaced into the toil . Yes , my lords , I feel myself cheered and impressed by the composed and dignified attention with which I see you are disposed to hear me on the most important question that has ever been subjected to your consideration ; the most important to the dearest rights of the individual ; the most deeply interesting and animating that can beat in his heart , or burn upon his tongue . Oh ! how recreating it is to feel that occasions may arise , when the soul of man may reassume her pretensions ; in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ os homini sublime dedi cwlumque tueri ; in which even I can look up with calm security to the court , and down with the most profound contempt upon the reptile I mean to tread upon ! I say reptile ; because , when the proudest man in society becomes so the dupe of his childish malice , as to wish to inflict on the object of his vengeance , the poison of his sting , to do a reptile 's work , he must shrink into a reptile 's dimension ; and so shrunk , the only way to assail him is to tread upon him . Bat to the subject ; this writ of habeas corpus has had a return . ' Case of Justice Johnson . Speeches , vol. i. pp. 145 , 146 . It is very probable , that if any of the a*mirers of Curran had undertaketi to select the best specimens of his elnquence , the two passages we have given above , would have been cited amongst the number . We doubt not that either of them would have been applauded in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable to excite an indefinite and indescribable emotion in the min ( 15 of the auditors , broken meta* phors , inappropriate and unnatural descriptions , expressed in language as glowing as that of ' Curran , will answer the purpose . The moment , however , such attempts are compared with the subject under discussion , their extravagance becomes manifest . It is true , they serve to conciliate unrefiect .. ing men , and consequently to give an authority to what the orator may choose barely to assert . But this is but a humble enterprise for genius ; and as modcrn discussions are conducted , it is seldom likely to be successful . All its effects may be easily dissipated and swept away by eloquence of equal animation and more purity , manliness , end good sense . // We can easily find examples of what we have said of Cur. ran 's preference of the sound to the thought .

' Speeches , vol. i. p. 249 . In the same speech , If there be but one witness , there is the less possibility of detecting him , he the less fears the detection of his murderous tale , having only infernal communication between him and the author of all evil ; and when on the table , which he makes the altar of his sacrifice , however common men may be atThcted at the sight of the innocent victim , it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigate him to retribution .

The argument , stated in common language , is , that as the Devil first prompted the witness to commit perjury , the Devil will not assist him to relent : therefore , where there is but one witness , there is the less possibility of detecting him . ' The following is one , among many , fine specimens of l*athos , which might be selected from his speeches . - What said the innocent countryman , Patrick Cavanagh ? Pursuing the even tenor of his way in the paths of honest industry , he is in the act of fulfilling the decree of his Maker ; be is earning his bread by the sweat of his brow , when this villain , O'Brien less pure than the arch fiend , who brought the sentence of laborious action on mankind , enters the habitation of peace and humble industry , and , not content with dipping his tongue in perjury and blood , robs the poor man of two guineas ! Can you wonder that he crept into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop him ? ' Ibid , vol. i. p. 257*. // he attempted to hide himself in the crowd , when the witnesa woul ( l have pointed him out ? Sometimes this absence of meaning extends beyond one or two sentences ; as in the following passage , in which we are occasionally mocked by a glimpse of meaning , without being ' able , after reading the whole , to tell what said meaning is . My friends , if you suffer your consciences to be influenced , to be degraded into opinions of the consequences of your verdict ; you are bound to decide by the evidences , the glorious privilege of trial by jury . If martial law must cut the thread of brotherly affection , the necessity of it will cease ; for verdicts of ' honest jurors will restore your country to peace and tranquillity , and the liberties of your country will , by that means , be secured , and the supreme government of ' the nation be protected and supported , whatever the form of that government may be . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to be resorted to but terror ? Let me observe to you , that the moral law is destroyed , when it is stained with the effusion of blood , and it is much to be regretted , when the terrors of the criminal law are obliged to be resorted to , to enforce obedience to the common law of the land by the people , for the sword may cover the land with millions of deluded men . Is it become necessary to hurl destruction round the land , till it shiyers into a thousand particles , to the destruction of all moral law , and all moral obligations ? By the common law of the land , DO subject is to be deprived of life , but by a trial of his fellowsubjects ; but , in times when a rebellion prevails in any country , many suffer without the semblance of a trial by his equals . From the earliest period of history down to the present time , there have been , in some parts of the earth , instances , where jurors have done little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , but it is the last scene of departing liberty I have read , that , in the period of the rebellion in England , in the last century , that jurors , on trials by the common law of the land , have been swayed in their determination , by the unsupported evidence of an informer , and after times have proved their verdict was ill-founded , and the innocency of the convicted persons had afterwards appeared ; trials on charges of high treason are of the utmost moment to the country , not merely with respect to any individual , but of the importance it is to the public , that they should know the blessings of trial by jury , and that the jurors will solely determine , on their verdict by the evidences , and maturely weigh the credit of the witnesses against the prisoner . ' *llond 's Triat* Speeches , vol. i. p. 337. // Passages , such as we have selected , would hardly be found in the speeches of a man , who , with Curran 's coininaiad of language , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are aware that they are among his worst passages . But we give them , not as specimens of his general manner , but as instances in which his prevailing fau*s are made more apparent than usual , by being carried to excess . We do not say that he is often so silly , or so destitute of meaning , as some of the foregoing extracts w , iuld make him appear . But it is true , that he frequently makes a great parade of language to introduce a very little mean *ng , thiac his general want of simplicity frequently degenerates in co obscurity , and that his love of the gorgeous and extravagtrit , often carries him into a ranting strain , which , to use expressions of his own , is neither law , nor poetry , but sometimes half metaphysical . ' If we have dwelt upon Mr. Curran 's faults , it has not been owing to any blindness to his merits . On the contrary , we have done it from a conviction of his genius , which , we fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating and dangerous . We certainly think that Mr. Curran was a most extraordinary man : and we are willing to attribute it entirely to his want of taste , and his want of industry , that he was miot one of the most powerful orators , the world has ever known . He had a bold and active mind ; and one which , when he chose to exercise it in looking at the subject , manifested a great compass and expanse of vision . Where the occasion came up to his style , for he would not accommodate his style to the occasion , he must have been capable of great pathos . Besides which , he possessed a readiness of retort , and a power of continued invective , which , added to his courage , that could neither be awed by power nor disconcerted by sudden attack , must have always made him a formidable opponent , even when he was not likely , to be a successful advocate . As favourable specimens of his eloquence , we would refer to that part of his defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death of Orr ; and to that *in the defence of Rowan , in which he speaks of Universal Emancipation , as well as to the conclusion of the same speech . These and all his more striking passages are so well known* that it would be tllliu* Our p*iges to v ry little uMe , to extract them . // LJau . We have often seen attempts made to compare Curran with Erskine . The idea was naturally suggested by the fact , that , at the same time , they were at the bead , the one of the English and the other of the Irish bar . But there is nothing in the speeches of the one , ever to call to mind those of the other unless it be in the way of contrast . Erskine is a close , profound , and animated reasoner . He is remarkable , beyond almost any other orator , for the elegant consistency and dependency of the several parts of his speech . Every thing which he says has a meaning , every thing an object , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never for a moment allows you to lose sight of the question . He is not content with rousing the feelings of the jury , unless he can give those feelings a direction favourable to his client , or hostile to the opposite party . In reading Curran , you are frequently obliged to turn back and wade through metaphors and epithets to pick up the thought ; and after all , you may not improbably be disappointed at finding it the most common thought in the world . Erskine brings down the most closely woven chain of argument within the reach of the meanest capacity . Curran sometimes appears ( not , it is true , from natural incapacity ) bewildered , and to be grasping at something which mocks and eludes him . Erskine is never incumbered with his own conceptions ; he throws out his strong thoughts , as if it were a matter of course for him ' to think deeply ; he manages his heavy weapons with such grace and adroitness , that you never suspect their weight , but from the force of the blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but in purity , vigour , and uniform elegance of language , Erskine is infinitely his superior . It is difficult to make extracts from Erskine 's speeches , they possess such uniform merit ; and the excellence of every thing he says depends so much upon its l ) lace and connexion . Yet we are tempted to give a passage from each of these orators ; both for the sake of , in some measure , making our peace with the admirers of Curran , by giving them another of his de bene esses ; ' and then of showing such others of our readers as value language principally as it is a medium of communicating thought , with how much more of conciseness , and , we think , of force , Erskine is in the habit of expressing himself . In the course of argument , it becomes proper for each of them to mention the folly of attempting to restrain public discussion . Mr. Curran does it as follows , // And what calamity are the people saved from , by having public communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , what they are saved from , and what the government is saved from . I will tell you also , to what both are exposed by shutting up that communication ; in one case , sedition speaks aloud , and walks abroad ; the deini*gogue goes forth , the public eye is upon him , he frets his busy hour upon the stage , but soon either weariness , or bribe , or punishment , or disappointment , bear hirr* down , or drive him off , and he appears no more ! In the other case how does the work of sedition go forward ? Night after night , the muffled rebel steals forth in the dark , and casts another and another brand upon the pile , to which , when the hour of fatal maturity shall arrive , he will apply the flame . If you doubt of the horrid consequences of suppressing the etl'usion of individual discontent , look to those enslaved countries where the protection of despotism is supposed to be secured by such restraints , even the person of the despot there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despot , nor the machinations of the siave have any slumber , the one anticipating the moment of peril , the other watching the opportunity of aggression . The fatal crisis is equally a surprise upon both ; the decisive instant is precipitated without warnisg , by folly on the one side , or by phrenzy on the other , and there is no notice of the treason , till the traitor acts . In those unfortunate countries ( one can not read it without horror ) there are officers whose province it is , to have the water which is to be drank by their rulers , sealed up in bottles , lest some miscreant should throw poison into the draught ! ' liawan 's Trial . Speeches , vol. i. pp. 91 , 92 . Lord Erskine , When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their sulferings , real or imaginary , their passions spend themselves in air , like gunpowder scattered upon the surface ; -. -  --  but pent up hy terrours , they work unseen , burst forth in a moment , and destroy every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , and argument to argument , and every good government will he safe . ' Trial of Thomas Paine . . Erskine 's Speeches , vol. i. p. 305 . As Mr. Phillips has furnished us with a pretext for these remarks , we feel bound in politeness to say something of him . We do it the more readily , for thinking , as we do , that Curran 's oratory is calculated to do great mischief in our country , we feel under great obligations to Mr. Phillips , for having , in some measure , furnished an antidote to the evil . Tue best criticism in the world will not expose the faults of a bad // niodel , half so effectually as an obvious , thorough imitation . If then , any one would observe the effect produced by bad taste alone , if he would learn how much beauty there is in an artificially swollen style , in confused and crowded imagery , in constant hyperbole and antithesis , in jingling epithets , which have no meaning , and flowing periods which contain no thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Curran 's school pushed to the extreme , and standing not covered by the genius of its master , he may read the Speeches of Mr. Phillips . Then if he would judge of the talents of Mr. Curran , he may read Mr. Phillips ' Recollections , ' in which he will find the most finished passages of Curran 's speeches collected , and occupying about one half of the book . In this manner , Mr. Phillips may claim the merit of having made a complete exposition of the faults and merits of Curran . And this we fear is the only way in which he can support such a claim . The work before us is an entertaining , pleasant book , and written so much better than any thing , in prose , which we had anticipated from its author , that we are not disposed to find much fault with it . It contains , as we before said , a great many extracts from Curran 's speeches , not a few from a work of Sir Jonah Barrington , with a number of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of biography , however , it is certainly defective . It gives but a poor analysis of Curran 's character , and does not supply us with materials for forming a very satisfactory one for ourselves . From what we learn of him , he appears to have been a man whose mind and character were not well balanced , lie possessed most of the elements of greatness , but was not , in the true sense of the term , a great man . Although capable *of the sublimest and most ennobling sentiments of morality , and apparently delighting in such sentiments ; yet it seems to be admitted , rather than stated , in this book , that he was sometimes guilty in his conduct of gross immorality . He affords , too , another melancholy proof of the curse , to its pos*essor , of an ill-governed genius . Susceptible , at one moment , of the highest excitements of hilarity and social feeling , he would , the next , relapse into the depths of melancholy and despondency . In the last stag*s of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper beeane the ascendant , and he appears to have passed most of his time , with his soul corroding from its own feelings , or hanuted by those images of hiorrour , which an imagination like his could conjure up . // It was a deplorable thing , ' says Mr. Phillips , to see him in the declIne of fife , when visited by this constitutional melancholy . 1 bave not unfrequently accompanied him in his walks upon such occasions almost at the hour of midnight . He had gardens attached to the Priory , of which he was particularly fond ; and into those gardens , when so affected , no matter at what hour , he used to ramble . it was then almost impossible to divert his mind froni themes of sadness . The gloom of his own thoughts discoloured every thing , and from calamity to calamity he would wander on , seeing in the future nothing for Y*pe , and in the past nothing but disappointment . You could not recognize in him the same creature who but an hour preceding had " set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his merriment , his flashes of wit were all extinguished . He had a favourite little daughter , who was a sort of musical prodigy . She had died at the age of twelve , and he had her buried in th*midst of a small grove just adjoining this garden . A little rustic memorial was raised over her , and often and often have I seen him , the tears " chasing each other * down his cheeks , point to his daughter 's monument , and " wish to be with her and at rest . " ' p. 289. - . " Perhaps after one of these scenes of misery , when he had walked himself tired , and wept himself tearless , he would again return into the house , where the picture of some friend , or the contingency of some accident , recalling an early or festive association , would hurry him into the very extreme of cheerfulness ! His spirits rose ,  --  his wit returned ,  --  the jest , and the tale , and the anecdote , pushed each other aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , the happiest , the pleasantest , and the most fascinating of companions . ' p. 291 . Mr. Curran was of very humble parentage . The first rudiments of his education he owed to the kindness of Mr. Boyse , the rector of the parish where he was born . By the same gentleman he was sent to Middleton School , where he passed to Dublin College , which he entered as a Sizer . After leaving College he proceeded to London , where he contrived says Mr. Phillips , quocunque modo to enter his name on the books of the Middle Temple . Of his resources in the metropolis , I never heard him speak , and the subject was too delicate to introduce . I have it , however , on the authority of a frie*md who knew him well , that he had some small stipend from the school at Middleton , and , that , in addition to this , he profited considerably by his literary exertions . ' His Vol.X.No. * 11 // subsequent rise was owing solely to his own talents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished ; and besides his eloquence , he secats to have been remarkable at the bar , only jor his power of cross examination , in which , from all accounts , he appears to have been nearly unrivalled . His skill in this respect was no doubt owing , in a degree , to the acqualutance which , in his youth , he must necessarily have acquired with the feelings , habits , and language of vulgar life . Mr. Curran was for some time a member of the Irish parliament . But his success There did not , *correspond with his eminence at the bar . The reason assigned for this , is the great pressure of his professional business ; in consequence of which his parliamentary effi ) rts were made without preparation , and generally under a state of exhaustion both of body and mind . We have no doubt this was the case : but still we can not help thinking from his habits , and character of mind , that if it had not been so , he would still have been distinguished , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as a powerful leader , or an able statesman . These are the most important of our Recollections ' of Curran , after reading the book before us , excepting several good stories and anecdotes , some of which we should have given as specimens of the wit for which he was remarkable , but that we have already exceeded our limits . We should have been glad to have learned something of Curran 's manner of speaking , his voice , enunciation , and gestures . All the information we obtain upon these points , is contained in the following very definite and satisfactory sentence : but alas ! the look all eloquent , the eye of fire , , the tongue of harmony , the exquisite address that gave a charm to every thing , and spell bound those who heard him , are gone forever . ' Mr. Phillips tells us in his preface , that this book was written in twenty two days . We see no reason to doubt his veracity : but then he ought to have spent more time in writing the biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proudest ornaments of Ireland .
