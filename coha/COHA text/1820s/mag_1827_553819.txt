txt 5. - An Address delivered in Burlington , upon the inauguration of the Author to the Office of President of thc University of Vermont ; Nov. 28 , 1826 . By JAMES MARSH . Burlington . E. &amp; T. Mills . pp. 31 . WE are not among those who are tired of a subject , only because it has been often discussed . We therefore , for ourselves , needed no apology from President Marsh , for choosing education as the subject of his Address , especially as it was a topic so appropriate . we might even say necessary , to the occasion . The apology which he offers , is , however , so very sensible , and so convincingly put , as we think , to all those who are apt to become fatigued with a discussion by the time they have acquired from it two or three general and superficial notions , that we can not deny ourselves the satisfaction of quoting it . This subject , however it may have been exhausted , as to its general and theoretical principles , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered trite in its details by the daily discussions of our own periodical press , has still , like that of religion , a hold upon our attention , that can be lost only when we are no longer capable of improvement . Like that , it mingles itself with the sweetest charities of domestic life , and is second in importance only to that in its relation to communities and nations . It comes home to the heart of every father and of every mother , as they contemplate the future character of a son or a daughter , and in the minds of the wise politician and philanthropist is associated with their dearest hopes and most labored efforts for the // improvement of society . It is practically connected with our daily and most interesting duties , and its principles can never be too well understood , or too faithfully applied by those , who wish well to the happiness of their country . ' pp. 3 , 4 . The truth is , that so long as education is a subject of intrinsic and inestimable importance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , so long ought it to be a frequent subject of discourse and reflection , and so long will it possess a strong hold on the minds , and a deep interest in the hearts of thinking men . It will indeed lose its novelty , when it is thoroughly understood in all its relations , and nothing remains to be discovered and developed in any of its departments . But that time has not yet come , and who can say when it will come I The view which Mr Marsh has taken of the subject , is one especially interesting at this time , and to this country . He considers , in his address , some of the peculiar advantages which we enjoy , as a people , for giving efficacy to the power and influence of education , and some of the higher results , in the general cultivation and wellbeing of society , which we may reasonably expect it to accomplish , or towards which at least our efforts in relation to it should be directed . ' In pursuing this design , lie exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our situation which distinguish us from all other nations , which place education in a new field of experiment , and which promise great and hitherto unknown results from the trial , lie could not , of course , omit to notice an institution so characteristic of at least one considerable section of our country , and bearing so closely and powerfully on the destinies of the whole , as that of our public schools . We are far from thinking that these schools have attained to anything like perfection ; but we are nevertheless convinced that the principle of their establishment is sound , and that their general operation and consequences have been incalculably great and beneficial . We therefore give our full approbation to the following eulogy upon them . In the minds of those , by whom our principles and our form of society were bequeathed to us , the maxim that all men are alike independent , and have the same right to act in the various relations of society , awakened of necessity the idea of so providing for the instruction of all , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very early period after the settlement of New England , free schools were established , and a system , unknown in every other country , which provides that the property of all shall be taxed for the education of all , under some varieties of form now everywhere prevails . The object or the effect of this is not indeed to give very eminent attainments to any , but to accomplish // what the spirit of benevolence is now aiming at in other countries , to implant the great principles of knowledge , of morality , and religion , and to elevate the condition and character of the great body of the people . It goes among us to establish and secure forever the principles of equality , from which it sprung ; to secure the lower from the insults of the higher , and the weak from the oppressions of the powerful . It prevents therefore all those evils , which in other countries have arisen from the opposing interests of different classes of the community , and obstructed the progress of general improvement . Instead of limiting our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our designs of improvement to all the members of the body politic , while it presents them to us in a condition best suited to receive the benefit of our labors. pp. 7 , 8 . One more extract we will offer , because it expresses what we shall hold to be , till we are argued out of our belieg the true doctrine of the union between religion and government , church and state . As religious principles were the starting point , and the source of all those ideas , which we have realized in our institutions , so the influence of religion on the moral character and the intellectual habits and acquirements of the great mass of our population is still the foundation on which those institutions rest . Thus , while politicians in Europe consider it an essential part of civil government to support religion , we have reversed the order , and look to our religion , as the only effectual support of our government ; not indeed as a part of the political system , associated and become one with it , as seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which it rests in the hearts of the people . For it is not only withdrawn more , than in any other country from all secular interferences , but abstains from directly interfering with all secular interests . It sustains itself in and by its own spiritual life and eliergy , and while it is independent of all aid from human institutions , and claims connexion only with heaven and the hearts of men , as its appropriate home and abiding place , it still sends forth its energiziiig and quickening spirit through all the complicated forms of society , building up the ruins that are fallen down , uniting and organizing anew the elements of good , which the warring passions and interests of men had torn asunder , and scattered abroad , and budding and blossoming forth with rich luxuriance in the refined and pure affections of social life , and in the nobler enterprises of benevolence. ' pp. 15 , 16 . We could not but regret the appearance in this excellent discourse , of several instances of false taste , both in composition and language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un // warrantable license . The author speaks of men of large roundabout sense , and cultivated reason . ' What , in the name of common sense , is round-about sense ? In the very next page , we are barked at by a tripleheaded monster , hight sound-book-learnedness . ' The ventriloquists of human reason , ' is a phrase which we might admire more , if we understood it better . The thraldom of the sensuous and the present . ' Sensuous is a word which is used twice in places where , as it seems to us , sensual would have been the right one . Johnson defines sensuous thus ; Tender , pathetic , full of passion . Not in use ; ' and adds this quotation from Milton ; To this poetry would be made precedent , as being less subtile and fine ; but more simple , sensuous , and passionate . ' This , we presume , is pot the meaning which Mr Marsh intended in his use of the word . We do not like to notice such faults in respectable writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
