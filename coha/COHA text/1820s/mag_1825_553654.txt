txt ART . VII. - Journal of a Residence and Travels in Colombia , during the Years 1823 and 1824 . B* CAPTAIN CHARLES STUART COCHRANE , of the Royal Navy . 2 Vols . Svo . London . 1825 . THE progress of South America in the career of revolu ! ion , independence , and liberty , is among the remarkable phe // nomena of the present age , and supplies a page in the history of man , rich with facts of high and novel import , from which the wise and benevolent may receive equal instruction and pleasure . The enlightened statesman will find his brightest anticipations more than realised , and the friend of human kind will contemplate with delight , * a march of improvement in the social , intellectual , and political condition of his race , which no records of previous history have taught him to expect . A tyranny so shameless in its aggressions on the rights of man , so iniquitous and selfish in its motives , and so desolating in its action , as that whose iron arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conquest down to the beginning of the present century , has never been known at any period of the world , whether civilised or barbarous . Chateaubriand spoke without metaphor , when he said , that for every dollar spent in Europe , tears of blood flow in the abysses of the earth in America . ' That the day should arrive , when such oppression would be resisted , and a just retribution fall on the heads of the oppressors , was to be expected , but that the struggles of the sufferers should be crowned with successes so speedy and permanent , was more than the most sanguine could have ventured to predict , or even hope . Within the short space of fifteen years , all Spanish America has shaken off the chains of its servitude , and new and independent governments have been established . The countries , which have respectively instituted separate governments of their own , are Mexico , Guatamala , Colombia , Peru , Chile , and Buenos Ayres . Nature seems to have marked out these divisions , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain fixed . Brazil enjoys a sort of anomalous independence , having dissolved its connexion with the old dynasty of Portugal , and set up a government of its own , under a constitution , and the new emperor Don Pedro , who , in his proclamation to the Brazilians published a year ago , bravely bid defiance to the Jacobinical and Machiavellian Cortes of Portugal . ' This is of course a temporary state of things . The atmosphere of America is not one , which can ever be breathed freely by kings and emperors ; crowns will not sit lightly here , and the fate of Iturbide should be a warning to all , who are ambitious of so hazardous a distinction . The experi // ment of the last fifteen years , which was begun indeed fifty years ago by the United States , has solved to a demonstration the great problem in politics , respecting the capability of men in a given state of society to govern themselves . Aloof from the governments of the ol*l world , and too remote to be encumbered and crushed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous neighbor , the South Americans have fought their way to independence ; and , notwithstanding they wei'e just emerging from a state of pupilage and degradation , so feelingly described by Bolivar , in his excellent speech at the opening of the Congress of Ci ? icuta , they have nevertheless shown . themselves adequate to every exigency . Wisdom has prevailed in their deliberations , and they have been firm , prompt , and persevering in action . Reverses have only roused them to new and more vigorous efforts , and experience has taught them lessons , by which they have not disdained to be instructed and guided . We do not mean to say , that there have not been civil commotions , tumults , and factions , errors of judgment on one part , and want of principle on another , contests of ambition , interest , passion , ignorance ; all these have shown themselves perpetually , and in various forms , and it is no wonder that they should ; but it may be affirmed , that the spirit of justice , intelligence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the praise of the triumph is in proportion to the obstacles encountered and overcome . In some of the republics there will doubtless be further changes , and perhaps civil discords , but the Rubicon is passed , the conflict between despotism and liberty is at an end . Disputes concerning the safest depositories of power , and the best machinery of government , will arise , constitutions will require to be amended to suit the growing intelligence of the people , and improvementof society . Such differences , when confined to discussions , or even to sharp collisions of party , will do hood , by quickening the spirit of inquiry , and diffusing a knowledge of political science . The recent able articles in the . JV'acio'na.l , published at Buenos Ayres , going into tVfull examination of the principles of a n*v constitution proposed for the government , can not fail to exercise an important influence in preparing the minds of the people for a salutary ch3nge The freedom , and even warmth , with which all // kinds of political topics have been discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed very much to the successful establishment of the constitution and laws of Colombia . Who knows how much we are indebted to the essays of the Federalist , and the newspaper wars of that day , for our own Union and the adoption of the constitution ? The light elicited by these contests of intellect and opinion , enabled the people gradually to distinguish sound principles from false , and prepared them to incline to the better side . We look for the same results , although by a slower process , in the rising states of South America . The Republic of Colombia has succeeded in attaining a better organisation , than any other of the new states , and , both from the comparative stability of its government , and its great commercial importance , it holds out many objects of interest to the rest of the world . The public seems in a fair way to be fully informed of everything pertaining to this country . Four books of travels in Colombia , and some of them of respectable dimensions , have been published within the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our readers must not imagine , however , that the love of adventure , which operates with a charm so magical and resistless on many minds , which carried Ledyard from one end of the world to the other , and hurried Park to an untimely grave in the heart of Africa , has been the ruling motive with all these travellers ; nor that , like Thales , Solon , Plato , and other sages of antiquity , they wandered abroad to study the laws , and gather up the fruits of the wisdom and knowledge of other countries . Our adventurers went not out in pursuit of shadowy things like these , but were mainly bent on the more substantial objects of inercantile enterprise and speculation . The Frenchman , M. Mollien , ought perhaps to be excepted from this remark , for it does not appear from his book , * that he had any other motive , than to please himself , and go home and tell what he had seen . Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane , of the Royal Navy , informs us in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing an exclusive privilege for the pearl fishery , having previously devised certain new expedients , ' by which // the divers might be protected from the sharks and other voracious fishes , which infest the seas in those parts , where the pearls are to be found . After obtaining from the Admiralty leave of absence for two years , he sailed for the West Indies , and at length landed on Terra Firma at Laguayra . He made a short excursion to Caiacas , thence returned to Laguayra , and sailed to Santa Martha , ascended the river Magdalena in a boat to Honda , from which place he passed up by land to Bogoth , the capital of Colombia . On his return he crossed the Andes at Ibagu* , Cartago , and Novita to the head of the river Atrato , which he descended to the bay of Choc6 , and thence sailed along the coast to Cartagena and Santa Martha , at which latter place he took passage for Jarnaica . The events of this tour the author dilates into a journal of two thick octavos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft on the purse and patience of his readers . He has , moreover , adorned his work with pictures drawn after nature , and beautifully colored . One of the most imposing of these is the frontispiece , exhibiting the traveller himself at full length , leaning pensively with his right arm on a mule , and gaudily dressed in what he calls the costume of the country . But although too diffuse , and carrying with it too much of the air of bookmaking , the narrative is not wholly without interest . The author 's ill stars lead him into more disasters and hardships , than commonly fall to the lot of travellers , to all of which he contrives to submit with becoming and cheerful resignation . He notes down the results of his observations and experience with spirit and good humor ; but few readers , we apprehend , will have the resolution to keep him company to the end of his book , or to follow him through the ambages of his descriptions , without occasional symptoms of weariness . From Santa Martha , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twentyseven miles , from which place there is a water communication to Baranquilla on the Magdalena , where he was to commence his voyage up the river . This short tour was not without its adventtires . While fording a small stream , in which the water was breast high to his horse , a peon , or native indian of the country , suddenly made his appearance from a thicket , and accosted // our traveller and his companion . It was night , and the salutation of the savage was not the more grateful to suspicious ears , by coming on the wings of darkness . Vaya yin . con Dios , cried our author , putting his Spanish for once , as he believed , to good use , go away , and God be with you . ' The obtrusive Indian disappeared , and the travellers soon found themselves in comfortable quarters , at the hospitable mansion of the good curate of Cienega . The next morning they rode about a league to Pueblo Viejo , whence they passed in a canoe to Solidad , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March , and were detained nearly a week on account of the feast days , which happened at that season . Nobody would work during the feast days , in fitting out a boat , and no bogas , or boatmen , could be employed . On the third of April the equipage was ready , and no wonder it should take a week even of good working time , and with the labor of all the bogas of Baranquilla and Solidad , to prepare it , if it accorded with the following description of a travelling apparatus in Colombia , as given in the author 's own words . To travel in this country , ' says he , it is necessary to have a small bedstead , so constructed as to be easily taken to pieces , with a toldo or covering of tolerably strong linen or blue check , in order to keep out the musquitoes and small sand flies ; the threads of a common musquito net , as used in Barbadoes , not being sufficiently close to prevent the sand flies from entering . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pillows , sheets , and blankets should be brought from Europe , as they are here very dear and bad . The bedstead and toldo cost only fifteen dollars , which is reasonable . I paid rather more , having persuaded the workmen , who are excessively lazy , to work on feast day , to which they are ordinarily very averse . The traveller should likewise procure two or three dresses of Holland sheeting , with feet of the same material , instead of stockings ; the jacket loose and buttoned to the throat . The white does not attract the sun , and feels cool and agreeable , is easily washed , and will dry expeditiously by being laid on the toldo . Two straw hats are necessary ; the one for lying down in the canoe , the other for various occasions ; both should have broad brims . Shoes of strong holland with leather soles are most easy and agreeable to the feet , and a pair of English shooting shoes for landing in the mud . A saddle with bolsters is requisite ; a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recline in during the day , two good mats , one to lie on in the // canoe , the other fitted to the sacking of the bed , to prevent the musquitoes froni penetrating at night ,  --  are amongst other needful precautions . All wine , tea , coffee , chocolate , sugar , and salt besides dried beef , hams : tongues , live fowls , eggs , and biscuits , with plenty of tocino or cured pork fat for frying eggs , should be laid in at this place , together with a sufficient stock of plantains and dried salt meat for the bogas , who are fed , as well as paid , by the traveller , and who , notwithstanding their abstemiousness at home , devour an astonishing quantity of provisions when living at the expense of others . The requisite cooking utensils are a large copper chocolate pot , a copper vessel for making soup , another for hash and stews , a third flat one for frying eggs , two block tin plates , three dishes , two tin cups for drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bogas , who will not work well without a dram each morning of the anise of the country , of which a jar or two must be pr&amp;vided , so as to supply them throughout the journey . Knives , forks , spoons , and small duck table cloths , about a yard square , must not be forgotten . ' V , ol. 1 . pp. 86-88 . This is a most formidable array of requisites , and if they are all indeed as essential , as the writer would seem to imply , it is quite evident that a voyage round the globe , whether toward the rising or the setting sun , is a trifling thing compared with an expedition up the Magdalena , in a toldo canoe poled by bogas . We can not but think , however , that the author 's catalogue of necessaries is much more ample , than any urgency in the case demands . The French voyageur above mentioned , who passed up the river from nearly the same place only two months before , makes no such provision for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by five o'clock , he says , everything was in readiness for his departure ,  --  * cinq heures tous mes effets *taient ? L bord de ma fr*le embarcation . He complains , it is true , that the voyage was tedious and long , fort pe*nible et fort longue , but hints not that his sufferings were in any way increased , by a want of suitable bed furniture , changes of apparel , or cooking utensils . In short , it will appear on this , as well as on other occasions , that our author 's ideas of comfort are not precisely those of a man , who had passed many of his days in the midst of nature 's solitudes . M. Mollien had sailed on the waters of the Senegal , and slept in the forests of AErica , he had heard the howlings of wild beasts in their native haunts , and had learnt to endure existence as a // very tolerable boon , even when deprived of many of the luxuries of civilised life . We at length find Captain Cochrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe poled by four bogas , and another at the stern with a paddle . From the mouth of this river , to the head oPboat navigation at Honda , is a distance of about 550 miles . The current is rapid , and a progress of ten leagues in ascending is called a good day 's journey . Many necessary delays occur on the way , and the voyage is seldom performed in less than a month . Captain C , ochrane had infinite trouble with his bogas , some running away , others feigning sickness , and others hecoming obstinate and refusing to work . These evils he ascrihes to a want of a proper code of laws to govern this class of men , and to the custom of paying them before their departure . He says their number on the banks of the river is nearly ten thousaod . Theii* great place of residence is Monpox , where those taken at the outset are commonly discharged , and others employed for the remainder of the voyage . The elements seemed also to conspire against him ; thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rain ; the musquitoes were merciless in their attacks , and heeded not the thick leather dress , which he procured on the way , in addition to his formidable outfit ; alligators paid him very unseasonable and unceremonious visits ; and venomous serpents lurked in the branches of trees overhanging the river , ready to dart upon an unsuspecting victim . With all these calamities , and many others untold , to worry and detain him , it is no wonder that he was doomed to the lingering passage of fortysix days from Baranquilla to Honda . The more fortunate Frenchman performed the same in less than thirty days . The author relates several rather marvellous anecdotes about alligators . It is very rare , he says , for them to attack any of the human species , but when one has made the experiment , and tasted human flesh , he becomes ravenous after that food , and is a terror to all those , who dwell in the neighborhood of his haunts . He is then called caymam bravo , and the natives feel no security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war upon this foe of human life , and accomplished his destruction ; much in the same way as the // 161 good people of Pomfret leagued themselves with General Putnam , to pursue and destroy the famous she wolf , that committed such havoc in the sheep folds of that town and vicinity . The cayman bravo frequently amuses himself by lying in a listless posture on the sandy margin of the river , when the natives surround hini in a body , armed with muskets and javelins , and commence their attack with such caution and fury , as to overcome the unsuspecting enemy . At other times the alligator is more guarded ; seemingly conscious of the hostility existing between him and the human race , he seldom appears on the beach , but seeks for a quiet retreat at the bottom of the rive* ' . The natives pursue him even here , and their mode of operation is thus described by the author . They select an opportunity when the water is clear , and drop quietly down the river , until they arrive over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldest and most experienced divers leaves the canoe , with a laso in his hand , dives to the bottom , places himself by his side , and tickles him under his throat , which causes him to lift his head without opening his eyes , at which moment the diver slips the noose over his head , and instantly reascends to the surface . No sooner does he appear , than the noose is hawled taught , and the end is handed on shore ; the whole party land and the moment the animal is thus brought to the water 's edge , they despatch him with firearms , and javelins , called by them matteculebras . ' It is proper to add , that the author did not see this exploit performed , although he had the account from such sources , that he consid*rs it entitled to implicit credit . The food of the alligators is chiefly fish , but they devour water fowl , and have a treacherous practice of seizing their victims , by rising suddenly under them and pulling them down by the legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks , mentioned by Buffon . The duck catcher ascertains a place , in a small lake or still creek , where a flock is in the habit of swimming apparently for amusement , an hour or two each day . In this place be sets afloat several calabashes , or gourds , the company of which on their first return the ducks do not seem to relish ; but seeing no harm done , their shyness gradually wears o11 and at length they swim among the calabashes wth perfect unconcern . When // this degree off is attained , the duck catcher puts a large calabash over his head , with holes for his eyes , arid wades gently into the water , with his head only above the surface , till he finds himself in the midst of the ducks , when he commences the same ungracious mode of assault as the alligators , and continues to draw them under water by the legs , till he can secure no more to the girdle fastened for the purpose around his waist . The next day he resorts again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sbould never come to an end , if we were to dilate on all the particulars of our author 's eventful voyage up the Magdalena . As Honda is the head of navigation , through which all imported goods , that are brought up the river , pass to the capital , it has a custom house . At this place , also , it is usual for travellers to sell their canoe , or chapman , to merchants for freight down the river . The country around the town is picturesque and beautiful , and the distant view is terminated by lofty mountains . Honda is somewhat more than sixty miles from Bogot*m , and the mode of travelling is on mules , over a broken road , and at times through a fertile and cultivated country . After setting us safely down in the capital of Colombia , the author comes no more to our notice for a long time , but hetakes himself in earnest to writing a history of the new Republic . This is comprised in four chapters of his work , and constitutes nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , but is perhaps as good a historical account as any within*the same compass , and coming down to the present time . We allow it this praise , however , mainly on the consideration of its being almost a literal transcript from a valuable work entitled , Outline of the Revolution in Spanish . /Jmerica , published in 1817 . Down to that period , Captain Cochrane has condescended to copy this work , without venturing to deviate often from the precise language of his original . So far his judgment may be commended , and it would have been creditable to his candor , if he had anywhere hinted to his readers , that he was exhibiting himself to them in a borrowed garb . This he has not done , and we leave him to settle the charge of egregious plagiarism with the publishers of the work , from which he has pillaged so bonnPfully . This Outline may be looked upon , as a book of // authority , respecting the revolutionary history of South America , till the date of its publication . The materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and they are put together with literary skill and judgment . For the last eight years there is no good history of South American affairs . The compilations that have been made by travellers are meagre , disconnected , and frequently Inaccurate . The work published in London , two years and a half ago , entitled Colombia , in two cumbersome octavo volumes , seems to have been designed to promote certain commercial projects , connected in some way with Mr Zea s loan , and can not be regarded as authority , any farther than it professes to be indebted to authors of known credit . The geographical , statistical , and commercial accounts are chiefly taken from Depons and Humboldt ; the history is transcribed from the Outline , ' to the year 18J* , and afterwards hastily collected from the common sources . The volumes contain several important and interesting public documents . There are some well written notices of revolutionary events in the Biblioteca dmericana , recently published in London . Mr Restrepo , the present able and learned secretary of the Home Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of the revolution . From his known ability , his zeal in the cause , and his perfect acquaintance with the subject , high expectations may justly be entertained of the success*f his undertaking. * The Republic of Colombia is composed of the countries formerly known , as the captain generalcy of Venezuela , and the viceroyalty of New Granada . Its extent from the mouth of the Orinoco , to the western extremity of Panam*t , in a direct line , is somewhat more than 1300 miles ; and from Cape Vela on the north , to the southern limits of Quito on the south , it is about 1100 miles . By an estimate founded on Humboldt 's astronomical observations , Venezuela contained 48,000 square leagues , and New Granada , including * Mr Restrepo 's Reports to Congress concerning the internal state of Co. lombia , and particularly that of 1823 , are documents of great vdue , evincing not more an intimate knowledge of the internal relations , wants , and pros . pects of his country , than a general enlargement and cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entitled Descripci*n dv la Provincicc dv . Intioquia , and contained in the second volume of the &amp;rninario dvi JV'uevo ! ? e*yno do franade , printed at Bogotti , in the year 1809. // Quito , 65,000 . According to this estimate the 1 ) resent superficies of Colombia , exclusive of Panarnh , is iqO 17,000 square miles , being twelve times larger than the Island of Great Britain , and about the dimensions of the whole territory of the United States east of the Mississippi . It is bounded on the north and east by the Carribean sea and the Atlantic ocean , on the south by the Brazils and Peru , and on the west by the Pacific and the new republic of Guatamala . Reckoning from the mouth of the Orinoco to the Isthmus of Darien on the Atlantic side , and from Panama to the borders of Peru on the Pacific , it will be found that Colombia has a seacoast of little less than 3000 miles in extent . When we consider the central position of this country , in regard to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Asia ; when we take into view its geographical features , its large and numerous rivers , its varied soil and climate , its mountains , and forests , and luxuriant valleys , its products and natural resources , its pearl fisheries and rich mines ; when we look at these immense advantages , enjoyed under a free government suited to convert them all to their proper ends , and to ensure a perpetually increasing prosperity , we can not but be impressed with the grandeur to which it must ultimately arise , and the elevated rank it is destined to hold in the family of nations . The present government of Colombia is founded on principles , nearly resembling those of our own jnstitution . It is a representative system , having a Congress of two Houses , and an elective President . It differs in two important respects from the fundamental principles of the constitution of the United States ; the first is in regard to the mode of elections , and the second in the administration of government in the departments , or what we should call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by making it necessary for every voter to possess a small amount of property , or to exercise some trade , or liberal profession . The people do not vote in the first instance for representatives , but for elect .. ors , by whom the senators and representatives are . chosen . By a law of Congress passed June 25th , 1824 , the Republic is divided into 12 departments , embracing 37 provinces , and 230 cantons . These cantons are further subdivided into parishes , // each of which holds what is called a parochial assembly on a stated day , once in four years , and at these assemblies the electors are chosen by the persons duly qualified to be voters .. A representative to congress is assigned to a population of 30,000 , and also each province is entitled to another representative , when there is a fraction of more than 15,000 . The number of electors for each representative is 10 , and if the population of the Republic be taken at 2,600,000 , which is thought a fair estimate , the whole number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of rel ) resentatives would accordingly be 86 . But in fact both the electors and rel ) resentatives exceed these numbers , because in case of an additional representative for a fraction , there is a full number of electors , for each fraction , although a less amount of population . On this new division of the Republic , it is supposed the number of representatives will be 95 . The senate is established by the constitution to consist of 4 senators from each department , making 48 in the whole . These electors meet once in four years , in the capitals of their respective provinces , and execute the very important duty of choosing on the same day , the President of the Republic , the Vice President , the Senators , and Representatives . The votes are sent up to the congress , where they are scrutinised in the manner pointed out by the constitution . The President and Vice President are elected for four years , and no person can be chosen president more than twice in succession . The representatives are chosen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of office for one half of the Senate expires at the end of every fourth year , so that only two senators from each department are chosen at the periodical elections . But the most remarkable deviation in the constitution of Colombia from that of the United States , is the feature by which the government is made a central , instead of a federative system . The Departments exercise no functions of government within themselves , hut are under the control of an Intendant , who is nominated by the president ; and the Provinces are likewise subject to governors appointed in the same way . The powers of these officers are prescribed by the laws of congress , and the same laws apply to all the departments , provinces , and cantons . This was a favorite // project with Bolivar , and it was undoubtedly a wise one , under the circumstances in which the new constitution was adopted . In the year 1811 , delegates from the provinces of - Venezuela , namely , Margarita , Merida , CunAn* , Varinas , Barcelona , Truxillo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared their independence , and on the 21st of December of that year , ratified a constitution , which was designed to bind them together in a confederacy , bearing a close resemblance to that of the United States . In that state of civil discord , and external hostility , the plan did not succeed . The provinces , which were ravaged or threatened by the enemy , were obliged to look to their own safety , and turn all their resources into channels for their own protection . The consequence was , that the general congress had neither power nor resources to execute its measures for the defence of the union ; it became an inefficient body , and was at length dissolved . A military government succeeded , which at last centred in Bolivar as dictator , and it was not till 1819 , after a series of almost unparalleled struggles in the fields of war and death , that the people had leisure to think of reforming their civil institutions . A congress was assembled at Angostura , in Venezuela , where , on the 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental law was published , which united Venezuela and New Granada into one state , to be denominated the Republic of Colombia . A committee was appointed to draft a constitution , which was adopted on the 30th of August , 1821 , by the general congress assembled at Rosario de Ciicuta , and is the same which has been in operation till the present time . Its proudest eulogy is , perhaps , that for the space of four years , the government has been administered under it with great firmness and regularity , and with the present prospect of entire success . The time is not likely to come , when it will have more serious difficulties to encounter , than have already been surmounted . We forbear to remark further at present on the constitution of Colombia , as we intend to embrace an early opportunity to give a brief sketch of its history , its principles , and its practical operation . Considering the institutions that may be expected to grow up under it , and the wide influence it must necessarily have ni forming the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest portions of the earth , it becomes a subject worthy of the interest and inquiry of every liberal mind . The great drawback on the favorable action of any constitution in South America , is the existence of the laws of old Spain , fitted only to be instruments of degradation and imbecility , but which are so closely entwined with the character and feelings of the people , that any violent attempts to eradicate their influence would be equally dangerous and ineffectual . They must be removed gently , and by a succession of new statutes wisely adapted to the purpose , and cautiously administered . The Colombians date their independence from the declaration at Caracas , in 1811 , to which we have above alluded . The names of the twelve departments , into which the republic is divided , are the following , Orinoco , Venezuela , Apure , Zulia , Boyack , Cundinarnarca , Magdalena , Cauca , Istmo , Escuador , Asuay , Guayaquil . At the Congress of Chcuta it was decided , that Bogoth should be the capital of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till a new town should be built for the purpose , and named Bolivar . Our readers will doubtless be pleased with Captain Cochrane 's description of the Congress Halls of Bogoth , and of some of the distinguished personages , who have made a figure in Colombian history , and are now at the head of government . The meetings of the Senate , ' says he ' are held in a long , but narrow and low hall , in the monastery of St Domingo ; the centre is railed off for the members , extending from each side of the President 's chair , in straight lines to the foot of the room , where the railing forms a horse shoe , leaving only sufficient space in most parts , for one row of spectators . At the head of the room , on a platform raised about three feet , is placed the President 's chair , a fine , stately , ornamented piece of furniture , covered with crimson and gold . In front is a table , ornamented with crimson-velvet , handsomely trimmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rich tassels ; the steps leading to the chair are likewise covered with a cloth of crimson and gold . Over head is a canopy , decorated with silk hangings , and the arms of the republic fixed n front ; the whole having a handsome appearance . From the foot of the platform extend two rows of chairs , for the use of the senators , gilt on the inside of the backs , and having the republican arms , and*notto Ser libre o morir , to be free or die . ' There are // also several small tables for papers to lie on , or affording materials and means for writing . About half way down on the left of the President , are the secretary 's chair and table , with all the various papers to be read on each day . The room is whitew ashed , and allegorical figures in watercolors embellish the wails , representing Liberty , Justice , Plenty , &amp;c. &amp;c ; and on the right of the President , is a portrait . f Bolivar , placed there by order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lighted by lamps hung down the centre of the room . The President has a pair of silver candlesticks ; and any member that wishes may have candles on his small table ; but with all this , the hall requires to be better lighted , in order to produce greater effect . The senators are tolerably punctual in attendance , and when the President observes that a sufficient number have assembled , he rings a small bell , silence ensues , he mounts his chair , and the senators take their seats . There are no prayers , as in our English House of Commons , which is remarkable in a Roman Catholic country . The President desires the secretary to read over the transactions of the previous day , on which casual observations are made , and any requisite amendments or alterations adopted . This done , any matters declared urgent are read , introduced and discussed ; after which the business for the day , as it stands on the list , is read and commented on . ' - There are two parties in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have obtained the names of the Mountain party , and the Valley party . the former , so named from being returned to serve in congress from the mountainous district , are chiefly priests , several of whom have been named according to the spot they come from ; such as Chimborazo , Cotopaxi , &amp;c. &amp;c ; and some of these names have not fallen badly on the individuals so designated . This is the smallest , but most illiberal party , and indeed carries no weight in the chamber . The liberal , or Valley party , so named from coming from the lower districts , is numerous , and not withoul priests , some of whom are men whose liberal sentiments would do honor to any country . There are some good speakers , but , taken as a whole , by no means equal to the Senate . I can not forbear expressing my admiration at the general decorum observed in both houses . A stranger would never suppose that this was thefirst constitutional congress , everything being so very well , and orderly conducted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus holding out a convincing proof to the world of what they will some day become . ' // The author next takes us to pay his respects to the heads of the departments , concerning whom he speaks in the following language . After mass on Sunday it is customary to pay a visit to the Vice-President , who holds a levee on this day , from twelve till two o'clock . There is no servant In attendance to announce you ; you merely walk up to the general , bow , and retire to the nearest vacant seat ; conversation then becomes general , easy , and unembarrassed . The Vice-President , General Santander , is above the middle height , strongly made , of a dark complexion , with penetrating black eyes ; he wears his hair very long , which , together with large whiskers and mustachios , gives him rather a stern appearance , though I have heard him mentioned in his military and public life as an agreeable man ; he is generally dressed in uniform , and sometimes appears in a sky-blue surtout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent man , has a great deal of natural acuteness , and is particularly sedulous in his attention to the business of the state-in diplomatic writing he is said to shine . General Francisco de Paulo Santander was born at Ciicuta , and educated at the college of Bogota for the profession of the law , which he left to become a subaltern in the patriotic army of New Grenada ; and afterwards made one of the few Grenadians who followed Bolivar to the plains of Venezuela , in his fallen fortunes , when Morillo possessed himself of the kingdom of New Grenada . His mother and sister ( the latter now the wife of Colonel Briceno ) remained in Bogota , and on account of their patriotism were in very straitened circumstances , but were still enabled to give , from time to time , very important information to Santander , respecting the state of the kingdom . On the approach of the Patriots , they , becoming suspected , were obliged almost literally to bury themselves alive , to escape the fury of that horrible monster , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the entrance of the patriots , just in time for the son to receive the last breath of his patriotic mother , who had contracted an incurable disease from the dampness of her hiding place , and who declared that she was happy in having lived long enough to see her country free ! At the close of the successful campaign of 1819 , General Santander was promoted to the rank of General of Division , and appointed Vice-President of New Grenada , or Cundinaniarca , as It was then called , by General Bolivar , and was afterwards elected Vice-President of Colombia , by the Congress of Ciicnta ; both VOL. xxi. - no. 48. // which situations , by his talents and conduct , he has proved that he highly merited : and to his unparalleled exertions in supplying Jiolivar with resources , under the most difficult circumstances , may be mainly attributed the glorious successes of Carababo and Pichincha ,  --  the one giving liberty to Venezuela , the other freedom to Quito . ' Vol. ii . p. 90-93 . After visiting the Vice-President , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment on the secretaries , and some of the chief members of Lhe congress . In compliance with those rules , Captain Cochrane next presented himself to Sciior Gual , Secretary for Foreign Affairs . He is considered a man of talent , and has seen more of the world than the other ministers , having , I believe , visited Europe , and passed a considerable time in North America . He speaks the English language fluently ; appears to have employed the time he spent out of his country to the greatest advantage , and seems perfectly acquainted with the present state of his native land , its resources , and the m cans by which it may be improved- , and rendered prosperous . From thence I went to Senor Castillos , the Minister of Finance ; he is an elderly man , and has suffered materially , both in body and property , by the revolution . He has read much , and still dedicates much time to reading , notwithstanding his arduous and engrossing duties . He is possessed of extensive knowledge , and an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *iing , is the general rendezvous of the best informed people , and I have there passed many agreeable evenings , observing the progress of knowledge in this new state , and picturing in my " mind 's eye** the pitch of greatness to which it may be eventually elevated . My next visit was to Senor Restrepo , Minister of the Home Department , a good-looking , well-educated , polite man , about forty , having the appearance of a gentleman in his dress and deportment . He has suffered much during the revolution , but is now placed in a situation where he is enabled to do much benefit . Even during the government of the Spaniards , he exerted himself greatly in the diffusion of knowledge , and in consequence , was bitterly persecuted on the breaking out of the revolution ; for , as increase of knowledge and desire of liberty go hand in hand , it was the policy of the Spaniards to repress all that might have a tendency to expand the mind , or enlighten the intellect , and to launch their vengeance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded , because they knew its power . - He is particularly attentive to the duties of his public office , and extremely obliging in all his communications with // strangers . He is a native of the province of Antioquia , which appears to me , generally speaking , to yield many able and gentlemanly men . This visit over , I betook myself to the Minister of War , Colonel Briceno Mendez . His appearance is highly prepossessing ; he wears uniform ; his dress l*andsome , without being gaudy ; his manners good , and he is naturally anxious to please . He appears well informed , and is particularly attentive to the duties of his arduous post , having the direction of the naval , as well as military department , which , in these turbulent times , is a duty of no small responsibility , and requiring great personal exertion . Vol. ii . p. 93-97 . Colonel Mendez has recently resigAed the office of Secretary at War , and General Soublette has been appointed to fill the vacancy . But the most brilliant star in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutions , is Bolivar . To whatever it may be ascribed , whether to accident , singular good fortune , the highest order of personal merit , or to all combined , Bolivar has raised himself to an eminent station in the list of successful heroes , and remarkable men . He was born at Caracas , about the year 1785 , and is said to be descended from a family of distinction in that place . As a favor granted to very few of the native youths of South America , he was permitted to finish his studies at Madrid . He afterwards visited different parts of Europe , travelled in Italy , Germany , England , and France , and was on very intimate terms at Paris with Humboldt and Bonpland . He returned to Madrid , where he married the daughter of the Marquis of Ulstariz , and soon departed for his native country . His wife did not survive many years , and he has not been married a second time . While yet in Europe , he had formed the design of devoting himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events should point to a suitable time ; and as it happened , he arrived at Venezuela just as the standard of liberty was beginning to be unfurled there by Miranda and his associates . Bolivar was not entirely satisfied , however , with the general system of measures pursued by the patriot party , and he avoided ta*king any active part . He did not approve the new constitution , which the Congress of Venezuela had adopted at Caracas , and he declined a request to be united with Don Lopez Mendez on a mission to England , // designed to promote the interests of the government formed on the principles of this constitution . But the time soon came when he felt it his duty not to be kept inactive by a mere difference of opinion ; the constitution , as it is well known , did not succeed ; the wars and disasters , which pressed immediately upon its adoption , proved its inefficiency , and dispelled the hopes , which its friends had entertained , of its power to concentrate the interests and the action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the necessary care of self defence in different parts . Bolivar perceived , that this was not a time to deliberate on theoretical schemes of government ; he joined the army under Miranda , and engaged in the contest with a zeal and patriotism , that raised him to a speedy P ? PMlarity and influence . From that day to this , his history is in the eyes of the world ; it has been a succession of splendid achievements , which have gained for his name a merited place on the same tablet with that of Washington . The brightest records of ancient or modern fame have nothing prouder to offer . Time and future events must show , whether this hero of the South will complete the parallel with his illustrious model , which may thus far be run with so much seeming justice . In some respects Bolivar 's ultimate success has been remarkable . He was several times unfortunate in his early career as a soldier , and more than once his enemies in his own country , as well as those from abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mind to rise above defeat , and restore the confidence which ill success has weakened . His ambition has never been too strong for his integrity , and a sincere desire for his country 's good . For a considerable period he was supreme dictator , with all the army at his command ; but when a calm was in some degree restored , a congress convened , and a favorable prospect seemed to open , of establishing a solid basis of government , he voluntarily yielded up all his power , and insisted on returning to the rank of a private citizen . This was accordingly done , till he was rechosen by the new congress to be commander in chief of the army , under the constitution and the laws . Twice he has by mere accident escaped assassination . In the first instance the dagger , which was intended for him , was plunged into the heart of his secretary , who happened to be sleeping in the hammock usually occupied by himself . // Energy is the predominant trait of his character . His movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time directed with so much discretion , that with a force frequently inferior in numbers and discipline to that of the enemy , he has been able to carry through a successful warfare with Morillo , Morales , Monteverde , and other of the most experienced Spanish generals . His generosity has been much praised ; he gave his slaves their freedom , and is said to contribute a principal portion of the income of his estate , in affording relief to the widows and children of soldiers , who have lost their lives in battle . As a companion he is social and pleasant , temperate in his habits , abstemious in his diet , and drinks no spirituous liquor . His constitution has suffered by the severe trials , both of body and mind , which he has gone through . His speeches and addresses , which have been published , evince sound and practical views , and adaptation of purpose , rather than depth of thought or great intellectual resources . His celebrated speech at the opening of the Congress at Angostura , we suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that speech shows at least , that he had studied profoundly the history and principles of various forms of government , and had most seriously at heart the object of establishing that form , which should be best suited to secure the prosperity and happiness of his country . Besides the persons already mentioned , as having stood in the foreground of Colombian independence , may be added the names of Sucre , Urdaneta , Bermudes , Paez , Montilla , Padilla . For the few hints , which we shall throw out concerning these persons , we shall rely chiefly on the authority of M. Mollien , who speaks from information obtained in the country . Sucre , who has recently acquired fresh laurels as the hero of Ayachuco , where the great battle was fought that has liberated Peru , is yet hardly thirty years of age . His previous fame rested on the battle of Pitchincha , in Quito , which was also gained by him , and procured for him the station of commandant general for that department . Urdaneta is a native of Santa Ft* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor . He has been president of the Senate , but is in a declining state of health . Bermudes was born at Cuman*i , and has from the beginning of the contest taken a // very active part for the independence of South America . He is about fifty years of age . Paez , so much known for his valor and the vigorous traits of his character , is a mulatto , and the troops with whom he has accomplished such feats of military prowess , are but half civilized , undisciplined , and of the same color as himself . His influence over his soldiers is surprising ; he lives with them on terms of intimacy and equality , shares in their privations , amusements , and exercises , and at the same time , by the high example of his courage , and the native power and firmness of his mind , he commands a perfect respect and obedience . Montilla formerly served in Spain , and it is said that he looked to the revolution as a means of augmenting his fortune . He resided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circles of Philadelphia , as is Sefior Gual in those of Baltimore . Montilla is now governor of Cartagena ; his influence is extensive , and it is supposed that he looks with no favorable eye on the towering ascendency of Bolivar . He had early differences with Miranda and Bolivar , which do not seem to have redounded much to his disinterestedness or patriotism . He must be allowed , however , to have fought bravely and successfully , and to hav'e done much to aid the progress of the revolution . Padilla is a mulatto ; at the beginning of the contest he was a pilot of Cartagena ; he has been the artificer of his own good fortune , and his fame is built on important and well directed services . To the larger portion , indeed , of the distinguished South American chiefs , not less than to Bonaparte 's Marshals , may be applied the language of Don Quixote , that each one is the son of his own works , ' cada uno es hfjo de sus obras . All the generals here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivar , says M. Mollien , seem rather to be his equals , than his subalterns ; and in case of his death , or even defeat , it is not impossible that they might put themselves at the head of the party , which they have attached to their interests . In this respect there is a strong resemblance between Bolivar and Alexander . Paez with his negroes will occupy the plains ; Montilla , Caracas ; Padilla , the coasts ; Sucre , Quito . Thus everything depends on the existence of Bolivar . ' Such forebodings , by the way , appear to us without foundation . The conduct of these leaders has not been such , as to warrant suspicions of this sort , nor is it just to their past // characters to suppose , that they would in any event be guilty of the folly , or the crime , of saci4ficing the safety and peace of their country , to the advancement of their own private aims . This would be to defeat the very object , for the attainment of which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last twelve years . It may , indeed , safely be affirmed , that the prospects of the Colombians have never been so favorable as at this moment . Their foreign enemies have ceased , through weakness , to molest them ; tranquillity prevails at home ; the constitution has triumphed by an experiment of four years ; salutary laws have been passed and published from time to time , and they go quietly into execution ; the national credit is well established ; the national resources are daily multiplying and becoming more efficient . Such has been the success at the outset of the new government , when experiments were to be tried , and obstacles innumerable to be met ; when wars were to be carried on , and armies maintained ; when the chmor of party was to be silenced , and the fire of ambition to he tempered and soothed . It is impossible to foresee what accident may bring to pass , but if successful experience is any pledge for future prosperity , it is reasonable to cherish the most encouraging anticipations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe check during the revolutionary disturbances , and it is not surprising that it should not yet be restored even to its former channels . It is quite evident from the commercial laws and regulations , that the heads of the new government were not familiar with the principles , details* and bearings of this complicated subject ; they were darkened and perplexed by the old system , and resorted to monopolies and restrictions . A revenue from commerce was absolutely necessary , and it was supposed that keeping up the old monopolies would be the most certain mode of obtaining it , since the people were accustomed to these restrictions , and would submit to them without complaint . If the government could make its own sales and purchases , and on its own terms , it was thought strange indeed , that it should not be able to secure the profits . Hence the ancient monopoly on tobacco was continued as a war tax . The consequence has been , that but a a comparatively small amount of this article was produced , and it could not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of fifty per cent on the latter . The next step was to prohibit importation altogether ; then followed smuggling and customhouse frauds , and other devices to elude the laws , and of course to diminish the revenue , which a fair and judicious tariff might have ensured . Another extraordinary piece of legislation was that , which prohibited every kind of Spanish produce . This was meant to injure Spain , but no policy could be more shortsighted . Custom had made the cocoa of Colombia a necessary article of luxury to the Spaniards , and it was surely for the interest of the republic to give them the opportunity of obtaining as muc hasthey could purchase and pay for , both on account of the present profit , and the importance of keeping open so good a market for the future . Again , a decree was issued by the Vice President , which required all foreign merchants trading in the country to consign themselves , ' as it has been expressed , to the natives , a most singular mode of tempting foreign capital and enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence is of such vital importance to the growth of the nation . It is proper to add , that the decree was not sanctioned by the congress . Several other strange specimens of legislation on this subject might be pointed out , which , as Colonel Hall has well remarked , might with propriety be entitled laws for the better security and increase of smuggling . ' Knowledge and experience , however , will correct the evils , and it will be seen and felt , that the modern doctrine of free trade with all nations , in the most absolute sense of the term , is the only one consistent with a republican system , and that will in the shortest time ensure the highest degree of prosperity to a people . Two laws in the Colombian code demand special notice , as fraught not more with justice , than a wise and liberal pol . icy . The first relates to the emancipation of slaves , and the second to the establishment of schools , and the encouragement of letters . One of the earliest decrees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born a slave in Colombia , and the importation of slaves is prohibited by a severe penalty . Moreover , provision is made for creating a manumission fund by a tax , or legacy , which , accord* ing to the old Spanish laws of the colonies , was retained by the government . It is gratifying to learn , that this law goes into effect without opposition from any quarter . A large // number of slaves is annually redeemed by the proceeds of this fund ; and to make the ceremony of manumission the more impressive and the more joyful , it takes place on the festival days in the month of December . A strict scrutiny is held by the highest magistrates , into the character of the slaves proposed to be redeemed , and those are selected , who are found to be the most worthy . It ought to be mentioned , also , that instances are frequent in which masters voluntarily give freedom to their slaves . The law respecting schools was likewise passed by the constitutional congress at its first session , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . Mr Restrepo 's Report shows , that the government were engaged in this work with great zeal three years ago . Numerous Lancastrian Schools , and a few seminaries of the higher order , have since been put in operation . A portion of the old ecclesiastical revenue is appropriated by law to this purpose , and especially the property of certain monasteries and nunneries . Good books and teachers are much wanted ; but the foundation of the system is admirable , and it must ultimately succeed . As a further aid to the progress of knowledge , science , and the arts , all books in every language are allowed to be imported free of duty , and also maps , charts , philosophical instruments , engravings , paintings , statuary , collections of antiquities , busts , and medals . In short , if we look at the body of the Colombian laws , which have been passed under the new constitution , we shall find , that , notwithstanding occasional minor defects , they are in the main well considered , recognising all the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the durable prosperity of the nation .
