txt ART . XIX. - The Works of Maria Edgewort A , in six vdumes. new edition . Published by S. H. Parker , Boston . Iv Sir Walter Scott , though universally allowed to be the author of the novels , be entitled to the name of the great unknown ; ' Miss Edgeworth , though remembered with admiration by all who have ever read her , may with equal propriety be called the great forgotten . ' The appearance of two volumes of a new and uniform edition of her works , from the press to which we are indebted for an edition of the Waverly novels in the same style , has excited in us the wish of recalling an old favorite to the memory of the public . It was formerly young men and women , not to say boys and girls , to whom the reading of the novels of the day was almost exclusively left by their elders ; and so ordinary a branch of letters were they esteemed , that we know of more than one respectable social library , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the venerable Accursius did on the Greek language ; Gra ? cum est ; non legitur . Of the three novelists who had acquired a standard character in English literature , Richardson alone was admitted upon the shelves of serious libraries , protected as he was supposed to be , by number of tomes and stiffness of manner , from the danger of being generally read . While his rivals Fielding and Smollet , however superior in genius and wit , were not without reason placed on the same prohibited list with the licentious authors of an earlier date ; and Tom Jones and Peregrine Pickle were as rarely almost to be met with as the New Atalantis . Miss Burney introduced a new era and a new style in works of fiction , and was thought safe reading , as far as a novel could be so ; and next to her succeeded Miss Edgeworth . It can not be said of the latter that she burst upon the world ; ' for // her earlier productions , particularly the most elaborate of them , Belinda , scarce ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was her smaller efforts , her Parents ' Assistant ' and Popular Tales , ' which first opened the hearts of all good people to her writings , and procured her such a popularity , that the Tales of Fashionable Life , and works which followed upon these , were anticipated with an eagerness , and read with a delight , which our youthful readers , who have come forward under the Waverly dispensation , will hardly credit . Had the field been left undisputed to her , we have no doubt she would have sustained the great popularity she then possessed . Mi-. raculous invention ' was spoken of , as her characteristic ; she was in the full tide of success , and at precisely the time of life when the faculties possess their maturest vigor . At this moment , the Waverly star arose . Destined as it was to rise above all that English literature had to show in this department . we well remember that its first reception was by no means triumphant . It may teach a humiliating lesson as to the infallibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference for their opinions , turned off Waverly as an indifferent thing , nor was it till the appearance of Guy Mannering , that people began to feel that something beyond Greek and Roman fame , was at work . Since that time , every other writer in this class has been distanced , and the best established reputations thrown into the shade . So steadily has the public taste and curiosity been urged from this wonderful source , a Waverly novel once or twice a year has grown into such a second nature of our intellectual constitutions , that the rising generation must be at a loss to know what their elder brothers and sisters talked about , before such things existed . We are not sure that men in fact are not beginning to he tired of this long continued exhibition of mental splendor and power ; and are getting weary of hearing Aristides called the just . It is quite common to hear in circles , not positively azure , that there is a great falling off in the two or three last novels ; and certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being pampered on this rich food , that they are amusing themselves with the incredible nicdserie , that not Scott , but a certain hugh ear of a Dr Greenfield is the author of these works . The shocking nonsense which has been fabricated on this subject , and inflicted on an unoffending community , shows to what a length the scribbling Jeshuruns of the day will run . // To such of our curious young readers , as would like to know what people read and conversed about fifteen or twenty years since , we would strongly recommend subscribing for Mr Parker 's edition of Miss Edgeworth 's works . It is neat , correct , compendious , and economical . It will give them her several productions , in an uniform exterior and in an agreeable style of typography , some of which are not to be had in this country , at all , or in very sorry editions . Once possessed of these works , and acquainted with them , they will find that we were not a wholly forlorn race before the Scotch novels appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scott , Miss Edgeworth is inferior to him alone . Where she is inferior , it is not so much in that which properly belongs to the novelist , as in those higher and more splendid qualities , which are rather the portion of the orator and the poet , and which Scott has brought into action , in his tales , by a facility of application , of which the literary world has no other example . Miss Edgeworth is likewise inferior in learning to Scott ; but learning also-profound , minute , professional , and technical learning -- was never before thought of as an accomplishment of a novelist . It remained for the Heart of Midlothian and Mr Saddletree , to show us , that the niceties of the Scotch game laws in an almost unintelligible jargon of law and latin , could heighten the pathos of a fictitious tale . Miss Edgeworth herself , in her Patronage , had made a bold but unsuccessful attempt , to play with this ponderous foil . But in the great qualities of inven* tion , observation of manners , familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense , Miss Edgeworth is not perceptibly inferior to Scott ; and in natural powers , if natural they are to be called , is exceeded by him only in that realizing imagination which enables the possessor of it to perceive his mental creations with more than the distinctness of real life , and in that pathos , which is the last great gift by which the poet and the orator exercise their , mastery over the humaii heart . Though inferior , we think , to him in these , we would by no means intimate that Miss Edgeworth does not possess them . A thousand passages , which will recall themselves to all who have read her works , abundantly manifest a vivacity and fertility of imagination , and a tenderness of feeling not often exhibited in an equal degree . When we consider the circumstances , under which Miss // Edgeworth has written , the just admiration with which we read her works is heightened . An equal degree of merit in a female author , evinces a much greater mental vigor than in a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developement of the female mind in that degree of maturity and conscious power , which are requisite for a su&amp; cessful writer , that a moderate excelleucc implies much greater native talent . The Abbe de Pradt , in his work on the Co*ncordats , has ventured to put Madame de Stad on a level with Mr Burke . We own this sounds to us like monstrous adulation . But when we think of the different education of these two persons , of Burke trained in the British parliament in opposition or union with the greatest minds , and in the administration of the greatest human interests , and Madame de Sta*il who has given her own character in one line , in saying , le fant6me de l'ennui m'a toujours poursuivie ; 7* and who speaks of desertion by fashionable society , as a situation insupportable , surtout pour une femme , ' we are more ready to endure the comparison . Beside the natural repression against which a female of talents must labor , before she can become a distinguished writer , Miss Edgeworth lived under many disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except in the single circumstance of enabling her to view more closely the manners and character of the common Irish . But it is plain , that her attention was given to this subject more than its relative importance required , and that her power of observation has been injured in its application to a large range of human nature , by the length of time during which the lower Irish were forced exclusively upon her notice . The home of Miss Edgeworth , though in many respects a happy one , was not in all things favorable to the developement of her genius . There can be no indelicacy toward a living character , in thus alluding to what her Life of her father has made known to the world . Miss Edgeworth has , for a great part of her life , been employed in the domestic care and education of seventeen or eighteen children of her father . Though this occupation also was advantageous to her as a writer , in furnishing her with materials for one of her most esteemed works ; and though the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued it , is certainly calculated to *trengthen and quicken the faculties , yet so many children , and * Dix Ann*ies d ' Exil. cii. ii . // those not her own , are , in all conscience , too many , and in the best regulated family imply a great deal of pretty humdrum nursery work . The close literary connexion , which subsisted between Miss Edgeworth and her father , was , we think , highly disadvantageous to the formation of her literary character . Mr Edgeworth was a sensible , shrewd , managing man , and was evidently looked up to in his house as a person of uncommon powers . His mind , however , was every way inferior to his daughter 's . Instead of aiding her by his counsels , his assistance , and his very dull prefaces , we think it plain that his influence hung like a millstone upon the wings of her fancy . Her spirit could derive no warmth from the intercourse with his . She was prevented from nourishing it in her own silent and lonely meditations , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matter-of-fact , and withal self-conceited person . The society of kindred spirits is not necessary for the formation of the mind ; books supply its place , and solitary exercises furnish a different hut perhaps as fine an exercise as the communion of intellects the most congenial . But wo to the understanding , however brilliant its powers , that is compelled by natural affection , or by any other cause to look up to , to respect , to admire a narrow , sterile mind . The family associates also of Miss Edgewortli were such as to form her merely to an elegant mediocrity . Above this level rise none of the Sewards , Darwins , Thomas Days , Honora Sneyds , and others , with whom Mr Edgeworth or his daughter or both were conuected ; and from whose intercourse or correspondence , her standard of excellence , if not ascertained , must necessarily have been modified . Society favors the individuality of female character so much less than that of men , that all these causes must have operated more on Miss Edgeworth 's mind , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten . The soci*il tyranny which exacts of every female a certain portion of female littlenesses , is so strong , that even the possession of sovereign power and kingly talents to sway it , was not enough to emancipate queen Elizabeth from the necessity of putting on some ladylike coquetries and airs . In common life , while men are allowed to be as peculiar , as indivdual , as independent as they will , and are prized in proportion to their originality , their poor wives and daughters are // almost as much subjected to the fashion of the time and place in their characters and pursuits , as in their dress . We will not now engage in so difficult a speculation as that , whether there be a native difference between the intellect of men and women ; whether , as Mr Lawrence urges , there be a sex to the mind . In many of the most important affairs of life the men have taken for granted that there is a marked inferiority on the part of the women , and have accordingly denied them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheriting real estate , of which they have thought fit to retain the monoply in their own hands . Wherever , nevertheless , women are called to administer affairs usually intrusted to men , it does not appear that they are apt to fail in masculine powers . The queens of the earth , whom chance has called to the throne , pass very good muster with the kings of the earth ; and whenever it so happens that large affairs are to be managed by a widow , by an heiress , or a single woman , it is certain that there is a fair chance of the said affairs being conducted with skill and energy . In Europe it is an extremely common thing for widows to conduct the commercial or manufacturing establishments of their late husbands ; and there are few trades in France , from those which require most deli .. cacy and skill , to the coarsest pursuits of husbandry , where the two sexes do not divide the labor in nearly equal proportions . If these reflections and many others of the same kind should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two sexes arises from education , we shall feel how much more respect and admiration are due to a lady , who , like Miss Edgeworth , has been able to break through the obstacles which society opposes to the acquisition of female literary excellence . At any rate she is the author of works not to be forgotten ; of works which can never lose their standard value as English classics , ' and deserve that honorable name infinitely more , than half the dull and licentious trash bound up in our libraries , under that title . If , as there is no question , the intellectual taste for life , is , in common cases , determined by the books one reads between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five , to Miss Edgeworth will ever belong the honor of thus been the instructress of one generation of her contemporaries , and that too at a very crowded and brilliant period of English // literature . Her novels always found an eager reception , at a time when the poetry of Scott , of Campbell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , when the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews , then splendid novelties , were to be duly read and studied , when Madame de Sta*l was at her zenith , and , in a word , when the competition of the noblest wits was only less keen , than at the present day . We have no right to say that this competition has aifrighted Miss Edgeworth , and we can only lament that she should have , for any reason , withdrawn from it . It is true , that all classes and orders of readers bave agreed to like Scott 's novels , more unanimously than any thing was ever liked before ; that not only in England and in America , but in Germany and France , they meet with a reception more wide , more prompt , more superstitiously fond , than could be believed possible , were it not known to be real . Yet nevertheless this popularity can not suspend the known laws of human nature . There is , and must be a large class of readers , and those of the most cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , would say that the Absentee is a good as Nigel , and Ennui far better than the Legend of Montrose . There must he a large class of those readers on whose 5uffrages the rank of writers will finally rest , who would at least esteem a novel of Miss Edgeworth extremely valuable by way of a change ; and we know not what higher compli. * ment ever could be paid to any novel , than to say that one would pass to its perusal with interest , from that of the most fascinating works ever produced .
