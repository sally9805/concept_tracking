ALTHOUGH the name of the translator of these works does not appear upon the titlepage , and accordingly is not placed at the head of this article , yet we do not scruple to make use of it here , in order that our readers may be assured , from the first , that the work *s executed by an accomplished hand . Besides , the translation does no ! claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take , if it be a license , by the fact that the name of Mr Bancroft is affixed to the Preface ; a gen // 1829 . Heeren 's Historical Works . 187 tleman to whom the lovers of learning have long felt under obligations , for the various exertions he has made to introduce the knowledge of German literature among us . Of this literature we have never entertained but one opinion , and that is , that the hours , which the scholar devotes to it , are among the most delightful and profitable of his life . We rejoice , therefore , that the necessity of translations is every day growing less , by increased facilities for acquiring the language . Among these , one which deserves especially to be mentioned , is an admirable German *4ramnmar , lately prepared by Dr Charles Follen , of Harvard University , of which we regret that it would here be out of place to speak more at large . If the work before us were a translation from any other department of literature than history , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost extent . The works of imagination come to us , through the medium of a foreign tongue , disrobed of half their native attractions . They wither under the influence of the translator 's pen , like plants transferred from their proper soil , or beauties carried to an ungenial clime . But history feels this blighting influence slightly , if at all . The historian does not address our fancy , but our reason , and reason has little regard to the outward appearance . If the language be correct and perspicuous , truth , which is the historian 's single aim , requires no more . The style of narrative is nearly the same in every language , and Heeren speaks through the medium of a translation , in nearly the same manner as in his native dialect . The only reason , therefore , why we should have preferred an original work of equal merit with the one before us , instead of a translation , is that our national pride would have been gratified , in claiming the author of such a performance for our countryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a country which has furnished such ample and interesting materials for history as ours , so little should have been done by our countrymen to illustrate them . The thought is indeed humiliating , that the best history which has yet appeared of our glorious Revolution , should have been the production of a foreigner . But we deem it a subject of still deeper regret , that so little provision is made in our systems of education , for the study of history . Our public seminaries have almost totally neglected it . The oldest and the most amply endowed institution in the land , has no professorship of history . Under these circumstaa*ces , we // can not wonder , however much we may regret , that the United States have produced no distinguished historians . Our Humes and our Gibbons must be self-taught geniuses , or a radical change must be made in systems of instruction . It is not our intention to enter into an elaborate argument in favor of the study of history . It would seem that few men could require any other motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than that which their own bosoms furnish , in the strong and universal feeling of curiosity implanted there . In the complete abstraction of all views of utility , one might suppose that the mere thirst for knowledge would bring men to the sweet fountains of history , and that the more copiously they drank , the more earnestly they would long to come and drink again . And if ever this intellectual spur should cease to pi*ove sufficient , we should look with confidence to the aid of that all-pervading sympathy , which men feel in the interests of their race . This would bring them to search in history , as the great biography and obituary of nations , fdr the records of what man has already done and suffered . And as the light of the past sends its rays into the future , the same expansive feeling , running forward , as well as backward , would once more bring them to history , for the means of predicting the lot of succeeding ages . But another motive , of a higher character than any we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Bacon has said of this most exalted attribute of intellectual beings , will not be deemed extravagant . Truth , which only doth judge itself teacheth that the inquiry of truth , which is the love-rnaking or wooing of it ; the knowledge of truth , which is the presence of it ; and the belief of truth , which is the enjoying of it ; is the sovereign good of human nature . ' This is the language of one who was as competent to judge concerning truth , as ever mortal was ; and none will question his sincerity , who thinks of the labyrinths of subtilty and sophistry , through which he was compelled to seek this sovereign good . ' But here perhaps we shall be cJ*arged with taking for granted what requires to be proved ; namely , that truth is to be found in history . We should dislike to incur the imputation of credulity , but , though it be at the hazard of this , we must confess that we do not belong to that class of skeptics , who from Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historians . The author of Historic // Doubts ' may have been sincere in his unbelief , and not less so his renowned father , Sir Robert Walpole ; of whom it is somewhere related , that when , in his last illness , he was asked if he would have some book of history read to him , he answered , . No ; it was now too late to be amused with works of fiction . ' But such sneers as these never prove anything . If they did , where would our belief in Christianity now be ? No doubt they exercise an influence U*Ofl the opinions of many men ; but if they do , it is only because a sneer can not be refuted , other** wise than by a sneer ; and the advocates of truth disdain such means of defence . The whole tribe of skeptics in history seem to have acted upon the maxim , that every historian should be deemed a liar , until it is proved that he tells the truth . Now this , to say the least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the truth of a hundred narratives , than to establish , by proof , independent of the testimony of the historian , the truth of one . Thus the contest is far from being waged on equal terms ; for to doubt is level to the capacity of every one , but to believe and justify belief often requires the highest wisdom . Nor is such skepticism disingenuous only ; we believe that it is also unphilosophical . The maxim by which our historic faith is regulated , is directly the reverse of the one just mentioned* We hold it reasonable to confide in the veracity of the historian , until evidence be found to convict him of falsehood , if a narrative , purporting to be true , carries strong marks of improbability upon the face of it ; or if it be contradicted by other more weighty and independent testimony ; then we would withhold our belief ; for belief under such circumstances would be worse than credulity . But when neither of these causes of disbelief exists , we are contented to rest our faith upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , we can not perceive what possible inducement he can have to deceive posterity ; and we do not believe than any man will forego the solid satisfaction there is in uttering what is true , unless he is under some immediate and powerful temptation to the contrary . But , on the other hand , we can perceive motives in favor of truth , which , if moral considerations be not a dream , must operate upon the historian with peculiar force . If he be worthy of his high employment , he must feel at the moment he is writing , that the accounts he gives may determine the belief of millions yet unborn ; and that too , in relation to the most // momentous events with which mankind are concerned ; to the origin , the growth , and the downfall of empires ; in one word , to all that rises and all that disappears , as destiny 's vast wheel rolls over the nations . Upon such themes as these , and under such responsibility , we can not easily be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , however , be supposed from what we have said , that we lay an equal stress upon the narratives of all historians indiscriminately . In our view , the best commentary upon a historian 's works , is the history of his own life . Without questioning his veracity , we still require some knowledge of his means and opportunities , before we yield him our implicit confidence . Accordingly we regard the Memoirs of Gibbon , written by himself , and accompanying his history , as operating like a letter of credit with posterity ; at the same time that it affords the reader as rich a banquet of amusement and instruction , as he can anywhere find within the same compass . The same may be observed of that beautiful miniature , which Hume sketched of himself in the last days of his life . Those who agree with us in the sentiments just expressed , will hear with pleasure , that Heeren has not left us ungratified in this particular . Under the form of a letter to a friend , prefixed to the first volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole course of his studies . It is written with peculiar modesty , and constantly impresses the reader with a conviction , that he claims far less than he deserves . As this letter , so far as we know , has never been translated into English , and as the author is an ardent admirer of our institutions , as well as one of the most distinguished scholars of the age , we trust that a brief abstract of his life will not be unacceptable to the readers of this journal . Besides we know not how we can better commend his history to the extensive circulation which it merits , than by exhibiting the unwearied labor and vast research , by which the author prepared himself to write it . Arnold Herrmann Lewis Heeren , was born in Arbergen , a small village near Bremen , on the twenty-fifth of October , 1760 . He was born in the same house , in which Dr Olbers , the celebrated discoverer of Pallas and Vesta , was born three years before . Two special advantages attended his birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his being . One was , that he belonged to that happy mediocrity of rank , which is equally removed from the pressure of poverty // and the temptations of superfluity . The other , that he inherited a constitution so sound and vigorous , that , during a period of sixty-eight years , his labors have hardly been twice interrupted by a transient disease . His first fifteen years were passed at Arbergen , where his father was settled as a preacher . The first instruction he received was in Latin and geometry , and was given by his father , who was himself a distinguished scholar . Soon , however , the official labors of his father made it necessary to employ private instructers , one of whom , nanely Hasselmann , is mentioned with gratitude , as the man who first excited in the future historian a fondness for history . This fondness soon became so great , that nothing could find favor with him , which did not come in the form of narrative ; though as yet he had not learned to discriminate between fiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut it was in reading a translation of Paradise Lost , and following Satan in his passage through the boundless void , that his mind first caught a glimpse of the grand and sublime . As might be expected from the circumstances of his family , his mind , during this period , was deeply imbued with religious impressions . I had learned , ' he says , C that the prayers of the pious never rise unheard . An inundation of the Weser threatened to destroy the dikes ; on my knees I prayed that it might not happen , and they were saved . Could I doubt that my prayer was the cause *t This was harmless , for I was yet too young for religious vanity . But I have learned from experience how circumspect parents and teachers should be in their religious instruction . The words that were read to me before my confirmation , " Whosoever eateth and drinketh unworthily , " etc. threw me into most fearful consternation and perplexity . ' At the age of fifteen , his father being called to officiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class in the cathedral-school in that city . Of his progress in the Latin , Greek , and Hebrew , while at this school , he speaks disparagingly . But every Saturday morning two hours were given to a Latin disputation , which to Heeren was worth more than all his other exercises . We shall translate his own words . C That was my field . Now as opponent , and now as respondent , I was always upon the arena. ; and soon I made such progress , that , lover of peace as you are wont to call me , there were few who would venture to contend with me . These exercises were afterwards continued without interruption at the University . And if // there be clearness in my ideas , or fluency in my discourse , to them especially I owe it ; and I bless the hours which I devoted to them . ' Heeren 's mind was precisely of that sagacious and inquisitive character to be benefited by the change from a quiet country village to an enterprising commercial city . Nothing escaped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of miscellaneous information , which floats , as it were , upon the surface of society . Whatever related to commerce he seized with avidity ; and the world , which had before appeared to be composed of insulated tribes and nations , now presented itself to his mind as one great family , whose members mutually supply each other 's wants . How little did the future historian of commerce foresee the purpose to which this knowledge was to be applied ! But there was another subject of still higher interest , concerning which he was now to receive his first impressions . The American Revolution had just commenced . Bremen felt its influence more perhaps than any other city in Europe . The great questions of liberty and equality were agitated in the circles where our young philosopher was introduced . From the first he embraced the liberal side , and has ever since shown himself the uniform advocate of political liberty . That which was at first only the generous sentiment of a fervent spirit , became matured , by subsequent study and reflection , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate its effect upon the historian ? Then compare the picture of Greece , in the days of her glory , as sketched by Heeren , glowing with admiration of her free institutions , with the dark caricature of Mitford , who abominated the very name of a republic . The period had now arrived for entering the University . In 1779 , at the age of nineteen , he went to Gdttingen , with the design of studying theology . If we admit his own statement , his knowledge of the languages was so limited , that he was in danger of profiting little by his first half year . But chance brought him to the lecture-room of Heyne , the man who , in every respect , had the greatest influence upon his future life . Heyne was then delivering his celebrated lectures upon Grecian antiquities , and under their influence the taste of Heeren at once took a new direction . Without immediately renouncing all thoughts of theology , he yet resolved to make himself a profound Greek scholar . He commenced with the Odyssey , at // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time reading portions of Plato and Plutarch . With the Lexicon on one side , and the Grammar on the other , ' to use his own words , he mastered every difficulty . ' In less than four months , he obtained permission to try his skill in a critical interpretation of one of the choruses in Seneca the Tragedian . Heyne listened to him for an hour , without making more than one suggestion ; and then encouraged him by the laconic but expressive remark , That promises somethino ' Next to Heyne , Spittler was the man , who , by his conversation and his lectures on political history , exerted the most decided influence upon the mind of Heeren . He wanted a model of historic style and method . He found one in Spittler ; and far above the pityful vanity of attributing everything to himself , he was forward to confcss on every occasion , how much Spittler had done for him . His method of reading history , which he now commenced in its original sources , he thus describes . For each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , and excerpts were made in a chronological order . At the same time , other authors treating of the same subject were read , and the variations noted in parallel columns . I still believe that this is the best method for beginning the study . ' During his last academic year , Heeren lived in the world of poetry . Heyne 's lectures had created in him a passion for the Greek poets . His proficiency in this department is evinced by the fact , that at the instance of Heyne , he undertook and executed , during this year , a collection of the fragments of Grecian Lyrics , which must have required him to examine nearly all the writings of the Grammarians , Scholiasts , and Rhetoricians . The time had now come , when a decision respecting his future course of life must be made . Through the influence of a professor whose esteem he had gained , a diplomatic office was offered him in Switzerland , with a good salary , an allowance for travelling expenses , and a future pension . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , whom he almost idolized , suggesting the ( lifficulty of returning contentedly from the splendor in which he would live , to a quiet and contemplative life , made him waver in his purpose . Heyne 's advice was , Refuse it ; in the end it amounts to nothing , and what can be wanting to you here ? ' This decided him to remain at G6ttingen . Accordingly he took his degree as Doctor of Philosophy and Arts , and prepared to commence his course as private lecturer . In // order to succeed in this , it was necessary to do something which should call the attention of the literati to him , and the question was what he should undertake . Philological criticism never had any peculiar charms for him , and yet this was the point of view , in which it was now for his interest to show himself to the public . Accordingly lie summoned up resolution enough to appear as a critic and annotator . While preparing his collection of fragments before mentioned , he had the rare fortune to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uport Panegyric , which had never been touched by a critic 's hand , and which had the further recommendation of an exceedingly corrupted text . With all despatch , he prepared it for publication . The publisher to whom he carried his manuscript , had never heard of such a man as Menander the Rhetorician , and the answer he gave was , Child , nobody reads that . ' However , since they were friends , and since Heeren asked nothing for the manuscript , the work appeared in due form . The author adds that , as Menander had no very great claims to remembrance , he may think himself fortunate to have found even such a commentator . ' The sweets of literary toil , Heeren had for a long time enjoyed . He was now to learn , for the first time , that even these are not without their bitter intermixtures . Severe application had produced a debilitated frame of body , and this , by reason of that secret sympathy between body and mind , which all feel so sensibly though none can explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though naturally of a lively temperament , he felt an unavoidable gloom gathering round his mind , and threatening to settle down into a sullen melancholy . To prevent this disastrous effect , by removing the cause , and at the same time to extend his acquaintance with mankind , he resolved to travel . A legacy left him by a distant relation , came most opportunely to supply him with the means . Another lucky accident gave him a specific object to be accomplished by his tour . An old companion of his studies had returned from Spain , and brought with him a copy of the writings of Stoba*us , which he presented to Heeren . Of this work there were only six copies extant , and these were to be sought in the libraries of Austria , Italy , France , and Holland . A careful collation of these promised a rich harvest of additions and emendations . Accordingly , the direction as well as purpose of his travels being thus defined , he left Gdttingen in July , 1785 . Time will // not permit us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the many illustrious men , with whom he formed acquaintance , and often intimate friendship . His visit to the queen of cities was the longest and the most delightful . In studying and admiring the wonders of art , in contemplating the awful majesty of ruin , and in visiting the places which were hallowed in his classic recollections , seven months flitted away like an exquisite dream . It was here that he met with Cardinal Borgia , one of those lofty spirits , who , while on earth , seem below their proper sphere . From the moment of their introduction , they were most intimate friends . A father could not have been more kind , nor a lover more fond . Heeren had access to him at all times , and always left him with regret . He ranks him among the venerated few , who have exerted a decided influence upon his character , and has always considered him the most perfect mortal he has had the felicity to know . To tear himself from such a friend was a far more painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty and grandeur of Rome . With their separation commenced a frequent correspondence which ended only with the death of Borgia in 1804 , while on his way to attend the coronation of Napoleon . We must not omit to mention , that while at Rome , Heeren had an opportunity of requiting the attentions of the Cardinal , and at the same time of bringing into use his knowledge of Grecian literature and antiquities , by writing two elaborate essays upon two of the most remarkable specimens of sculpture in Borgia 's collection . In June , 1787 , after visiting Naples , Florence , Leyden , and Paris , he returned to Gdttingen , and in August received an appointment as Professor extraordinary of Philosophy . A new and a difficult career was now opened to him . In a university where free competition makes the support of every professor depend solely upon his own merits , and where most of the chairs were filled by veterans of long established fame , he was to create for himself a reputation . During the first two years , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of belles-lettres , upon Roman antiquities , and upon Tacitus and Sallust . In 1790 , he delivered his first course upon ancient history and geography , which has since l*een repeated every term without interruption . One would suppose that he could have found little time for other literary pursuits ; yet he informs us that he was , at the same time , associate editor of the // " Library of Ancient Literature and Art . " * Nor is this all ; for in 1792 , after immense labor in comparing and correcting , he published the first volume of his work entitled , Johannis Stobcei Eclogarurn Physicaruin et Ethicarum Libri Duo , etc. , which he dedicated to Cardinal Borgia . As soon as it came out , he sent a copy to one of the most respectable literary journals , but not the slightest notice was taken of it . He could not help feeling chagrined at this neglect , but it led him to form a resolution , which he ever afterwards kept , namely , to leave his works to their fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success proves the rule , in his case at least , to have been a good one . Heeren 's experience in preparing Stob*us made his conviction stronger than before , that mere verbal criticism was not a department congenial with his disposition . He required a wider range , and one where his heart as well as head could be engaged . We have already mentioned his early fondness for history . This passion had increased with age , and he now resolved to make historical investigation the primary occupation of his future life . Hereafter , then , we are to survey hini in the dignified character of a historian . We have seen what seeds he had sown , and we are now to learn what were their fruits . - That he might commence as far back as there were lights to guide him in his researches , he examined with laborious fidelity all the original sources of our knowledge of Asia and Africa , considered in a historical , commercial , and political point of view . The result of his inquiries appeared in a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chief . A " ations of dntiquity , the first volume in 1793 , the second in 1796 . The universal applause with which this first historical effort was greeted , the more grateful as following the neglect of Stobteus , was more than a compensation for the years of toil it had cost him . Of the general merits of this work , the American public may judge from the portion selected and translated by Mr Bancroft in 1824 , under the title of Politics of . lncient Greece . We shall only add , that had his labors terminated here , posterity would have hailed him as a benefactor , and assigned him an exalted place among profound and sagacious historians . // 1829 . Heeren 's Historical Works . 197 It now seemed that but two additions could be made to the felicity of Heeren 's condition . In describing the first , we shall translate his own words . " About this time a change took place in my domestic state . A daughter of the man to whom I already owed so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became the companion of my life . She has forbidden me to speak much of her , but thus much I xviii venture to say to you ; that the twenty-second of April , 1796 , was the day of the commencement of unsullied domestic happiness , which has been mine for twenty-five years . " The other change above alluded to was in his connexion with the university . In 1799 he was appointed Professor of History . This was the summit of his wishes , and the measure of his happiness was full . Previously , , however , to this appointment , it should be mentioned that he wrote a History of Classic Literature in time . lIliddle . lges , which forms the fourth and fifth volumes of a work undertaken by an association of literary gentlemen , under the auspices and editorship of Eichhorn , entitled .1 History of the . lrts and Scsences . In 1799 , soon after his appointn ; ent to the professorship of history , Heeren* gave to the world the work on ancient history , whose title is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lecturing for nine years upon the subjects of which it treats , and had gone up to the fountain-head for all his information . It embodies , therefore , the results of hi* researches during jhis long period , and if the certainty that a writer has had ample time , ability , and opportunity to collect and elaborate his materials well , be any recommendation of a work before examination , this work possesses that advantage in its fullest extent . Of its particular merits we shall speak hereafter . The interval that elapsed between 1799 and 1809 was occupied , besidns his regular duties as professor , in collecting and arranging the materials of the work , whose title is placed second at the head of this article . At the time of its appearance , Europe was groaning under the fetters of Napoleon . This circumstance operated to give the book a rapid circulation . Why it should thus operate , will be readily conceived by those who consider how much more fairly mankind appreciate the blessings of which they are deprived , than those which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th' political relations of kingdoms and states independent of each other . That independence was now nearly swallowed up irm // the despotic rule of a single individual . From its loss men began to feel its value , and accordingly they seized with avidity the work which developed its beneficial effects . The first numerous impression was exhausted within a year . The second edition came out in 1811 . The third , by reason of numerous pirated impressions , was not called for till 1819 . Meantime NapoJeon 's career had terminated , and the chains of Europe were broken . Thi* gave the author an opportunity of adding to this edition , an account of the restoration of those political relations , whose origin and progress he had before described . Upon all the subjects hitherto mentioned , Heeren had been lecturer as well as author , and the number of his hearers had increased every year . But we . have not yet seen the whole compass embraced by his lectures . He gave each year a course upon Statistics , in which he placed before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of things , but a philosophical view of the organization , resources , and economy of nations . His fundamental idea was that nations are to be regarded , not as inanimate machines , but as a kind of moral heings ; and accordingly , that it is as absurd to apply to them the rigorous results of numerical calculation , as it would be to apply to the movements and the conduct of individual men , the laws which regulate inert matter . In conformity with this idea , he first analysed government into its distinctive forms , and then illustrated the nature and operations of each by a living example . For the representative of a monarchy with a free constitution and free administration , he chose Great Britain ; France represented a monarchy free in its constitution , but arbitrary in its administration ; Russia , a monarchy arbitrary both in its constitution and administration ; and the United States , a federative republic founded in the sovereignty of the people . To these forms , thus illustrated , all others were referred ; and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these lectures nothing has yet been published . Another course of lectures illustrated the kindred subjects of Geography and Ethnography . Heeren considered these as among the most useful which he gave , though not the most interesting , either to the lecturer or the hearer . Their chief object was , not so much a particular description of each separate division of the globe , as a general survey of the materials of which the known nations of the earth are composed , and of // the limits of our knowledge concerning them and their places of abode . We shall close this account of Heeren as a lecturer , with observing that he made it an invariable rule never to enter the lecture-room until he had placed the train of ideas distinctly before his mind ; but the language was left to the suggestions of the moment . The only use he made of notes was to assist him in remembering names and dates . He believed that the hearers could not be interested , unless the speaker evinced a deep feeling of what he uttered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold and mechanical method of reading from manuscripts . If , to what has now been related , we add the labors which resulted from his connexion with literary and scientific associations , we shall have taken a view of all the grounds upon which Heeren 's literary reputation rests . These consist of fifteen or sixteen essays on various subjects , published in the Transactions of the Scientific Society of Gdttingen ; together with numerous tracts in that department which was peculiarly his own , namely , inquiries into the authority of the most distinguished historians and geographers of antiquity . He was a member of many foreign associations , but never contributed to their transactions , except in a single instance . He wrote upon the prize question proposed by the French National Institute , in 1808 , on the Consequences of the Crusades . We shall now close this sketch of Heeren 's life by translating a single paragraph . My poetical vein was nearly exhausted in my youth , but not my fondness for poetry . This , in my old age , is still as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetical reading has been exceedingly narrow . My taste was formed upon the great models of antiquity ; and whether they , or the authors of Iphigenia , of Oberon , and of Piccolomini , or both together , have spoiled me , I can not say ; but I confess that I can not see how it is possible to place by the side of these , such works was put the hair rather than the heart in motion , and which , though in the phrase of the critics they are " well spoken of , " are soon destined to be utterly forgotten . French poetry has never pleased me so much as French prose . Shakspeare I know more from translations than from the original , for that language was early rendered disgusting to me by the man who taught it . I have read the Italians much , and with me Tasso still continues to be the prince of modern epic poets . The great masters of history and eloquence have occupied me most , but I never felt capable of making an indiv*dual of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhetorical pomp never made any impression upon me , but I was almost overwhelmed with the simple grandeur of the eloquence of William Pitt the younger . From all , I have derived one special rule , which is , to express my thoughts as naturally as possible , and so clearly and precisely , that no one can mistake my meaning . In the formation of my style , I have aimed to be neither artificially refined nor carelessly negligent . To the rigid purists I do not belong . To reject from our language all the foreign words in general circulation , would in my view impoverish it ; and in one who writes upon political subjects , it would be stiffness and affectation . The end of my wishes and endeavors has been to write , not merely for the schools , but for the enlightened public . To do both at once is difficult . The art of not saying much that one might say , an art rare in our literature , is the first requisite . ' Thus , in a few pages , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honorable life . We shall make no apology for this digression from the immediate subject of review ; for we consider the example of such men as Heeren nearly as valuable to mankind as their works . They are glorious illustrations of a truth , which if it could gain universal credence , would change the moral aspect of the world , namely , that unwearied labor conquers all things . But it is time that we turn from Heeren 's life , to a more particular consideration of the works which in Mr Bancroft 's translation are laid before the public . Our first remark is , that thotigh admirably adapted for textbooks in the study of history , and perhaps primarily designed to be so used , they are at the same time worthy of a place in every man 's library , as most convenient books of reference . We never remember to have seen so much important information brought into so small a compass . Before entering upon the history of each nation , the author enumerates the original sources from which his own knowledge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disting*ished authors who have written on the same subject , with the titles of their works . Sometimes , also , Heeren gives in a few words his opinion of the authors cited ; and this will pass for no slight merit with those who consider the multitude of books which go under the name of history , and who believe , as we do , that no man living was better qualified to make a judicious selection . For these reasons we feel assured that even the adept in history , when he has examined th*&lt; -- volumes , will not be willing to be without them . // Next in value to the actual possession of information , may justly be reckoned a knowledge of the places and the works where that information is to be found . It is a kind of map to the literary traveller , which saves him from many a devious wandering . There is another excellence not common in histories , and therefore the more to he praised . We refer to tile strict attention always paid to geographical limits . In the ancient history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulous accuracy , before entering upon the regular history . It can not he necessary to remark how intimately our recolleclirn of events is associated with the place where they happened . Every one feels this truth , and acts upon it . Gibbon informs us that he never thought of studying the history of a country , until he had first ascertained whatever could he known of its position ; and we can readily believe this , having always been struck , in reading his history , with the astonishing minuteness of his geographical knowledge . After the sketch we have given of Heeren 's life , it is almost superfluous to say that he was , in the strictest sense of the term , a philosophical historian . Though both the works before us belong to the class denominated general , yet they do not , like most general histories , exhibit a mass of insulated facts , instead of a connected series of events . The author may not have brought together so many distinct particulars , as many others would have done . But on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . In his selection of events , he has confined himself to such as are of primary importance ; and he has presented these to the reader under the fundamental relations of cause and effect . Historical writing would have had no charms for him , if it had been nothing more than a mere narrative of facts . His delight was to reason upon events ; to trace them back to their origin , and then follow them out into their results . He did not believe that the character of a historian required a man to lose sight of his own personality ; for in that case , Polybius and Tacitus , Hume and Muller , Gibbon and Robertson , must be struck out of the list . To write without prejudice or prepossession , as far as that is possible , he regarded as a duty of sacred obligation ; but he did not feel himself called upon , by the office he had assumed , to suppress the feelings which his subject excited . Writing under these impressions , he unites the three characters of philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark applies more particularly to the modern history , because the period which has elapsed since the discovery of America , contains more aml ) le and more interesting materials , than any period , of equal length , within historic memory . We are not disposed to speak disparagingly of those collections of facts and dates , which are now in circulation under the title of general histories . If we were , we could bring high authority to support us , and would quote the following passage from Lord Bacon on Learning . As for the corruptions and moths of history , which are epitomes , the use of them deserveth to be banished , as all men of sound judgment have confessed , as those that have fretted and corroded the sound bodies of many excellent histories , and wrought them into base and unprofitable dregs . ' We do not fully acquiesce in this sweeping denunciation . On the contrary , we believe , that such conipends and epitomes may be useful , if kept in their proper places , that is , to exercise the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aspire , and then the works of Heeren will never come into competition with them * for these address themselves , not to the memory alone , but to the judgment and the reasoning faculties . The epitomes to which Lord Bacon alludes are the abridgrnents of single authors . Those who are conversant with even the higher order of histories now in use , must have remarked how little notice is taken by their authors of the two great subjects , commerce and colonization . These have given a new face to human affairs , and yet how insignificant is the place they fill in the secondary modern histories . But not so in Heeren 's . These are the two great points of view in which he exhibits the period from the year 1500 down to the present time ; and therefore to all who are desirous of understanding the commercial and colonial interests of Europe , in connexion with the political , we recom* mend the study of Heeren . With one remark more , we shall dismiss the subject . It has been observed in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an independent and liberal character . The works before ns would be sufficient evidence of this , if we had not his own confessions to that effect . The second embraces the period in which the momentous question of *freedom arose , was discussed , and finally settled by the establishment of our independence . A friend to arbitrary principles might have given // such a coloring to the transactions connected with that great event , as would neither have been agreeable nor profitable*to the citizens of a republic . Accordingly we look upon the liberal spirit which characterizes all the writings of Heeren , and none more than the last mentioned , as one of its weightiest recommendations . Without this , whatever might be its other merits , we should neither wish nor expect it to be popular here . But having this superadded to its other excellences , and being thereby adapted to th' feelings as well as to the wants of our community , we earnestly commend it to the friends of education .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
