txt ART . X.-Elements of Geometry , by A. M. LEGENDRE , Member of the Institute and the Legion of Honor , of the Royal Society of London , &amp;c . Translated from the French for the use of the Students of the University at Cambridge , New England , by JOHN FARRAR , Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy . Second Edition , corrected and enlarged . Printed by Hilliard and Metcalf , at the Univ . Press , Cambridge , N. E. 1825 . Svo. pp. 224 . THOSE who are fond of reconciling apparent contradictions in national character , may find amusement in attempting to // 192 July , account for the singular fact , that the French , who are so remarkable for their constitutional vivacity , and , we had almost said , levity of character , should nevertheless have been unrivalled for nearly a century , in almost every department of scientific research . That they should have taken precedence of other nations in elegant literature , if such were the fact , would not be very surprising ; for we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the prominent features of their character . But when we see them engaging with wonderful ardor and perseverance in those studies , which almost entirely exclude imagination and feeling , and demand for their successful prosecution , the severest efforts of reasoning and abstraction , we witness a phenomenon , of which we find ourselves unable to give a satisfactory explanation . Of what discordant elements must the character of that people be formed , who , within the short space of thirty years , have gone through a revolution so momentous , that it broke up all the strong foundations of society , and yet , within the same time , have advanced physical science and pure mathematics to such a height as they never attained before . We have seen them rise , with a fearful unanimity , to hurl reason from the throne and trample truth in the dust , and then , before our terror and amazement have had time to subside , we have seen reason and truth reinstated among the same people , and worshipped with a devotion as fervent and enthusiastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same individuals , who now give up their days and nights to abstruse speculation , were once strenuous actors in the stormy scenes of the Revolution . There was one , especially , whose life exhibited a scarcely credible contrast . During that disastrous period , so expressively denominated the Reign of Terror , his mind , then all for action , caught to the full the mad phrenzy of those around him ; and he engaged , heart and hand , in the infernal business of the tune . But the moment that the moral hurricane was over , this same wonderful man , sitting down as it were amidst the very ruins he had helped to create , and apparently forgetting all that had passed , gave up his whole mind to the investigation of the celestial motions , in these ' serene and sublime contemplations , he was chiefly occupied for the last twenty years of his life ; and next to Newton , Philosophy now hails him as her brightest name . But to pronounce a panegyric upon French philosophy , is // not the purpose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed at the head of this article . This work of Legendre forms one of a series translated by Professor Farrar , for the use of the students at Harvard University . The entire course , both of pure and applied mathematics , being now completed , we avail ourselves of this opportunity to call the attention of our readers to it . In bestowing upon it the tribute of our commendation , we do but echo the general voice of the scientific community , in our country . If the course be examined with the scrutiny which it may safely challenge , and meet only with that acceptance from the public , to which its real merit entitles it , we are sure it can not fail to be adopted in all the distinguished seminaries of learning throughout the United States . Several of them , as we are informed , have already introduced it . We regard it as high testimony in favor of its excellence , that it was selected for the manual in the University of Virginia , by the judgment of such profound and sagacious men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize less highly the ample sanction it has received at West Point , where , if we arc correctly informed , the entire course has been introduced , and where , let it be remembered , Mathematics and the kindred sciences are pursued to a greater extent , than at any other institution in the country . To these authorities , we may add that of Columbia College , in New York , where we are safe in saying there is ample ability in this department , to scan the merits of the course severely . But we will not consume further time in adducing extrinsic evidence in support of the merits of these works . We prefer to let them speak for themselves . The entire course translated and compiled by Mr Farrar , including all the subjects which fall within his department , as Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy , is contained , as the books are usually bound , in eight volumes , comprising about 3000 octavo pages . The following is a list of the several works , which are comprehended in it , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Elementary Treatise on Arithmetic , taken principally from the Arithmetic of S. F. Lacroix . ' An Introduction to the Elements of Algebra , designed for the use of those who are acquainted only with the first principles of Arithmetic . Selected from the Algebra of Euler . ' Elements of Algebra , by S. F. Lacroix . ' Elements of Geometry , by A. M. Legendre. ' voz*. xxvii. - No. 60. 25 // An Elementary Treatise on Plane and Spherical Trigonometry , and on the Application of Algebra to Geometry ; from the Mathematics of Lacroix and Wzout .

' An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics , comprehending the Doctrine of Equilibrium and Motion , as applied to Solids and Fluids . ' This work is a compilation . The authors principally used , are Biot , B*zout , Poisson , Francceur , Gregory , Whewell , and Leslie . Elements of Electricity , Magnetism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the form of a Treatise . ' This volume with the exception of the notes , is selected from Biot 's Pr*icis Eldmerttaire de Physique , and translated with such alterations as were necessary to adapt it to the English reader .

' The body of this volume like that of the preceding , is selected and translated from Biot 's Pr*cis EUrnentain de Physique Ea*p*rimental . An Elementary Treatise on Astronomy , adapted to the present Improved State of the Science . ' This treatise is selected and translated from Biot 's Trait6 EUmentaire d'astronomic Physique . Such is the ample list of works , by the preparation of which Mr Farrar has proved himself a benefactor to the cause of science , and acquired a durable reputation for most patient industry and profound judgment . Nor is this all . It is but justice to add that this Herculean task has been achieved , in addition to the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important professorships in our University . Our readers will scarcely believe us when we add , that besides all this , the same persevering hand has prepared and published , for the use of schools , an epitomized exposition of the principles of Mechanics and Natural Philosophy , under the title of Fischer 's Elements of Natural Philosophy . It is a translation from the French of Biot , who himself translated it , with many additions , from the German of Fischer . It has // been recently offered to the public , and will speak for itself . We have only room to remark here , that from personal experience , we are convinced it will supply a deficiency hitherto deeply felt and complained of , by all those who have been engaged in elementary instruction . We propose to confine our remarks in the present article , chiefly to the work placed at the head of it ; reserving what we may have to say upon other portions of the system , for a future occasion . But before taking leave of the general course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have carefully examined every part of the course , and if our memory do not deceive us , the subject of acoustics , or the Laws of Sound , has received no share of the author 's attention . At Cambridge this omission may not be felt as a great evil , because it is well supplied by his justly celebrated lectures ; for on this very subject , we remember him to have been peculiarly happy . Still in a course which may so safely count upon general circulation , a subject so important as this should not be wholly neglected ; and we hope that when another edition shall be called for , the author , to whom the public is already under so many obligations , will add one more to them , by supplying that which alone seems wanting to the completion of the system . The science itself , of which this work contains the Elements , has always been regarded with enthusiastic admiration . The surpassing beauty of its texture , no language can describe ; and the mind loses itself in contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measurement of land , but its noblest application is to the spaces of the Heavens . When geometry was yet in its infancy , it acquired so strong an influence over Plato 's imagination , that he placed an inscription over the door of his school , saying , Let no one who is unacquainted with geometry enter here ; and when his disciples asked him what was the probable employment of the Deity , he replied , God hintself geometrizes . Pythagoras was so delighted with his demonstration of the theorem respecting the Square of the Hypothenuse , that be is said to have sacrificed one hun ( Ired oxen to express his gratitude to the Muses . Archimedes took so much pride in his discoveries respecting the properties of the sphere and cylinder , that he ordered his tomb to be inscribed , after his death , with a sphere and a cylinder . Even in modern times , we find the great and excellent Dr Barrow entertaining // so profound an admiration for this science , that he placed the following inscription at the beginning of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apollonius himself was known by the title of the great geometer ; and this brief but expressive sentiment of religious enthusiasm for geometry , was written by the preceptor of Newton . But the most eloquent encomium , which we remember to have seen , is that of Gilbert Wakefield . For my own part , ' he observes , alluding to his early studies , though I set inestimable value on the general conceptions which I had then acquired of mathematics , I felt within me no proper relish for these sublimities of knowledge , nor one spark of real inventive genius . But happy that man who lays the foundation of his future studies deep in the recesses of geometry , " that purifier of the soul , " as Plato called it ; and in the principles of mathematical philosophy ; compared with whose noble theories , I make no scruple to declare it , our classical lucubrations are as the glimmering of a taper to the meridian splendors of an equatorial sun . What subject of human contemplation shall compare in grandeur with that , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimensions , the velocities , and gravitation of the planetary system ; states the tides ; adjusts the nutation of the earth ; and contemplates the invisible comet wandering in its parabolic ( ? ) orb for successive centuries , in but a corner of boundless space ; which considers that the diameter of the earth 's orbit , of one hundred and ninety millions of miles in langth , is but an evanescent point at the nearest fixed star to our system ,  --  that the first beam of the sun 's light , whose rapidity is inconceivable , may be still traversing the bosom of boundless space ? Language sinks beneath contemplations so exalted , and so well calculated to inspire the most awful sentiments of the Great Artificer ; of that Wisdom which could contrive this stupendous fabric ; that Providence which can support it ; and that Power whose hand could launch into their orbits , bodies of a magnitude so prodigious ! * Such being the wonders of the science of which we speak , and such the fervent devotion of its votaries , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have reached a state little short of perfection . And so we accordingly find it . Compared with any other branch of pure mathematics , we believe it may be safely denominated a perfect science . We believe , moreover , that the work of Legendre , considered abstractly , as an exposition of the close and exact conuexion which exists among the truths of elementary geometry , is the best which is * Wakefield 's I4fe , vol . I. pp. 102 , 103. // extant . In one important quality , arrangement , it has a decided advantage over any of the editions of Euclid . If we were to suggest any change in this respect , it would be to place the problems immediately after the theorems upon which they respectively depend , instead of placing them by themselves at the ends of the sections . The reason for such a change is , that they would be solved more readily , and would be better understood , while the theorems involving them were fresh in the mind of the student , than when these impressions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In claiming for Legendre a superiority over the ancient master , we shall probably shock the predilections of many . Indeed , considering how strong is sometimes our infatuation in favor of antiquity , there may be some who will contend , that no modern has been able to improve or beautify the magnificent fabric which the ancients reared . But if so , we have only to say , that it would be strange and unaccountable , if , in a progressive world , the experience and reflection of more than two thousand years , with the advantage of beginning where the ancients left off , had been unable to add anything to their discoveries . We are willing to concede to them all the glory of having been pioneers in the march of scientific truth . The invention and the creation belong to them , and surely this is glory enough . Long after every other memorial of their existence shall have sunk into oblivion ; when their statues , and temples , and triumphal arches shall have crumbled atom by atom into dust , the science of geometry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain , and , we would fondly hope , grow beautiful with age ; for it is founded upon immutable and everlasting truth . Decay and corruption can never reach it . Independent of matter and all its liabilities , it is the same in all times and places ; and the admirers of geometry , through all future ages , will go back to the times of Thales , Pythagoras , Archimedes , and Euclid , to celebrate the birthday of their favorite science . The work before us being a translation , it may be expected that we should say something of the execution . Of this , however , little needs to be said . The chief merit of any translation is fidelity and perspicuity , in rendering the meaning of the author . This is peculiarly true of a work on mathematics , in which all literary embellishment is to be studiously rejected . In this respect the language of science may be compared to // glass ; we do not wish to look at it , but through it . Hence it would be as preposterous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to paint pictures on the glass intended solely for windows ; because both best answer the purpose for which they are designed , when they are perfectly clear and transparent . To this merit we conceive the translation to be fairly entitled . We doubt if there be any passages , whose meaning a learner of common sagacity would be at a loss to comprehend . Perhaps the enunciations of the propositions are more liable to obscurity and want of definiteness , than any other portion of a work on geometry . This is certainly the case with Euclid , in the editions both of Simson and Playfair , and these are unquestionably the best forms , under which the Elements of that illustrious man have appeared . But let any one examine the enunciations of Legendre , in this point of view , and he will find a manifest superiority in them . This may be chiefly owing to the fact , that in Legendre each one is rendered specific and definite by the introduction of letters , referring every part immediately to the diagram ; whereas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By way of illustration , we shall take at random a proposition from each . The first is from Legendre , art . 61 . If two straight lines , AL , BD , ( fig. 36. ) make with a third line AB , two interior angles BAL , ABD , the sum of which is less than two right angles , the lines Al , BD , produced , will meet . ' The other is from Simson 's Euclid , prop . 7 , b. 1 . Upon the same base and on the same side of it , there can not be two triangles that have their sides which are terminated in one extremity of the base equal to one another , and likewise those which are terminated in the other extremity . ' Now we presome there can be no doubt , which of these two methods is best adapted to the conception of the learner ; since it is admitted on all hands , that generalization and abstraction are the most difficult of all mental operations . Nevertheless we are aware , that besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave authorities against the practice of introducing the letters . We have been informed from a source which we presume is authentic , that an edition of this same Legendre ( not from Professor Farrar 's translation , but that made by Dr Brewster for the Edinburgh Encycloprndia ) , is in a course of preparation , in which one of the chief alterations will be the omission of the letters . Still we speak from some // experience , when we say , that we have found it much better to allow learners to use le mrs at first , and afterwards to require them to give a general enunciation , than to make use of general enunciations in the first instance . On the whole , therefore , we are decidedly in favor of retaining the letters . The student of Legendre does not require much previous knowledge of Algebra . Besides proportion , only a few of the simplest operations are introduced , and these may be easily made intelligible at the time . The ancients were entirely unacquainted with algebra , and hence were in want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , arises the difficulty which the student of Euclid always encounters at the beginning of the fifth book , where the doctrine of proportion is introduced . It is , of course , not impossible to understand proportion without the aid of algebra ; for if it were , Euclid must have terminated his work at the end of the fourth book . But though not impossible , it is certainly very difficult . Let those who doubt this , take up the subject as the sagacious mind of Euclid has presented it , and when they are wearied with the severe effort of abstraction , which is necessary where no algebraic symbols are used , let them turn to the exposition of the same subject , as given by Lacroix in his Algebra ; and after a few hours of no very severe thought have put them in complete possession of the whole subject , we venture to say , they will agree with us in the opinion , that the introduction of algebraic signs and symbols into geometrical proportions , though it he a departure from the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to have the benefit of this improvement , and , at the same time , not to presuppose a knowledge of algebrn ; the fundamental laws of proportion are illustrated in the introduction . We shall now say a word upon the definitions . The greatest obstacle to be encountered , in reasoning of every kind , arises from the imperfection of language . But this evil is less felt in geometrical , than in any other species of reasoning . Here , for the most part , the definitions may be perfectly exact , so as not to leave the shadow of a doubt in the mind as to what is intended . . Hence the absolute and entire confidence we feel in the certainty of the conclusions to which we are led . Since , then , such perfect exactness is attainable , and since it is upon the definitions that the whole science rests as its substratum , there is no portion of a treatise which calls for so // much thought and circumspection ; inasmuch as the slightest imperfection here must reach through and vitiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work before us are , in point of brevity and precision , all that we could wish . To this remark there are only two exceptions . One regards the definition of a straight line , the other that of parallel lines . These we shall notice hereafter . In the mean time we shall propose what , it appears to us , would be an important improvement in all the definitions of geometry . It is to introduce into them the idea of motion . Of this idea , we do not recollect to have met with any practical application , in the geometrical treatises which have hitherto been given to the world . It was suggested to us by somewhere reading , that Plato blamed Archytas for employing motion in geometrical constructions . In what manner he employed it , we are not told ; and this is the only hint of the matter we have met with . For the purpose of illustrating our opinions , we shall here give a few specimens , intending to pursue the subject further , if another opportunity should present itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point be supposed to move , the path described will be a bne . Cor . A line will have length , but neither breadth or thickness . If the point , after commencing its motion , does not change its direction , the path will be a straight line . If it change it constantly , the path will be a curved line . If it change it only at perceptible intervals , the path will be a broken or polygonal line . If a line move in any other direction than that of its length , the sj*ace described will be a surface . Cor . A surface has length and breadth , but no thickness . If the moving line be straight , the surface xviii be plane . If the moving line be a curve , the surface will be curved . If broken , the surface will be polygonal . If a surface move in any other direction than that of its length or breadth , the space described will be a solid . Cor . A solid has all the dimensions , length , breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight line , preserve always the same distance from each other , the lines will be par* did . // Cor . Parallel lines will never meet , though ever so far produced . If two points , describing straight lines , intersect each other 's directions , the lines are said to form angles with each other . If the intersection be such that any two adjacent angles are equal , these are right angles , and the lines are perpendicular . If two parallel lines move in any other direction than that of their length , still continuing parallel , they will describe parallel planes . If of two points one be fixed , and the other move round it , preserving always the same distance from it , the space enclosed will be a circle ; the line described will be the csrcumference , and the fixed point the centre . If a point , after commencing its motion , change its direction a number of times , so as to return to its first position , the space enclosed is a plane figure . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure is rectilineal or a polygon . If a polygon move in a direction parallel to its first position , the solid generated will be a prism . If a circle move in a direction parallel to its first position , the solid generated will be a cylinder . We might continue this method through geometry ; but the above examples are sufficient for illustration , and that was all we intended . We shall leave the subject with the single remark , that after making several experiments , we are fully satisfied , that definitions of this kind are more intelligible to beginners , than any we have met with . If it be objected , that they are not strictly geometrical , we must request the objectors to point out to us in what the precise quality of being geometrical consists . We will now offer the suggestions we proposed above , concerning the definitions given by Legendre of a straight line , and of parallel lines . A straight line is defined to be the shortest way from one point to another . ' Our objection to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view the very property , by which the mind always distinguishes a straight line from any other , namely , that all its parts have the same direction , while those of a curved or broken line have different directions . Let the following line be drawn , * The mind decides at once that this is not a straight line ; but how does it make this decision ? Is it by measuring the dis voL. xxvII. - NO. 60. 26 // tance , comparing it with others , and finding that it is not the shortest 7 We answer , No . It perceives ntstantaneously that the direction changes . Again , let the following line be drawn , A B. The mind decides instantaneously , that this is a straight line ; but how does it make the decision ? Does it compare this distance with every other , and find that it is the shortest of all ? Manifestly not . It perceives instantaneously , that its direction does not change . It is then change of direction that constitutes the distinguishing property , and this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infinite straight lines are treated of in mathematics , and we would ask the advocate for Legendre 's definition , how he would determine the shortest distance between two points infinitely distant . Now let the defining property be unity of direction , and no such difficulty will occur . The idea of distance , which really forms no part of our conception of a straight line , will not then intervene . It is on these grounds that we prefer , both as more simple and more correct , the definition suggested above , if a point , after commencing its motion , does not change its direction , the path described will be a straight line . From this , distance and limitation are excluded , and the mind has to consider the direction alone . Moreover by adopting this definition , we avoid the necessity of demonstrating theorem 32 ; Two straight lines , which have two points common , coincide throughout , and form one and the same straight line . ' This will be a necessary consequence from our definition ; for if the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afterwards to separate , one or the other must change its direction . But then the lines would not be straight lines , which is contrary to the supposition . We have dwelt thus long upon the definition of a strai6ht line , because this is the first and simplest , and , for that reason , the most important of geometric magnitudes . rrhe whole subsequent course of reasoning rests upon it . Legendre was aware that his own definition was imperfect , and it is but fair to give , in his own words , the reasons which induced him to adopt it . The definition of a straight line , ' he observes in the Preface , being the most important of the elements , I have wished to be able to give to it all the exactness and precision of which it is susceptible . Perhaps I might have attained this object by calling a straight line that which can have only one position between two // given points . For , from this essential property we can deduce all the other properties of a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two given points . But in order to this it would have been necessary to enter into subtle di*cussions , and to distinguish , in the course of several propositions , the straight line drawn between two points , from the shortest line which measures the distance of these same points . I have preferred , in order not to render the introduction to geometry too difficult , to sacrifice something of the exactness at which I aimed . Accordingly I shall call a straight line that which is the shortest between two points , and I shall suppose that only one can be drawn between the same points . It is upon this principle , considered at the same time as a definition and an axiom , that I have endeavored to establish the entire edifice of the elements . ' We come now to the definition of parallel lines . This is the next most important definition in geometry . Our author follows Euclid , except in not confining it to straight lines . The words of Legendre are , Two lines are said to be parallel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so far both ways , they do not meet . ' Now this definition is liable to the following objection . It fixes a test of parallelism , which , from the very nature of the case , can never be applied . How , according to this definition , are we to ascertain that two lines are parallel ? Will it be enough to produce them to any finite distance ? No ; because stop where we may , we can not say but that , if we were to produce them still farther , they might meet . What then ? We must produce them infinitely . But this is manifestly impossible . Indeed if the property of being produced to any finite or possible distance without meeting , were what consitutes parallelism , then the hyperbola and its asymptotes would be parallel ; for these are such as being situated in the same plane , and produced to any finite or possible distance whatsoever , would not meet . Now what is there in this last case , which leads us at once to say that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they constantly approach each other ? If so , then the leading idea , in our conception of parallel lines , must be , that these do not approach each other ; in other words , that they are throughout at the same distance from each other . This we believe to be the essential property of parallel lines , and that which the mind primarily contemplates , whenever it forms a conception of them . Accordingly we contend , that it should form the basis of the definition . Assuming this , the other property , that they could // never meet , would follow of necessity ; whereas by assuming the latter property , it becomes necessary to demonstrate the former , as in art . 69 . Ia favor of the opinion we have here advanced , we have tho authority of Hutton , and after him of Webber , who seems chiefly to have copied Huttcn in his geometry . They define parallel lines to be those which are always at the same distance , and never meet though ever so far produced . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of by our author , xviii close our criticism upon his definitions . In general he has not departed from Euclid ; and where he has done this , as in one or two instances , we think it is for the worse . We dislike the use of the term rectangle , to denote that figure which Euclid , by a much more convenient expression , denominates an oblong . The word rectangle literally means the same as right angle ; it is almost equivalent , therefore , to using the same word in two very different senses . The substitution of the word oblong , for the quadrilateral which has its angles right angles , without having its sides equal , ' instead of the word rectangle , would avoid all confusion . Again , the term parallelogram is used to denote that figure which Euclid calls a rhomboid . But the definition of Legendre is a quadrilateral which has its opposite sides parallel . ' Now this is the property , not of one , but of four quadrilaterals , viz , the square , the oblong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence we think it produces unnecessary confusion to make it the denomination of only one of these figures . With the exceptions now stated , the author 's nomenclature appears to he as concise and appropriate as the nature of the case admits of . The subject next in order is axioms . These , in the words of Legendre , are propositions the truth of which is self-evident . ' Taken in connexion with definitions , they form the entire groundwork of geometrical reasoning . Of course it becomes a very important question , what truths are to he regarded as axioms . Legendre has enumerated only five ; hut in this respect , he has departed from Euclid and all the other authors we have consulted . The number generally admitted is eleven or twelve . Indeed Legendre supposes throughout the work the admission of six , which he has not enumerated . What his motive was in omitting these , he has not told us . To say that they are self-evident can not be a sufficient reason , for // this reason would equally exclude the mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he more complete , if this omission were supplied . It might he done as follows . If equals he added to equals , the wholes are equal . If equals be taken from equals , the remainders are equal . If equals be added to unequals , the wholes are unequal . If equals be taken from unequals , the remainders are unequal . Things which are double the same , are equal to one another . Things which are halves of the same , are equal to one another . Besides these six , which are enumerated hy Euclid , and constantly taken for granted by Legendre , we shall suggest two others . But previously to doing this , and in order that our motives may not be misconstrued in proposing this and subsequent alterations , we will here state in what light we propose to regard the work of Legendre , during the remainder of this discussion . We have hitherto spoken of it as a complete treatise on the elements of geometry , and regarding it in this light , we have not hesitated to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strongly intimated our opinion of its general excellence , by the few and comparatively trivial defects , which we have been ahle to point out . But the object had in view in translating it , was to make it a manual or text-book for the students of Harvard University , with the expectation , doubtless , that it would be adopted also in other colleges and seminaries of learning . Considering it , therefore , in this light , as a manual or text-book , we think it is liable , in the first place , to this objection , that it is not sufficiently practical ; in other words , that the problems are far too few , in proportion to the theorems . The student is put in possession of a mass of geometrical truths , while at the same time he is taught only a small number of their applications to geometrical constructions . Perhaps it may be answered , that the practical application is left for a useful exercise of the student 's sagacity . But the same argument might he used with equal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known fact that very few students subject their sagacity to this salutary exercise . But the gravest charge we have to urge against the work , considered in the light of a text-book , is , that it is by far more bulky , than the necessity or convenience of our students re // quires . We presume it will not be denied , that if its size can be reduced , without diminishing the number of practical results obtained , or impairing the rigor with which they are established , such a reduction would be a decided improvement . For we hold it to be no argument in favor of its being extended over so wide a surface , that every part is an excellent discipline for the mind , and that consequently the greater its extent is , so much the more of mental discipline will be afforded . This argument would do very well , if there were no room for equally salutary discipline , beyond the precincts of pure geometry . But this is not the case . Geometry is but the first flight of steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boundless range . But the longer you are occupied in the ascent , just so much less time have you left for exploring the mysteries which now begin to open upon you ; those sublime and stupendous mysteries , in the midst of which the intellects of Kepler , Newton , and Laplace expatiated , and which furnish even a higher and nobler discipline for the mental faculties , than the truths of pure geometry . To approve then of amplification , which might be avoided , merely on the ground of mental discipline , would be like recommending to the tourist the most circuitous routes he could find , because they would afford him the greatest amount of physical exercise . Our aim , therefore , in what follows , will be to suggest such alterations as would reduce the limits of the work , without diminishing at all the number of practical results ; and we hope also to make it manifest that these changes , so far from rendering the subject more abstruse and difficult , will bring it even nearer than it is at present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall assume the following propositions as maxims . Whenever the truth of a proposition is immediately obvious , without demonstration , the demonstration should be omitted . Of two demonstrations equally rigorous , the shortest is the best . Lastly , if a proposition contain only an isolated truth , that is , if no subsequent theorem or problem depend upon it , it is better that such proposition be omitted . These things being premised , we proceed to suggest the retrenchments which we think might be made in the work of Legendre . We begin by recommending that the first theorem , ( art . 27 ) , namely , that all right angles are equal , be regarded as an axiom . We have now before us the works of seven distinguished geometers , at the head of whom we place Euclid ; and // not one of these has deemed this proposition to need demonstration . All set it down among the axioms . Now if it be not strictly an axiom , it is , at least , a necessary and obvious corollary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a manner that the two adjacent angles are equal , each of these is a right angle . ' Into this definition the length of the lines does not enter . Of course they may be produced indefinitely , and then a single diagram will represent all possible cases . Hence right angles can never differ . To give a labored demonstration of their equality , therefore , is mere supererogation . We have only one more axiom to propose , which is the following . If one straight line constantly approaches another , they will meet *f produced sufficiently far . This will fill up the only apparent chasm which occurs in the reasoning throughout the work . In art . 58 , we have the following proposition . We shall give it in general terms to avoid the necessity of a diagram . If one straight line be perpendicular to a second , and *f a third line make with the second an acute angle , the first and third will meet *f produced sufficiently far . This our author seems to think requires proof , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt at demonstration , or as he calls it , cxplanation ; promising a more rigorous but not geometrical demonstration , in the notes appended to the cud of the work . His inability to demonstrate it geometrically , he ascribes to the imperfect definition he has assumed of parallel lines and of a straight line . Why then did he not pursue the same course as Euclid did , when hc found the same difficulty ? Euclid at once made it an axiom , or , as it is sometimes called , a postulate ; at any rate a proposition not requiring demonstration . In our view this was the wiser course . For though it be not quite so simple as the other axioms , and may perhaps require a moment more of reflection in order to believe it , yet it is a proposition , of which it is impossible not to believe the truth , the moment we form a conception of the relative position of the lines ; moreover the belief is of that absolute kind , to which no resoning can add any force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two lines constantly approach each other , the farther they are produced . This is as evident , as that the whole is greater than a part . Yet this is the very thing and the only thing , which the author attempts to prove . // Hence we say it would have been better to admit the proposition as an axiom in the first instance ; for the attempt to prove it , implies that it needs proof ; and not to succeed in proving it , is at once to strengthen the doubt if there could have been any , and at the same time to convey to the mind of the student the impression , that geometrical reasoning is not equal to all it undertakes . Indeed the whole difficulty , if there were any , still remains unremoved . We have stated what is self-evident in this celebrated proposition , and we will now state what is wanting . Taking it for granted that two lines constantly approach each other , does it need to be demonstrated that these lines will meet if produced sufficiently far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after art . 58 , are doubtful ; because they rest upon something which requires demonstration , and yet does not admit of it . But we contend that this is not the case . The mind does not require a demonstration here . After the simple perception of constant approach , we can not conceive of a more immediate and irresistible conclusion , than that of ultimate meeting . Moreover we believe that this absolute certainty is the very cause which renders the demonstration impossible . We can not prove it , for the same reason that we can not prove the whole to be greater than its part ; that is , because nothing is more certain . But here we are asked by the objector , why it is not equally certain that the hyperbola and its asymptotes may be produced so far as to meet ? Why will not the same reasoning apply to this case as to the other ? The distance at first is finite , and as there is a constant approach of the curve and its asymptote , this finite quantity must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease of a finite quantity must ultimately bring it to zero . To this we reply , that the cases are by no means parallel . The very existence of an asymptote involves a physical impossibility . It is a tangent to the curve at an infinite distance . Now since such a curve can never be actually drawn , it follows that the point of contact must always be imaginary , and of course that the asymptote can exist only in imagination . But the proposition in question does not involve any physical impossibility . The lines can be actually represented to the eye , and the idea of im*finity does not intervene . Hence our instantaneous belief that the lines in question must meet ; since we only want sufficient space , and that not infinite , in order actually to make them meet . We shall now leave this subject ; having already protracted // the discussion farther than we should have done , had it not been for our strong desire to show that no attempt at demonstration is here necessary ; and our regret that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legendre , there should be even the appearance of a chasm . We proceed to our work of abbreviation . By adopting what we have endeavored to show is the true definition of straight and of parallel lines , and also the two additional axioms above proposed , articles 27 , 32 , 58 , 59 , and 69 become unnecessary . Theorem 178 is , The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of its altitude by half the sum of its parallel sides . The labored demonstration here given is unnecessary . The truth follows from what has already been shown to be the measure of a triangle ; for by drawing a diagonal , the trapezoid is divided into two triangles , having for their common altitude the altitude of the trapezoid , and for their bases the parallel sides . Therefore the measure of these triangles is the measure of the trapezoid . Q. E. D. The following articles , 223 , 224 , 229 , 230 , 231 , 232 , 233 , 234 , 235 , may be omitted , as they lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent depends upon them . Problem 260 , which is , To find the common measure , if there be one , between the diagonal and side of a square , ' is useless ; because it was before shown , ( 188 ) that these two lines are tncommensurable . Lemma 283 , which is , Every curved line arpolygon , which encloses from one extremity to the other a convex line , is greater than the enclosed line , does not require demonstration . No reasoning can make the truth of it strike the mind more forcibly , than the mere enunciation of it . One glance at the diagram makes it a matter of simple perception . Both lines being convex , who can doubt that the enclosed line occupies a shorter distance than the enclosing one ? For our part , we can see no room for reasoning ; it rather impairs than increases the force of our first conviction . But even if what we have said were not true , still , both this and the following Lemma , 285 , both of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous , if a method of demonstrating this theorem can be devised , which shall not depend upon the admission of these subsidiary truths . Accordingly such a method we shall now propose . // For this purpose , we only require the admission of the following proposition . The circle may be considered as a regular polygon of an infinite number of sides . This may be made intelligible to the mind of any youth , in the following manner . Take a circle and inscribe in it any one of the regular polygons before mentioned , ( art . 269 , 271 , 273 ) . Then proceed to bisect the arcs subtended by the sides , and draw chords to these half arcs . This operation may obviously be continued until the arcs become confounded with their chords ; a limit , which on account of the imperfection of our vision and of instruments , will soon be attained . But it is evident that the operation may be extended in imagination beyond this limit , to an indefinite degree . Indeed problems 293 , 294 , furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular polygon , until they shall not differ by any assignable quantity . It is not therefore absolutely necessary to introduce the idea of infinity ; for if we suppose the operation to terminate at some distant finite limit , still the error will be so small that it may be safely neglected , as it is in the quadrature of the circle . We have , however , preferred the use of the term infinite , both because it is more convenient than any other , and because it is the only one which renders the proposition strictly true . We are aware that the above considerations do not amount to a positive demonstration , for this is not practicable . Mathematical infinity , as here presented , is a negative idea , and the only proofs , which propositions involving it admit of , are of a negative or indirect kind . We shall give an indirect demonstration of the rigorous truth of the one in question , by showing in the sequel , that all the conclusions which result from reasoning upon it as a hypothesis , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly more labor , by a course of strictly geometrical demonstration . Meantime what we have said above , will put the student 's mind into a train of reasoning , such as can not fail to remove whatever doubt the first statement of the proposition might have occasioned . Perhaps , too , it would not be amiss to place before him that negative sort of evidence , which results from the fact , that , whether true or not , its falsity can never be demonstrated ; since every attempt to prove a want of coincidence between the circle and polygon , must sup* pose the number of sides finite , which would be contrary to the hypothesis . After all , we expect that the lovers of strict geometry will // object to the introduction here , of a principle which belongs more properly to fiuxions . We have already stated our object to be the abridgment of labor ; and when we shall have shown that the recognition of this single principle will do away the necessity of many of the longest demonstrations in the work before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigot to particular forms and systems , will find fault with the step we have taken . Let it be remembered , moreover , that the first suggestion of such a principle was made by a man no less profound and sagacious than Kepler , who employed it in a manner very closely resembling the one we propose ; that it has already been partially recognised by Legendre himself , in his approximation to the quadrature of the circle ; that it forms the entire basis of Trigonometry , as presented in the volume which follows Geometry in the Cambridge course ; and finally , that the application of the Differential and Integral Calculus , to geometric b le extent , is a recognition at magnitudes , throuo*h its who once of its truth and importance . Who then will say that we can avail ourselves too early of that instrument , by which Kepler , Newton , Leibnitz , and Laplace , have so wonderfully facilitated their vast calculations ? We accordingly now proceed , without further apology , to point out the extent to which the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle , that the circle is a regular polygon of an infinite number of sides . Theorem 287 . The circumferences of circles are as their radii , and their surfaces are as the squares of their radii . Admitting our principle , this proposition is included in that of art . 282. it is there demonstrated , that the perimeters of regular polygons of the same number of sides , are as the radii of their inscribed circles ; and their surfaces are as the squares of these same radii . ' Now the circles in question being regular polygons of an infinite , and therefore the same number of sides , and the radii of the inscribed circles being the radii of the circles in question , as both become coincident , we have only to substitute for perimeters , the word circumferences , and for the radii of their inscribed circles , the words their radii , and the same theorem is sufficient for both cases . Q. E. D. Theorem 289 . The area of a circle is equal to the product of its circumference by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular polygon of an infinite number of sides becomes confounded with its inscribed circle . Therefore it must have for its area , its perimeter or circumference multiplied by half the radius . Q. E. D. Theorem 312 . The circle is greater than any polygon of the same perimeter . We would vary this phraseolo6y conformably with our principle , by saying , the circle is greater than any other polygon of equal perimeter . ' Then it becomes a corollary to proposition 311 , of two regular isoperimetrical polygons , that is the greater which has the greater number of sides . ' For the number of sides in the circle being infinite , must be greater than that of any other polygon . Q. E. D. We now come to Part Second . This is divided into four sections . The first three treat of planes , polyedrones , and figures described on the surface of a sphere . In no part of these , therefore , could our mode of reasoning be substituted . But by applying it to the Fourth Section , which treats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of that section will be reduced more than one half . XYe proceed to point out , as briefly as possible , in what manner this application is to be made . In the first place , Lemmas , 513 , 514 , 515 , may be omitted , being only subsidiary to theorem 516 . The solidity of a cyl*nder is equal to the product of the base by its altitude . This proposition is involved in that of the solidity of the prism , 406 . It is there shown that the solidity of a prism is equal to the product of its base by its altitude . But the cylinder is a prism of an infinite number of faces . This may be illustrated by the same kind of reasoning as that employed with regard to the circle . Indeed it is a necessary consequence of admitting that the circle which forms the base of the cylinder , is a polygon . Hence a second demonstration is unnecessary . The solidity of a cylinder must have the same measure as that of a prism . Q.E.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced for the sake of demonstrating theorem 523 . The convex surface of a cylinder is equal to the circumference of its base multiplied by its altitude . Now it has already been demonstrated , lemma 520 , that the convex surface of a right prism , is equal to the perimeter of its base multiplied by its altitude . ' Admitting , then , our principle , the convex surface of a cylinder will consist of an infinite number of rectangles , each having for its alti // tude , the altitude of the cylinder , and the sum of their bases , forming the circumference of the base of the cylinder . In other words , the cylinder is a right prism , of an infinite number of faces . Hence the convex surface of a cylinder must be the same as the convex surface of a prism . Q. E. D. Theorem 524 . The solidity of a cone is equal to the product of its base by a third part of its altitude . ' It was before demonstrated , 416 , that every pyramid has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its base by its altitude . ' But according to our principle , a cone is a pyramid , having an infinite number of triangular faces . This necessarily follows from its base being a polygon of an infinite number of sides . Hence the measure of a cone must be the same as that of a pyramid . Q. E. D. Theorem 527 , enunciated in general terms , is as follows . The frustum of a cone is equal in solidity to the sum of three cones , having for their common altitude , the altitude of the frustum , and for their respective bases , the inferior base of the frustum , its superior base , and a mean proportional between these two . ' In art . 422 , it was demonstrated that the frustum of a pyramid has the same measure for its solidity . Admitting our principle , a second demonstration becomes entirely unnecessary ; for the frustum of a cone becomes the frustum of a pyramid of an infinite number of faces . Therefore it must have the same measure of solidity . Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone is equal to the circumference of its base multiplied by half its side . ' This results necessarily from the definition of a cone just given . All the triangles forming its surface , have the side of the cone for their common altitude , and the sum of their bases forms the circumference of the base . Hence the sum of all these triangles , or the convex surface of the cone , is equal to the circumference of the base into half the side . Q. E. D. Theorem 530 . The convex surface of the frustum of a cone is equal to its side multiplied by half the sum of the circumferences of the two bases . ' The two bases being parallel polygons of an infinite number of sides , it follows that the convex surface is composed of an infinite number of trapezoids , each having the side of the frustum for its altitude . Therefore the sum of all the trapezoids , or the convex surface , must be equal to the side of the frustum , that is , the altitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel sides , or half the sum of the two circumferences . Q. E. D. // Theorem 535 . The surface of a sphere is equal to the product of its diameter by the circumference of a great circle . ' This is incuded in the preceding corollary . The entire surface described by the revolution of a semipolygon about its axis , is equal to the product of the axis into the circumference of the inscribed circle . ' Here we have only to substitute for semipolygon the word semicircle , and for axis the word diameter , and to remember that the great circle and the inscribed circle are one and the same , in order to perceive that the surface of the sphere must have the measure enunciated . Q. E. D. Theorem 538 . The surface of any spherical zone is equal to the altitude of this zone multiplied by the circumference of a great circle . ' This is involved in lemma , 533 , as may be shown by considerations precisely like the preceding , and therefore unnecessary to be mentioned . Theorem 546 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a base multiplied by a third of the radius , and the entire sphere has for its measure its surface multiplied by a third of the radius . This long demonstration may be avoided , and the truth inferred directly from theorem 545 , by substituting , as our principle justifies , the words spherical sector , in place of the words polygonal sector . The same demonstration will then suffice for both cases . It is now time to draw our remarks to a close . The alterations which we have suggested , will reduce the limits of the work about one fifth . Had we time we might mention several other propositions which might be omitted altogether , on the ground of standing isolated or leading to no practical results . Whether the increased popularity and practical utility , which might thus be insured , be an object worthy of consideration to the publishers , when another edition shall be called for , as we understand will soon be the case , it does not concern us to inquire . Of this , however , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a work on geometry less amplified than Legendre , and at the same lime rendered more practical ; and we know of no treatise which would so well serve for the basis of such a work , as that which we have attempted to review .
