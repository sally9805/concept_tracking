THIs ample title page promises much variety , and in that the reader will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book to he a great evil , twelve hundred pages of autobiography may seem somewhat appalling , yet many will think , when they have read the work and felt its interest and importance , that it is not too long . We are of opinion , however , that with regard to its popularity and general circulation , it might have been condensed to advantage . The multiplicity of books in these days renders economy of time as well as of purse , a necessary consideration . It has become a fashion of late , and it is sanctioned by the example of the most ingenious authors of our times , to interweave with affecting stories of individuals , often creatures of the brain , important passages of history , and thus to enlist curiosity and sensibility in aid of useful acquirements . The nearer those works resemble or approach the truth , the greater are their merit and their charm . The narrative before us comes VOL . XXIV. - NO. 55. 41 // out as one of entire truth ; the history is of a crisis as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century has produced ; and the story is more moving , more pathetic , and of more thrilling interest , than almost any tale of romance invented to excite the sympathies of human nature , and the tenderer feelings of the heart . Before we had read this book , we had heard the name of Theobald Wolfe Tone , who had suffered , with many others of his countrymen , for attempting to effect a separation of Ireland from England ; for having been a United Irishman , taken in arms , bearing the commission cf a French general officer , and waging war against the Irish , or , should we say , the British government . We had always understood him to have been a man of lofty courage and eminent talents , and of an amiable and virtuous private character . The specimens we had seen of other distinguished United Irishmen , who had been for many years our fellow citizens , had impressed us very favorably ; but we had never before seen the history of that epoch drawn out so fully , nor formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Irish people could be defended , nor of the extensive views of those who put all to hazard on the chance of liberty or death . When we took up these volumes we intended no more , than to exercise an impartial judgment within the sphere of our literary duties ; we did not , nor do we yet , enter the field as champions of Ireland against England ; we rather hope that some propitious change may remove the causes of such a disastrous strife , wherein men , formed to shine as an ornament and honor to their country , perish on the scaffold . But without engaging in that quarrel we must say , that had we been the most devoted partisans of England 's power and empire , still by the reading of this narrative , our hearts would have been subdued into respect and admiration for the man , who in so extraordinary a degree united the highest and most attractive qualities of the head and heart . It is rare to find such endowments in one individual ; onick and brilliant conceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convincing , great firmness of purpose , with a temper gentle and winning , and a cheerful and pleasing vein of native wit , that in the darkest hours of danger and dismay lighted and cheered his way , and in the very heat of battle played like a lambent flame around his crest . Add to this a heart framed for friendship and love , and it must be owned , that , perish where he // might , when or for what he might , when Tone fell , there fell a noble being . And now , after long years are past , his son and relict claim to be heard in his behalf . They appeal to the gi*eat tribunal of humanity and to posterity , to man below , to heaven above , for a reversal of that sentence , which doomed him to a traitor 's death . We are told by the editor , the son and worthy representative of such a father , that more than a quarter of a century has been suffered to pass , lest the disclosures in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any of those who acted with him . At length , and when there remained but two survivors of his family , the precariousness of human life required the consummation of the long made vow . A monument was to be raised from the materials which his own hands had provided ; and to the record of his conviction as a traitor , was to be opposed and confronted the record of his life . It is a tribute , ' says the son , which I owe to the memory of my father , and a sacred duty ; believing as I do that in the eyes of impartial posterity is will do honor to his character . ' Our duty as reviewers of this book is not an easy one . No ordinary rules of criticism can be fairly applied to writings , never intended to meet the public eye , and which never would have appeared in their present form , had the author lived to complete the history of his country , of his own life , and his own times . We are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father in different passages of his diaries , that they were intended for his family and one or two select friends ; and nothing , indeed can be more evident ; for to whom else could be addressed those glowing expressions of heartfelt love , those inward confidences of the soul , those playful sallies of whim and humor , those transitions from grave to gay , not to be felt or understood but by the few to whose fond memory they might recall the happier hours of social and domestic intercourse ? We shall endeavor to give a fair summary of the nature and contents of the book , without overloading our article with quotations , in which if we were to indulge ourselves , we should be led too far . And , with respect to the digressions and raillery so amusing , and often so affecting , it would be injustice to repeat them to our readers , who might not yet have become acquainted with the genius and character of him , from whom they proceeded , nor have entered into the feelings of the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom only they were intended . // .324 April , If it be asked , why reveal to the public what was intended only for the social or domestic circle ? we should say , that candor suggests a ready answer . The justification , or vindication , of Tone 's character and honor , was not to be a denial of any fact , nor the particular inculpation of any individual . On his trial he disclaimed all subterftige , all compromise . He would have stated with manly composure the grounds on which he acted , and the reasons why he took up arms . He was not allowed to exhibit his side of the question . He was denied a hearing on the only point to which he cared to speak . He made but one request , which was to die the death of a soldier , and as an enemy taken in honorable warfare . Had that been thought admissible , these memoirs perhaps had never seen the light . It was because he was refused that boon , not denied to the French emigrants standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French republic , as he did before that court martial assembled to pass sentence upon him , that this vindication of his character has been after so long delay , produced . He was sentertced to a mode of death , which to himself abstractedly , might have been indifferent , but which affected him through those whom he loved much more than his own life . It was calculated to wring the heart of his aged and sorrowing parent , to give a triumph to a malignant faction , and to wound his honor as a soldier , for he held the commission of a chef de brigade , and of adjutant general in the French army , and had served as such . If , then , the object was to confound him with common malefactors and felons by the manner of his death , and to fix the stigma of shame and infamy on him and his posterity , how natural , how honorable , and how sacred is the task , by which his son has undertaken to lay before the world his acts , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and very inward breathings of his soul . And this may well account for and excuse whatever may seem redundant in these volumes ; for the son and relict of this extraordinary man well knew , that more was required of them , than their own silent sorrow , or smothered and unavailing recollections . It was not enough , that they adored his memory . It was not enough , that he had died lamented , and that in the dark and dismal night of terror , that enveloped all connected with him , some few and faithful friends had stolen secretly with trembling steps to scatter a few tear bedewed flowers on his // grave ; or that , in later times and under better auspices , his name had been sounded with bolder acclamation . It was not enough , that his fate had been pitied , and his private worth acknowledged . It was not enough , that he should have a place in story , with brave outlaws , or convicts half redeemed from the shame of their crimes by their courage , amiable qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who gloried in his name to seek excuses for him , as for one of a good heart but unsound judgment , an honest enthusiast , who does wrong intending right . Those with whom his vindication lay were too candid and too enlightened not to know , that revolt and rebellion against organized power and settled government may be and often have been the work of guilty and remorseless ambition , and this even where the governments sought to be overturned were themselves corrupt . They were willing that his merit should be graduated upon that scale , which descends to Cataline and mounts to Cato ; and for their patriot hero they claim the highest point ; and they proudly , and we can not say vaingloriously , place him by the side of that last and best of the free Romans , who , when his country 's cause was lost , and her last hope gone , fell upon his own sword , and closed his eyes in willing death , before the hand of the executioner could dishonor his person , or he be led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stake they go for is an important one . The world must be their judge . They have laid the very soul of their beloved martyr bare to view . His failings and frailties , of which he was himself the sternest cen. - sor , are all set forth . Truth , sacred truth , is the foundation on which they place his monumental image , faithful to the life , uncurtailed in any one of its proportions . It was with this view , no doubt , that so many of the lighter fragments have been inserted , and that so many of his graver writings have been retained , to serve as cumulative evidence , how profoundly he had examined the subject of his country 's unhappy condition , and probed the wounds under which she suffered and groaned . And though there may be many repetitions in these various tracts , yet the historical knowledge they contain , and the moral and political lessons they impress , render them well worth preserving . Others , who have written long histories of Ireland , have , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dwelt more upon fabulous antiquities , than the purposes of true and useful history would // 326 April , warrant . Swift and Molineux were the authors , who treated the cause of Ireland with a view to her condition then , her rights and her wrongs . But when Swift wrote , the great mass of the population were broken and brayed , and while he dissected the religious dissensions between high church and low church , and the political factions of Whig and of Tory , he thought no more of the majority of the people , and the most ancient possessors , than if they had been so many beasts of the field . And as the whigs and patriots in and out of parliament entertained no more enlarged or extensive views , when the American revolution first stirred their patriotic feelings , and raised their thoughts towards the equal independence of their country , its free legislation and free trade ; when they formed that army of volunteers , which was first raised to defend their unprotected coasts against invasion , and afterwards to give efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legislature over that of their own then independent kingdom , as they asserted it to be ; so , though their success was brilliant , and a blaze of uncommon talent shone forth within their parliament , yet a few years undid all that they had done . Religious intolerance divided the land , and , as the house that is divided against itself can not stand , so neither could they . Instead of securing that equality and independence , which was already within their grasp , they lost all , because they were too interested , too proud , or too bigoted , to share the privileges they challenged for themselves with the mass of their countrymen . It was at this interesting epoch that Tone , who had already given early proofs of his talents , was led to consider the cause of such a failure , and deeply examine the true state and condition of his country . We shall here use the words of the editor in his preface . In opening these pages , it should be remembered that the situation and political organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been before and have fallen to since . She possessed at that precise moment a separate government and a national legislature nominally independent . My father never considered himself as an Englishman , nor a subject of Great Britain , but as a native and subject of the kingdom of Ireland , most zealously and passionately devoted to the rights , liberties , and glory of his country . At the epoch of the American war ( 178*2 ) , the unguarded state of that island , the efforts of the patriots in its legislature , and the simultaneous and formidable // rising of the volunteers , whilst England was exhausted by that fruitless contest , had wrung from the British government the re* luctant acknowledgment of its independence . The period was bright and glorious . With the first dawn of liberty , Ireland took a new spring , and began to flourish by her natural resources , the spirit of the people reviving with her commerce , industry , and manufactures . But this dawn was soon , overcast by the corruption of her government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object is not to write a history , nor to anticipate what my father has urged with such force and eloquence in the following memoirs ; but had the Irish legislators , who recovered their independent rights , had the liberality to emancipate their Catholic brethren , and allowed them to participate in the benefits of free and equal citizenship , and had the volunteers admitted them into their ranks , England never would have recovered the power she had lost ; and it would be a curious , but at this day a vain speculation , to calculate what those two independent but allied kingdoms might have risen to , each cultivating its own separate means , under one sovereign and with one interest . ' Vol. i. p. 5 , 6 . Speaking of the Roman Catholics of that day , whom the wakening spirit of liberty had roused from their long slumber , he says ; Their first steps were weak and timid , but their progress was inconceivably rapid . Those of the present day , in reading these memoirs , and other works of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have been degraded to such a state ; and with what trembling , doubts , and hesitation , they first opened their eyes to the dawn of freedom , and directed their first tottering steps in its career . My father was the first Protestant , who engaged in their cause to its full extent , and experienced in the beginning the greatest difficulty to rouse them , if not to a sense of their wrongs , at least to the spirit of expressing them . ' Vol. i. p. 6 . After animadverting upon the narrow policy , which , instead of encouraging the industry and the mental and physical resources of Ireland , from a petty jealousy of competition crushed them by every possible means , he adds ; The only conclusion which I wish to draw from these premises is , that England , by dissolving the Irish government , has fully confirmed the charges adduced against it , and my father 's opinion of it ; and till the abuses which it supported , and which survived its fall are corrected , till that monopoly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usurped by a favored // minority , whilst the remainder of the population groans in slavery , Ireland , either under a separate and national administration , or as a province of Great Britain , will ever remain in an unnatural state of anarchy and misery , unable to cultivate her resources , either for her own benefit , or even for that of her masters . ' Vol. i. p. 8 . It appears that although Tone became soon convinced that the oppressive rule and impolitic jealousy of England were the primary sources of all the misery and degradatiod of Ireland , and its own corrupt domestic administration but the secondary cause , yet he did not aim at separation till he was equally convinced , that all other hopes were vain . He was the confidential agent of the Catholic body , and attended their delegation , when , passing over the limits of their prisonhouse , they carried their petition to the monarch , and obtained concessions that promised a fair measure of contentment , and a more propitious era , had not the evil genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baleful triumph to the enemies of her peace and happiness . The recall of Lord Fitzwilliarn , and the measure of coercion , insult , and cruelty , which followed and ended in rebellion , are well known as historical events , and will long be lamented by every friend to that country , and by the true friends of England . The progress of that rebellion , and the mighty consequences which it threatened to the British empire , will be found in these memoirs ; and since the events are now past and over , they furnish deep matter of reflection to the wise and philanthropic statesman . The first article in the work is a fragment of the life of Theobald Wolfe Tone written by himself , but never completed , giving an account of his early adventures and of his family circumstances . In this sketch , lie exposes very freely the follies of his youth , his early passion for military parades , and the genius of his whole family for roaming abroad and visiting foreign countries . The uncertain and somewhat unfortunate circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived him , as he says , of the advantages of cool and settled study , and yet such was the quickness of his natural parts , that he bore off almost every prize for which he was a competitor in Trinity College , where he was educated , obtained a scholarship , and would in all probability have gained a fellowship , had he remained a proper time . But the love of that person , with whom he united his destiny , then young and beautiful . // gave a new direction to his fate and fortunes . They made what is called a runaway match , but unlike many of those thoughtless and imprudent marriages , which begin in giddy passion and often end in apathy or disunion , these two congenial spirits grew together , and he that would see the picture of true and constant love , has but to read their story . Their little means sufficed for all their wants , and in their domestic circle , composed of this fond couple , his sister , his brothers , and his friend Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , and the delights of intellectual intercourse graced their frugal meals , and though fortune frowned , they never ceased to smile . It being determined that he should try his fortune at the bar , he passed the usual time of probation in London , keeping his commons at one of the inns of court , and with no other help than such as those preposterous institutions afford to the bewildered student , where he receives neithei tuition nor advice . He soon became disgusted with that life of inanity , so ill suited to his lively genius , and employed himself at times in writing essays for a magazine . But he and his brother and his friend Phipps , as he relates , formed once a bolder project , and drew up and presented a memorial to Mr Pitt , containing a proposal for the establishment of a colony in one of Cook 's newly discovered islands , on a military plan , to put a bridle on Spain in time of peace , and annoy her in that quarter in time of war . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , a convention being agreed upon between England and Spain , he was informed that existing circumstances had rendered it unnecessary at that time to put it in execution , but that it would be kept in remembrance . At length , in the year 1789 , he was called to the Irish bar ; but he declares with his usual na*vet6 , that though he went circuit three times , and dressed himself in a foolish wig and gown , yet he was modestly speaking , one of the most ignorant barristers in the Four Courts . ' It appears , however , that notwithstanding this self imputed ignorance , he nearly cleared his expenses on his first circuit , which is more than many do after a much longer period . Here begins his political career . A pamphlet in defence of the Whig Club , then newly established , and vehemently attacked , brought an invitation from that body , the chief of which was Mr George Ponsonby . He was now dazzled with // the prospect of a Seat in Parliament , and was employed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a mark of incipient favor ; but though he considered the principles of the XVhigs good so far as they went , his own views had become more expanded . He did not like the idea of attaching himself as a dependan* to any great man . Upon this subject he thus expresses himself . I soon found reason not to regret that the w'higs had not thought me an object worthy of their cultivation . I made speedily what seemed to me a great discovery , though I might have found it in Swift and Molyiieux , that the influence of England was the radical vice in our government , and consequently that Ireland never would be free , prosperous , or happy , until she was independent , and that independence was unattainable , whilst the connexion with England existed . In forming this theory which has ever since unwaveringly directed my political conduct , to which I have sacrificed everything , and am ready to sacrifice my life if necessary , I was exceedingly assisted by an old friend of mine , Sir Lawrence Parsons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few honest men in the Irish louse of Commons . It was he who first turned my attention to this great question , but I very soon ran ahead of my master . It is in fact to him that I am indebted for the first comprehensive view of the actual situation of Ireland . What his conduct might be in a crisis I know not , but I can answer for the truth and justice of his theory . I now began to look on the little politics of the Whig Club with great contempt , and their peddling about petty grievances instead of going to the root of the evil ; and I rejoiced that , if I was poor , as I actually was , I had preserved my independence , and could speak my sentiments without being responsible to any but the law . ' Vol. i. pp. 3*2 , 33 . In recording the names of the members of a club which he had instituted about this time , consisting of the best wits of the day , he thus speaks of the well known martyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have strangely omitted the name of a man , ' says he , whom , as well for his talents as his principles , I esteem as much as any , far more than most of them , I mean Thomas Addis Emmet , a barrister . He is a man completely after my own heart ; of a great and comprehensive mind ; of the warmest and sincerest affection for his friends ; of a firm and steady adherence to his principles , to which he has sacrificed much , and would I am sure , if necessary , sacrifice his life . In classing the men I most esteem , I would place him beside Russell at the head of the list ; // because with regard to them both , the most ardent feelings of my heart coincide exactly with the most severe decision of my judgment . ' Vol. i. p. 40 . The passage , which follows this , contains his remarks on the effects of the French revolution upon England and Ireland respectively , and of the great controversy betw&amp;n Burke and Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , and how vigorously he could seize upon the reality in every controverted question . After stating the reasons of Burke 's triumph in England over Paine , and the revolutionary principles , he continues ; But matters were very different in Ireland , an oppressed , plundered , and insulted nation . As we well knew , experimentally , what it was to be enslaved , we sympathized more sincerely with the French people , and watched their progress to freedom with the utnrnst anxiety . As the revolution advanced , and as events expanded themselves , the public spirit of Ireland rose with a rapid acceleration . The fears and animosities of the aristocracy rose in the same or a still higher proportion ; till in a little time the French revolution became the test of every man 's political creel , lnd the nation was fairly divided into two great parties , the aristocrats and democrats ( epithets borrowed from France ) , who have ever since been measuring each other 's strength , and carrying on a kind of smothered war , which the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call into energy and action . ' Vol. i. p. 43 . XVe next come to the author 's account of the origin and principles of the United Irishmen , and the formation of the first club in Belfast , of which he wrote the declaration , but in which he says he soon sunk into obscurity , for the establishment of a republic at that time had not entered into his speculations . He sought only the independence of his country . Antipathy to England had now become almost an instinct in him ; he considered the power of that country as in constant hostility to the happiness and welfare of Ireland . Some new advances were at this time made to him by the Whig party , which he did not reciprocate , and he intimates a belief that Mr Ponsonby had not forgiven him for his independent conduct towards him and those who acted with him . We are obliged to pass over many interesting particulars , which abound in every page of this fragment , and hasten to the concluding part of the biography by his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris the abstract here men- // 832 April , tioned , some time after the latest events recounted in it , and from memory . It brings down the history of his life to the middle of July , 1792 . The sequel would have been supplied by the diaries , which he regularly kept from the time that he felt himself involved in important public concerns , had not these diaries , tomprehending a most eventful period of his life , been lost through the fault or neglcct of a friend , with whom they were deposited for safe keeping . It is to fill out this deficiency , from the scanty materi'ls which remained , that his son resumed his pen , and few men were more competent to do justice to such a task , than Captain William Theobald Wolfe Tone . At an early age , his talent for historical composition had acquired him distinguished notice from the National Institute of France . His literary attainments , unassuming merit , fidelity , and courage , have rendered him a favorite , as well with his preceptors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the fall of his great master , Napoleon , he honorably resigned his commission , and repaired to this country , where , we believe , his merit has not been overlooked by those of our statesmen , most capable of appreciating it . After having been the Secretary , and an able and efficient agent of the Catholic body , accompanied the delegation which carried their petition to the foot of the throne , and refused , from a high spirit of independence , very advantageous offers from the great leaders of the Whigs , Tone became implicated with Jackson , who was sent from France to sound the sentiments of the Irish people . But he was at length obliged to leave his native country , and come to the United States . He had determined to settle near Princeton , in New Jersey , and was in treaty for a farm , when he was invited by his friends in Ireland to repair to France , and solicit succors from the government for the liberation of their country . His early political creed was not revolutionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her support of the monoply and of the abuses of the Irish administration and protestant ascendancy party , as the bane of Irish prosperity , and thought that independence was to be sought by every practicable means . He clearly saw that the great impediment to this object was the disunion of religious parties , and the exclusion of the great body of the people from every civil and religious right . He was convinced that no relief could be effectual or worth pursuing , which was not founded on entire equality and justice . // The Whig principles he approved , so far as they were accordant with this sentiment ; but he soon made up his mind , that the narrow views of the irish Whigs , who , with a great show of patriotism , and display of talents and eloquence , still hung upon petty grievances , and hacknied opposition , aiming rather at a change of men and their own advancement , than at the restoration of the people to their rights were rather hurtful than advantageous to the real cause of his country . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had negotiated between the catholics and the protestant dissenters , and between them both and the great leaders of the opposition of the day , Grattan , Lord Moira , the Ponsonbys , and others ; but , above all , he had formed the first clubs of the United Irishmen , upon the principle of political freedom and religious toleration . His writings , in which the reader will find most of what has been repeated in so many celebrated speeches of the orators in Parliament , and writers of celebrity since his day , had marked him as one of those whom it was necessary for corruption either to ruin or to gain . When he left his country , he carried with him the confidence of the protestant dissenters of the north of Ireland , and the liberal part of those of the established church , who were then not a few , some of whom Were distinguished for their character and talents , and whose spirit revolted at the measures of insult and oppression . From the catholics he received a vote of thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever pay . Before we accompany Mr Tone through his adventures in France , we shall give , in his own words , a picture of the misery to which the poor Irish emigrants , flying from the terror and vengeance which drove them from their native shores , were still exposed . About the 20th of July , some tune after we had cleared the banks of Newfoundland , we were stopped by three British frigates , the Thetis , Captain Lord Cochrane , the Hussar , Captain Rose , and the Esperance , Captain Wood , who boarded us , and after treating us with the greatest insolence , both officers and sailors , they pressed every one of our hands , save one , and near fifty of my unfortunate fellow passengers , who were most of them flying to America to avoid the tyranny of a bad government at home , and who thus most unexpectedly fell under the severest tyranny , one of them at least , which exists . As I was in a jacket and trowsers , one of the lieutenants ordered me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , and it was only the screams of my wife and sister which induced him to desist . It would have been a pretty termination to my adventures if I had been pressed and sent on board a man of war . The insolence of these tyrants , as well to myself as to my poor fellow passengers , in whose fate a fellowship in misfortune had interested me , I have not since forgotten , and I never will . At length , after detaining us two days , during which they rummaged us at least twenty times , they suffered us to proceed . Vol. i. p. 130 . On the 1st of January , 1796 , he sailed from New York , with letters from the French Minister , Adet , recommending him strongly to his government , and on the first of February he arrived at Havre de Grace . It may be well imagined what impressions would be made upon the lively and inquiring mind of Tone , by the scenes presented on the first view of a country , whose history , manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager curiosity . The period at which he arrived , was one pregnant with events ; it was that between the horrors of the revolution and the elevation of a single chief to such power , as none had ever before attained in Europe ; where a succession of weak , tottering , and corrupted governments had paved the way for that arbitrary , but brilliant conqueror , reformer , and legislator , whose powerful genius has left traces of light behind , and whose fall may serve as a beacon , warning against fatal and self deluding ambition . From his first arrival in France , our hero lost no occasion of promoting his object . He husbanded his little means , the better to preserv2 his independence , and he avoided with equal address the artifices of spies , and the no less dangerous society of indiscreet friends . Though often disgusted with the ignorant and preposterous opinions which he had to encounter , his warm enthusiasm never betrayed him into word or deed , that could alienate a friend or create an enemy to his country . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he prevailed , but by manly reason and persuasion . Profoundly acquainted with his own country , he was always ready to present such a state of facts , and such enlarged views , as to inspire respect and confidence , till his opinions became the opinions of those , in whose hands was the disposal of power . His first visit in Paris was to the American . Minister , Mr Monroe , who received him very kindly , and was his adviser as // far as his station would warrant . lie next made his way to the Minister , De Ia Croix . By him he was referred to Madgett , of whose agency in the case of Jackson he had previously fill knowledge . But finding this person preoccupied with his own impracticable projects , he drew up a memorial to the French government , and soon after was informed that , consid .. ering England as invulnerable till separated from Ireland , they were willing to enter into an alliance offensive and defensiye and a treaty of commerce upon principles of mutual advantage . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of Tone , far short of the object and the necessity of the case . That his ideas might be better understood , he determined to go to the directory and demand an audience . His first interview with Carnot , then President , and whom he styles the organizer of victory , ' is thus described . Feb. 24. - Went at 12 o'clock in a fright , to the Luxembourg , conning speeches in execrable French all the way . What shall I say to Carnot ? Well , " whatsoever the Lord putteth in my mouth , that truly shall I utter . " Picked up a spirit as I drew near the palace , and mounted the stairs like a lion . Went into the first bureau that I found open , and demanded at once to see citizen Carnot . The clerks stared a little , but I repeated my demand with a courage truly heroical ; on which they instantly submitted , and sent a person to conduct me . ' Vol. is. p. 25 . Having thus gained access to the first magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . In this , as in every other communication , he stipulated for perfect independence , and against all interference , in case of success , with the government , which the Irish people might think proper to establish . He insisted upon the necessity of an adequate force , that blood might b* spared on every side , and valuable lives saved , of which so many had already been sacrificed ; and in two memorials he exhibited the motives of policy , which should induce the greatest possible exertions , and pointed out the best means and measures to be pursued . But of all with whom he had to treat , he found the greatest difficulty with one , to whom he was referred as best able to judge of his plans , and of the situation and circumstances of Ireland . This person was no other than the General Clarke , afterwards created duke of Feltre , and so conspicuous as minister of war under Napoleon . He was descended from one of the adherents of James the Second , who , after that monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notions were of the old Jacobite school ; and his mind was preoccupied with legends , and traditions , and follies of past times , still looking to the aristocracy of Ireland , as that through which a revolution was to be effected . It required all Tone 's command of countenance and temper to reason with him , and make him comprehend the altered spirit and new combinations , that had arisen , particularly since the American and French revolutions . He reminded him , moreover , that in the wars between William and James , the French king , Lewis the Fourteenth , might have separated the two kingdoms ; but that partly through his own bad policy , and partly through the interested views of his mliiister Louvois , he contented himself with feeding the war , little by little , till the opportunity was lost , which France ever since has had reason to regret . To which General Clarke added , that more recently , when the volunteers were in force , and a rupture seemed probable , a proposal , to succor Ireland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count de Vergennes , who for that service , he said , had received a considerable bribe from England ; and that he , Clarke , had been informed of this by a principal agent in paying the money . Carnot and Hoche were the two persons , whom Tone most admired and respected . For the latter , under whom he served , and whose entire confidence he possessed , he formed a devoted attachment . That brave general added to his rank of chef de brigade that of adjutant general , and made him one of his family during the time he was at Rennes , the head quarters of the army destined for the invasion . There he was near losing that excellent friend , by the attempt of two assassins on his life . From the low state of the French finances , the disaffection of the marine , and other difficulties , it was not till the month of October , 1796 , that General Tone received orders to accompany his chief to Brest . The accounts of the arrest and dangerous situation of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every delay , that crossed his hopes of arriving in time for their deliverance . The general entered into his feelings , and strongly urged forward the admiral ( Villaret Joyeuse ) , who still hung back , and was at length cashiered . He was succeeded by Morard de Galles , but with little advantage , as to him was imputed the ultimate defeat of the expedition . // After many obstacles , a force was finally collected of fortytliree sail , with 15,000 troops , the flower of the French army , a force in the opinion of General Tone , which many circumstances go to confirm , more than sufficient to effect their purpose . This was a critical period in the history of the British empire . On the 17th of December , 1796 , this fleet put to sea ; but from the first hour till the last of its ill omened proceedings , the elements conspired with treason , or something as ruinous , to protect England from the consequences of an administration , which boasted of strong measures against its own exasperated subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For more than a fortnight this fleet kept the seas . During a part of that time , the greater portion of it was in the very bay of Bantry , the destined place of landing , but the admiral , with the commander in chief detained on board , never joined ; and Grouchy , the second in command , could not be persuaded , till it was too late , to disembark the troops . The long continued storms and violent gales drove the ships from their anchors , and rendered all communication by boats impracticable . The signal being at length given to steer for France , they again entered the waters of Brest , without having seen an enemy . Those who take pleasure in military histories , will find in the diary of General Tone , during this expedition , a full and particular relation of every occurrence as it arose . In the midst of the disasters that hung upon this enterprise , under circumstances of such agitation , tantalized by the sight of his native land , for which he had done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the destined spot of disembarkation , stung with indignation at the misconduct of the admiral , and grief for the absence of Hoche , who was the life of all his hopes , on the rack for the fate of his family and friends , still present to his thoughts , amidst the tempests and the rocking of the stormy waves , we find him firm and self possessed , observing all that passed , and noting it down , with his own comments and reflections , composing new manifestos in place of those remaining with the absent commander , forming plans , making estimates of the still disposable means and force , assisting at councils of war , and swaying , by his discreet and unassuming persuasion , the judgments of his seniors and superiors . The absence of the blockading squadron , under Admiral Gardner , from before Brest , during the whole time of this // 338 April , expedition , may perhaps be accounted for by a stratagem of General Hoche . Having learned that his printer was to be bribed for a copy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , translated with great show of mystery and secrecy by a priest , who understood their language . For a month after his return to France , Tone remained in a state of depression , and discontinued his journal , having nothing to say and little inclination to write ; but he was soon roused from this stupor by two events , the best calculated to revive his sensibilities , and call forth his energies . The one was a letter from his wife , announcing her arrival with her children at Hamburg , and the other an assurance from General Hoche , that the affair of ireland was only suspended , and would soon be resumed with new spirit and determination . Having received his arrears of pay , and leave of absence , he proceeded through Holland to join his family and conduct them into France . He met them at Groningen . The next attempt for the liberation of Ireland was from a quarter not before thought of or suspected . General Hoche had persuaded the government of the Batavian republic to undertake an expedition , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ground of future fame , he conceded to the Dutch general , Daendels , and to Admiral De Winter , the honor of conducting it . Whatever England had to dread , or Ireland to hope , from the expedition of Bantry bay , this seemed still more formidable , and the circumstances more auspicious to the undertaking . The Irish administration had persisted in what were called strong measures , which are stated to have equalled the worst horrors of the revolution in France ; and we fear that we can not altogether refuse to credit the assertion , that tortures were mercilessly used to extort confessions and denunciations , or to execute punishment or revenge . To believe this without strong evidence would be wrong , but we must doubt too many respectable authorities before we can question these appalling facts . Among the rest we must doubt the veracity of the statements , laid by the Earl of Moira before the English and Irish house of lords , in which these excesses were not denied but justified . They were indemnified by bills of indemnity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it seems greatly added to the strength of the revolutionary party , and driven into its ranks // men of high character and great talents . It may justly give us some confidence in any leaning we may have to the side of the rebels , as they were then called , that , fortune having brought many of them to our shores , who , whilst their friends and country lay prostrate , were branded with opprobrious names , and held up to the world as very miscreants , they have since become our fellow citizens and resided amongst us for a quarter of a century , presenting examples of purity , honor , and loyalty , in every action of their lives . If , at a time when their hands and tongues were tied , whilst they lay in dungeons , and every organ of communication was denied , and none dared to vindicate them , advantage was taken of their situation , it is but a fair and honorable duty now to let their true story be told and promulgated far and wide . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was stated about this time , by a committee of the Irish house of Commons , that there were in the north of Ireland , 100,000 United Irishmen , all of whom were then declared felons by the law , and liable to be hanged and shot . They bad eight pieces of cannon , at the least , concealed , one mortar , and a great quantity of other arms . The mutiny in the English fleet had reached the army , and was with time and difficulty appeased by increase of pay to both seamen and soldiers . The public funds were at the lowest state of depression ever known . Hoche pressed the directory ; and the minister of the marine in France was now entirely favorable . The Dutch executive council , the generals and admiral , warmly adopted the design , as a means of reviving the drooping honors of their name by an act of high eclat . Stipulations were renewed for the independence of Ireland . The line of battle was appointed , nearly fourteen thousand troops were on board , in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the fortune of England again prevailed . The wind , which had before been fair , suddenly changed to the southwest , where it continued without intermission for about two months , till the opportunity was lost . The mutiny at Plymouth , Portsmouth , and the Nore was quelled . Admiral Duncan 's fleet was augmented by a large reinforcement , and now much exceeded that which was to transport the army to Ireland . The provisions shipped for the use of this army were nearly exhausted . At length the great enterprise was abandoned ; minor projects were talked of , and afterwards , in the montb of October* the // Dutch fleet was ordered to sea , for xvhat reason , or upon what principle , still remains doubtful . The brave De Winter , after one of the most desperate and hard fought actions of modern times , was defeated by the more fortunate Duncan . Tone 's ensuing journals are written in a spirit of great despondency . The news of the death of Lord Edward Fitzger .. ald , the death or danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings of his country , xveighed heavily upon his heart , till his hopes were for a time revived by the formation of a new army , to which he was attached , professedly for the invasion of England , to be commanded by General Bonaparte , then just returned from a victorious campaign in Italy . But in his first conference with that extraordinary personage , he discovered that his design was not to benefit his country . That ambitious chief , the editor and son of Tone observes , had already formed his plan for the conquest of Egypt , and used the name of Ireland and of the Army of England ' to conceal it . He disliked the causes both of Ireland and Poland , as too much connected with the spirit of republicanism and revolution , which he did not wish to encourage ; yet the one would have proved the weak point of England and the other of Russia , and he might have kept both powers in check by a frank support of those two oppressed and unfortunate countries . His final downfall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of retributive justice , and it is remarkable that an Irish minister and an Irish general effected his final overthrow . ' A few months before embarking in the last fatal expedition , there are passages in our hero 's journals of a melancholy and prophetic cast . The conduct of the English government , ' he observes , though atrociously wicked , is by no means deficient in system and arrangement . They have begun by seizing almost all the chiefs of the people , and now they dra*v the sword to anticipate the possibility of resistance , or render them incapable of profiting by it . ' What miserable slaves are the gentry of Ireland ! The only accusation against the United Irishmen is , that they wish to break the connexion with England ; in other words , to establish the independence of their country ; an object in which surely the men of property are most interested . Yet the very sound of independence seems to have terrified them out of all sense , spirit , or honesty . If they had one drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage or genuine patriotism in their hearts , they should have been the first to support this great object . The peo // pie would have supported them ; the English government would never have dared to attempt the measures they have since triumphantly pursued , and continue to pursue ; our revolution would have been accomplished without a shock , or , perhaps , one drop of blood spilled . ' If the United Irishmen succeed , there is no rational man can doubt but that a very short period will suffice to do away the evils inseparable from such a contest ; and that in seven years or less , after the independence of Ireland is established , when she can apply all her energy to cultivate her natural resources , her trade , agriculture , and manufactures will be sufficient to indemnify her for the sacrifices with which she will be obliged to purchase her liberty . The example of America is an evidence of this truth . ' The best that can be said in palliation of the conduct of the English party is , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of revenge , and their own personal security . They see Ireland only in their rent rolls , their places , their patronage , and their pensions . ' At least the United Irishmen have a sublime object in view . Their enemies have not yet ventured , in the long catalogue of their accusations , to insert the charge of interested motives . They may be feared and abhorred , but they can never be despised . ' Vol. ii . pp. 481-484 . Towards the end of May , Tone was ordered to join Genera ) Bethencourt , at Havre , which place the English were bombarding , and he served a month there . His journal closes with bitter reflections upon the sad condition of his country , which had been purposely goaded into open resistance , without any means of supporting the war against the power of the oppressor , except the arms that indignation and despair supplied . Remorseless massacres and bloody executions were sweeping away the lives of the brave , who ventured into the field , and still more of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , such the principles of Theobald Wolfe Tone . That he was honest and sincere , never can be doubted ; that he was highly gifted , can be as little questioned ; and no true patriot or lover of liberty can contemplate his story with indifference . The last and most tragical period of his existence is now , after nearly thirty years , given as a sequel to his own autobiography by his son ; his materials , as he says , being derived from the public papers , his mother 's correspondence , and a few private letters . He draws an imposing picture of the history and character of the tirees . Refugees from Ireland , of various // descriptions , with their blood boiling with indignation at the scenes they had witnessed and passed through , vehemently entreated for succors , and pressed upon the government of France to make some exertion in favor of those who yet stood out , before the occasion should be lost forever . General Tone was recalled to Paris , to consult with the ministers of the war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but those recently arrived , impatient of delay , begged to be only relanded on their own shores with a supply of arms and ammunition to make a last effort for their bleeding country . A brave but thoughtless soldier of fortune , Humbert , fired by their story with a romantic ardor , broke through the rules of command , and with one thousand men , one thousand guineas , and one thousand spare muskets , effected a landing , and succeeded in surprising and defeating the English general , Lake , who had been a signal instrument of the vengeance of the government , and the author of a terrible proclamation some time before . It is said and believed by the younger Tone , from the evidence he has examined , that had this gallant adventurer followed up his success with the same spirit with which he had begun , and advanced rapidly into the country , where there was a denser population and more system , he might have afforded a sufficient rallying point for a rising of the people . But the government , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the bishop of Killalla ) than to General Lake for his defeat . This prelate found means to entertain and amuse him , till the viceroy himself ( Lord Cornwallis ) , after putting all the forces in the kingdom in motion , marched against this little band with slow and cautious steps . When encircled by the whole army , they laid down their arms , and the miserable peasants of this wild and desolate quarter , who had joined the standard without order , system , or discipline , and with so little knowledge of fire arms , that they threw them away as incumbrances , were slaughtered without mercy . Two of those who had accompanied Humbert from France , General Tone 's brother Matthew , and Bartholomew Teeling , son of a distinguished member of the Catholic committee , were taken to Dublin in irons , and there executed . On the news of the first victory of Humbert , the small division of General Hardy was sent off with one ship of the line and eight frigates . They encountered adverse winds , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir John // Borlase Warren . Whilst the French admiral prepared to do honor to his flag , by a brave though hopeless defence , the French officers supplicated Tone to go on board a frigate , the Biche , that had the best chance of escape , and which in fact did escape . His answer was , Shall it be said that I fled while the French were fighting the battles of my country ? ' He was on board the Hoche 74 , which , surrounded by four sail of the line and a frigate , sustained , during six hours , the fire of the whole fleet , and did not strike till her scuppers ran with blood , and she floated a dismasted and dismantled wreck upon the waters . Tone commanded a battery , and is reported to have fought like one who courted death . He was landed with the other prisoners , and was with other officers seated at breakfast at the table of Lord Cavan , when he was discovered by an ancient fellow student , Sir George Hill , and hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a most painful situation , fettered and on horseback , and exposed to indignities , which he bore with that loftiness of nature which never forsook him . His noble carriage at his trial , his courageous avowal of his acts and principles , and the affecting tragedy of his death , we leave for the reader , who , if his heart be not steeled , will *sigh over the moving tale as we have done . Some future poet may take it for his theme of song * some orator borrow from it inspired thoughts and animated strains ; but poetry or eloquence can add but little to the thrilling interest that it possesses . The reader of the life of Tone will doubtless wish to learn the fate and fortunes of his family . The account given of them by his son is very affecting . He states that his mother , though in a delicate and precarious state of health , a stranger in the land , scarcely speaking the language , and without friend or adviser , having lived in the greatest privacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore . She first addressed herself to the minister of foreign affairs , who could speak her language , and had known her husband . He entered into her feelings with kind solicitude , and gave her an introduction and strong recommendation to the directory . The Dutch ambassa-. dor , M. Schimmelpennick , also assured her that her husband should be claimed by the Batavian republic , in whose service he held the same rank as in the French . She wrote to her friend the brave Admiral De Winter , and to General Kilmaine , the commander in chief of the army in which he served , who also addressed a warm and affectionate letter to the directory . // They determined that hostages should be seized . With all the credentials and means she could desire , she was about to embark in hope of reaching his prison before the fatal stroke . At this moment the news arrived , that she was a widow , and her children fatherless . Her misfortunes excited universal interest . Distinguished and powerful persons , as Talleyrand , Admiral Bruix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was grateful , but preferred trusting to the nation to bestow on them a manly education , rather than have them brought up favorites and dependants in great men 's families . This met their approbation and confirmed their esteem . Her lofty spirit could not brook dependence , nor stoop to complaint ; and she was reckless of every honor , but the cherished memory of him that was no more , and of every employment but the education of his children . She locked up in her own breast her silent anguish , and gathered under her wing her little brood , to shield them as she could from the farther ills of fate , and taste thenceforth of no delight but that of educating them , and teaching them to be worthy of their father 's name . Amongst many tokens of respect paid to his memory , and to her desert , will be found in the Appendix a discourse of unrivalled eloquence , pronounced by Lucien Bonaparte , then president of the council of five hundred . The editor subjoins , as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a true account , from the pen of his mother , of a certain interview with Napoleon . Misrepresentations of this interview had been made in print , and repeated in the Monthly Magazine , accompanied indeed by very liberal and delicate comments . Although the article appears to have been written with no unkind view toward her , and the author was not sparing in compliments , it brought her before the public , in a light , which was to her peculiarly distressing , as having figured in the genteelest circles , when her life had been one of privacy and seclusion , estranged from every scene of gaiety , devoted to one only object , the care and education of her children . It is not therefore surprising , that this should have drawn from her a few strong expressions of her wounded feelings ; for grief , ' to use her own words , is proud , and maker its owner stout . ' But however admirable such qualities may be , we prefer those specimens of female eloquence , when the soul , softened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accents of piety and love , and above all a mother 's // love . In this narrative of simple truth , extorted from a widowed mother , are not wanting attractive and moving descriptions of this kind . These volumes are closed with a memoir , containing a brief narrative of Captain Tone* s services in the light cavalry and staff , until he emigrated from France to the United States , after the battle of Waterloo . It describes in a vivid manner the enthusiasm , buoyant dispositions , hardships , sufferings , and mode of living of that army , so long the terror of Europe . The battle of Leipsic , and the horrors which overspread the field and hung upon the French in their retreat , are the more impressive from the simplicity of the narration . This young ofhcer , after much hardship and many wounds during three campaigns , resigned his commission upon the fall of his great chief ; and renounced the prospects of advancement that were still open to him . He brought with him many and high testimonials of his merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and settled with his mother near the seat of government . He married the daughter of Mr William Sampson , who was the early friend of his father , and many years ago , in his memoirs , published in this country , celebrated his virtues , and paid an affectionate tribute of respect and esteem to her , who had shared his fortunes when living , and by her faithful performance of every duty during a long widowhood , sustained the honor of his name and family .
